Dear Chessfriend,

according to an agreement with Lou Hays, publisher of the 
US-editionof Euwe/Kramer, the file MIDDLE.CBV is 
password-protected.
YOU CAN FIND THE PASSWORD EASILY in KRAMER/EUWE: 
THE MIDDLEGAME itself (in any edition you may have):

1) Go to the chapter "Individual Style" (last chapter of vol.2) 
2) look at the subsection "TAL" (just near the end) and 
3) look at the game Tal - xxxxxxxxxxx that is given in that section.

The password is the (last) name 
of the black player xxxxxxxxx of this TAL game. 

IMPORTANT!
Please type the password with ALL LETTERS LOWERCASE!

Technical Notes:

A) The password is required for getting the middleg.cbv
   file out of the ZIP. There is no password-protection 
   by Chessbase on the CBV-file (the extension would be
   CBZ and not CBV in such a case!).

B) Winzip V. 6 works fine for unzipping with password; 
   also good old PKUNZIP 2.04g for DOS extracts correctly; 
   I tried the command   
   C:>PKUNZIP MIDDLEG.CBV -S
   and was prompted for the password after that.

C) If your ZIP-Utility doesn't support ZIP-password protection,
   please contact
