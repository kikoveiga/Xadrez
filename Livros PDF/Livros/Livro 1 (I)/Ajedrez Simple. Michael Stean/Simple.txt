Here are collected all the positions from Michael Stean's "Simple Chess", not annofritzed.
It is the shortest, simplest and clearest book on chess strategy I have read!
The English edition seems not to be in print anymore, so I have based this work on the French edition (you can find it from www.alapage.com or www.amazon.fr: it's cheap, also).
