CBFT-Patch:
-----------
Modifies Chessbase software (CBReader12-15, ChessBase 12-17, Fritz 13-18, 32+64-bit)
to support anonymized prot files for ChessBase-FritzTrainers (CBFTs)!

1) Put 'CBFT-Patch.exe' in the ChessBase program folder and run it.
   a) CB-programs CB12-17/F13-18 must have been activated before!
   b) the CB-program must not be started when you run CBFT-Patch!
   c) if you get an error message "... is write protected!", then
      right-click on CBFT-Patch and choose "Run as Administrator"!
2) Put the folder 'Streams' to the following location:
   in Windows Vista/7/8 (probably also in Windows 9/10):
     C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\ChessBase\Streams
   in Windows XP:
     C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Local Settings\Application Data\ChessBase\Streams
3) The CBFTs (English and German!) should now work without any further activation.

Thanks to Anon_c for his original patch and the anonymized prot-files!
