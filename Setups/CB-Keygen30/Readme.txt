1) Serial number:
-----------------
  a) Select the GUI you want to activate
  b) Select the Engine you want to activate
  c) Generate a serial number by pressing "New Serial"

2) Activation:
--------------
  You can choose between two methods of activation:

  a) Built-in: your serial number will be used to automatically activate
     your selection of software. Just follow the instructions in the pop-up.

  b) Hardware ID: by selecting this method, you can follow the normal
     offline activation procedure of your product.

*** Note that it is critical to use the right serial for the product
    you want to activate if you want to follow this procedure!

    - Select offline activation in your ChessBase product
    - Generate a serial number FOR YOUR PRODUCT and copy/paste it into
      the normal ChessBaseAdminTool
    - Your hardware ID will be revealed in ChessBaseAdminTool,
      enter this hardware ID in the proper box in CB_Keygen
    - Press "Get Activation Key"
    - Copy/paste the Activation Key into ChessBaseAdminTool and press "OK"

3) If ChessBase or ChessProgram ask for a serial when starting up,
   put in the serial number you generated in the first step.
   It should ask for a serial number only once.

*** Note that CB13 64-bit may give weird errors and engine serial is
    inactivated. Just click OK and everything should be fine!

Enjoy your CB product!

Remember: Please buy this software if you feel it worth the money!
