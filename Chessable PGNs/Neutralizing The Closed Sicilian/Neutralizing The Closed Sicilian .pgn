{ Hello dear reader,   This book will focus on the Closed Sicilian, which is characterised by White's last move, 6.d3.  It is played at all levels, but the frequency of it is in inverse proportion to the rating level.  Stronger players are generally less into it than casual and intermediate class players.  That said, the opening is played at the GM level, Shirov - my favourite GM - being an exponent of the Closed Sicilian, Carlsen having also played it.  Below is a brief exposition of plans for both sides:  White:  1- wants to keep the game closed-up, as much as possible.  2- favours moving the pieces to the Kingside, with 'pawn-storm' ideas similar to those found in the Indian opening.  When properly executed, this plan can provide White with significant tactical opportunities and makes Black's life rather uncomfortable.  Black:  Black has two different basic gameplans  1- wants to prevent or stop White's kingside pawn-storm, with f5 pressuring the centre.  2- counters White's kingside pawn-storm with an immediate  (if possible)  queenside attack, forcing White's Queen to remain on the 2nd rank near the Rooks, as well as trying to exchange pieces. This should seriously hamper White's attack as well as provide him with weak advanced pawns.  Like the King's Indian-King's Indian Attack, the Closed Sicilian is predicated on keeping the centre closed and mounting an effective kingside attack.  The player unfamiliar with this type of opening and its ideas - closed centre and kingside attack - may occasionally experience difficulty in finding proper moves against it and have a higher probability of losing, as a consequence. }
6... e6
{ In preparation of f5 by which Black hopes to block White's coming pawn-storm and which, along with d5, seeks to counter White's plans with play in the centre. }
7. O-O Nge7
{ Guarding both the  f5  - and  c6  -squares Both the  d4  - and  d5  -squares will make powerful posts for the Knights, later in the game. }
8. Be3 Nd4 9. Qd2
{ White prepares to perform the first step in the plan. The  ♕d2  and  ♗e3  diagonal-battery is aiming at the critical  h6  -square. Then, Subsequent is the idea of Ne2-Ng3-Nf5 with an attack on the kingside! }
9... O-O 10. f4 f5
{ Black's key move to counter White's pawn-storm.  Closing the vital  c1  -  h6  diagonal is the right way of handling White's ♕d2/♗e3/f4 formation. }
11. h3
{ A war has broken out for the  g4-  square and the deployment of Ng3.  Both are part of White's plan to assault Black's critical  f5  square. If White crushes Black's hold on  f5  , he can continue his advance. Should White not succeed, the odds of losing will markedly increase. }

{ As can be seen, Black's position at this point isn't very appealing.  White 2350 elo  Black 2515 elo  
By this point, the inclined reader should be convinced of the importance of being prepared to meet this type of opening with a clear plan.  The study of relevant model games as examples for the conception and execution of common strategies in this kind of opening, the player of the Black pieces will get a better grasp of the underlying principles and be well-armed against White's onslaught in the complex. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6
{ The main problem of 2... Nc6 is 3. Bb5. If you are not a hyper-accelerated dragon player, I suggest you continue to closed Sicilian with 2... Nc6. In this variation, you have to pay attention to the 3. Bb5 move.  Players who play 2... Nc6 may face with some other anti-Sicilian systems and Rossolimo systems. For this reason, playing 2... g6 against the closed Sicilian reduces the number of moves White can play and makes Black's opening preparation stronger. }

First played by Bent Larsen  (see the 'model games' section.)  but perfected by Botvinnik, whose structure is the one we will learn here. There are 21 'model games' in this book, including the first game played by Bent Larsen played and Botvinnik's masterpiece.  In this position, after 6... f5, Black stops White's Kingside activities early by pressuring the center. }
5... d6 6. d3 f5 7. Nf3 Nf6 8. O-O O-O
{ The position is very symmetrical, Black having already equalized! White doesn't usually accept to concede equality without some form of benefits such as a flank attack, a strong square, an open file or a dangerous plan etc. But this position is truly symmetrical and offers no such compensation. We will study all the other variations deeply. }
9. Kh1 Kh8 10. Be3 Be6 11. Qd2 Qd7 12. Rae1 Rae8 13. Bg1 Bg8 14. b3
{ b3 is an important move for White as it controls the  c4  square and limits the Bishop's movement from the  g8  square. }
14... b6
{ ...b6 similarly limits the  g1  -bishop's movement and also protects the  c5  -pawn firmly. It also secures the possibility of playing moves such as ...e5 and ...d5. As will be illustrated in the model games, Black generally takes advantage of the central pawn majority and central pawn movements. }

{ ♗xf5 is a natural move, but gxf5 is preferable because if ♗xf5, this decreases the chances of achieving a central pawn majority. gxf5 gives Black a better game. }
8. Qh5+
{ White threaten's Black with exf5, blocking the pawn majority as well as preventing O-O in response to Black's exchanging gxf5.  Black concedes the loss of O-O and takes with gxf5 because the move is also problematic for White as it prevents ♘f3 with a loss of tempo as a consequence.  For example:    8.Qh5  Kf8  9.Nf3  Nf6  10.Qh4  Nd4  11.Kd1  h6   As can be seen, White has problems and Black is better. }
8... Kf8 9. Qd1
{ A very natural move. White wants to complete his natural development quickly to take advantage of Black's inactive Rook at  h8  and the king's vulnerable position.  In this position, we have to check the move 9. ♘d5.    9.Nd5  e6  10.Ne3  Nf6  11.Qe2  Kf7  12.Nf3  Re8  13.c3  Kg8   Black pieces are well-positioned, its King is safe and it has a central-pawn majority. Black is fine. }
9... Bd7
{ b6-Bb7-e6 is an alternative but we don't choose this  (the b6-Bb7-e6 is an option in lightning games as it's easier to play but just holds no advantage.)  The  e6  pawn may need help here and black want to keep b5-b4 option on hand.   The  e6  pawn is weak and must be very well supported. }
10. Nf3 Nf6 11. Ne2
{ White wants to open the center with a direct d4 or c3-d4 plan. Because Black's king position isn't good and the rook is still stuck on  h8  , White has to open the center swiftly to benefit from these weaknesses. }
11... e6 12. O-O Kg8
{ A prophylactic move, which gets the king away from the f-file. This avoids possible pins and allows the central pawns more mobility. }

{ Black wants to attack with ...h5-h4 in order to benefit from the  h8  -rook that wants to join the game. The  g4  and  e4  squares are serious weaknesses }
15. c3 Nxd4 16. Qxd4 Bc6
{ Both of Black's Bishops are active and the center is mobile. Black also has a central pawn majority and White's king is under pressure.  White doesn't have pawns on the central file, the  c1  -bishop is very weak as a pawn and the kingside is under pressure, but White can put pressure on Black's central pawns.  The position is equal. }

Black may also be able to defend the  e7  pawn with a rook on the 7th rank, and it can even use the king if needed.  Black has space on the Queenside to regroup it's pieces and setup an attack  The position is equal. }

{ White had natural development for both sides until played Bd2. Bd2 isnt an extraordinary move and doesnt have a clear plan. Bc3 is playable, Qc1 is playable, as we see in the game Be1 and Bf2 can be played either. }
8... O-O 9. O-O Kh8 10. Be1
{ We understand that Bf2 has a higher chance to play with tihs move, but more logical ones are Be3-Bf2 without losing tempo. }
10... Be6 11. Ng5 Bg8 12. exf5 gxf5 13. Bf2 Nd4
{ We see everything that we saw in last variant instead of Bishop's  d2  to  f2  move. }
14. Ne2
{ Lets talk a little about Ne2. Ne2 can go to  f5  and  g3  square even later times so can support the attack on King also control over  d4  square will increase so it can attack c3-d4. For this reason Ne2 isnt so bad at all.  Black especially has a way better position in here   14.Bxb7  Rb8  15.Bh1  Rxb2  -+  . Need to be careful when taking  b2  and  b7  pawns. }
14... Ng4
{ Ng4 is an efficient resuming way, attacking  f2  and puts pressure on  h2  and  e3  squares. }
15. c3
{ A normal natural move,  d4  square's control is so important for white. }
15... Nc6 16. d4

22. Rb1 Qf6 { Qf6 move reduced the Black's chances a little. } 23. Ne6 Nxf2
{ Nxf2 is another mistake by Black, its advantage is almost over to the point of equality.  The better one:    23...Bxf1  24.Bxf1  Qh6  -+ }
24. Rxf2 b5
{ b5 sacrifice is a move that priotize playing the Bishop couple and advancing the central pawns. }
25. Nxf8 Rxf8 26. Bf1 Qd4
{ The Black has pawn majority in the center suitable for us and needs to use it carefully. }
27. Bxc4 bxc4 28. Kg2 Qe4+ 29. Rf3 Rc8 30. Qe1 c3 31. Qxe4 fxe4
{ At this point the game got into the lategame, Black has less pieces but has an additional pawn and passed pawns are ative and lively. They are so efficient. }

{ In this chapter, I suggest you play the Botvinnik variant against closed Sicilian with 6 ... e5, because in the Botvinnik variant, if we consider the pros and cons, the biggest minus is the critical sharp variants where White can directly sacrifice with f4-f5...  
This is the heart of the repertoire! In this way, the strategic facts of the game are known at the start and we will go into the game with a chance to win and to control the game. The chosen variants will increase your chances of getting a positive result. In particular, I would say, especially against strong players will increase your chances of getting a highly positive result.  In this repertoire, we will not examine the standard moves on 6. With f4 f5  (Botvinnik main variant)  , we first find the variant developed by Bent Larsen and play the variant developed by Botvinnik, sharpening the game of white, forcing the black to make mistake by attacking the kingside and keeping strategic phenomena in the forefront. Trying to finish the game to prevent the most critical variants that will be played against us later.  Let's review the pros and cons of this opening.  Pros  1. With the black e6, the center is not behind, but with the e5, it builds strength in the future.  2. The d4 square is a very strong square for Black.  3. There is no serious disadvantage in the position.  4. 6. Combined with f4, f5, it can work very effectively and harmoniously as well.  5. The fact that the threat of f5 is in constant possession is likely to make the best use of the mobility of the central pawns.  6. When we take the statistics, the average win rate of 6 ... e5 moves is 25% for White! A fairly low rate is a serious advantage for this black.  Cons  1. I don't like it being too close to equality  (personal opinion)  if I'm Black, it's more appropriate for my character to force the game to win.  2. The d5-f6-g5 squares need to be kept weak and constantly under control.  3. White has a chance to play on both sides of the board. }

{ Green arrows indicate Black's acquired space.  Yellow arrows indicate White's acquired space.  Movement of Black pieces shown with blue arrows.  The Red squares show the White squares that will be threatened in the future with our game plan. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nge2 Nc6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 d6 6. d3 e5 7. O-O Nge7 8. h3
{ A move that has been played very little but has solid foundations, primarily White supports the pawn storm from the kingside with g4, the basic game plan ♔h2 and pawn storm from kingside to attacking Black king.   Kh2 is a thematic prophylactic move that is avoiding first rank checks and reducing Black's tactical resources. }
8... O-O 9. g4
{ It was a move we expected after White played h3. How should we continue as Black? We could start a pawn race on the other wing, but this contains a lot of risk as White already has g4, so we will be too slow.  According to the general principles, if your opponent has started an attack from the wing, you can either attack faster on the opposite wing and interrupt your opponent's attack, or you can open the center to stop the attack. In this position, we are opposed to the principles against the attacked side, but we remain in a good position. }
9... f5 10. exf5 gxf5
{ There are 3 moves to play in this position. You can see these moves in the next variations. }
11. Ng3 f4
{ Dangerous moves for white!   The  c1  bishop is now restricted since there is a black pawn on  f4  also  g5  square and  h4  squares are weak that's because Black can use these squares. Lastly Black can advance f3 after prepared strongly for some tactical chances. }
12. Nh5 d5 13. Re1 Bh8 14. Na4 b6 15. c3 Bb7
{ Black has a great space advantage, the Knight on  a4  is very badly placed, the  h4  -  g5  squares are very serious weaknesses, Black has the chance to take advantage of the pawn attack.  Black has a very good position. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nge2 Nc6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 d6 6. d3 e5 7. O-O Nge7 8. Bg5
{ With this move, White pins the  e7  Knight  (I think the idea of Bg5 is a very effective move against the variant)  e6  (-)  d6  (-)  g6  (-)  Nge7  . I play Bg5 with the idea of quick f5 with the White pieces.  and it is an important variation for White.  The main idea is to disrupt the position of Black by using the  d5  ,  f6  ,  h6  squares if Black is not paying attention. }
8... h6
{ Black plays an early h6. It weakens Black's kingside but also opens space to hide the King. }
9. Be3 O-O 10. Qd2 Kh7 11. f4 Nd4
{ As I explained in the critical informational section of this position, White's main purpose is advancing a pawn to  f5  with the idea for kingside attack against 6... e5 Botvinnik variation.  
In this book, we have prevented the positions where White can play f5 as much as possible, but I allowed our opponent to play f5 in a few positions because we are staying well in those positions. White does not have enough compensation.   If we didn't want our opponent to play f5 somewhere, we could've to stop White's f5 move with playing 11... f5. }
12. f5 gxf5
{ White in this position can continue with Rf2 and Nd5 and we will examine these continuation paths in future variations. }
13. Rf2
{ A very natural move, to take advantage of the f file, White is preparing a Rook battery on the f file, White can also play  (Rg2-Rh2)  from the 2nd rank to g file if it is opened. A flexible move }
13... fxe4
{ Black wants to reduce the number of white pawns in the center. Black wants to open the center with pawn moves from the center in the event of Black's kingside under pressure.  The first rule of a successful side attack is to keep the center closed and under control.   Black threatening to open center for natural defending against kingside attack indirectly. }
14. dxe4
{ White can not play Bxe4 because Black plays f5 instantly and takes advantage.   With dxe4, White gain control over d file d6 pawn is a backward pawn on semi-open d file. White can seek some chances from d file.   In return, the White's  e4  pawn be an isolated pawn. In this position, if the game goes to the end game then both sides will have their own chances because of backward d pawn and isolated e pawn but in my opinion, the Black side is a little bit more valuable at endgame. For example, if Black trades f pawn with e pawn then Black's e pawn will be protected passed pawn and this is a very strong advantage on end game. }
14... b5
{ We want to disrupt the position of the  b4  Knight with b3.  If White plays Nd5 then Black will play Nxd5 with the idea of filling the weak  d5  square with a white pawn.  d6  -  c5  -  e5  is a weak structure for Black, especially the  d5  square, which is a hole. }
15. Bxd4 cxd4 16. Nxb5 Rb8
{ In the last position, Black is clearly winning. Black's pieces can quickly enter the game from effective squares Be6 Qb6 etc..  Black is in a winning position. }
17. c4 a6 18. Na3 h5
{ Black has strong dark square control, open b file and central advantage, Black's position is slightly better. }

Also if Black wants to try to open the a file then he can benefit from his queenside space advantage for opening files, e.g. a4-a3-b3, etc  2- Black doesn't lose the fight on the open e file. It's very important because there is just one open file and if someone loses the domination of that file the opponent can get the advantage.

{ The ♘h3 move was first attempted in the 1900s and popularized in the 2000s, according to the game plan of Closed Sicilian. When we look at the statistics, there is a success rate of 35-40%. Of course, there is little play on the basis of this fact, such as taking the opponent out of home preparation and making a surprise, but it does not change the fact that these ideas are effective, so I felt the need to prepare a major section for moves ♘h3 and ♘h3.  The basic idea of ​​♘h3 is to play f4 by supporting h3 at any time without blocking the path of the pawn. Well, ♘ge2 does not block the path of the pawn ♘h3 is the difference. Let's talk about a few critical points ♘h3 does not occupy square  e2  and  c3  Knight can easily go to square  e2  . The Knight  h3  controls  g5  and  f2  and  f4  .  The most important point in this variant we should note is that Black doesn't let White play the move f5 as in other variants  (for example '6. f4 With Nf3' Black playing f5 and blocking White f pawn's way)  , but with 6. ♘h3 White can play quick f5, but at this point, we did not throw O-O with Black. We can still run with O-O-O.  The black king can run away. }

{ Black's kingside is weakened. If Black had played O-O, we could say the f5 sacrifice had succeeded, but the problem for White is the weakened White kingside now while the White king is still in the center.  The Black King easily runs away from White's dangerous flank attack by castling long. }

The basic idea of the Nh3 move is to support f4-f5 for a quick attack.  + Doesn't close  f2  pawn’s way. Because of this White can play f4-f5 quickly.  - Weakens the  g4  square a little bit and in general, it can't do most of the work the Knight does on the  f3  square, for example, controling the center by pressuring the  e5  and  d4  squares. }

Both side's pieces are symmetrical, pawn structures are not damaged. In my opinion, the single problem in-game that black didn't castle somewhere. Its giving opposite side castling chances and more safety chances that's why I prefer the Black pieces here but the position is nearly equal. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4
{ Nh3 move is an appropriate move for a closed Sicilian game plan and first played in the 20th century and got popular in the 2000s. When we check its statistics it has a 35-40% win rate. Of course, this percentage can differ depending on the level of preparation by the opponent, rating and the element of surprise, but that doesn't change the fact that these ideas can be effective. That's why I wanted to make a part about 6. Nh3 and 7. Nh3 on its own.  In this game, we want to examine how Nh3 can be so effective and produce effective ideas in Nh3 positions by looking at Magnus Carlsen's game as our first model game. }
1... c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. g3 Nc6 4. Bg2 g6 5. d3 Bg7 6. Be3 e5 7. Nh3
{ The main idea behind Nh3 is to play Nf4 without blocking the pawn by the Knight.This of course can also be achieved by Nge2 so let's talk about some differences. Nh3 doesn't occupy the  e2  square and the Knight from  c3  can go to  e2  easily. Furthermore, the  h3  Knight controls the  g5  ,  f2  and  f4  squares.  The most important fact in this variation is that we normally avoid playing f5 but might want to do this here if White plays 6. Nh3 in order to play a quick f4. going 0-0 might be difficult then but we could also go for 0-0-0. }
7... Nge7 8. f4 Nd4 9. O-O O-O
{ In this position, Black's reckless castling is a minor mistake and will get him into trouble later because White has well-positioned pieces on the Kingside and they will cause trouble. }
10. Qd2 { White achieved his basic attacking structure } 10... Bd7
{ Black could have gone   10...b6   10...Rb8  instead of Bd7. the reason for b6 is to support the  c5  pawn in order to play the Knight to  d4  easier and advancing the d pawn more comfortably. Rb8 is another idea to create counterplay against White's Kingside b4 - b5.  Bd7 is not entirely a bad move but wanted to talk about the alternative ideas. }
11. Nd1
{ The main goal behind Nd1 is to take control over the  d4  square by playing c3 which gets rid of the Black knight. Because the White knight is on  h3  , c3 will make sure Black loses a tempo as opposed to when the knight would be on  f3  or  e2  , in which case Black would simply swap the knights. }
11... Qc8 12. Ndf2 Ndc6 13. c3 { White achieved its basic attack position. }
13... b5
{ 13... b5 is not a bad move, but in this position White plays fxe5 and opens the f file and  c1  -  h6  diagonal which benefits White. }
14. fxe5 Nxe5
{ When White plays fxe5 we want to take back with the d-pawn. However, because of the earlier b5 move, the  c5  pawn is under attack by White's bishop. Therefore, Black can't play dxe5, something White takes advantage of. }
15. Bh6
{ White wants to exchange the bishop to weaken the dark squares around Black's king. }

{ Bh3 is a very strong defensive move trying to prevent Black's queenside attack because the Black king is still in the center.  For example:   13.Bh3  Qa5  14.Bxe6  fxe6  15.Nce2  Nec6  16.Nxd4  exd4  17.Nh3  White has strong Kingside activity and Black has no mating threat right at this position.   That's because Black will not attack to queenside. }
13... Ng8 14. Qe3 { We will inspect   14.Qg7  later. } 14... Bxh3 15. Nxh3
{ White knight on  h3  is out of game White must spend some time for it. This knight looking just  g5  square and its not very important at this position. }
15... b4 16. Nd5 Nf6 17. Nxf6+ Qxf6 18. Rhf1 O-O
{ Black's position is little bit better because Black has space advantage on queenside and center, its king is safe, black knight is very strong on  d4  , White has no clear attacking plan to black kingside. }

{ At this position, Black players oftenly played O-O, because of that i tried to find something new something different so h5 is very interesting idea.  The idea is preparing a attack on White's kingside and provoking White to play h4. If White plays h4 then files will be closed and Black can play O-O comfortably also  g4  square will be weakened.  If White plays O-O-O as we see before, the position will be very dangerous and difficult to play for White.  Where white king should go? It's a knife sharp both sides for White. }
11. h4 O-O
{ Black king is very comfortable, White played h5. At this position using the White's general kingside attack plan  (f4-f5)  will be very difficult.

{ The Bowdler Attack is an opening that not very strong as the most popular ones. And not weak as the rest of other openings.  In my opinion, Bowdler Attack has too many different sideways that White can be play and nearly all of the other sideways are strong as mainlines in Bowdler Attack's.  That's why I tried to find a variation which is limiting sideways that White's can play and the variation must be strong for Black side that Black forcing White to play. }
3... Nf6
{ At this position, we are playing Nf6 with the idea of quick d5 for limiting White's possibilities.  If Black plays Bg7 and after that Nf6 then White's e5 move would be very strong. Because after d5 White can play exf6 and won a piece.  If you think that your oppenent will play Bowdler Attack becareful for move order. }
4. e5 d5
{ Now as you can see White's options are melting.   After this position, White can play Bb5,Bb3,Be2-ef6. White has no other logical moves. Because of this reason, we won't have to study too many variations. Also, this variation that I choose very easy for reminding and remembering. }

1. e4
{ In this case, we will see an outstanding game where black takes control over  g5  and  g4  squares and play h4 for attacking the Kingside if needed to open the h file. }
1... c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 d6 6. Nh3 e5 7. O-O h5
{ h5 move is one of the aggressive resuming ways against Nh3. the main idea is to advance h4 for having a Knight in  h3  square. Black controls  g4  square effectively and wants to have invulnerability on that square by supporting with the bishop on  c8  and h5. For example, if Black exchanges the Bishop in  g4  square with any pieces White will play hxg4 to open h file and might be able to attack Kingside rather easily. }
8. f4 Nd4 9. Be3 Bg4 10. Qd2 h4
{ Black achieved the main goal. Now Black wants to open the h file by playing h4 and wants to weaken the Kingside and attack. }
11. Ng5 hxg3 { Black opened h file, the threat is coming to White King. } 12.
hxg3 f6 13. Nf3 Ne7 14. Rab1
{ White realized that Black will go O-O-O so it opens b file to attack the queenside and wants to play a counter game. }
14... Qd7
{ Black prepared O-O-O, strong  c8  -  h3  diagonal is in Black's hand } 15. b4
Bxf3
{ Bxf3 is imminent that's why the  h3  square will weaken and moves like Qh3-Rh3 will be playable. }
16. Bxf3 Qh3
{ Black is attacking h file and serious problems did occur, White needs to exchange pieces and simplify for reducing threats.  For example:    7.Qg2  Qxg2+  18.Kxg2  Nxc2  19.Bf2  cxb4  20.Nb5 }
17. Kf2
{ Kf2 is a big mistake Black could have the winning position quickly.    18...Qh2+  19.Bg2  Rh3  20.Rh1  Qxg3+  21.Kf1  Qxe3  22.Qxe3  Rxe3  23.Rh7  cxb4  24.Rxb4  Nxc2 }
17... Qh2+ 18. Bg2 Rh3 19. Rh1 Qxg3+ 20. Kf1 Rxh1+
{ Rxh1 is not good for White, Qxe3 is a better continuation. } 21. Bxh1 O-O-O
22. bxc5 dxc5 23. Ne2 Qg4 24. c3
{ c3 is a serious mistake, White has serious problems and the h file is open. It would be okay to prioritize tempo and a fluent attack, not pieces.    24...Rh8  25.Bg2  Nf3  26.Qb2  b6  27.Bxc5  Rh2  28.Ng1  Nh4  29.Bh3  Rxh3  30.Nxh3  Qxh3+ }

{ As we see in this game Bg4 deal has done. White is forced to play Nd1 and this lets White lose time. }

18. Bxg7 Kxg7 19. Nf3
{ White played Nf3 and gave Black a chance to ake dxe4. This way Black will open d file and use it actively, which will give Black an advantage. }
