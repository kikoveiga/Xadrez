4. Nxd4
{ Here White gets the knight to the center and prepares to ruin Black's queenside pawns. Black can now choose whether to play into the sharpest lines where White will be pushing to attack, or the calmer lines where White will be pushing in a better endgame. In this book we will not be examining any of the early gambits for White such as 4.Bc4 or 4.c3. }

White's plan here should be to castle long and either pawn storm the king-side or break with e5. Bf4 supports both ideas. Alternatively, White could plan to place the bishop on e3 but will need to prepare this with h3 or f3 to prevent Ng4 counter play. }

After Nc3 Black can play Bd6 and retain the e-pawn. While the computer still likes this position for White, I wanted to get the e-pawn more cleanly with Nd2. After Nd2 if Black tries Bd6 to keep the e-pawn then Nc4 is quite strong so after Nd2 Black just gives up the e-pawn in many lines.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6
{ This constitutes the Schmidt Variation of the Scotch. } 5. Nxc6
{ Now we are in the subvariation called the Mieses Variation. Play will generally revolve around how both players deal with the attack and defense of the White e-pawn. Unusual pawn structures and tactical aspects make this opening one in which the more familiar player tends to have a significant practical advantage. The richness of ideas makes this one of my favorite lines to play from either side ! The Scotch Four Knights Variation after 5. Nc3 is a viable alternative for those looking for options. }
5... bxc6
{ Recapturing with the d-pawn is just positionally bad. White will trade queens and have an endgame pawn structure advantage, an exposed Black king to target, and easy development of his pieces. }
6. e5 { White defends his pawn by advancing it. } 6... Qe7
{ Black judges that the advanced e-pawn may be a weakness rather than a strength and begins to target it. Both players will end up with king bishops that are inconveniently blocked in after White's best response. }
7. Qe2
{ With this move, White forces Black to spend a tempo saving his knight. } 7...
Nd5 { Centralizing is the correct response by Black. } 8. c4
{ White seeks to gain time against the Black knight again along with grabbing space and placing a bid for the d5 square. Black will often want to free his position by playing d5 and this begins to deal with that break. }
8... Ba6
{ Black develops another piece. We will see his other main option of 8... Nb6 in a separate chapter. }
9. b3
{ A significant commitment by White. Alternatives are available here, but playing b3 simplifies the general theme of White's game. He will be able to defend the e-pawn with Bb2 and queen checks from b4 lose most of their sting with the b-pawn protected by the a-pawn instead of the bishop or queen. Moreover, the bishop on a6 often ends up locked out and requiring time to reposition it back into the game. The downside is that black can sometimes send his a-pawn down the board to pry open White's position. }
9... g6
{ Reasonably considered the main line, but there are several alternative tries by Black which we will consider. Black has inconvenienced his dark square bishop with Qe7 and now seeks to develop it with thematic purpose, attacking the pesky e-pawn. }
10. Bb2
{ A natural development of the White dark-square bishop. f4 is a viable alternative for those that wish to avoid the upcoming endgame that will be discussed. This also has the advantage of relatively few solid branches from which Black can choose, thus his preparation requirement is simpler. }
10... Bg7
{ Nearly always played. Black continues his intention with g6 of attacking the e-pawn. }
11. g3
{ White needs to solve his light-square bishop development issue as well. From g2, it will help fight for that important d5 square and provide an option to castle. }
11... O-O
{ Black continues to develop. Castling prepares for a rook to get on the e-file and add more pressure to the e-pawn. Black can castle in either direction, but castling short is more common when g6 instead of g5 has been played. }
12. Bg2
{ Completing the idea that started with g3. White really needs to get castled and this opens the path. }
12... Rfe8
{ See Rae8 if Black goes for the endgame in this line. White will play all the same moves in the endgame and will have the choice of transposing or playing the stronger 18. f4. }
13. O-O Rab8 { Has also been tried, but Qd2 looks compelling. } 14. Qd2 Nb6 15.
f4
{ Note that 15. Re1 fails because of 15... Bxc4! 16. Ba3 Qd8 17. bxc4 Nxc4 18. Qd3 Nxe5. By providing the e-pawn with a more secure protection first in the form of 15. f4 we prevent this tactic. }

14... d5 { This and f6 are the most common tries. } 15. Qc2
{ With dxc4 impossible due to Bxc6 we can take this moment to get out of the pin. White will complete his development with Nd2  (after cxd first if Nd7 is played here)  and have a continuing advantage going forward. }

{ Keeping the pawns together is his best try. We will call this the key endgame position. It is quite complex and while some computers slightly prefer the Black position, reality finds that White scores quite well. Our opinion is that the position gives the better player excellent chances of winning, but, with accurate play from both sides, victory may be quite the challenge. This position is so important and critical to our recommendation, that we think it is worth verbalizing some of the salient points. Let's start with Black's pluses. Looking at material only, Black has a rook and two pawns for the two minor pieces. In general, if the rooks can find open files to use, this will make them very effective. Black also has a passed pawn  (s)  on the d-file. The e-file is his for now, so he has at least one excellent file to work with his rooks. Last, the Black king can get to the central battlefield more easily than the White king can. Now let's look at White's pluses. The e-file is in use for Black, but he has no penetration points. White can essentially force his knight to the c5 square which may compel Black into a somewhat defensive position. Black has more pawn islands and one of his extra pawns is a doubled pawn so he has more weaknesses to worry about. The pieces tend to find working around pass masses easier if the files remain predominantly closed. White's plan will depend on Black's play, but in general, he will look at the following ideas going forward. Na4 eyeing the c5 square when both d6 or d4 are mistakes. If the knight gets to c5, then d6 pushes him to an effective blockading square on d3 and Rc1 targets the new weakness at c6. The bishop usually goes to f3 preventing rook penetration to e2 if Black doubles rooks. The rook will normally go to c1 immobilizing the Black pawns or sometimes d1 with similar intent. As long as the Black rooks only have one file to work with, White should usually refrain from trading a set of rooks unless additional tactical concession is achieved  (Black's rooks tend to get in each other's way when there is only one file for them)  . f4 is sometimes played, but the usual response by Black is Re3 and Rd3 when Black now essentially has two files with which to work so consider this closely before ever playing f4. In the end, we see a lot of ways for White to fight for a win while Black does not have any obvious paths to make any progress. We find the endgame quite pleasant for White and fully worthy of recommendation; however, those that find the endgame not to their liking should look to 10. f4 as an alternative. As far as computer assessments, White can take comfort that this is exactly the kind of endgame that is very difficult for computers  (and humans)  to properly assess and that despite the e-file, extra passed pawn, and king accessibility to the center, they still find White has compensation from a material count only standpoint. }

{ After castling, Black's king will be a little lonely and all the Black pieces are wondering where their targets went. While Bd3 may look natural it is not as good, for several reasons. First the Bishop often wants to get to f3 and the long diagonal, after Bd3 it has to go to e4 to do that, and cut off the Queen's defense of the e5 pawn. In addition after Bd3 we would be cutting off the Queens defense of the Knight, and Qa5 for Black can be an annoying move to face. Finally, there are possible positions where the e-file becomes more open and it can be helpful to have the Bishop on e2 to slow down tactics towards our Queen and King. }

{ This is the major alternative to 8... Ba6. See the chapter on Scotch Schmidt, 8... Ba6 for commentary on all moves prior to this move. With this move, black elects to retreat the threatened piece instead of pinning the c-pawn with Ba6. The bishop often ends up out of position on a6 and needs to be rerouted to get it back into the game and it inhibits any ideas Black may have of creating weaknesses by pushing the a-pawn down the board. Nb6 tries to avoid those issues, but at the cost of having a less aggressive knight on the board or waits to see White's intentions before deciding to play Ba6 anyway. It is a matter of taste and both are popular. As such, White must be familiar with the ideas in both set-ups. }
9. Nc3
{ This is the most popular path forward. From c3, the knight influences two of Black's more common plans---pushing the a-pawn or the d-pawn. The downside is that the knight will not be in position to directly assist in the defense of the e-pawn anytime soon. }
9... g6 10. Ne4
{ Here, Ne4 is fully justified tactically despite his undeveloped situation.  This is due to the White dark-squared having not moved yet allowing it to come more effectively to the g5 square. Moreover, the rook on a1 is not attacked by the Black queen or bishop taking on e5 since the b3-pawn has yet to move. }
10... Bg7 { Naturally developing and adding pressure to the e-pawn. } 11. Bg5
{ Adding more dark-square control around the Black King. Nf6 is not as strong after the King can safely run to d8. Notice that Nf6 we are really only attacking with a single piece, it is almost always better to bring more firepower in before proceeding. }

{ Now that the knight is held, an eventual Re1 will be very difficult to defend against. If Bxf6 then Re1+ wins right away. }

If Black castles long, White follows him, if he castles short then castling long is still an option given the central control and ability to initiate a pawn storm on the king-side. Overall, I think White has an advantage, but the play will be dynamic with Black having somewhat better short-term piece activity and White the better structure and endgame chances. }

19. Nd6 Bxd6 20. exd6 Qxd6 21. Bxh8
{ This appears to be the best way to take the exchange which buys time to fight for the e-file. Black generally will play d4/Nd5 and seek to plant his knight on c3 or e3 which will be his source of compensation. White will usually play g3 and place his rooks in a fashion that he does not get forked by the knight. Otherwise, White will strive to trade material and reach a favorable game. Black has nice pieces, but no concrete way to improve his position whereas if White can open another line for his rooks he should be doing well. In short, the better player has good winning chances here. }

{ As played in the origin game, Robson-Onischuk, Lubbock 2010 } 17. Qxe5
{ White has a slight advantage going forward in this line due to better structure and ease of piece activation. Note that fxe5 is not nearly as strong because both the Bishop and Queen are partially blocked by the e5 pawn and we recieve no targets in exchange for accepting the isolated pawn. With Qxe5 if Black wants to trade Queens and isolate our pawn then d7 will be weak. }

10. Bd2

After g6 or d5, I believe Black is very close to equal and moreover the queens are likely to come off the board in the d5 line which I think diminishes any advantage White may have in this line. Combined with that and the need to be prepared for multiple lines, I have chosen to simply develop logically  (defending from the most common intended square for the Black bishop)   b4  , and be more familiar in an alternative line that Black is less likely to know and is just as effective given some novelties I have developed in the line. White may still end up playing Qe4, but depending on how Black responds, castling long may be an option and an immediate d5 is not quite as effective with White ready to castle and Black not.

12... O-O
{ This is the most logical play from Black, but allowing us to develop the bishop with threat gives White an easy game. Most of Black's pieces are on the queenside which will require careful play from Black to not fall under an attack. It appears his best option is to simplify the position to an endgame where White seems to be doing fine with accurate play. }
13. Bd3
{ Clearly the most natural move. Develop with a threat of mate. Black has only one decent move here when White has a reasonable endgame to play and White gets a very nice game from other moves. }
13... f5
{ This move may equalize for Black, but he must play accurately. White will have to get coordinated, but has reasonable endgame chances as when the dust settles, his king will be well placed and he will have the better structure. Alternative moves allow White to castle short and leave him with a comfortable position to play for a favorable endgame. }
14. exf6
{ This opens up the Black king, encourages Black to enter an endgame, and gives Black a lot of ways to less than ideally. }
14... Qxe4+
{ Black's best choice. Rxf6 is likely playable, but all other moves cede a significant advantage to White. }
15. Bxe4
{ This recapture is the correct one. d5 is the most dangerous follow up and it is better to be able to retreat the bishop to the actice f3 square with a pin on the d-pawn and a block defence of f2 from a rook that retakes on f6. Recapturing with the knight raises questions of what to do after d5. }
15... d5
{ Black tries to open up the center before White can secure his king and develop his rooks. While I believe this is the strongest plan for Black, we will see this initiative is short-lived and White will be well positioned at its conclusion. }
16. Bf3
{ This move is the key to the position. The f2-pawn gets some defense and Black's pawns have to feel some pressure. }
16... Rae8+
{ Naturally preventing castling by White and making connecting the rooks more difficult. However, White will get his time by requiring Black to recapture on f6. }
17. Kd1
{ Now the endgame is in mind. White's king will be in better position to deal with issues on the queenside. Meanwhile, Black's king is safe, but unemployed. }
17... Rxf6 { Now or never ! } 18. Kc2
{ Completing the task of connecting the rooks and getting even closer to the upcoming endgame conflict. An interesting battle remains. White's general plan is to place an appropriate rook on e1 and seek simplifications to an endgame with fewer pieces so his king position and the relative pawn structures become more relevant. If Black doubles rooks on the f-file, then Be3 handles the f-pawn. Black's best move is to reroute the bishop to c8 and f5. White handles this with ease with Rae1 and Kd1. If the bishop immediately goes to c5 then the strongest is the ignore the f-pawn threat and play Rhe1. It is worth noting here that, positionally-speaking, Black would be doing well if he could keep both rooks alive and have White's king so exposed. His problem is that White can force the trade of a set of rooks  (making his king safer)  or else get the more important open e-file for himself  (acquiring the more serious initiative when a rook appears on e7, Black will likely find himself again forced to trade a set of rooks)  . Furthermore, White has real winning chances given the principle of two weaknesses  (weakened queenside pawns and pawn majority on the kingside)  . }

{ White's plans in the Malaniuk Variations:   After Bb4, White seeks first to trade off the annoying dark-square bishop after Be3 and Nf5.  Normally, the knight will recapture on e3 with excellent central control/opportunities.  White will generally play an eventual c4 and Nc3 granting great control of d5, Black will get an outpost on e5, but will have no targets.  White will normally castle short and play will revolve around knight maneuvering and Black's queen-side majority versus White's king-side majority if an endgame arises.  White tends to have more space for the maneuvering, but Black's bishop is more active as compensation.  In the end, White tends to have easier play as his plans are easier. These will depend on Black's set-up, but tend to revolve around an f4 push, a queen-side expansion, and/or endgame simplification with rapid centralization of the king. }

I have always viewed the dark-squared Black bishop in this and the immediate Bc5 line to be enemy number one and that much of the initial play should be oriented toward trading or neutralizing it in both lines.

7... g6

8. Bxb6
{ White needs to get rid of the dark-square bishop and the knight needs to be able to retreat to e3. }
8... axb6
{ Black cannot afford to take the knight instead with the new dark-square weaknesses on the king side and dxb6 is not an option due to Nd6. }
9. Ne3

O-O
{ Black is ready for the middle game after d6. The dark-square weaknesses around his king are not very troubling since White has no dark-square bishop. Moreover, having the open a-file provides more counterplay for him. Any attempt to create a bind with c4 is likely to fail as Black has an extra b-pawn to break it up. White needs to play very efficiently just to not end up significantly worse. }
11. Be2
{ c4 has been the most common move here, but we simply do not trust it because of the aforementioned aspects  (extra b-pawn to lever the bind away and the open a-file make creating a restricted bishop suspect)  . Be2 has scored well in limited exposure, but finding a true advantage for White is problematic. For those seeking alternatives to the Be2 line we will suggest Na3 or try to make the c4 line work. }

{ Naturally, we recapture without fouling our structure. White's plan from here is to prevent Black's most natural break, d5. We will achieve this in most lines by playing c4 and Nc3. True that our bishop is not so great in that structure, but when Black lacks any substantive breaks White can take his time to achieve reasonable play. The main other possible break with f5 would be dangerous if Black is castled on that side. }
8... d6

9. c4 { Again creating our bind against the d5 break. } 9... Nge7
{ If Black is going to play Nge7, then move order is not very important. Black will normally play d6, Nge7, and castles. For our purposes, it makes no difference which order this occurs. Nge7 makes a bit more since to me as Black needs a pawn break and f5 is the only meaningful one he is likely to get despite its risk. As such, Nge7 supports that break and is the most consistent for Black if he wishes to have a logical plan. With all that said, Nf6 leading White to normally put another pawn on a light square has its merits. }

{ Naturally, we recapture without fouling our structure. White's plan from here is to prevent Black's most natural break, d5. We will achieve this in most lines by playing c4 and Nc3. True that our bishop is not so great in that structure, but when Black lacks any substantive breaks White can take his time to achieve reasonable play. The main other possible break with f5 would be dangerous if Black is castled on that side. }

{ White has achieved his bind position. Normal follow up would be Be2, Qd2, castles kingside. Black is ok here, but will have trouble creating any serious counter play without risking f5. This will be a maneuvering game where the better player will have the better chances and White's play is easier. }
11... Nd7 12. Be2
{ Black is a bit crampe and lacking a plan so Bd3 allowing him to likely trade a knight for the bishop is probably not a good decision. The bishop is not likely to be bad forever. }
12... Nc5 13. O-O
{ Most moves here are met with Ned5 and then either b4, Nb5, or f4 depending on Black's response. }

Some key tactics involve Nb5 with threats on the c-pawn and often a sacrifice of a knight on d6. These threats tend to force the Black king to d8 and leave him subject to attack in the center.  White often accepts a bad pawn structure  (usually doubled c-pawns)  in exchange for the attack  White usually castles short and brings his rook to e1 to aid in the attack. }

The standard way of dealing with a gambit where the opponent has a development advantage is to trade pieces and often to give back the pawn for a comfortable position. The biggest issues for Black with accepting the pawn are that he cannot trade a lot of pieces off and he has no easy way to bail out by just giving the pawn back. He will generally end up trading a bishop for knight, have one or both rooks sitting at home unused, and have an exposed king. The biggest issue with not accepting the pawn is that his other plan  (attacking the king)  is simply not justified with no other pieces significantly involved yet. Thus, I deem the early queen move to be objectively inferior versus other choices available to Black. However, it is a dangerous move for an unprepared White player to face. }
7. Nb5
{ Certainly not Nxc6 as the trading of pieces when you have a development advantage dissolves said advantage. With this move, the knight is saved and creates a threat of Nxc7. }
7... Kd8
{ White will get an improved version here of our mainline as now Black can no longer foul the queenside pawn structure yet still has all his disadvantages related to the exposed king. }

Castling protects the g-pawn, but, more importantly, releases the bishop on e2 and creates serious threats related to the rook showing up on the e-file. After this move, we see Black usually try one of three ways to continue forward. }
9... a6 { Black seeks to back up the aggressively placed knight on b5. } 10.
Bf3
{ White develops his bishop to a more aggressive post with tempo on the queen since the bishop is no longer needed to protect the knight on b5 that will be moving soon. Not to mention, the e-file is opened for the rook to show up on with menacing threats. }
10... Qc4
{ Black has a number of queen moves available. Qc4 and Qg6 have been the most common. The general approach is that Nd4 is good enough for an advantage in most of the lines. However, the alternative replies of Bxc6 axb5 Bd5 when the c pawn is not covered by the queen's choice of squares on move 10, or the knight sac on d6 when the queen's choice was Qc4 are viable moves for an ongoing advantage. We will go further in this line for general guidance into the attacking scheme available. }
11. Nd6
{ Again, Nd4 is enough for an advantage, but defending this sacrifice is very difficult and even in the best line for Black, White retains an advantage. }
11... cxd6 { Accepting the sacrifice is the only way to try to survive. } 12.
Qxd6 Nge7 { The best try, but White is still on top. } 13. Bf4
{ Between Re1 and Qc7+, Black's days are numbered. } *

5... Bb4
{ Of course. This renews the threat to the e-pawn. Other moves are much less common, but we will touch on a couple of them briefly. }
6. Be2
{ With this move, White gambits the e-pawn. It is considered the strongest reply in theory. What does White get for the pawn ? A development advantage and an exposed Black king in most variations. With the offer of the e-pawn, White tries to direct Black's aggression into his choice of Black's plans by encouraging Black to play for winning a pawn and denying attacks on an exposed White king  (as he will be castling soon)  . }
6... Qxe4
{ The pawn is usually accepted and the knight on d4 is attacked twice thus white cannot castle immediately and must save his knight. The standard way of dealing with a gambit where the opponent has a development advantage is to trade pieces and often to give back the pawn for a comfortable position. The biggest issues for Black with accepting the pawn are that he cannot trade a lot of pieces off and he has no easy way to bail out by just giving the pawn back. He will generally end up trading a bishop for knight, have one or both rooks sitting at home unused, and have an exposed king. The biggest issue with not accepting the pawn is that his other plan  (attacking the king)  is simply not justified with no other pieces significantly involved yet. Thus, I deem the early queen move to be objectively inferior versus other choices available to Black. However, it is a dangerous move for an unprepared White player to face. }

10... d6
{ The most logical choice is trying to develop the bishop without further delay. Other moves have been tried. In general, if Black tries a6 then white will retreat to d4 unless his bishop is on e3 in which case sacrificing the knight on d6 should always be considered followed by Bb6+. If Black tries h6, then Bxf6+ followed by Re1 will continue to provide an advantage. }
11. Qd2
{ White has a comfortable position. His rooks will find aggressive positions and the bishop pair combined with the awkward Black king and the unemployed rook on a8 more than make up for the pawn investment. The general plan going forward is Re1, Rb1/ Rd1, Bf3, and sometimes sacrificing with Nxd6. Note that Nxd6 does NOT work yet in this position. With our Rook still on f1 and our Bishop on e2 Black can force the Queens off with Qe6 after the sacrifice. }
