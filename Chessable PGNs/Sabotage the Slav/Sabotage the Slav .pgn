{ It's not a secret that the Slav Defense is one of Black's most reliable openings against 1. d4. Moreover, Black has a wide choice of different variations such as the Classical Slav, the Semi-Slav, the Chebanenko Slav, the Schlechter variation, etc. Throughout my career as a chess player my main choice against the Slav was 3. Nf3 and 4. Nc3, entering mainstream lines. It goes without saying that I had to be ready to deal with all of Black's various options, whether it was the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav or Chebanenko. All of these variations have been played quite a lot on top Grandmaster level and therefore the theory has been evolving all the time.At some point I felt that it was necessary to develop an alternative variation, which wouldn't require a lot of theoretical knowledge, but would nevertheless be challenging. My choice has fallen upon the 4. Qb3 variation. It's important to mention that I employ this move only after 3... Nf6, while Black can deviate by playing the 'Triangle Slav' 3... e6 after which 4. Qb3 doesn't appeal to me as much.The 4. Qb3 variation has served me pretty well since 1998. Since the theory of this line has significantly evolved, I am very excited finally to introduce my work in this variation. It's important to add that 4. Qb3 is very different from the lines I recommend in my Grandmaster Repertoire series. I hope that chess players all over the World will enjoy my work and, even more importantly, score a lot of wins in this line.Boris Avrukh, March 2020 }

{ First of all, playing against players below 2300 level, you can expect superficial knowledge or sometimes even complete lack of knowledge in this variation.   It sounds a bit strange, but on the other hand, there is a very logical explanation: Black has so many mainstream lines to cover, such as 3. Nf3 and 4. Nc3; 3. Nf3 and 4. e3; 3. Nc3 and 4. e3. It is not surprising that Black players mostly focus on studying these lines and are familiar with all recent theoretical developments there, especially in sharp lines.

That being said, you can expect to face different responses depending on the level of your opponent.   Here is how I would break down what you can anticipate from Black according to my personal experience. }
4... a6
{ Honestly, I have never faced this move and it appears this move is not very popular compared to Black's other responses. However, it seems this waiting move in the style of the Chebanenko variation works not only with a white knight on c3 but also in other lines.   It seems like more and more strong players are starting to play this move. For instance, I found three games of Motylev, a very strong Russian grandmaster, played in recent years.   4... a6 is a move that you can expect from someone who doesn't have serious knowledge in this variation, but who implements the Chebanenko variation against other 4th moves by White. }
5. Bg5
{ My choice here, even though it's far from being White's top choice statistically. I would like to mention one specific line: }
5... b5
{ This move is not bad, but it is not so effective without a white knight on c3. }
6. cxd5 cxd5 7. e3
{ It is key to not automatically develop the knight to c3. White will first develop his kingside, and after that I will offer a new strategical idea. }
7... e6 8. Bd3 Be7 9. Nbd2
{ White benefits from not having his knight on c3 by starting play along the c-file and challenging Black's queenside pawn structure through a2-a4. }

It is also important to mention that the knight will be developed to d2, and not to c3: as we are trying to prevent the c5-break, we should not block the c-file. The knight can go to b3 afterwards, gaining even more control over the c5-square. Another idea is to play e5  (gaining a tempo on the black queen)  and to place the bishop on e4. }

The rook is unable to move:  11.Rd2  Nb6  and the queen is trapped. So here you can see why the queen needs the e2-square! }

6. Nbd2

6... Nbd7 7. g3 { We opt for the fianchetto set-up once more. } 7... e6 8. Bg2
Be7 9. O-O O-O
{ Both sides have made normal developing moves. It is now time to make a decision and decide on a direction for the game. }
10. Qb3
{ After a lot of analysing, I decided on this move. White attacks the b7-pawn and vacates the c4-square for his knight. }
10... Qb6
{ A very common reaction to White's attack on the b7-pawn, although Black has several alternatives. See for example here. }
11. Nc4 { The endgame after } 11... Qxb3 12. axb3

{ A slightly unusual opening approach with an early queen sortie, but nevertheless a well-known opening variation. In my opinion, this variation has proved to be a reliable alternative to the main lines with massive theory, such as 4. Nc3, or 4. e3.   The idea behind White's move is simply to protect the c4-pawn and develop his pieces in the most efficient way.   There is a lot of similarity with the move 4. Qc2, however I have always believed that after 4... g6, Black obtains a somewhat good version of a Grunfeld set-up with White's queen being slightly misplaced on c2.   I will be examining Black's five most popular responses against 4. Qb3. In this chapter we will take a look at 4... e6. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Qb3
{ A slightly unusual opening approach with an early queen sortie, but nevertheless a well-known opening variation. In my opinion, this variation has proved to be a reliable alternative to the main lines with massive theory, such as 4. Nc3, or 4. e3.   The idea behind White's move is simply to protect the c4-pawn and develop his pieces in the most efficient way.   There is a lot of similarity with the move 4. Qc2, however I have always believed that after 4... g6, Black obtains a somewhat good version of a Grunfeld set-up with White's queen being slightly misplaced on c2.   I will be examining Black's five most popular responses against 4. Qb3. In this chapter we will take a look at 4... e6. }
4... e6
{ This is a very solid set-up which usually leads to play similar to the QGD, although Black still maintains the possibility of capturing on c4 in some lines followed by b7-b5. }
5. Bg5 Nbd7
{ The most popular move in this position. 5... Be7 should eventually transpose into the text, but there are two important alternative lines worth mentioning, 5... dxc4 and 5... h6. }
6. Nc3
{ It is essential to start with this move.  Once I experimented with   6.e3 ?!  and ran into  6...Qa5+  7.Nc3  Ne4  after which White has to fight hard for equality.  See here. }

12... Ng6 13. Rce1
{ Here in the only game Marshall-Janowski, 1908, White opted for the natural   13.Rfe1  but failed to achieve anything after  13...Ne4  Placing the other rook on e1 makes a significant difference. }

{ White has definite pressure. The pawn on b7 is hanging, and Qb4 is an idea to unpin the knight. Moves like h3 or Rfe1 will also be useful. }

{ Without the queen on e7, e3-e4 is not nearly as strong. With Qc2, White instead aims to put some pressure on the kingside. Note that since the rook on e7 is now protecting the pawn on b7, the queen was not doing much on b3 anyway. }

{ A very challenging move in my opinion, and the one I recommended in my book 'Grandmaster Slav Repertoire' for Black. The theory has significantly evolved since I published my work in 2014.   In this specific variation I would like to offer two options for White. The first one - 6. Nbd2 - is a positional move after which White maintains a very safe position. The second try is 6. Nc3, which leads to a more aggressive and ambitious type of play.   I am offering two different approaches so that players can find the best choice for themselves.

{ The main reason I decided to provide this game is to highlight an inaccurate move order. It's quite tricky as this move doesn't seem so different from the accurate 6. Nc3. Hopefully, this example will help you to avoid the same mistake! Remarkably enough, in about 20 games White's inaccuracy went unnoticed. }
6... Qa5+ { This is the problem for White. } 7. Nc3
{ Nobody has played   7.Nbd2  and rightly so, as after  7...Ne4  8.Bh4  g5 !  9.Bg3  g4  -+  Black wins material. }
7... Ne4 8. h4
{ White has a few alternatives here:   8.Bf4  g5 !  9.Bg3  in case of   9.Nxg5  dxc4 !  N  is the right reply for Black.   9...Nxg5  10.cxd5 !  Be7  Zitek,M - Jina,J ICCF email 2004, and here White should have played  11.d6 !  N  Bf6  12.O-O-O  with very interesting compensation.  10.Qa4  The only move.  10...Qxa4  11.Nxa4  Bb4+  12.Ke2  Nxg5  13.Bxg5  e5  =+  9...h5  10.h4  g4  11.Nd2  Nxg3  12.fxg3  Bh6 !  Black was clearly better in Thejkumar,M - Adhiban,B Jalgaon 2013.  Apparently White's best continuation is   8.cxd5  even though Black has a comfortable game after  8...Nxg5  9.Nxg5  exd5  10.Bd3  Be7  11.Nf3  O-O  12.O-O  Qd8  Caruana, F - Kamsky,G Achaea 2012. }

{ In case of   13.Qxc3  Qxc3+  14.bxc3  c5  the endgame is quite unpleasant for White. }
13... Qf5 14. g3 Qe4+
{ White is able to create counterplay after   14...c5  15.O-O  b6  16.Ng5 !  ⇆ }
15. Be2 b6 { 15...c5  16.Qb1  Nf6  would have been more annoying for White. }
16. Qb1 Qxb1+ 17. Rxb1 Bb7 18. Ne5 Nxe5 19. dxe5
{ Eventually I was able to reach a balanced position and I was really happy to escape with a draw in this game. }
