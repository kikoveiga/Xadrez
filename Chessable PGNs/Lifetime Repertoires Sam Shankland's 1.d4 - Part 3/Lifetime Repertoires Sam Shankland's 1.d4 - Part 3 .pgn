1. d4
{ Welcome to the final part of my Lifetime 1.d4 Repertoire! In Part 1, @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/course/47519/@@LinkEnd@@, I covered all of Black's sidelines, in Part 2 @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/course/53465/@@LinkEnd@@, I covered the Indian Games with 1. d4 Nf6, and now finally we have reached the toughest part of all, covering the Queen's Gambit with 1. d4 d5.   Much like we saw in the first two parts, my goal is to fight for a strategic edge such as space advantage, a better structure, or the bishop pair, and this is not really a repertoire aimed at tearing Black's head off. But, given that Black has placed a pawn in the center on the very first move of the game, I find it harder to accomplish these goals, and I was actually surprised to find that even in some very solid variations, White ended up with some kind of attacking chances.   While I believe that part 3 is more demanding than parts 1 and 2 in how difficult playing the resulting positions will be, I still am very happy with the analysis I did and I think I managed to pose Black a lot of problems in some very solid variations. The lines given in this file are all covered in the course. Happy Studying! }
1... d5 { 1...Nf6  This move was the subject of part 2. } 2. c4 e6
{ 2...c6  3.Nc3  If White is happy to play into the Meran, this move order does a very good job of cutting down on some of Black's extra options.  3...Nf6  4.e3  And here in addition to e6, transposing to the Semi-Slav, I covered Black's other 3 main tries.  4...g6   4...a6   4...Bf5   2...dxc4  3.e3  Nf6   3...e5  4.Bxc4  a6  5.Nf3  e6  6.O-O  Now, I covered the dubious but still reasonably common 6...b5 as well as the main move 6...c5.  6...c5   6...b5 }
3. Nf3 Nf6
{ This is the main move, but I covered all of Black's other tries as well.   3...c5  4.cxd5  exd5  5.g3+=  I did not discover any groundbreaking new ideas against the Tarrasch, but luckily the existing state of the theory was very nice for White.   3...a6  4.Bg5!  I like this move, which seems to secure White a small edge. }
4. Nc3 c6
{ 4...a6  5.c5!  I think this is a great way to steer the game into an uncomfortable position for Black.   4...Bb4  5.cxd5  exd5  6.Bg5  I ended up choosing the old mainline against the Ragozin, which surprisingly is out of fashion nowadays. I don't think Black is equalizing too easily here.   4...dxc4  5.e4  Bb4  6.Bxc4  I advocate this enterprising pawn sacrifice against the Vienna, but with an important novelty early on in the mainline that I think poses Black some problems.   4...c5  The Semi-Tarrasch was quite a challenge as well. I ended up going for the mainline with  5.cxd5  Nxd5  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  Some long lines seem more or less okay for Black, but I'm satisfied that I found a new idea which should pose serious problems for a human to solve, and at the end leads to a position that feels more comfortable for White to me even if the computer calls it equal.   4...h6  This move has curiously gained some popularity in recent years. I have no idea why, but I found a comfortable way for White to play.   4...Nbd7  5.Bf4   4...Be7  The proper Queen's Gambit Declined is one of Black's most solid options against 1.d4 in the history of chess. I think I managed to put him under some pressure after 5.Bf4. }
5. e3
{ It was a bit awkward to propose a recommendation against the Semi-Slav, both because I believe it is Black's best opening against 1.d4 and because I already wrote a course on it from Black's point of view @@StartBracket@@ @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/lifetime-repertoires-semi-slav/course/31529/@@LinkEnd@@ @@EndBracket@@ and had to fight against my own analysis. I ended up choosing the Meran, and I thought I found a position that felt a bit more comfortable from the White-side, but in a higher chess sense, should be more or less fine for Black. This is the normal result when analyzing a mainline and trying hard to find an edge with White. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6

The way I advocate playing does a very good job steering the game into Semi-Slav territory, and it avoids a lot of Black's other options. }
3. Nc3
{ 3.Nf3  Is quite a bit more common, but I like this move order. With 3. Nc3 and 4.e3, White avoids all kinds of Bc8-f5 or g4 options. Black does not HAVE to go for a Semi-Slav, but his other options look pretty soft to me. A key point of understanding these positions is knowing when to take on d5. It's a pretty common move to make whenever Black touches his c8-bishop, as then the b7-pawn will become weak after a subsequent Qd1-b3. It's also generally a good move if Black plays Nb8-d7, as the knight really belongs on c6 in all of the Exchange Slav structures. }
3... e6 4. e3
{ Black should probably play Ng8-f6 here, again transposing to the Semi-Slav, but he does have another option. }
4... f5
{ This has seen play from time to time. I find it to be a poor version of the Stonewall plan I was advocating in the Semi-Slav course. }
5. Nf3 Nd7
{ I have also seen this move played with the idea of developing the g8-knight to h6, but I find it unimpressive. }
6. Bd3 Nh6
{ Black's play is not totally senseless. He is looking to play Bf8-d6, O-O and will always have Nh6-f7 available to prevent White from landing a knight on e5. But, I think we can take advantage of the knight committing to h6 so soon. }
7. Qc2 { White prepares castling long. } 7... Bd6 8. Bd2 O-O 9. O-O-O
{ In general, I think castling long against the Stonewall tends to be unimpressive because a knight landing on e4 will be colossally annoying with f2 hanging. But, Black's knight on h6 is obviously misplaced for such a task! White can look to prepare a kingside attack with h2-h3 and g2-g4, and I think Black is too slow to make anything too annoying happen. }

3... dxc4
{ If Black is hell-bent on not playing  3...Nf6  , this is probably his best option, aiming to transpose to some kind of Classical Slav. But, it gives White an excellent option he does not have when the moves Ng1-f3 and Ng8-f6 are included. }
4. e3 b5 5. a4 b4
{ Now since Black's knight is still on g8, thankfully White does not have to retreat his knight to an ugly square like a2. }
6. Ne4 Qd5
{ Black should probably try to hang onto the pawn since his position is really suspect if he doesn't, but I don't think this equalizes either. }
7. Nd2 Ba6 8. Qc2
{ White promptly takes the c4-pawn back, and should enjoy a nice edge. Black's results have been really bad here. }

5. cxd5 cxd5 6. Qb3

I only played the White side of this position once, though I won, it was a very stressful game. I think I can cause Black some more issues than present theory can. }
12. Nf3 O-O 13. O-O Qc7
{ Avrukh correctly points out that this is not best. The queen is misplaced here and will be vulnerable to a knight landing on b5, and White has a very nice counter sacrifice. }
14. Nd4 Nc4 15. b3 Bxh2+ 16. Kh1
{ Material has been equalized, but Black's coordination is horrendous, his pieces are loose, and White will easily complete his development with Bc1-b2 once the c4-knight leaves. The machines are claiming White is much better, and I won't argue with them. }

Of course, the queen is better on c1 than c2 because it will not be attacked by Nc6-b4. Black has a few options here, but none of them equalize. The basic plan is Rf1-d1, Nb5-c3, and Nf3-d2. Black will have a very hard time saving the c4-pawn or making any counterplay if White can pull this off. }

{ Now, it's very important to understand the following maneuver. White's plan is to eventually launch a kingside attack, but if Black is allowed to secure his kingside with Nd7-f6 and then get a quick c7-c5 in, he will be able to prevent White from sticking the knight on e5. Not only will this make the f3-knight more passive, but it will also make it impossible to lift a rook to h3. White should prevent this from happening. }
11. Bd3 { First thing's first. White provokes a weakness on the kingside. }
11... Nf6

12. Ne5

{ The Tarrasch Defense phases in and out of popularity for a while, but now it is clearly out and I expect it to remain so for the years to come. Black accepts an isolated pawn as early as move 3, and I can't really imagine he can seriously fight for equality.

I have played it myself several times, including scoring a big win over Alexander Onischuk in the penultimate round of the 2018 US Championship, setting me up for a successful fight for first place the following day. Unlike a lot of Black's other super solid defenses, this one offers him decent chances to imbalance the game and play for a win, making it a favorite of players of all levels. It took a lot of work to try to put it under any kind of pressure, but I am reasonably satisfied with what I found. }
5. cxd5
{ Once upon a time, this was the main move by a wide margin. Nowadays White has often looked in other directions, but I think that for once, the old move actually has some merit. }
5... exd5 6. Bg5
{ Now, if White can play e2-e3, Bf1-d3, and O-O, he will be pleasantly better. Black has a few ways to try to stop this from happening. Broadly speaking, he can either try to look for direct counterplay in some way, or he can try to get his bishop to f5 before White can get his own bishop to d3. In general, Black should be able to pull off the latter plan, but when he does, he can often run into concrete problems connected with Qd1-b3. }
6... Nbd7
{ This is known as the Westphalia variation. It has since taken a backseat to the modern mainline with   6...h6  , but it certainly remains a tough nut to crack. }
7. Qc2
{ This rare move has not enjoyed much popularity in the last five years, but I find it to be a nice alternative to   7.e3  , which allows for a quick h6/g5/Ne4 expansion. White is ready for e2-e3 next. }

7... O-O 8. e3 Bf5

Black accepts a slightly worse position with basically no discussion but hopes that he can keep the disadvantage to a manageable level and hold a draw without much trouble. }

I think White's best coordination is to play Re1-e3 and Qd2-e2, and if he can safely pull this off, he will be better. Black's queenside pawns will be stuck, and White will have secured the e4-pawn as well as the c2 and c3 squares, severely limiting any hope for queenside counterplay. Additionally, the pieces will be very well placed for a d4-d5 sacrifice with e5-e6 to follow. Black should take care not to let this happen. Alternatively, if White can play d4-d5 and get his pawn all the way to d6 without any hiccups along the way, he will be much better. Black must be careful to prevent this as well. }

White should not fear being a pawn down as Black can't do much with it, and should rarely take back on d4 as this would allow Black's pieces to spring to life with Nd7-e5. Finally, it is important to note that Black is enormously hindered by the a7-a6 advance.

Black is unwilling to commit his knight to d7 just yet and may look to play c6-c5 and develop the knight to c6 in various cases.

It's a pretty common move to make whenever Black touches his c8-bishop, as then the b7-pawn will become weak after a subsequent Qd1-b3.

But, Black's knight on h6 is obviously misplaced for such a task! White can look to prepare a kingside attack with h2-h3 and g2-g4, and I think Black is too slow to make anything too annoying happen. }

{ The Slav has always been one of Black's most solid choices against 1.d4, and it is the move order I recommended in my Semi-Slav course @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/lifetime-repertoires-semi-slav/course/31529/@@LinkEnd@@. The way I advocate playing does a very good job steering the game into Semi-Slav territory, and it avoids a lot of Black's other options. }
3. Nc3
{ 3.Nf3  Is quite a bit more common, but I like this move order. With 3. Nc3 and 4.e3, White avoids all kinds of Bc8-f5 or g4 options. Black does not HAVE to go for a Semi-Slav, but his other options look pretty soft to me. A key point of understanding these positions is knowing when to take on d5. It's a pretty common move to make whenever Black touches his c8-bishop, as then the b7-pawn will become weak after a subsequent Qd1-b3. It's also generally a good move if Black plays Nb8-d7, as the knight really belongs on c6 in all of the Exchange Slav structures. }
3... dxc4
{ If Black is hell-bent on not playing  3...Nf6  , this is probably his best option, aiming to transpose to some kind of Classical Slav. But, it gives White an excellent option he does not have when the moves Ng1-f3 and Ng8-f6 are included. }
4. e3 b5 5. a4 b4
{ Now since Black's knight is still on g8, thankfully White does not have to retreat his knight to an ugly square like a2. }
6. Ne4 Qd5
{ Black should probably try to hang onto the pawn since his position is really suspect if he doesn't, but I don't think this equalizes either. }
7. Nd2 c3 8. bxc3 bxc3 9. Nb1
{ If White can take on c3, he should enjoy a nice edge thanks to Black's weak c6-pawn. I don't believe Black can stop this from happening. }
9... Qa5 10. Qc2 Na6
{ This is the main move, and for good reason. Black is hoping to make good use of the weakened b4-square, but this should not equalize. }
11. Qxc3 Nb4 12. Bd2 e6 13. Nf3 Nf6 14. Bc4
{ I can't really imagine Black equalizing here with the weak c6-pawn and the bad bishop on c8. White's play is very straightforward: O-O, Rf1-c1, Nf3-e5, attack the weaknesses. It says a lot that even in the engine vs engine world of ICCF, Black is losing some games. }

The way I advocate playing does a very good job steering the game into Semi-Slav territory, and it avoids a lot of Black's other options. }
3. Nc3
{ 3.Nf3  Is quite a bit more common, but I like this move order. With 3. Nc3 and 4.e3, White avoids all kinds of Bc8-f5 or g4 options. Black does not HAVE to go for a Semi-Slav, but his other options look pretty soft to me. A key point of understanding these positions is knowing when to take on d5. It's a pretty common move to make whenever Black touches his c8-bishop, as then the b7-pawn will become weak after a subsequent Qd1-b3. It's also generally a good move if Black plays Nb8-d7, as the knight really belongs on c6 in all of the Exchange Slav structures. }
3... Nf6 { This is the main move by far. } 4. e3
{ Now, I strongly believe that Black's best move here is e7-e6, transposing back into a Semi-Slav where White is forced to play e3 instead of Bg5. Since this was our plan anyway, I do not find it to be troubling. }
4... a6
{ If Black is hell-bent on not playing into the Semi-Slav, this is a decent option. }
5. Nf3 Bf5
{ This move is not totally stupid, it has been recommended by Boris Avrukh in the same Classical Slav book as well as by Alex Colovic here on Chessable, and I even played it once against Boris Gelfand. I got into massive trouble straight from the opening and never really touched it again. }
6. Qb3 { I like this natural move the best. White harasses the weak b7-pawn. }
6... b5
{ Of course Black can consider advancing b7-b5 as well, but I find it unimpressive. }
7. cxd5 cxd5 8. a4 { The position is opening faster than Black would like. }

e4
{ Black cannot take on e4 thanks to d4-d5 hanging over his head, and his king will soon be taken for a ride with moves like Bc1-g5 on the way. }

Black does not HAVE to go for a Semi-Slav, but his other options look pretty soft to me. A key point of understanding these positions is knowing when to take on d5. It's a pretty common move to make whenever Black touches his c8-bishop, as then the b7-pawn will become weak after a subsequent Qd1-b3. It's also generally a good move if Black plays Nb8-d7, as the knight really belongs on c6 in all of the Exchange Slav structures. }

{ Black's position is absurdly dangerous, and the Bh7-d3 and Qd1-e2 regrouping could very quickly lead to mate. Additionally, White can also consider Bh7-e4, trading the light-squared bishops, and once his queen lands on e4, Bg3-h4 can hurt a lot too. The machines think Black is only a little worse here and more or less surviving, but I have to imagine a human would really be struggling, even if he made it this far some 7 moves after my novelty. }

Much like a lot of other systems, Black takes on c4 knowing that he may not be able to keep his extra pawn, but hopes that White will have to lose some time and uncoordinate his pieces to get it back. Still, this always struck me as a bit suspicious since it allows White to take over the whole center right away. }
5. e4 { Of course. } 5... Bb4
{ This is the main move by far, and in my opinion, it is best. Black pins the knight, threatens the e4-pawn, potentially prepares for b7-b5, and gets ready to castle. However, White can sacrifice a pawn for a powerful initiative and get way ahead in development. }

{ Now, it's very important to understand the following maneuver. White's plan is to eventually launch a kingside attack, but if Black is allowed to secure his kingside with Nd7-f6 and then get a quick c7-c5 in, he will be able to prevent White from sticking the knight on e5. Not only will this make the f3-knight more passive, but it will also make it impossible to lift a rook to h3. White should prevent this from happening. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4
{ This move signals the start of the Vienna variation. Much like a lot of other systems, Black takes on c4 knowing that he may not be able to keep his extra pawn, but hopes that White will have to lose some time and uncoordinate his pieces to get it back. Still, this always struck me as a bit suspicious since it allows White to take over the whole center right away. }
5. e4 { Of course. } 5... Bb4
{ This is the main move by far, and in my opinion, it is best. Black pins the knight, threatens the e4-pawn, potentially prepares for b7-b5, and gets ready to castle. However, White can sacrifice a pawn for a powerful initiative and get way ahead in development. }
6. Bxc4
{ This is certainly the most critical move. Black really should take on e4, otherwise, he will have nothing to show for the massive pawn center. }
6... Nxe4 7. O-O
{ Now Black has two options. He can retreat with Ne4-f6, losing back his extra pawn but hoping to consolidate his position and complete his development, or he can take on c3 to try to conserve the extra material. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted is one of Black's most solid defenses against 1.d4. It does really offer him many counter chances, and as such has never been wildly popular, but breaking it down is anything but straightforward, and a lot of strong guys have used it in recent years when they are looking to be as solid as possible and are quite happy to make a draw with Black. It took me a lot of effort to find a variation I liked, but I ultimately was satisfied with what I found. }
3. e3
{ White can also consider Ng1-f3, but this gives Black some annoying additional options such as a quick Bc8-g4 or even  3...a6  . This move strikes me as simpler. Black normally lets the pawn go with Ng8-f6 but he has tried some other things as well. }
3... Nf6 { This is the main move by far. } 4. Bxc4 e6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. } 5. Nf3 c5 6. O-O
{ Now, Black's main move by far is a7-a6, but he does have some extraneous options. }
6... a6
{ This is the main move by far, has been played almost exclusively by top players in recent years, and is the recommendation of Sopiko Guramashvili here on Chessable. It's a somewhat demanding task for Black to play this position since White easily has 10 sensible moves that all require precision from Black's end to meet, but when assuming Black plays the best moves, it's actually incredibly difficult to prove anything and I tried five different moves before I found something I was satisfied with. }
7. Nbd2
{ I quite like this extremely rare move, which has been played just a few times in the past decade. But, two of those games saw Ding Liren and Grischuk on the White side! I predict it may become a hot trend. }
7... Nbd7
{ This move would be the most consistent with Black's general plan in the modern QGA. Guramashvili gives it against more or less every other legal move! Black is waiting on developing the f8-bishop, hoping to perhaps take back on c5 in a single move, and does not yet commit the b-pawn either as it may want to go to either b6 or b5, depending on how White proceeds. }
8. e4 { Grischuk's choice looks very decent to me. } 8... b5 9. e5
{ White does this right away so that the knight does not have the option to go to d5. }
9... Nd5 10. Bxd5 exd5 11. dxc5
{ Black is strategically busted due to the weakness of the d5-pawn and d4-square. Moves like Nd2-b3 and Bc1-e3 will play themselves. }

It's a somewhat demanding task for Black to play this position since White easily has 10 sensible moves that all require precision from Black's end to meet, but when assuming Black plays the best moves, it's actually incredibly difficult to prove anything and I tried five different moves before I found something I was satisfied with. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted is one of Black's most solid defenses against 1.d4. It does really offer him many counter chances, and as such has never been wildly popular, but breaking it down is anything but straightforward, and a lot of strong guys have used it in recent years when they are looking to be as solid as possible and are quite happy to make a draw with Black. It took me a lot of effort to find a variation I liked, but I ultimately was satisfied with what I found. }
3. e3
{ White can also consider Ng1-f3, but this gives Black some annoying additional options such as a quick Bc8-g4 or even  3...a6  . This move strikes me as simpler. Black normally lets the pawn go with Ng8-f6 but he has tried some other things as well. }

Black is much worse thanks to his isolated pawn and I see no real hope for counterplay. I like this even more than 10.Nd4-b3, winning the d5-pawn, as at least then Black would have active pieces- now, White is the one with more active pieces, and Black has nothing to show for the long term weakness on d5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c5
{ The Tarrasch Defense phases in and out of popularity for a while, but now it is clearly out and I expect it to remain so for the years to come. Black accepts an isolated pawn as early as move 3, and I can't really imagine he can seriously fight for equality. Additionally, it is important to note that since White has not yet committed to placing his knight on c3, he completely avoids the Dubov Tarrasch that Erwin L'Ami recently published a course on. }
4. cxd5 exd5 5. g3
{ White has more aggressive options available, but I find putting the bishop on g2 to be a very easy and stress-free route to a pleasant edge. Black will very likely end up with an isolated queen pawn. A good rule of thumb is that he only wants to take on c5 once Black has moved the f8-bishop. }

{ This position is perhaps the most topical one in the entirety of 1.d4 openings. Broadly speaking, White should be better if he can develop his c1-bishop outside of the pawn chain and then play e2-e3 next without anything bad happening to him in the meantime, and if Black lets this happen, he usually ends up a bit worse. Black's main moves here are certainly c6, c5, Bb4, dxc4, and Be7. But, it is important to be ready for his side attempts as well. }
4... h6
{ This bizarre move has actually become semi-popular in 2020. I have no idea why. }
5. g3
{ Of White's many decent options, I like transposing into a Catalan the best. This is not normally a Catalan repertoire, but the move h7-h6 is almost completely useless in every major variation and the extra tempo gives White a very nice position. }
5... Bd6 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O
{ Now, White is ready for Nf3-d2 followed by e2-e4 next, with a very pleasant advantage. Black has to put his knight on an awkward square to prevent this from happening. }
7... Nc6 { A sad necessity. Black prevents Nf3-d2. } 8. a3
{ I quite like this subtle move. White is ready for Qd1-d3 next without running into Nc6-b4. Black is best advised not to less this happens. }
8... dxc4 9. Qa4
{ If White can take on c4 and consolidate the position, he will be much better thanks to the excellent g2 bishop, poorly placed c6-knight, and his superior central control. Black should be very direct to try to break down the center before this will happen. }
9... e5 10. Qxc4 exd4 11. Nxd4 Nxd4 12. Qxd4
{ This structure is always a bit uncomfortable for Black thanks to White's ability to set his central majority in motion, and the bishop on g2 exerts some annoying pressure on Black's queenside. The machines settle on a 0.2 advantage or so, but in practice, I think White's chances are higher than that. }

The knight on c6 is not great, not only is it in an uncomfortable pin but it also does not have great squares, making it vulnerable to a simple pile-up with moves like Be2-b5 and rooks to the c-file. Additionally, Black's kingside can become very vulnerable on the light squares thanks to the presence of opposite-colored bishops, which tends to favor the attacking player. And most importantly, Black has absolutely no counterplay. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Be7
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined with 4... Be7 is one of the most popular openings throughout the history of chess and has had the reputation of being the most solid of Black's defenses against 1. d4. It has been played in countless World Championship matches and by more or less every top player in history. Unsurprisingly it turned out to be very difficult to show any kind of advantage, but I am satisfied that I found a way to put Black under some pressure. }
5. Bf4 O-O { Black rarely plays anything else. } 6. e3
{ This is Black's first major decision point. c7-c5, Nb8-d7, and b7-b6 all have their merits, and White should be ready for each one. }
6... Nbd7
{ This has to be considered the main move. Black develops a new piece and is looking to break with c7-c5 next, hoping to entice White to lose a tempo with the f1-bishop. }
7. c5
{ I believe that taking all the space is White's most critical try to fight for an advantage. Black must try to break down the space advantage with b5-b6 at some point, but he does have to choose if he first wants to take the f4-bishop or not. }
7... c6
{ Playing without Nh5 has been the choice of many strong players more than once, but in my opinion, it is less critical and White has an idea to show a nice edge. }
8. h4

8... Ng4 9. Be2 Re8
{ White is not particularly well prepared to deal with the incoming e6-e5 break and I already would prefer Black. The point is that there will not be a weak pawn on c6. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4
{ The Ragozin has long been one of Black's most solid available options within the Queen's Gambit, enjoying just as much popularity among the elite in recent years as any of his other options in this position. I have played it myself several times, including scoring a big win over Alexander Onischuk in the penultimate round of the 2018 US Championship, setting me up for a successful fight for first place the following day. Unlike a lot of Black's other super solid defenses, this one offers him decent chances to imbalance the game and play for a win, making it a favorite of players of all levels. It took a lot of work to try to put it under any kind of pressure, but I am reasonably satisfied with what I found. }
5. cxd5
{ Once upon a time, this was the main move by a wide margin. Nowadays White has often looked in other directions, but I think that for once, the old move actually has some merit. }
5... exd5 6. Bg5
{ Now, if White can play e2-e3, Bf1-d3, and O-O, he will be pleasantly better. Black has a few ways to try to stop this from happening. Broadly speaking, he can either try to look for direct counterplay in some way, or he can try to get his bishop to f5 before White can get his own bishop to d3. In general, Black should be able to pull off the latter plan, but when he does, he can often run into concrete problems connected with Qd1-b3. }
6... Nbd7
{ This is known as the Westphalia variation. It has since taken a backseat to the modern mainline with   6...h6  , but it certainly remains a tough nut to crack. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4
{ The Ragozin has long been one of Black's most solid available options within the Queen's Gambit, enjoying just as much popularity among the elite in recent years as any of his other options in this position. I have played it myself several times, including scoring a big win over Alexander Onischuk in the penultimate round of the 2018 US Championship, setting me up for a successful fight for first place the following day. Unlike a lot of Black's other super solid defenses, this one offers him decent chances to imbalance the game and play for a win, making it a favorite of players of all levels. It took a lot of work to try to put it under any kind of pressure, but I am reasonably satisfied with what I found. }
5. cxd5
{ Once upon a time, this was the main move by a wide margin. Nowadays White has often looked in other directions, but I think that for once, the old move actually has some merit. }
5... exd5 6. Bg5
{ Now, if White can play e2-e3, Bf1-d3, and O-O, he will be pleasantly better. Black has a few ways to try to stop this from happening. Broadly speaking, he can either try to look for direct counterplay in some way, or he can try to get his bishop to f5 before White can get his own bishop to d3. In general, Black should be able to pull off the latter plan, but when he does, he can often run into concrete problems connected with Qd1-b3. }
6... Nbd7
{ This is known as the Westphalia variation. It has since taken a backseat to the modern mainline with   6...h6  , but it certainly remains a tough nut to crack. }
7. Qc2
{ This rare move has not enjoyed much popularity in the last five years, but I find it to be a nice alternative to   7.e3  , which allows for a quick h6/g5/Ne4 expansion. White is ready for e2-e3 next. }
7... c5
{ Historically, this has been the main move by far, but it doesn't impress me much. As usual, when Black plays c7-c5, White should take it if he can. }
8. dxc5 Nxc5 9. a3 { Black is immediately forced into an unpleasant endgame. }
9... Bxc3+ 10. Qxc3 Nce4 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Qxf6 Nxf6 13. e3
{ White is pleasantly better due to the weakness of the d5-pawn and can easily finish development with Bf1-d3, Nf3-d4, f2-f3, and Ke1-f2. }

{ The Ragozin has long been one of Black's most solid available options within the Queen's Gambit, enjoying just as much popularity among the elite in recent years as any of his other options in this position. I have played it myself several times, including scoring a big win over Alexander Onischuk in the penultimate round of the 2018 US Championship, setting me up for a successful fight for first place the following day. Unlike a lot of Black's other super solid defenses, this one offers him decent chances to imbalance the game and play for a win, making it a favorite of players of all levels. It took a lot of work to try to put it under any kind of pressure, but I am reasonably satisfied with what I found. }
5. cxd5
{ Once upon a time, this was the main move by a wide margin. Nowadays White has often looked in other directions, but I think that for once, the old move actually has some merit. }
5... exd5 6. Bg5
{ Now, if White can play e2-e3, Bf1-d3, and O-O, he will be pleasantly better. Black has a few ways to try to stop this from happening. Broadly speaking, he can either try to look for direct counterplay in some way, or he can try to get his bishop to f5 before White can get his own bishop to d3. In general, Black should be able to pull off the latter plan, but when he does, he can often run into concrete problems connected with Qd1-b3. }
6... Nbd7
{ This is known as the Westphalia variation. It has since taken a backseat to the modern mainline with   6...h6  , but it certainly remains a tough nut to crack. }
7. Qc2
{ This rare move has not enjoyed much popularity in the last five years, but I find it to be a nice alternative to   7.e3  , which allows for a quick h6/g5/Ne4 expansion. White is ready for e2-e3 next. }

8. Bh4 c5

9. e3
{ Now, Black has to be reasonably direct. White was not able to take on c5 on the previous move, but sooner or later he may be able to. }
9... Qa5
{ This is a very important move. Black threatens Nf6-e4, which forces White to develop his bishop to d3 where it will be vulnerable to the c5-c4 advance. }
10. Bd3 c4
{ Now c5-c4 has come with tempo. The whole fight will revolve around the e4-square. }
11. Bf5 O-O 12. O-O Re8 13. a4
{ White stops Black from expanding with b7-b5, and Black does not have a great plan. This position would be quite fine for him if the bishop were back on g5 and the pawn back on h7, as then he would be able to push g7-g6, kicking the all-important f5 bishop off of its post, and conquer the e4-square. As is, g7-g6 cannot happen, and Black can barely move. Slowly but surely White can play moves like Nf3-d2 and Rf1-e1, eventually looking for the e3-e4 break. }

{ The Ragozin has long been one of Black's most solid available options within the Queen's Gambit, enjoying just as much popularity among the elite in recent years as any of his other options in this position. I have played it myself several times, including scoring a big win over Alexander Onischuk in the penultimate round of the 2018 US Championship, setting me up for a successful fight for first place the following day. Unlike a lot of Black's other super solid defenses, this one offers him decent chances to imbalance the game and play for a win, making it a favorite of players of all levels. It took a lot of work to try to put it under any kind of pressure, but I am reasonably satisfied with what I found. }

{ Now, if White can play e2-e3, Bf1-d3, and O-O, he will be pleasantly better. Black has a few ways to try to stop this from happening. Broadly speaking, he can either try to look for direct counterplay in some way, or he can try to get his bishop to f5 before White can get his own bishop to d3. In general, Black should be able to pull off the latter plan, but when he does, he can often run into concrete problems connected with Qd1-b3. }

{ The Semi-Tarrasch is a very solid opening that goes in and out of fashion. In general, it is extremely difficult to show any objective advantage, and the best players in the world can be notoriously difficult to crack. But, it also strikes me as a little impractical as a lot of the positions seem easier for White to play. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 cxd4 8. cxd4 Bb4+
{ Of course this is the move. Black trades off a pair of minor pieces since he has less space. }
9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Bc4
{ Nowadays, almost every game continues with Nb8-d7, which is undoubtedly the best move, though it has to be mentioned that Nb8-c6 enjoyed some popularity once upon a time. }
11... Nc6
{ This used to be the main move for Black, but modern practice frowns upon it. White's main break that he is hoping to accomplish is d4-d5, and the knight on c6 will lose time. White's weaker central pawn is on e4, not d4, and the knight on c6 not only is a long way from attacking it, but it will also get in the way of a bishop on b7. }
12. O-O b6 13. Rad1 Bb7 14. Rfe1
{ Much like we see in the mainline, White's rooks belong in the center. d4-d5 is coming reasonably soon. }
14... Na5
{ This is Black's best move order. He avoids the Bc4-e2 option due to the hanging e4-pawn. }
15. Bd3 Rc8 16. Qe2
{ I like highlighting the misplaced knight on a5, not letting it regroup via c4 and d6. }
16... Qe7 17. h4
{ I like this patient attacking move. White anticipates needing the g5-square for his knight, and he can also go h4-h5 at any moment. }
17... Rfd8
{ This was Black's choice in the only game to reach this position, but it fails to impress. White gets a nice edge with a typical pawn sacrifice. }
18. d5 exd5 19. e5
{ White is already threatening a greek gift on h7, can always meet g7-g6 with h4-h5, and h7-h6 with Nf3-d4-f5. A position like this one would be much less clear if Black's misplaced knight on a5 stood on d7 instead- with Nd7-f8 coming, he would be able to secure his kingside. As is, he should get mated. Additionally, it has to be pointed out that the rook on d8 is now misplaced as it is quite passive and would rather be back on f8 to help get a move like f7-f5 through, blunting the kingside assault to some degree. }

I think White's best coordination is to play Re1-e3 and Qd2-e2, and if he can safely pull this off, he will be better. Black's queenside pawns will be stuck, and White will have secured the e4-pawn as well as the c2 and c3 squares, severely limiting any hope for queenside counterplay. Additionally, the pieces will be very well placed for a d4-d5 sacrifice with e5-e6 to follow. Black should take care not to let this happen. Alternatively, if White can play d4-d5 and get his pawn all the way to d6 without any hiccups along the way, he will be much better. Black must be careful to prevent this as well. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 c5
{ The Semi-Tarrasch is a very solid opening that goes in and out of fashion. In general, it is extremely difficult to show any objective advantage, and the best players in the world can be notoriously difficult to crack. But, it also strikes me as a little impractical as a lot of the positions seem easier for White to play. }

{ Nowadays, almost every game continues with Nb8-d7, which is undoubtedly the best move, though it has to be mentioned that Nb8-c6 enjoyed some popularity once upon a time. }
11... Nd7 12. O-O b6
{ This is a better moment to play b7-b6 as Black need not fear d4-d5 just yet. I consider this the starting position of the modern Semi-Tarrasch. }
13. Rad1 Bb7 14. Rfe1 Rc8 { This is played approximately 100% of the time. }
15. Bb3
{ Now, Black has a few options. It's very important to understand what White is trying to accomplish, and how Black can try to stop him. I think White's best coordination is to play Re1-e3 and Qd2-e2, and if he can safely pull this off, he will be better. Black's queenside pawns will be stuck, and White will have secured the e4-pawn as well as the c2 and c3 squares, severely limiting any hope for queenside counterplay. Additionally, the pieces will be very well placed for a d4-d5 sacrifice with e5-e6 to follow. Black should take care not to let this happen. Alternatively, if White can play d4-d5 and get his pawn all the way to d6 without any hiccups along the way, he will be much better. Black must be careful to prevent this as well. }

{ At long last, I'm ready to give an assessment. The machines swear this position is equal, shooting an endless string of zeroes at me. I won't argue that in a higher sense this is probably true, but in practice, the position feels much more comfortable from the Whiteside. Black's king will be under constant pressure for the rest of the game, I can't really imagine his extra pawn ever posing much of a danger, and he is complete without counterplay and with passive pieces. Some pawns are not worth taking. White's plan will be f2-f3 to dominate the f6 knight, bring the bishop back to c2, and then h4-h5 to undermine the g6 pawn and fight for the f5 square. Regardless of objective equality, I can't imagine any human wanting to play such a position for Black. }

We will see that in the mainline, White ends up playing Bf1-e2 and then Be2-d3 later, and here he got there in one move. So, White is basically two tempi up on a normal position and can look for a typical development scheme with Qd1-c2, Ra1-d1, and eventually e2-e4. He looks pleasantly better to me. }

Finally, it is important to note that Black is enormously hindered by the a7-a6 advance.

White should not fear being a pawn down as Black can't do much with it, and should rarely take back on d4 as this would allow Black's pieces to spring to life with Nd7-e5. Finally, it is important to note that Black is enormously hindered by the a7-a6 advance.

Even with all that in mind. I still prefer White. He puts his knight on b6 next, and if Black ever takes it, f4-f5, e4-e5, and f5-f6 comes very, very fast. }

I claimed that the Semi-Slav is Black's best defense against 1.d4, so it was not too surprising to me that trying to make any headway against it from the Whiteside turned out to be a massive challenge. }
5. e3 Nbd7
{ This is Black's main move, and the one I recommended when covering the same position from the opposite side of the board. }
6. Be2
{ I quite like this quiet development of the f1-bishop. Normally, it goes to   6.Bd3  Instead, but by putting it on  6.Be2  , White will not be forced to immediately recapture the pawn should Black choose to take on  6.--  ...dxc4  . }
6... Bd6
{ This move is the most consistent with Black's normal development scheme in the Semi-Slav. }
7. O-O O-O 8. b3
{ Black probably should go for   8...b6  here. Nothing else looks too appealing. }
8... b6 9. Bb2 { Transposes to the mainline. } 9... Bb7
{ Now if White were to continue with   10.Qc2  , which the computer rates as best, we would be transposed into a major mainline of the Semi-Slav. I think I showed comfortable equality for Black in my course, and I would prefer another way. }
10. Bd3
{ Obviously White is not thrilled about losing a tempo to play this move, but it was a necessary loss as if he had placed the bishop on d3 in one move,   10...e5  would have come at a moment when White would not have been well equipped to deal with it. This position has been reached a lot of times with White to move @@StartBracket@@Black will have had to have played badly for that to happen of course@@EndBracket@@ when he is clearly better, but even a tempo down I think he has chances to fight for an edge. In general, White's best plan is to place a rook on the d-file and then fight for e3-e4. Normally, he would do this with Qd1-c2 and Rad1, but I quite like leaving the queen on d1 and going for Ra1-c1-c2-d2. The queen can be a bit of a target on c2 once the c-file opens. Some key points. First off, it is absolutely critical to not ever let Black play  10...dxc4  and then be able to comfortably meet  11.bxc4  with  11...c5  . You need to always be ready with d4-d5 in response. Similarly, White really does not want to allow Black to play c7-c5 and then take back with the knight on d5. Both of these goals can be accomplished with accurate play. }
10... Re8
{ This has historically been Black's most common move, and it makes perfect sense. In some cases,   10...e5  could come, and the rook seems quite useful here. }
11. Re1 Rc8
{ Another natural move. Black puts his other rook on a file that could open shortly. As I wrote in my Semi-Slav course, Black's rooks generally want to follow White's, and here he anticipates   12.Rc1  coming next. I ended my coverage here and claimed Black is fine and can think about  12...c5  next. In general, I still think this is more or less correct and I stand by that analysis, but even if Black is objectively fine, I think Whiteside is still a little more comfortable in human play and he can pose some challenges with the right plan. }
12. Rc1
{ White is ready for his plan of Rc1-c2-d2. None of Black's breaks are particularly enticing. }
12... c5 13. cxd5
{ A position like this one highlights why it's not necessarily such a bad thing to leave the queen at home on d1. If she were on the c-file here, White would be very vulnerable to various tactics. }

In general, White's best plan is to place a rook on the d-file and then fight for e3-e4. Normally, he would do this with Qd1-c2 and Rad1, but I quite like leaving the queen on d1 and going for Ra1-c1-c2-d2. The queen can be a bit of a target on c2 once the c-file opens. Some key points. First off, it is absolutely critical to not ever let Black play  10...dxc4  and then be able to comfortably meet  11.bxc4  with  11...c5  . You need to always be ready with d4-d5 in response. Similarly, White really does not want to allow Black to play c7-c5 and then take back with the knight on d5. Both of these goals can be accomplished with accurate play. }

I ended my coverage here and claimed Black is fine and can think about  12...c5  next. In general, I still think this is more or less correct and I stand by that analysis, but even if Black is objectively fine, I think Whiteside is still a little more comfortable in human play and he can pose some challenges with the right plan. }

11. Re1 Rc8
{ Another natural move. Black puts his other rook on a file that could open shortly. As I wrote in my Semi-Slav course, Black's rooks generally want to follow White's, and here he anticipates   12.Rc1  coming next. I ended my coverage here and claimed Black is fine and can think about  12...c5  next. In general, I still think this is more or less correct and I stand by that analysis, but even if Black is objectively fine, I think Whiteside is still a little more comfortable in human play and he can pose some challenges with the right plan. }
12. Rc1
{ White is ready for his plan of Rc1-c2-d2. None of Black's breaks are particularly enticing. }
12... h6
{ Given that Black cannot comfortably break with e6-e5, c6, c5, or d5xc5 followed by c6-c5, the best thing he can do is make a waiting move and ask White to show his big idea. After all, White has made no major threats yet, and h7-h6 is actually a bit clever. Black could potentially consider taking on   13.--  ...dxc4  next and meeting  14.bxc4  with  14...c5  , taking advantage of the h7-pawn no longer being hanging. }
13. Rc2
{ White is looking for Rc2-d2 next and then   13...--  14.e4  to follow. The rook will prove very useful on the d-file. It's hard to find a useful waiting move and I suspect Black would play c6-c5 here, reaching the typical hanging pawns position. }
13... c5 14. cxd5 exd5 15. Ne2
{ White's knight will go to g3 next, as we have seen in a lot of similar lines where Black has pushed for c6-c5. In general, I think this is a better version of the hanging pawns positions for White than he was getting in the Qc2 lines I showed in the Semi-Slav course, but still, the advantage is admittedly pretty meager and Black is more or less okay. This is a pretty normal conclusion to reach when analyzing what appears to be the best moves for both sides in a mainline opening- White ends up a touch more comfortable and any human would certainly take the Whiteside, but in a world of higher truths, it really is not that much. Unsatisfying as this may seem, both sides more or less achieved their goal when playing a mainline opening. }

{ 20.Ra2  I would have seriously considered this move, for two reasons. First off, it allows White to take back with the c-pawn on d4, and secondly, the rook will be very good on b2. }
20... Nf6 21. Bf3
{ 21.f3  This looks much more natural to me, dominating the knight on f6. White can consider Be2-d3 next, fighting for the b1-square so his rooks can make trouble on the b-file. }
21... Ke7 22. h5 Kd6 23. Ra3 cxd4
{ Karjakin could have taken at any moment, but it was only now that he decided to pull the trigger.   23...c4  The machine recommends locking the position like this, but I find this structure tends to be worse for Black if he did not get b7-b5 in. Indeed, after something like  24.Rha1!  White will slowly but surely inch his rooks to the b-file, cuasing Black a lot of trouble, and he faces no counterplay. }
24. exd4 Re8 25. Nf1
{ Now that the e3-pawn is gone, Grischuk maneuvers the knight to to its ideal post. It's important to note that this pawn structure normally would not promise much for White thanks to the weakness of the backward c3-pawn, but the lack of queens means that the king on d2 defends it very nicely without fear of harassment. }

Black should probably play this move, aiming to play c5-c4 next when he will be ready with b6-b5 to follow. The computer claims he is equalizing here, and I more or less agree. After all, I did offer a Semi-Slav repertoire for Black advocating this kind of position.

{ Funnily enough, despite the equal material and opposite colored bishops, Black is dead lost just a few moves into the endgame. White will anchor the bishop on d6 and the knight on d4, and then Black's weaknesses will become apparent. }

21. Rec1
{ Black's position is passive but still looks reasonably solid. That is, until Riazantsev showed the right maneuvre. }
21... Be6 22. Ra3
{ How on earth does Black plan on dealing with Rb3 coming next? Deep into the endgame, the lack of activity he experiences from this opening haunts him. }
22... Nd7 23. Bd6 Ra6 { Now, White should be patient. } 24. Rcc3
{ Reparing for Ra3-b3 next.   24.Rb3?  Rxd6!  Oops. } 24... Nf8 25. Rab3 Bd7

{ This structure can be very dangerous for Black, as Gelfand demonstrates. }
8... Nb6 9. Bb3 Bd6 10. g3 Bd7
{ 10...c6  Black could have turtled up with c6 to make sure that he prevents all the breaks at all costs, but the bishop on c8 is a sad sight. After  11.O-O  O-O  12.Qc2  White is ready to centralize his rooks, and Black has absolutely no active moves, ever. Eventually, h2-h4 and Nf3-g5 will start to make problems on the kingside. }
11. O-O O-O 12. Qd3 Bc6 13. Rad1
{ White is just about ready for f4-f5 to come, blasting open a line towards Black's kingside. Adams understandably did not want this to happen. }
13... Qf6 14. Ng5 g6
{ 14...Qf5!  According to the machine, this was the way. It looks like a very scary move as after  15.Qe2  Black is hard pressed to deal with Bb3-c2, but after  15...Qa5!  The computer just barely manages to hang on. White can execute one of his key breaks though.  16.d5!?  exd5  17.Qh5  h6  18.Nxd5!  I can easily imagine Adams taking one look at this position and telling himself 'No way.' It looks like Black should be crushed on the kingside in just a couple of moves.  18...Nxd5  19.Rxd5  Bxd5  20.Nxf7  c6!  The machine only sees a perpetual for White. }
15. Nge4 Qf5 { 15...Bxe4  16.Nxe4  d5 is coming next all the same. } 16. d5
{ Adams understandably did not want to blunt his own light squared bishop with c7-c6 early on, but now White gets through one of his big breaks. He still has a lead in development thanks to Black spending a lot of time on Nf6-d5-xf4, and that persists deep into the endgame. }
16... exd5 17. Nxd5 Nxd5 18. Bxd5 Bxd5 19. Qxd5 Qxd5 20. Rxd5 Rfd8 21. Rc1
{ Black is somewhat paralyzed. The bishop on d6 is vulnerable, but can't move. }
21... Rac8 22. Rc3 Be7 23. Rxd8+ Bxd8 24. f5
{ Using a pretty tactic, White gains more space on the kingside. Black's position is dreadfully passive. }
24... Kg7
{ 24...c6  This offered more saving chances, but I still would not want to be Black after  25.f6 }
25. Nd6 { Well spotted. } 25... Rb8 26. Ne8+ Kf8 27. fxg6
{ A clever in-between move. } 27... hxg6
{ 27...Kxe8?  28.g7  White makes a queen. } 28. Nxc7
{ The dust has settled, and White is a pawn up. His advantage in activity that was gained early on has been converted into something tangible, and Gelfand did manage to convert the resulting endgame. }
28... Bf6 29. Rb3 Be5 30. Nd5 b6 31. Nb4 Rc8 32. Nd3
{ The knight keeps everything defended, and a rook coming to c2 will be surprisingly useless as White brings his king to d1. }

39... Rd7
{ 39...h4!  40.gxh4  Rc4!  Would have given Black much better saving chances. }
