[Result "*"]

1. e4
{ Why 1.e4? At master level, 1.e4 is the most popular first move. White controls the center, opens the diagonal for his light-squared bishop  (bringing himself one step closer to castling)  , and prepares to start developing. 1.e4 has been the favorite of many world champions and amateurs alike. One key aspect of 1.e4 compared to other popular first moves such as 1.d4 is that the resulting positions tend to be a bit more open, and there are fewer transpositions to other openings. }

1. e4 e5
{ 1...e5 is the most classical way for Black to play, controlling the center and opening up lines for his pieces. Since Black is down a tempo in an otherwise symmetrical position, White will be able to fight for the initiative rather easily. }
2. Nf3
{ White attacks the e5-pawn and brings one of his kingside minor pieces into play. }
2... Nf6
{ 2...♘f6, known as the Petroff Defense, is one of the most solid choices for Black. It was popularized by Kramnik as a drawing weapon, a reputation that it has maintained through the years. While at the super-GM level the Petroff might be considered drawish, at lower levels it can be quite fun to play as White because Black has very little counterplay and is usually focused on trying to limit White's advantage. }
3. Nxe5
{ White should not be afraid to snatch the e5-pawn since ...♕e7 can always be met by d4. }
3... d6
{ Black would be ill-advised to try to win back the pawn immediately; 3...♘xe4 is a rare trap line that will be explored in the theory chapter. 3...d6 kicks back the White knight in preparation for taking on e4. }
4. Nf3 { White drops back with his knight. } 4... Nxe4
{ Black wins back the pawn. } 5. d4
{ White grabs his share of the center and prepares to start developing his pieces.   5.Nc3  Nxc3  6.dxc3  is an interesting alternative. White accepts doubled c-pawns in exchange for faster development. White usually castles queenside and tries to play for the initiative. }
5... d5
{ 5...Be7  6.Bd3  Nf6  would leave Black in a very uncomfortable situation due to White's space advantage. }
6. Bd3
{ White develops his light-squared bishop in preparation for castling. White's setup will usually involve O-O, c4, and ♘c3. }

3... f5
{ 3...f5  (the Schliemann Gambit)  is a rather common club player's weapon, and it does indeed contain quite a bit of venom. However, with correct play, White can force an advantage. }
4. Nc3
{ White should not play 4.exf5 because Black gets significant activity after 4...e4. Instead, White should focus on his development. The resulting positions tend to be quite sharp and therefore involve very concrete play which is explored in the theory chapter. }

5. d4
{ White forcefully opens the position in order to exploit Black's early pawn grab. }
5... Nd6
{ The Black knight drops back to d6, hitting the bishop on b5. 5...exd4 would be too risky with Black's king still in the center: 6.♖e1 wins material by force. }
6. Bxc6 { White does not want to lose time retreating his bishop. } 6... dxc6
{ 6...bxc6 hinders Black's development, so recapturing with the d-pawn is correct. }
7. dxe5 { White regains the pawn and opens the d-file. } 7... Nf5
{ Black's knight steps aside. f5 is the best square for the knight because Black discourages White from keeping the queens on the board with ♕e2 in view of ...♘d4. }
8. Qxd8+
{ White enters an endgame in which Black has the bishop pair in exchange for his inferior pawn structure. White's plan is to create a passed pawn on the kingside using his pawn majority. If White is able to trade all of his pieces and create a kingside passed pawn, he is likely to win the game. }

Rb8
{ 7...Bb7  Black commits his bishop to the long diagonal before White plays  d4.  8.d3!  Black's bishop is passive on  b7  , hitting White's central pawn wall. White has easy development with  Bg5  and Nc3-d5 with a more comfortable position. }
8. axb5 { White opens the a-file. } 8... axb5 9. c3
{ White aims to gain space in the center with 9.d4. One of the main drawbacks of the Archangelsk is that Bc5 can be hit with tempo when white plays his typical plan of c3-d4.

6. d4
{ It is important to remember that in almost all cases, if Black takes on e4 before castling, White should try to open up the position with the central strike d2-d4. In this position, Black usually follows up with 6...b5 followed by 7...d5, but there are some interesting sideline continuations as well. As stated earlier, these positions are much easier to play as White since Black is playing risky chess by grabbing material before castling. }

Black is well developed, but Nc6  (restricted by c3 and blocking Black's c pawn)  and Be7  (trapped inside Black's pawn chain)  are passively placed. Therefore, Black is likely to spend some time improving those pieces  (...Na5 or ...Nb8-Nd7, ...Re8 with ...Bf8 and ...g6 with ...Bg7 are common ideas)  , which gives White enough time to finish his development and play d2-d4. White usually aims to exploit his superior center  (it will be superior after White plays d2-d4)  and space advantage by fighting for the initiative. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5
{ The Schliemann gambit. Black's positional idea is to trade his f-pawn for White's center-pawn, giving him a central pawn majority. The tactical justification of 3...f5 is that 4.exf5 ?! gives Black excellent piece activity after 4...e4. The drawback of 3...f5 is Black provokes the opening of the position when he is behind on development. }
4. Nc3
{ White prepares for the opening of the position by rapidly developing his pieces.   4.exf5 ?!  e4   4.Bxc6  dxc6  5.Nxe5 ?!  Qd4 !  6.Qh5+ ?  g6  7.Nxg6  hxg6  and  Qd4  protects  Rh8. }
4... fxe4
{ The most critical move. White was threatening to take on f5 due to his control of the e4 square. Black obtains a 2 vs. 1 central pawn majority at the cost of opening the position, which should favor White due to his lead in development. }
5. Nxe4 d5
{ The most aggressive move. Black occupies the center and provokes immediate complications.   5...Nf6  is safer but after  6.Qe2  White still has a lead in development and continue opening the center with  d4. }
6. Nxe5
{ White sacrifices a piece, but will win material back soon by playing Nxc6.   6.Ng3  Bg4  allows Black to keep his pawn center. }
6... dxe4 7. Nxc6
{ Black's main 2 responses are 7...Qg5 and 7...Qd5  (counter-attacking rather than immediately recapturing)  because 7...bxc6 allows White to win at least the exchange and a pawn after 8.Bxc6+. }
7... Qg5
{ White is ahead a pawn, but his b5-bishop, c6-knight, and g2-pawn are all hanging. With accurate play, White can consolidate his material advantage.   7...bxc6  8.Bxc6+  Bd7  9.Qh5+  Ke7  10.Qe5+  Be6  11.Bxa8   7...Qd5  8.c4  Qd6  9.Nxa7+  Bd7  10.Bxd7+  Qxd7  11.Qh5+  g6  12.Qe5+  Kf7  13.Nb5 }

8... Nf6 { Preventing Qh5+   8...Qxg2  9.Qh5+ } 9. f4
{ White sacrifices a pawn in order to prevent ...Qxg2 and deflect Black's queen from controlling the b5 square. }
9... Qxf4 { 9...Qh4+  10.g3 } 10. Nxa7+
{ White wins a pawn and provokes trades.   10.Ne5+  c6  11.d4  Qh4+  12.g3  followed by  Bc4  ,  Bg5  , and  O-O-O  is a safer route to an opening advantage. }
10... Bd7 { 10...Kd8  11.Nxc8 } 11. Bxd7+
{ White is ahead a pawn and it is unclear where Black's compensation lies. Black is forced to either give up the right to castle with ...Kxd7  (allowing Qb5+)  or retreat with ...Nxd7  (allowing White to consolidate with d4 and Nb5)  . }
11... Nxd7
{ Black now has no compensation for his sacrificed pawn.   11...Kxd7  offered Black some chances for compensation in the form of piece activity, though the complications starting with  12.Qb5+  favor White. If you don't like these complications, I recommend that you deviate from this game with  10.Ne5. }
12. d4 Qf5 13. Nb5
{ White has a won position due to his extra pawn and more active pieces. }

{ The downside of these trades is that they improved White's piece activity. }

{ Not the most accurate move, as White is not actually threatening to take on c7   Nxc7  ...Rc8  (Qxc7 ...Qxc7 Nxc7 ...Rc8 followed by ...Rxc2)  . Black could have ignored White's threat and continued with 11...a6 or even 11...d5.   11.Bf4!  followed by  Rad1  and  Nc3  would give White a harmonious position. }
11... c6
{ Black didn't realize that White's 'threat' did not need to be defended. 11...c6 weakens the d6 pawn. }

19. Rxd1 Bxe5
{ It might seem like Black has escaped the worst because material is now equal, but White has a stunning combination. }

O-O 9. h3 Re8
{ Black makes a flexible move that is useful in almost all of the Closed Ruy Lopez systems. Black aims to redevelop his kingside bishop  (...Bf8, ...g6, ...Bg7)  . }
10. d4 Bb7
{ Black has transposed into the Zaitsev Variation, which is usually reached by the 9...Bb7 move order. Black is aiming for pressure on the e4 pawn. The Zaitsev is similar to the Breyer but allows both sides additional options: Black has the option of playing ...Na5 instead of ...Nb8, but if White chooses to play d4-d5 before Nc6 moves out of the way, White gains a tempo. }
11. Nbd2 Bf8
{ One of the main benefits of the Zaitsev is that it interrupts White's thematic knight maneuver Nbd2-f1-g3. }
12. d5
{ 12.Nf1  loses a pawn to  12...exd4  followed by  ...Nxe4.  White prevents Black from opening the e-file in order to continue with his knight maneuver. White also gains a tempo on Nc6. }
12... Nb8
{ 12...Na5  13.Bc2  followed by  14.b4  forces Black to play  ...Nc4.  After  Nxc4  and  ...bxc4  , Black's  c4  pawn would be very weak and can be targeted. }
13. Nf1
{ This pawn structure is thematic in the Zaitsev. Black's main attempt to fight for counterplay is his pawn break ...c6. After dxc6 ...Bxc6, Black's d5 square is weak but Black can try to advance ...d5 to free his pieces. The main fight in this variation of the Zaitsev revolves around the d5 square. }
13... Nbd7 14. N3h2
{ White starts a thematic and deep strategic plan. White's plan is to trade Nh2 and Bc1 for both of Black's knights  (Bg5-xf6, Ng4-xf6+)  . This helps control the d5 square because Black's knights are often one of Black's main fighters for d5. Then, after Black plays ...c6  (Black has no other method of obtaining counterplay. If Black doesn't play ...c6, White can fight for a kingside attack and/or try to create weaknesses on the queenside)  , White will try to exchange light squared bishops on d5, leaving him with a good knight  (which has the d5 outpost)  against Black's passive dark-squared bishop. If this plan is completed without Black getting compensation or counterplay, White's position will be strategically won. A similar plan  (trading all of the minor pieces except for White's good knight with the d5 outpost against Black's passive dark-squared bishop which is restricted by it's pawn structure)  is attempted in some variations of the Najdorf because the pawn structure with ...c6 dxc6 is similar to the pawn structure Black has in the Najdorf when he plays ...e5. }
14... Nc5
{ 14...h6  is sometimes employed, preventing  Bg5.  The downside of  ...h6  is that it is slow. This gives White enough time to fight for a kingside initiative with  15.Ng4  and will be dealt with in the theory chapter. }
15. Bc2 c6 { Black challenges White's center. } 16. b4
{ White gains a tempo forcing Nc5 to retreat before taking on c6. If White took on c6 first, Black would have more pressure on White's e4 pawn. }

{ White creates the pawn structure that he was preparing for with his 14th move. }
17... Bxc6 18. Bg5 h6 19. Bxf6 Nxf6 20. Ng4 Nxg4 21. Qxg4
{ White has completed phase 1 of his plan: trade Bc1 and Nh2 for Black's knights. }
21... Bd7
{ 21...d5  opens the center, but in White's favor:  22.exd5  Qxd5  23.Bb3  gives White the initiative. White was more prepared for the opening of the center because his pieces were placed more aggressively.  (Michael Adams vs. Ruslan Ponomariov 2002) }
22. Qf3 Rc8 23. Bb3 { White continues fighting for the d5 square. } 23... Be6
24. Rec1
{ Ne3 was temporarily prevented due to ...Rxc3, so White takes a moment to defend his c3 pawn.   24.Qd3  also prepares  Ne3 }
24... Be7 25. Rc2 { White prepares to play Rad1. } 25... a5 26. Qd3
{ White prepares to meet ...a4 with Bd5. If Black takes on d5, White can take back with his queen, maintaining the d5 outpost. If White wins the d5-square without making a concession, Black will have no compensation for White's superior minor piece, giving White a strategically won position. }
26... Bxb3
{ Black starts a combination to either win a pawn or be able to free his position with ...d5. If he did not go for this, he would be very passive and d5 would be a clear weakness. }
27. axb3 axb4 28. Ne3
{ White sacrifices a pawn to achieve his goal: a powerful knight on d5 against Black's inactive dark-squared bishop.   28.cxb4  Rxc2 !  Black deflects White's queen from defending the  d5  square.  29.Qxc2  d5 !  and Black has freed his position. }
28... bxc3 29. Rxc3 Rxc3 30. Qxc3 Bg5 31. Nd5
{ Black's extra pawn is blockaded, rendering it almost useless. White aims to use his superior piece activity and powerful knight to target Black's b5 pawn. If White wins Black's b5 pawn, Black will have no compensation for White's superior minor piece, giving White a strategically won position. }
31... Qd7 32. Ra6
{ White prepares to dominate the c-file with Rc6 or target Black's b6 pawn with Rb6. }
32... Rc8 { Black prevents Rc6. } 33. Qd3 Kh7 34. Kh2
{ Both sides take a moment to improve their king safety. } 34... Rc1 35. g3

37... Rc5 38. Ne3
{ White decided that he has strengthened his position enough. He is ready to provoke concrete action. }
38... Be7
{ 38...Rc6  allows  39.Qxb5.  Note that  Qxb5  would not work if White's king were still on the first rank due to  39...Rc1+.  If your opponent is helpless, it is often good to improve your position to the utmost before provoking complications. }
39. b4 { Black can't safely keep his material advantage. } 39... Rc8
{ 39...Rc7  40.Qd5  attacking Black's  f7  pawn  40...Bf8  41.Rb6 } 40. Rb6 g6
41. Qxb5
{ White's knight is far stronger than Black's bishop and White has an outside passed pawn. Black's d6 pawn is basically useless because it can be blockaded by Nd5. White's position is won. }
41... Qxb5 42. Rxb5 Bd8 43. Rb7 Kg7 44. Nd5 Rc4 45. Rd7
{ Black resigns. If Black had played on, he would have lost his d6 pawn and White's passed b-pawn would be too powerful for Black to hope for a draw. }

O-O 9. h3 Na5
{ Black opts for the Chigorin variation. 9...Na5 gains a tempo on Bb3 and prepares to gain space on the queenside with ...c5. }
10. Bc2
{ White should not give up the bishop pair by allowing ...Nxb3. White's light-squared bishop is very important in the Ruy Lopez. }
10... c5
{ Black gains space on the queenside. 10...c5 is the consistent follow up to 9...Na5. }
11. d4 { White gains space in the center. } 11... Qc7
{ Black usually delays taking on d4 until White plays Nbd2 in order to not allow White to play Nc3. }
12. Nbd2
{ An immediate   12.d5  is not optimal because White does not want to grant Black's knight access to the desirable c4-square.  12...Nc4  Black's knight can always drop back to b6 if attacked by b3. }
12... Nc6
{ Black immediately tries to bring his knight back into the game, but White has a simple response.   12...cxd4  13.cxd4  Nc6  is more popular nowdays. }
13. d5 { White gains space in the center. } 13... Na5
{ Black has lost 2 tempi and his queenside knight is still out of play. } 14.
b3
{ Since White is looking to attack on the kingside, it is in his interest to keep the queenside closed. After this move b3, White can meet ...c4 with b4 and ...b4 with c4, keeping the queenside closed. 14.b3 also prevents ...Nc4 after white plays 15.Nf1. This is an idea to remember. }
14... Bd7
{ Black does not want to take away the b7-square from from the knight. } 15.
Nf1 { White executes the typical knight maneuver to the kingside. } 15... Nb7
{ Black looks to transfer his knight to the kingside via ...Nb7-d8-f7. Black would theoretically like to drop his knight on c5, but since ...c4 can be met by b4, this is no more than a dream. }
16. Ng3 c4 17. b4
{ White makes sure to keep the queenside closed because he wants to focus his attacking efforts on the kingside. }
17... Rfc8
{ 17...a5  Black should try to open the queenside.  18.a3  axb4  19.cxb4  Black has a passed c pawn, but this is easily blockaded. If Black advances with ...c3 and ...Qc4, White can easily chase the queen away with Bd3 or Bb3, so Black's counterplay down the c file is essentially non-existent. }
18. Nf5
{ It is important to remember that in the Ruy Lopez, White should not be afraid to drop his knight into f5 because Black would be ill-advised to take it with his light-squared bishop. }
18... Bf8
{ 18...Bxf5  Black gives up his key bishop. Black's dark-squared bishop is a terrible piece.  19.exf5  White happily recaptures. Next, White can start pushing forward on the kingside with g2-g4-g5. The rapidly advancing kingside pawns combined with the bishop pair and the powerful d5-pawn will prove far too much for Black to handle. }
19. Nh2
{ White begins the typical maneuver Nf3-h2-g4. Nh2 also prepares Qf3 or Re3-g3 by removing the knight from the 3rd rank. }
19... a5 20. Re3
{ This rook lift is rather thematic because it performs both attacking and defensive duties. Re3 supports key queenside squares such as a3 and c3, as well as prepares to transfer over to the kingside where it will aid the attack against the Black king. Other attacking ideas include Ng4  (Qf3 first cuts off the rook)  and Qf3. }
20... axb4 { Black does his best to open up lines on the queenside. } 21. cxb4
Bxf5
{ This is a typical mistake. After exf5, White can easily pawn storm the kingside. However, Black was worse anyway, so giving White a few concrete pawn weaknesses may have been his only hope. }
22. exf5 c3 23. Ng4 { White completes the typical knight maneuver Nf3-h2-g4. }
23... Be7 24. Nxf6+
{ White trades off the f6-knight because it protected the e4-square. Now White can blockade using that square. }

{ White improves the position of his other rook so that it attacks the weakness on c3. At this point, there is little Black can do to prevent the loss of the c3-pawn. }
32... Qd7 33. Qf3 Be7 34. Re3 Bf6 35. Re4 Be7 36. g4
{ White switches gears and continues the attack on the kingside. Black cannot take on h4 because of the simple tactic g4-g5, and the Bishop on h4 is trapped. }

{ Up a pawn, White still has the bishop pair and initiative. } 38... Rbc8 39.

{ Black aims to win the bishop pair with ...Nxb3. There are several alternatives which will be discussed in the theory chapter. }
10. Nc3
{ ...Nc5 undefended the c3 square, so White can develop his queenside knight more actively than normal. White is now threatening to take the d5 pawn. }
10... Nxb3 11. cxb3
{ White wants to control the dark squares  (d4, c5)  . cxb3 opens the c-file, making it easier for White to fight for the c5 square. }

{ White prevents Black from pinning Nf3 with ...Bg4. } 13... O-O 14. Ne2
{ White prepares to trade dark-squared bishops with Bc5. This is important because Black's dark-squared bishop is the main defender of his weak dark squares, so if White traded it off, it will be easier for White to exploit Black's weaknesses. }
14... f6
{ Black's only way to generate counterplay is to open the position and fight for the initiative. If Black played slowly, White will trade dark-squared bishops with Bc5, trade knights with Ned4, and be left with a powerful knight against Black's passive bishop on e6. White would also have pressure down the c-file. This is similar to White's strategic goal in the Zaitsev, except that in the Zaitsev, Black's dark-squared bishop is his bad bishop  (restricted by Black's pawn structure)  and White's pressure is down the d-file instead of the c-file. }

15... Rxf6 16. Ned4 Nxd4 17. Bxd4

17... Rf5 18. Ne5 Qc8 { 18...Qd6  19.Rc6  wins material } 19. Nc6 Bd6
{ 19...Bg5  20.f4 !  wins material because  Bg5  is overloaded defending the  e7  square against  Ne7+  , forking Black's king and queen. }
20. Bc5 Qd7 21. Bxd6 cxd6 22. Nd4
{ White has completed his plan. He has traded all of the minor pieces except for his knight and Black's bishop. White's knight is powerfully placed on an outpost, Black's bishop is passive and restricted by Black's pawn structure. To add to this, Black has a weak pawn structure due to his double isolated d-pawns. }
22... Re5 23. Rc3 { White prepares Rg3. } 23... b4 24. Rg3 a5 25. Kh2

33... Qf8 34. Qg5 Qg7 35. f6 Qf8 36. Rc1 h6 37. Qd2 g5
{ 37...Re2  put up a tougher defense, though White should still win after  38.Qd3  followed by  Qa6.  White can target Black's weak queenside pawns and infiltrate on the c-file. }
38. Rc7 Re2 39. Qc1
{ White dominates the c-file and Black has too many weaknesses. The rest is a matter of technique. }

{ White's slight lead in development is enough for him to fight for the initiative. His plan is to castle followed by playing c4 and Nc3. }
6... Nc6
{ 6...Nc6 is the most flexible move. Black would like to pressure White's d4 pawn after White plays c4  (he can meet ...c4 with ...Nb4, preparing to take on c4 and blockade the newly made isolated pawn with ...Nbd5)  and Black has not committed if he is going to play a setup with ...Bg4 yet. Even if Black plays an early ...Bg4, he is likely to play ...Nc6 soon. }
7. O-O Be7
{ Black's main alternative is 7...Bg4 which often leads to very sharp positions after 8.c4. }
8. c4 Nb4 9. Be2 O-O 10. a3 Nc6 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. Nc3 Nxc3 13. bxc3
{ White has a superior center that can eventually advance  (c4 with d5)  . This gives White excellent prospects of fighting for the initiative. }
13... Bf5
{ The main move by far. Black rushes to finish his development before White's initiative  (fast development with c4 and d5)  becomes too strong.   13...Na5  controls  c4  , but is too passive. White can easily counter this control  (Ne5, Qa4)  (in order to prepare c4 if he needs to. White has plenty of time to finish his development)  (Re1, Rb1, Ne5, Be3 or Bf4)  (and advance his center with c4 and d5. Black has no counterplay.) }
14. c4 { White advances his center with tempo. } 14... Qd6
{ Black controls the e5 square in order to meet 15.d5 with 15...Ne5. Black's queen is less exposed than it would be if he had played Qe4. }
15. d5 Ne5
{ 15...Bf6  Black counterattacks against White's rook on  a1.  16.Ra2  White can still play  Nd4  next and rook lifts such as  Rd2  become possible. }
16. Nd4
{ White has a space advantage and the initiative. White is threatening to take Black's light-squared bishop and after it moves away, White can play a4 followed by Ba3  (If Black retreats with ...Bd7, Rb1 with Rb3 first becomes another powerful idea)  . }

This line is similar to a line in the Italian:  1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bc4  Bc5  4.c3  Nf6  5.d4  White gets a pawn center, but Black can fight it off due to White's bishop on  c4  being targettable by  ...d5.  5...exd4  6.cxd4  Bb4+  7.Bd2  Bxd2+  8.Nxd2  d5 !  with equal chances.  ...d5  would not have been good with White's light-squared bishop on  b5  because  ...d5  would not come with tempo and would pin  Nc6. }
5. O-O
{ White castles before playing d2-d4 in order to avoid ...Bb4+ and to try to bait Black into taking the e4 pawn. If Black doesn't take the e4 pawn, White gets a pawn center with d2-d4 for free.   This position can also be reached by the Berlin move order:  3...Nf6  4.0-0  Bc5  5.c3 }
5... O-O 6. d4 Bb6
{ Black takes advantage of White's hanging e4 pawn.   6...exd4  7.cxd4  gives White a powerful center. }
7. Bg5
{ 7.dxe5  Nxe4  White increases the tension and prepares to develop actively. White is now threatening to take the e5 pawn because Nf6 is pinned. }
7... h6
{ Attacking Bg5.   7...d6  leads to similar positions with the same plan for White after  8.a4  a5  9.Na3 }
8. Bh4 d6 9. a4
{ White gains space, prepares to play Na3, and threatens to play d5 followed by a5.   9.Qd3  isn't as strong because Black can safely play  9...g5!  followed by  ...Nh5.  The key difference is that unless White is threatening something  (after Black plays ...d6 to prevent e5 or Bxc6 followed by dxe5)  (, Black is able to safely play ...g5, because the Nxg5 sacrifice isn't as strong)  (Black has the time to play ...Kg7)  (. Since a4 threatens a5, Black still doesn't have time for ...g5.) }
9... a5
{ 9...exd4  10.Bxc6  dxc3  11.b4   9...a6  10.Bxc6  bxc6  11.dxe5  favors White due to his superior pawn structure. The difference between playing  Bxc6  followed by  dxe5  now instead of on the previous move is that Black is now unable to play  ...Ba6  and White can play  a5  (gaining space with tempo)  (.)   9...g5  10.Nxg5!  hxg5  11.Bxg5  gives White a decisive advantage because Black can't defend against the dual threats of  Bxc6  followed by  a5  and  Bxc6  followed by  dxe5  ,  Qxd8  , and  Bxf6. }
10. Na3 exd4
{ The only move which has been tested at master level. The main point is to prepare ...g5, since Bxc6 followed by dxe5  (and Qxd8 with Bxf6)  is no longer possible. }
11. Nc4
{ A novelty. White sacrifices material to play for the initiative. The advantages to 11.Nc4 is that White increases his piece activity and pressures Black's b6-bishop. Black will be forced to allow Nxb6 because retreating allows a superior version of Bxc6 and cxd4 due to White's increased control over the e5-square.   11.Bxc6  bxc6  12.cxd4  allows White to win back the d4-pawn, but this is a concession, and Black has excellent chances in the resulting position due to his bishop pair. Black can safely develop with  12...Bg4  or  12...Be6.  Even  12...g5  is playable. }
11... dxc3
{ 11...Ba7  12.Bxc6  bxc6  13.cxd4  White has the advantage due to his superior pawn center and initiative. Black has to watch out for many dangerous ideas including  e5  and  Nxa5. }
12. Nxb6 { White wins the bishop pair and damages Black's pawn structure. }
12... cxb6 { 12...cxb2  13.Nxa8  bxa1=Q  14.Qxa1 } 13. bxc3
{ White has excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn in the form of his bishop pair, superior piece activity, and Black's damaged pawn structure. Against non-forcing play, White can simply develop his pieces, secure his e4-pawn, and play for a kingside attack or pressure against Black's d6-pawn. Most of the sub-variations below are not forced, but are some examples of how White can successfully react to various Black moves.   13...g5  14.Nxg5   13...Re8  14.Nd2   14.Re1  is also strong.  14...g5  Otherwise White could play  f4.  15.Bg3  Black can take on  e4  , but White  (after exchanging knights)  (can obtain a powerful attack with Bd3 and f4.)   13...Na7  14.Bc4   13...Ne5  14.Qd4   13...Be6  14.Nd4   13...Bg4  14.h3  Bxf3  15.Qxf3 }

Black will have to be very careful to develop his pieces in such a way as to render g2-g4 harmless, and to halt White's general progress on the kingside. The second element is White's ability @@StartBracket@@or, once again, lack thereof@@EndBracket@@ to effect favorable piece trades.

{ The Keres Variation. Black aims to play ...a4 in order to gain queenside space and target White's bishop. If White plays d4, Black will often capture on d4 followed by ...Nb4. The downside of this approach is that Black's queenside pawns can be targetted and that Black isn't trying to solve the  (positionally urgent)  problem of redeveloping his 2 passive minor pieces  (Nc6 and Be7)  . The mainlines often involve Black redeveloping his dark-squared bishop  (...Re8, ...Bf8, ...g6, ...Bg7)  and c6-knight  (...Nb8-d7 or ...Na5 with ...c5)  in order to fight for activity. 9...a5 helps with neither of these and it isn't clear that this queenside space is even useful  (White can target Black's b5-pawn)  show why 9...a5 is not one of the mainlines. }

11. Bc2
{ White has a superior Closed Spanish position because Black has lost time on ...a5-a4, which wasn't as useful as solving Black's problem pieces  (Nc6 and Be7)  , which are still passive. Black's pawn storm leads nowhere and White is able to claim an advantage with the thematic Ruy Lopez maneuver Nbd2-f1-g3 with Be3  (due to his central space advantage)  or the attempted punishment by targetting Black's b5-pawn with Na3 and Bd3  (...b4 can be met with Nc4)  . The potential punishment with Na3 and Bd3 is probably stronger than the normal Nbd2-f1-g3 maneuver but students do not need to memorize past this point because both options are strong and Nbd2-f1-g3 is thematic. }

This pawn structure is favorable for White  (this pawn structure is very common in the Closed Spanish and often arises when Black plays ...c5 and White responds with d5)  because the closed center allows him to attack on the kingside while White is the one who gets to decide if the queenside is opened  (he can play axb5)  . }

1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7
{ Black generally prepares ...Nf6 with ...Nd7 in order to recapture on f6 with his knight. }
5. Nf3
{ This repertoire recommends 5.g3, but the game soon transposed into that. }
5... Ngf6 6. Nxf6+
{ It makes sense to exchange knights in order to not lose a tempo retreating and to unblock the long diagonal. }
6... Nxf6 7. g3
{ Black's main problem piece in the Rubenstein variation of the French is his light-squared bishop. To activate his light-squared bishop, Black usually wants to play a queenside fianchetto because his e6-pawn restricts him from developing his light-squared bishop to f5 or g4. Therefore, White aims to beat Black to the long diagonal and apply long-term pressure to his queenside. }
7... c5
{ Black challenges White's space advantage. Alternatives will be covered in the theory section. }
8. Bg2
{ White allows Black to capture on d4 and increases his lead in development. }
8... cxd4 { The only consistent follow-up to 7...c5. } 9. Qxd4
{ White is fine with a queen trade for multiple reasons. He would have long-term pressure on the long-diagonal against Black's queenside, especially since ...Qxd4 Nxd4 would unblock White's light-squared bishop. In the endgames, piece activity is very important, and White has more active pieces and easier development. Black still is a long ways from activating his light-squared bishop, and it will only get harder if the queens are traded. }
9... Qxd4
{ Since White has such a massive lead in development, Black's best chance of fighting for equality is accepting the queen trade, otherwise White's initiative might quickly grow to a decisive attack. }
10. Nxd4
{ This is one of the main tabiyas of the 5.g3 variation of the Rubenstein. To take stock of the position: White has more active pieces, can easily finish his development, and has a queenside pawn majority. White also has pressure against Black's queenside. Black has a solid but passive pawn structure and can quickly develop his kingside, but due to the pressure against his b7-pawn, has trouble developing his queenside. At master level, virtually all of the games from this position end in a White win or a draw, but Black has virtually no winning chances due to his passive position. }
10... Bc5
{ Black hopes to gain a tempo in order to give himself more time to untangle. }
11. Nb3
{ White wins the tempo back and unblocks the d-file. White can either double rooks on the d-file or simply centralize both of his rooks, as the center is open. }
11... Bd6
{ 11...Bb6 is a natural alternative and will be covered in the theory section. }
12. Be3
{ White now has significant pressure on Black's queenside pawns and can easily finish his development with O-O-O and Rhe1. }
12... O-O 13. O-O-O Bc7
{ Black retreats his bishop rather than self-pin with ...Rd8, which would give White a reason to double his rooks on the d-file. }
14. Bc5
{ White takes advantage of the newly weakened diagonal and attacks Black's rook. }
14... Re8
{ 14...Rd8 would allow the trade of rooks, which favors White. This is because he could  (after trading rooks)  follow up with Rd1 with domination on the d-file. }
15. Rhe1
{ White finishes his development with a harmonious game. If Black waits, White could increase the pressure by improving his worst piece: Nb3-d2-c4-d6. }
15... h6
{ Black can't safely develop his queenside. ...Bd7 drops a pawn to Bxb7, ...Rb8  (defending his b7-pawn)  loses the a7-pawn to Bxb7. Black has no good plan while White can increase the pressure.   15...a6  prepares  ...Rb8  , but weakens the dark-squares. White can take advantage of this with  Bd6  , trading dark-squared bishops, though he doesn't have to do this right away: White still has the time to keep making improvement moves such as  f4  because  ...Rb8  can always be met by  Ba7. }
16. Nd2 { White prepares a knight maneuver to d6. } 16... Nd7 17. Ba3 Nf6
{ Black can't do much but wait. } 18. Nc4 a5 19. Nd6 Bxd6 20. Bxd6
{ White now has the bishop pair on top of his superior piece activity and Black's weak queenside. }

{ 21...Rb6  22.Bc7  followed by  23.Bxa5  wins a pawn.   21...Rc6  22.Bb5  wins the exchange. }
22. Be5
{ White's plan is to now strengthen his position and coordinate his rooks down the d-file. }
22... b6
{ Black takes advantage of White's bishop  (finally !)  going off of the critical long-diagonal, but White quickly takes advantage of the weakened light-squares. }
23. Bb5 Rf8 24. Rd6
{ White now targets Black's weak b6-pawn. In this type of endgame, White often is able to win at least one of Black's queenside pawns in the long-run because Black will often remain passive if he doesn't make a queenside weakness to finish his development. }
24... Ba6
{ 24...Rb8  doesn't help: Black now has no safe square for his bishop to develop. White can win the b6-pawn at any time with Bd4-xb6, but White also has the time to gain space with moves like  f4  ,  a4  , and  c4  , because Black can't do much but wait. }
25. Rxb6 Bxb5 26. Rxb5
{ White is now ahead a pawn. Due to White's 3 vs. 1 queenside pawn majority, Black's weak a6-pawn, and White's superior piece activity, White's position is won. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. g3 b6
{ While Black has alternatives to the ...c5-xd4 endgame if he plays 5...Ngf6, but one of his best attempts to equalize is to fight for the long-diagonal. If White prevents Black from fianchettoing his light-squared bishop, it will likely remain passive for a long time  (or Black will have to make a concession to free it)  . Therefore, 5...b6  (aiming to fianchetto Black's bishop)  is one of his most logical approaches. }
6. Bg2 Rb8
{ Black needs to prepare ...Bb7 by adding support the b7-square, otherwise White could have discovered attacks to win the bishop.   6...Bb7  7.Nf6+  Ngxf6  8.Bxb7  White is better due to his bishop pair. }
7. Nf3 { White is developing his pieces harmoniously. } 7... Bb7 8. Qe2
{ White protects his e4-knight and develops his queen. } 8... Ngf6 9. Nxf6+
{ When you have a space advantage, it is usually better to not trade pieces as to not help uncramp your opponent. In this case, it is fine because White is only trading one pair of minor pieces and retreating would lose a tempo, which would be a bigger concession. }
9... Nxf6 10. O-O
{ White has excellent piece coordination and center control. Black has activated his problem piece  (his light-squared bishop)  and has a solid position, but due to White's lead in development and excellent center control, he can fight for the advantage without risk. }
10... Be7 11. Rd1
{ White develops his rook. Rd1 makes sense because it impedes ...c5  (which can now be met by dxc5 with a discovered attack on Black's queen)  as well as doesn't commit how White will develop his queenside. White can choose to either fianchetto his dark-squared bishop or play Bf4. }
11... O-O 12. c4 { White gains space and is slowly improving his position. }
12... Nd7
{ 12...Qe8 is a logical alternative. Either way, White has a space advantage and has the choice of how he would like to develop his queenside. }
13. Bf4
{ 13.b3 with 14.Bb2 is also a logical option. 13.Bf4 is more active but allows Black to trade at least one pair of minor pieces. Since White's remaining pieces will be more active than Black's, White will still have some advantage. }
13... Bd6 14. Ne5
{ Exchanging on d6 only helps Black control the center, allowing Black to capture on f4 allows Black to double White's f-pawns. }
14... Bxg2 15. Kxg2
{ Black has solved the problem of his worst minor piece, but now has weak light-squares on the queenside. White is now threatening Nc6, winning the exchange. }
15... Bxe5 16. dxe5
{ Though Bf4 is currently passively placed, it is still better not to trade it, because White has more space. Black's d7-knight is now tied down on the d-file, which White can quickly take over  (Rd2 with Rad1)  . Other than doubling rooks on the d-file, White can try to take over Black's weak queenside light-squares with Qe4-c6. }
16... Qe7 17. Rd2 { Simple play. White doubles rooks on the d-file. } 17...
Rfd8 18. Qg4
{ White begins a kingside attack. Other than an aggressive move, 18.Qg4 is also prophylaxis: Black's main weakness is Nd7 being tied down. Black had intended to play either ...Nf8 or ...Nc5, now either of those moves loses to Bg5 with a skewer. Black's knight needs to stay put in order to guard the f6-square, giving White the time to increase the pressure. }
18... Qe8
{ Black prepares to play ...Nf8, since Bg5 is no longer skewering his queen. }
19. Bh6
{ White doesn't give Black a moment's respite and forces him to weaken his dark-squares with ...g6 due to his threat of Qxg7#. }
19... g6
{ 19...Qf8  20.Rad1  White wins material because Black can't retreat his knight, Black's queen isn't really defending  Rd8  because it is overloaded, also defending against  Qxg7#. }
20. Qf4
{ White consolidates his advantage by protecting his e5-pawn. Now Black's d7-knight is tied down in a different way: it is defending the f6-square in case White decides to increase his kingside initiative with Bg5-f6. }
20... f6
{ White's threat of dark-square domination with Bg5-f6  (with a kingside attack, such as h4-h5-xg6 with Qh6 and an attack on the h-file)  was too powerful to ignore. Black had to play ...f6 before White placed his bishop there. }
21. exf6 e5
{ Black's only hope of counterplay is to strike back in the center. Objectively, it isn't enough. }
22. f7+ { White gives back the pawn to force a favorable endgame. } 22... Qxf7
23. Qxf7+ Kxf7 24. Rad1
{ Black's passive d7-knight gives him a losing position. Black is unable to move his knight because it is pinned  (...Nf6 loses to Rxd8)  . White is now threatening to remove the defender with Bg5. }
24... Ke6 25. Bg5 a5
{ Black sacrifices the exchange. White knows that he can win the exchange  (with a won position)  at any time, but since Black can't safely move his knight or d8-rook without losing even more material, White can afford to improve his position to the maximum before grabbing the material advantage, especially since Black can't do much but wait in the meantime. }
26. a4 { White gains space and restricts Black's queenside pawns. } 26... Ra8
27. f4
{ White gains space. Black can't safely take on f4 because his king will be too exposed on the open e-file. }

29. fxe5 { White is now up the exchange and a pawn. } 29... Ke7

{ Black intends to play ...Bc6. This variation is known as the Fort Knox. } 5.
Nf3 Bc6
{ The ...Bd7-c6 maneuver is very slow, especially since Black is behind in development. This gives White a good reason to be extra aggressive, taking advantage of his lead in development. }
6. Neg5
{ Simple developing moves like 6.Bd3 followed by 7.0-0 give White a small and simple advantage, but I like 6.Neg5 better. White doesn't mask his intentions: he wants to fight for a kingside attack. One of White's main ideas is to sacrifice his knight on f7, follow up with Ng5+, and play against Black's king in the center. White can get away with this because he can quickly castle and Black is behind in development. }
6... Nd7
{ Black has some alternatives, which will be analyzed in the theory section. Most still allow the sacrifice on f7. }
7. Nxf7
{ White sacrifices a piece for a powerful initiative ! White could have fought for the initiative with Bc4 or Bd3, but Nxf7 is more aggressive, and if White delayed, Black could have tried to prevent it. }
7... Kxf7 8. Ng5+ Ke8 9. Bc4
{ White delays the capture of the e6-pawn because if he took it right away, he would have to meet ...Qe7 with Qe2, blocking his light-squared bishop. White can take it soon. Black has no easy way to bring his king to safety, 2 pawns and a powerful initiative gives White sufficient compensation for the piece. }
9... Ndf6
{ Black opens the d7-square for his king, but this is too slow.   Stockfish boldly recommends  9...Bxg2  , but after  10.Rg1  , it is almost impossible to defend Black's position. Eventually, Stockfish agrees that White's knight sacrifice is sound. }
10. Nxe6 { White wins his second pawn with gain of tempo. } 10... Qe7 11. O-O
{ White can rapidly develop his pieces, this is enough to obtain full compensation for the piece. Black has no easy way to finish his development or bring his king to safety, while White can quickly bring all of his pieces into the attack. }
11... b5
{ What else can Black do ? White has a decisive attack no matter what alternative Black chooses, he can't defend his king in the center when White can attack with so much firepower. }
12. Bb3 Kd7
{ Black's tries to run to the queenside, but it is no safer there. } 13. Re1
Kc8 14. Ng5
{ Simple developing moves such as 14.Bf4 would also give White a decisive initiative, but now White has tactical solutions. White threatens both Rxe7 and Nf7, winning material. }
14... Qb4 15. c3
{ Black resigned. If Black had played on, White would have followed up with Nf7, winning all of his material back  (with interest)  while keeping his initiative. }

{ Since Black's central pawn chain is pointed in the direction of the queenside, Black intends on beginning a queenside attack starting with ...b5. Alternatives will be covered in the theory section. }
8. Qd2
{ White makes a flexible developing move. He can castle queenside later, but if he does that, he should either play dxc5 or Black should play ...cxd4 first, because if Black closes the center with ...c4, his queenside attack would be too dangerous with White castling queenside. }
8... b5 { Black continues his queenside attack. } 9. dxc5
{ White releases the tension in the center, giving him the d4-outpost for his knight. }
9... Bxc5 10. Bd3
{ White makes a natural developing move and prepares to castle kingside  (queenside is also playable, but riskier when Black has already played ...a6-b5)  . This move is not the mainline, possibly because Black can fork 2 of White's minor pieces with 10...d4. This move is tactically unsound, and one of the main benefits of 10.Bd3 over 10.Bxc5 is the trap of 10...d4 being so tempting for Black. }
10... d4
{ Black, a strong GM with a rating of almost 2800, fell for this trap ! Black 'wins a piece', but White has a tactical way to win the piece back with interest.   10...Qb6  11.Bf2  is slightly better for White due to his kingside initiative and d4-outpost.

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 cxd4
{ Black sometimes exchanges on d4 in order to define the pawn structure and prevent White from exchanging on c5. }
8. Nxd4 Bc5 9. Qd2 Nxd4
{ Black initiates a series of trades. This would normally make sense in the French because Black is behind on space, but his pieces that remain aren't very active. }
10. Bxd4 Bxd4 11. Qxd4 Qb6 12. Nb5
{ White is fine with a slightly better endgame. He intends to recapture on d4 with his knight, as the d4-square is an excellent outpost.   12.Qxb6  followed by  Nb5  gives White a similar endgame to what was played in the game.   12.Qd2  is a good approach if you would rather play for a middlegame initiative, though you have to be okay with sacrificing the b2-pawn with  12...Qxb2  13.Rb1. }
12... Qxd4 13. Nxd4
{ This is a typical slightly better endgame which can arise in the Classical French. White's position is slightly better due to his superior bishop  (Bc8 is restricted by Black's pawn structure)  , space advantage, and centralized knight. While this advantage is probably not decisive, it is enough to put Black under significant pressure, and White can play for a win without risk. }
13... Ke7 14. g3
{ White decides to finish his development. 14.g3 also makes sense because it follows Capablanca's rule: 'When you have one bishop left on the board, place your pawns on the opposite color squares to your bishop.' This principle is logical because the pawns and the bishop can work together, controlling opposite colored squares instead of restricting each other. One of Black's main problems in this endgame  (and in similar Classical French endgames)  is his light-squared bishop is restricted by Black's pawn structure.   14.h4  This is an alternate approach to the 'slow' g3. White immediately aims for concrete play. He wants to gain space on the kingside with h5-h6, and if Black weakens the kingside with ...g6, White can aim to eventually use the weakened dark-squares  (this is especially useful in a knight ending)  . If Black prevents h5 with ...h5, then White would have gained a tempo to bring his rook into the game with Rh3-c3 }

16... g6 17. g4
{ White wants to play for the f5 break. White would have loved to play g4 earlier, but if g4 can be safely met by ...h5  (where h3 is unplayable)  , White should delay it. The reason for this is White would have to either capture on h5  (weakening his pawn structure)  or advance with g5  (preventing the f5 breakthrough and giving Black a knight outpost on f5)  . Since h3 doesn't work when Rh1 is undefended  (...hxg4 hxg4 would win a pawn due to the pin)  , White usually develops his light-squared bishop before playing g4. }

{ White gains space and now has the option of opening the position with fxe6 or fxg6 at any time. }
19... gxf5 20. gxf5 Rg8 21. f6+
{ As Black's rook is now guarding the f6-square  (any Rook invasion to f6 after Rf1 and fxe6 is unlikely to be effective)  , White decides that gaining space would be more important than the potential to open the f-file. White has increased his advantage since this endgame begun: he now has more space and Black still hasn't solved the problem of his light-squared bishop. }

{ Black can't just exchange on g1, which would give White complete dominance over the g-file. White dominating the g-file would allow him to infiltrate into Black's territory with Rg7 or Rg8+. }

25... Ne4

{ 30...Nxg3  would give White an indisputable positional advantage due to his superior bishop and potential to fight for the g-file. White should fight for the g-file, possibly with  31.Rg1.  White's plan would be to trade knights with  Ne2  (to open the g-file)  (, but as Black's position is passive, he should improve his position to the utmost first)  (with moves like Kd2-e3 and c3)  (.) }

8... O-O 9. dxc5
{ It is generally too risky for White to castle queenside if Black is able to close the center with c4. With White's king on the kingside or in the center, ...c4 would be releasing the tension against White's center and allowing him to have an easier time with the f5-break. On the other hand, with the center closed  (especially with Black's pawn chain aimed at White's queenside)  , Black would cut off White's forces from being able to defend White's king, if he castled queenside. Therefore, White takes on c5 first. Other than preparing to castle queenside, dxc5 also gives White the d4-square for his knight. }

5. a3
{ White ignores the attack on his d4-pawn and counterattacks Black's b4-bishop. }
5... Ba5
{ 5...Bxc3+ is more popular, but concedes the bishop pair and strengthens White's center. 5...Ba5 is not popular at master level due to White's following move. }
6. b4
{ White sacrifices a pawn to dominate the dark-squares. White's main idea is to meet ...cxb4  (which unpins Nc3)  with Nb5, intending Nd6+. }
6... cxb4
{ 6...cxd4  is stronger and will be covered in the theory section. White's position is slightly better and White can play the safe  7.Nb5  or the dynamic  7.Qg4  with good chances. }
7. Nb5
{ Black's d6-square was weakened by 4... c5. White wasn't able to immediately take advantage of this due to the pin on Nc3, so White broke the pin with b4. }
7... Nc6 8. axb4 Bxb4+ 9. c3
{ In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, White got open lines and diagonals  (he can develop faster)  , and excellent dark-square control  (which can be increased with Ba3)  . Due to Black's passive position and White's ability to develop rapidly, White is able to apply positional pressure, even with Black's extra pawn. }

{ White aims to exchange dark-squared bishops in order to play Nd6+ without allowing ...Bxd6. }
10... a6 11. Bxe7 Ngxe7 12. Nd6+
{ Black's remaining bishop is very passive. Black's light-squared bishop is a passive in many variations of the French, mainly because Black's pawn chain ...e6-d5 restricts its mobility. }
12... Kf8 13. Bd3
{ Other than easier development and a superior bishop, Black is also not able to castle. White's compensation is mainly positional, though due to Black's passive position, White can quickly start an attack. }
13... Qc7 14. Qh5
{ A mistake for tactical reasons, giving Black hope of counterplay. If it weren't for Black's tactical shot, 14.Qh5 would be a very aggressive and dangerous move to meet, threatening 15.Qxf7#.   14.Nf3  White can castle next with significant pressure against Black's position. }
14... Nd8
{ Black misses his opportunity.   14...Nf5 !  15.Bxf5  Nxe5 !  Black threatens to play ...Qxc3+ with ...Qxa1. This is the reason why Qh5 was inaccurate: White undefended his a1-rook.  16.Ne2  Nc6 !   16...Qxd6  17.dxe5  would allow White to keep some positional pressure.  17.Nxc8  exf5  18.Qxf5  White can win the d5-pawn and castle, but Black has activity too. The position is roughly equal. }
15. Ne2 { White defends his c3-pawn and continues developing. } 15... Bd7 16.
O-O Nc8 17. Nxc8 Rxc8 18. f4
{ Black's position is very passive and Black is unable to use his extra pawn effectively as ...b5 is always met by Rxa6. White uses his central pawn chain and well-coordinated pieces to start a kingside attack. }
18... Qb6 19. Rab1 Qa7 20. Kh1
{ White moves his king off of Qa7's x-ray in order to avoid tactical tricks like ...Rxc3 followed by ...Qxd4+. }

{ If Black didn't take on f5, White could have played f6 and won on the dark squares. }
22. Bxf5 Rc6 23. Nf4 Rxc3 24. e6

{ White fights for the initiative and targets Black's weak g7-pawn, which was weakened by Black trading his dark-squared bishops. }
7... Qc7
{ Black sacrifices his g7-pawn in order to get dynamic counterplay on the queenside. His immediate threat is ...cxd4 followed by ...Qxc3+ and ...Qxa1. }
8. Bd3
{ White could accept the sacrificed g7-pawn, but he would rather do it in more favorable circumstances than 8.Qxg7.   8.Qxg7  Rg8  9.Qxh7  cxd4  Black threatens  ...Qxc3  , virtually forcing  10.Ne2  which prevents White from developing his light-squared bishop for the time being. Therefore, White should develop it on move 8, in preparation for accepting the sacrificed pawn. }
8... cxd4
{ Black could castle or play 8...c4, but that wouldn't be in the spirit of his pawn sacrifice, and White can fight for the initiative there as well. Alternatives to 8...cxd4 will be covered in the theory section. }

12. Bf4 Qf6
{ 12...Qh8  13.Qxh8  Rxh8  14.Nxc3  White wins his pawn back and has a better endgame because of his bishop pair, lead in development, and passed h-pawn. }
13. h4
{ White begins to push his passed h-pawn, which is his main asset in the poisoned pawn variation. Since Black has no pawn opposing it on either the g-file or the h-file, White's simple threat of advancing his h-pawn all the way down the board and making another queen is very serious, especially since it is hard for Black to fight for the initiative due to White's lead in development. }
13... Nbc6
{ Black develops a piece and threatens to play ...e5 with central counterplay.   13...Rxg2  is risky because Black is already behind in development. This variation will be analyzed in the theory section. }
14. Bg5 { White improves his bishop with the gain of time. } 14... Qe5 15. f4
{ White gains another tempo and impedes Black's ...e5 advance. } 15... Qc7
{ Black's offside queen is not capable of helping Black fight against White's passed h-pawn. }
16. h5 { White keeps advancing his h-pawn. } 16... e5
{ Black rushes to get central counterplay, but it's too slow.   16...Bd7  17.h6  O-O-O  18.Qxf7  is significantly better for White, but more resilient because Black is able to finish his development. }
17. h6
{ White's passed h-pawn is the deciding factor. White is able to queen it by force with a decisive advantage. White's immediate threat is Qxg8+ followed by h7 with the double threat of hxg8=Q+ and h8=Q. }
17... Rf8 18. Qg7 { White prepares to play h7. } 18... e4 19. h7
{ White is able to sacrifice his bishop, after all, a queen is worth more than a bishop, and White can queen his h-pawn soon ! }
19... exd3 20. Qxf8+
{ White temporarily sacrifices his queen, which he can recover on the next move by queening. This pseudo-sacrifice removed the defender which was guarding the queening square. }
20... Kxf8 21. h8=Q+ Ng8 22. Qxg8+
{ White has many ways to win at this point, but he chooses the most straightforward method: sacrificing his queen to create a mating net. }

{ White supports his d4-pawn so that if Black sacrifices his knight, White can recapture in a way that would protect his c3-square so that the ...Qc3+ fork would be impossible. Castling would get rid of the fork, but White's king is in no danger because the center is closed.

{ This is another sideline that Black sometimes plays. 3...Nc6 is rather anti-positional because Black blocks his c-pawn, preventing ...c5. }
4. e5
{ White gains space in the center. In the French, e5 is often met with a quick ...c5  (undermining the base of White's pawn chain)  . Since ...Nc6 impeded ...c5, White can play e5 with greater power.

5. Bb5
{ The struggle is around the e5-point. White's space advantage, led by White's e5-pawn, cramps Black's position. Black's c6-knight was applying pressure against e5, therefore, White pins it. }
5... Bd7
{ Black unpins.   5...fxe5  6.Qh5+  g6  7.Qxe5  favors White due to Black's weak e5-square and backward e6-pawn. }
6. Nf3
{ White supports his e5-pawn and has a better position due to his space advantage. Black is unable to recapture on e5 right away due to Bxc6 followed by Nxe5, giving White a dominant knight on the outpost e5-square  (and giving Black a backward e6-pawn)  . White's plan is to finish his development in a way that supports his e5-pawn  (O-O, Re1, Bf4)  . If e5 is overprotected, Black's counterplay resource of attacking  (and potentially capturing)  White's e5-pawn with ...fxe5 would lose effectiveness because it would activate many of White's pieces and create weaknesses down the e-file. After White succeeds with this phase of his plan, he can choose a plan for attack, as Black's position should be passive due to White's unchallenged space advantage. }

Black can give his king retreat squares by moving his kingside rook, but then White can simply consolidate his central advantage with Ne2-d4. When the center is stable, he can attack on the kingside without risk. One thing that should be pointed out is that ...h6 is too risky  (as it usually is)  because it only helps White open the kingside after g4-g5. }

If Black accepts the pawn sacrifice, White can control the e5-square with Bf4 followed by weakening Black's light-squares  (...fxe6 weakens the light-squares)  by playing Bd3 in order to trade light-squared bishops.

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. h4
{ White played 4.Nc3 and soon transposed into this repertoire's recommended line. I altered the move order to match this book's recommendation. }
4... h5
{ The main line. Black prevents White from playing g4 or h5 at the cost of weakening the g5-square. }
5. Bd3
{ Given that White's light-squared bishop is his good bishop  (because White's central pawns are on dark-squares)  , it usually wouldn't make sense to trade light-squared bishops in this pawn structure. This is an exception because the inclusion of h4 and ...h5 weakens the g5-square, giving White's dark-squared bishop an outpost. Without White having a passive dark-squared bishop, Bd3 makes perfect sense because exchanging on d3 trades Black's most active piece and improves White's queen with tempo. }
5... Bxd3 6. Qxd3 e6
{ Black prepares to develop his dark-squared bishop and possibly play ...c5. }
7. Bg5 { White develops his dark-squared bishop with gain of tempo. } 7... Be7
{ 7...Qb6 is the main line. 7...Be7 isn't a bad move, but is rather passive and gives White the chance to take over the initiative without offering Black much counterplay. }
8. Nf3
{ Exchanging on e7 would only help Black develop, so White develops his knight and supports the g5-square. }
8... Nh6 9. Nc3
{ White focuses on development. Since c4 might be an idea which White would like to later play, the maneuver Ne2-g3 is likely. }
9... Nd7 10. Ne2 Nf5 { 10...c5  11.c3 } 11. Ng3
{ White is okay with Black doubling White's g-pawns because White would obtain the open f-file in return. }
11... g6
{ 11...Nxg3  is stronger, but after  12.fxg3  White gains attacking chances on the kingside due to the open f-file. }
12. Nxf5
{ White doubles Black's pawns. Unlike if Black had played ...Nxg3, there is no compensation for the doubled pawns. }
12... gxf5
{ Black hopes to obtain compensation for his doubled-pawns by opening the g-file.   12...exf5  13.Qb3 }
13. O-O
{ White has a significant advantage due to his space advantage, lead in development, and superior pawn structure. To use his advantage, White needs to open the position. He can do this with the pawn lever c4, possibly after the preparatory b3. }
13... Nf8 14. g3
{ White adds support to his kingside structure, preparing to retreat his dark-squared bishop if needed without hanging the h4-pawn. }
14... Nh7 15. Bf4 { White avoids trades because he has more space. } 15... Rg8
16. Kh1
{ White avoids any tricks down the g-file. He doesn't need to rush, Black has no counterplay. White can open the position after making the necessary precautionary moves. }
16... Qd7 17. b3 { White prepares c4. } 17... O-O-O 18. c4 dxc4

19. bxc4
{ White now has even more center control than he previously did. White has also obtained the open b-file. }
19... c5
{ Necessary, but insufficient. Black strikes at White's center in order to obtain some piece activity. If Black did not do this, then White could have slowly improved his position and eventually attacked on the queenside or struck in the center with d5. He could have prepared it slowly if needed, as Black has no chance for counterplay other than ...c5. }
20. d5 { White strikes in the center. } 20... exd5
{ White was threatening to play d6, so ...exd5 is necessary. } 21. cxd5 Qxd5
22. Qxf5+
{ White has a significant advantage due to his superior pawn structure. White will win a pawn by taking on h5 soon. }
22... Rd7 23. Kg2 { White protects his f3-knight and can play Qxh5 later. }
23... Nf8 24. Rad1
{ White can take on h5 at any time, he would like to prevent counterplay first.   24.Qxh5  would be inaccurate because of  24...Ng6. }
24... Qe6 25. Qxh5 { White is now ahead a pawn. } 25... Rxd1
{ Black's best chance would have been to play  25...Ng6  26.Ng5  Nxf4+  in order to damage White's pawn structure. This would have given Black partial compensation for the sacrificed pawn. }
26. Rxd1 Ng6 27. Ng5 Nxf4+ 28. gxf4
{ White gets a superior version 25...Ng6 because White has full control over the d-file. Black has partial compensation for the sacrificed pawn due to White's damaged pawn structure, but it isn't enough, especially since White has active pieces. }
28... Bxg5
{ The decisive mistake. This exchange fixes White's pawn structure and gives White a passed pawn.   28...f6  was Black's best chance, but after  29.exf6  Bxf6  30.Qf3  White would have a significant advantage. }
29. hxg5 Qxa2 30. Rd6
{ White's passed pawns are faster than Black's passed pawns. White is objectively won. }
30... a5 31. Rf6
{ A mistake. White should not allow Black to play ...Qd5+.   White could have easily won with  31.Qh7  , among other moves. }
31... Qd5+ 32. Kh2 Qd2
{ Black doesn't have time for this. He could have obtained enough counterplay for dynamic equality with 32...a4. }
33. Qf3 Qd7 34. Qe3
{ The position is extremely sharp and both sides made some inaccuracies, but what happens at this point of the game can be summarized as White's passed pawns are more dangerous than Black's. If Black hurries and pushes them as fast as he can, then he probably has enough counterplay to equalize. Black didn't do that, so White  (again)  obtained a winning position. }
34... Qe7
{ 34...c4 was the only move which had drawing chances. Black is now lost. } 35.
Qb3 Rh8+ 36. Kg2 { 36.Kg3 is stronger because it controls the g4-square. }

Black usually plays ...Ne5-Nc4 to gain the bishop pair, and sometimes sacrifices the exchange with ...Rxc3 in order to expose White's queenside  (if White's queen leaves d2 with a premature Bh6 and ...Bxh6)  . Black's queenside attack is helped by Black's fianchettoed bishop baring pressure down the queenside. White's plan is to open the h file  (g4 with h4 and h5, or sometimes h4-h5 without g4 as a pawn sacrifice)  , trade dark squared bishops, and attack Black's kingside. White's plan is rather straightforward, so it can be very difficult to defend Black's position. }

This would not be possible without ...Nc6 because ...e5 could be met with Nf5. With ...Nc6 already played, White has a different powerful attacking plan:  10.Qe1  with Qg3 and Rae1. White is likely to play Bd3 and e5 to open the position. White has excellent center control and chances for a kingside attack. }

10... Re8
{ Black prepares to play ...Bf8. Alternatives will be covered in the theory section. }
11. f5
{ White adds pressure on Black's e6-pawn and prepares to play g5.   11.g5  is also good but after  11...Nd7  12.f5  Black has time to play  ...Ne5  while if White played  f5  before  g5  , Black would have trouble safely playing  ...Nd7  due to the weakness of her e6-pawn. }

{ Black's king is very weak and her queenside is still undeveloped. Black's extra 2 pieces do not matter because White has more than 2 pieces extra in attacking power. }

19. Bg6 { 19.g6  also wins. } 19... Bg7

{ White develops his rook, moving it off of Bg7's x-ray. It is often a good idea to prepare b4  (or b3)  by developing White's queenside rook to avoid any tactics involving a discovered attack from Black's dark-squared bishop.   12.Rb1  is also strong. }

{ Black moves his knight off of the open c-file in order to target White's c4-pawn. }
14. Nd5
{ White centralizes his knight and interferes with Be6's attack on the c4-pawn. White is okay with Black exchanging on d5 because when White recaptures, he will increase his space advantage. }

{ White finishes his development and protects his e4-pawn.   15.b4  is also strong.   The pawn sacrifice  15.Nd4  , impeding  ...b5  , is also strong.  15...Nxe4  The only possible punishment.  16.Nxe6  fxe6  17.Bg4  White has more than enough compensation for his sacrificed pawn. }

{ White's bishops no longer interfere with White's pressure down the e-file. }

{ No counterplay allowed ! Not even something as harmless as ...Ng4 should be allowed.   The aggressive  22.f5  is also powerful. }
22... e5
{ Black opens the center. This favors White because of his superior piece activity and bishop pair. Another downside of ...e5 is that White can apply pressure against Black's d6-pawn. If Black continued to wait, White would have doubled rooks on the e-file with pressure against Black's e7-pawn and opened the kingside with f5. }
23. dxe6 fxe6 24. Nb5 { White targets Black's d6-pawn. } 24... d5

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. c4
{ White provokes the Hedgehog pawn structure. The Hedgehog is like the Maroczy bind in that White has a space advantage due to his c4 and e4 pawns, but Black does not fianchetto his dark-squared bishop. }
5... Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Be2 b6
{ The Hedgehog pawn structure is where Black has traded his c-pawn for White's d4-pawn and has his pawns on a6, b6, d6, and e6 against White's e4 and c4-pawns. Black has less space in the center, but he wants to target White's pawn center. }
8. O-O Bb7 9. f3 { White supports his e4-pawn. } 9... Nbd7
{ In the Hedgehog, ...Nbd7 is usually better than ...Nc6 in order to not block Bb7.   9...Nc6  is not only positionally bad in the Hedgehog, it is also tactically bad. Black often wants to play ...Qc7, but with ...Nc6, White can sometimes play the Nd5 sacrifice. For example:  10.Be3  Be7  11.Rc1  Qc7  This is too dangerous with ...Nc6, but where else will Black develop his queen ?  12.Nd5  exd5  13.cxd5  White will win the c6-knight back with an extra pawn and good control over the c-file. }

{ This is a typical Hedgehog middlegame. White has finished his development and has a space advantage. Black's pieces are well coordinated, making up for his space disadvantage. Black intends on activating his pieces at some point with the ...d5 break, so before White continues pawn storming, he should take some prophylactic measures against ...d5. }
15... Bd8
{ Black intends on playing ...Bc7 with ...d5, attacking White's h2-pawn.   15...Rfe8  is likely to transpose.  16.Kh1 }
16. Kh1
{ White prevents ...Bxh2 from being check. White intends on preparing the c5 break with Na4, Rb1, Rdc1, and Nb3. White did not place his rooks on the d and c files earlier because the lack of a rook on the d-file before White played Kh1 could increase the effectiveness of ...d5. Black intends on playing ...Bc7 and ...Re8, preparing for the ...d5-break. }
16... Re8 17. Bg1
{ White prophylactically guards his h2-pawn. 17.Nb3  (attacking d6)  is also playable.   17.Nb3  Bc7  18.Bf4 !  Ne5  19.Bxe5  gives White a queenside pawn majority and can advance with  c5. }
17... Bc7 18. Rb1
{ White reroutes his rooks to the b and c-files in order to prepare the c5 pawn break. }
18... h5
{ Black prepares to advance his h-pawn to h3, where it can weaken white's kingside. This can be especially important if the center opens after c5 or ...d5, where Black's bishops would aim at White's weakened kingside. White should continue his plan while preventing ...h4. }
19. Qe1
{ White's queen controls the h4-square. Both sides aren't rushing with their prepared pawn breaks, they want everything to be ready before opening the position. }
19... Bd8
{ Black threatens 20...h4 due to the tactic 21.Qxh4 Nxe4 ! with a discovered attack. If Black's dark-squared bishop is on d8 and Black threatens to play ...h4, White should guard h4 with his bishop by playing Bf2. }
20. Bf2 { White controls the h4-square. } 20... Bc7
{ Black waits. Black doesn't have very much counterplay because White has impeded the ...d5 break and hasn't prematurely opened the queenside.   20...d5  21.cxd5  exd5  22.exd5  Nxd5  23.Nxd5  Bxd5  24.Qf1  Black will lose his a6-pawn. If Black opens the position prematurely, his queenside weaknesses  (a6 and b6)  will be more exposed. }

24. Rb1 Qa8 25. Rdc1 { White is almost ready to play c5. } 25... Ne5 26. c5
{ White rushes to open the queenside.   26.Nb3  White doesn't need to rush c5. Preparing c5 with Nb3 is slightly more accurate than the immediate c5.  26...Nxc4  White was threatening Black's b6-pawn. This tactic is the only way for Black to avoid losing material.  27.Bxc4  b5  28.Nb2  bxc4  29.Nxc4  White's knights are powerful and can invade on the dark-squares with Nb6 and Na5. Black's d6-pawn is also a weakness. }
26... b5 27. Nb6
{ White advances his knight. Black must play 27...Bxb6 because White forked Qa8 and Rc8. }
27... Bxb6 28. cxb6
{ White's b6-pawn is a powerful passed pawn. b6 is not a weakness because it is well supported by White's queen-bishop battery. }

35... h3 { Black now obtains counterplay. } 36. Kg1 hxg2 37. Ra1

6. Be3
{ This is one of White's most aggressive approaches. White's intent is to play Qd2 with O-O-O and f3 with g4 in order to fight for the initiative. If Black plays an early ...d6, White also has the option of transposing into the Scheveningen with Be2 and O-O. }

{ Black prepares to play ...Nc4.   9...O-O  10.g4  b5  11.g5  White has the initiative because his kingside attack is faster than Black's queenside counterattack. }

6... e6
{ Black is almost obliged to meet 6.♗c4 with 6...e6 in order to blunt White's bishop. If Black does not play ...e6, White's light-squared bishop will be even more powerful. }
7. Bb3
{ White prophylactically prepares for ...b5, which no longer comes with tempo. }
7... Nbd7
{ Black delays his kingside development in order to trade White's light-squared bishop with ...Nc5-xb3. The downside of this maneuver is ...Nbd7-c5-xb3 is a slow maneuver when Black is already behind in development. }
8. f4
{ White sharpens the position and attempts to open the position by force with f5.   8.Bg5  is a simple and logical alternative, though the resulting positions are less sharp. }
8... Nc5 9. f5
{ White can consider opening the f-file with fxe6. Another idea that is common in this line  (usually after Qf3 and Be3)  is a kingside pawn storm: g4-g5 with f6. }
9... Be7
{ Black develops his dark-squared bishop and prepares to castle kingside. } 10.
Qf3 O-O
{ Black has developed his kingside and is now ready to start play on the queenside. }
11. Be3
{ White develops his last minor piece and prepares to castle queenside. } 11...
e5 { Black forces White's d4-knight to retreat, but weakens the d5-square. }
12. Nde2 Nxb3
{ Black completes the maneuver which was the goal of 7...Nbd7: trading his queenside knight for White's light-squared bishop. }
13. axb3
{ Black has the bishop pair, but White is well placed to pawn storm the kingside with g4-g5 and f6. Black needs to show accuracy in order to equalize. }
13... b5 14. g4
{ 14.Nd5 would transpose into 12...b5 13.Nd5, but White can fight for more. White wants to pawn storm the kingside. White threatens g5, gaining space with tempo and removing Black from defending the d5-square. Black must immediately fight for counterplay or he will likely lose to a decisive kingside attack. }
14... b4
{ Black aims to deflect White's knight from controlling the d5-square before White plays g5.   14...Bb7  15.g5  Nd7  16.h4  b4  17.Nd5  White has a powerful initiative and Black must give up the bishop pair to remove White's d5-knight.   14...h6  15.h4 }
15. Na4 Bb7 { Black applies pressure against White's e4-pawn. } 16. Ng3
{ White protects his e4-pawn. } 16... d5
{ Black strikes in the center before White has a chance to play g5. } 17. g5
{ White has the initiative.   17...Nxe4  18.Nxe4  dxe4  19.Qg3  White has excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn and can increase his initiative with  f6  and  Nb6.   17...dxe4  18.Qe2  Nd5  19.f6  gives White more than enough compensation for the sacrificed material due to his massive initiative and excellent piece coordination. }

White can often win his pawn back with Nb6-xd5. Stockfish initially evaluates this position in Black's favor, but if shown White's resources  (it doesn't initially realize how dangerous ...h6 Bxh6 is for Black)  , it will claim that White has at least equal chances. }

{ The key move ! White prepares to play down the h-file. White wants to be able to meet ...h6 with Bxh6 without ...Bg5 being check. White is now ready to attack on the h-file with moves like Rh2  (Rh5 is often playable and is more aggressive but if Black fights for counterplay down the c-file with ...Rc8 and ...Qc7 then it can be useful to have the c2-pawn already defended)  with Rdh1 or Qe2-h2  (sometimes the reckless looking Rxh7 is also playable)  and has a powerful initiative. }

This idea is more powerful after Black played ...Be7 because White prepares the Bxe6 sacrifice as he is threatening 8.g5 Nd7 9.Bxe6! because Black's g7-pawn is undefended. White can follow up with g5  (Qh5 and Rg1 can maintain the g5-pawn and the Bxe6 sacrifice is in the air if Black plays ...Nd7)  with a powerful initiative. }

14. gxf5
{ White has a powerful initiative which is worth the sacrificed knight due to the open g-file and the d5-square. White's plan is Rg3 with Rdg1, Nd5, and Qh5. If Black prevents Qh5 with ...g6  (after ...Kh8)  , then White will be able to take advantage of the weak dark-squares with Qd2 and Bd4+.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6
{ The Classical Sicilian. } 6. Bc4
{ The Velimirovic attack. White develops his light-squared bishop to an active square and creates pressure on Black's f7-pawn. }
6... e6
{ Black prepares to develop his kingside and blocks the a2-g8 diagonal in order to reduce the influence of White's light-squared bishop. }
7. Be3
{ White plans to play Qe2 and O-O-O, followed by a kingside pawn storm. } 7...
Be7 8. Qe2
{ 8.Qd2  is not as strong because Black can play  ...Ng4.  White doesn't want to lose time on  f3  , so  e2  is the best square for White's queen. }
8... O-O 9. O-O-O
{ White is now ready to pawn storm the kingside. Black usually tries to finish his development and get counterplay by counterattacking on the queenside. }
9... a6
{ Black controls the b5-square  (Nb5 is prevented)  and intends on following up with ...Qc7 and ...b5. }
10. Bb3
{ White usually meets ...a6 with Bb3 in order to not lose a tempo after Black plays ...b5 or ...Ne5. }
10... Qc7 { Black prepares to play ...b5 by protecting his c6-knight. } 11.
Rhg1
{ White prepares to play g4-g5  (gaining kingside space and forcing Nf6 to retreat)  and develops his rook. After White plays g5, Rg1 can aid the kingside attack with a typical rook lift: Rg3-h3.   11.g4  Nxd4 !  is less clear because  12.Bxd4  loses a pawn to  12...e5 !  followed by  13...Bxg4. }
11... Nd7

12. g4
{ White gains space on the kingside and prepares to sacrifice with Nf5   ...exf5  gxf5  in order to open the g-file. White also can use Rg1 to aid the kingside attack even without the open g-file with Rg3-h3  (this is often combined with g5 and Qh5)  . }
12... Nc5 13. Nf5
{ White sacrifices his knight in order to open the g-file and obtain the d5-square. }
13... b5
{ Black decides that accepting the sacrificed knight would give White too much compensation due to the d5-square and the open g-file. Instead, he prepares to finish his development with ...Bb7 and has the option of pawn storming the queenside with ...b4 and ...a5. }
14. Bd5
{ White prevents Black from trading his light-squared bishop with ...Nxb3 and offers another sacrifice. This time, if Black accepts, White will bring his c3-knight to the powerful d5 outpost with tempo and help White open the position  (opening the position favors White because he is ahead on development)  . }
14... Bb7
{ At master level, Black usually rejects both sacrifices  (for now)  in order to focus on development.   14...exd5  15.Nxd5  Qb7  16.e5  gives White a powerful initiative.   14...exf5  15.gxf5  gives White a powerful initiative on the newly opened g-file. }

{ Black continues to reject the piece sacrifices. Just like before, accepting either one would give White at least full compensation and a powerful initiative. }
16. Rg3 { White prepares to play Rh3 and Qh5. } 16... b4
{ 16...b4 is not Black's most common move, but is Black's best chance. White has at least as powerful of an attack against the alternatives. Black increases the tension and threatens to capture White's c3-knight. If White retreats, Black can safely play ...exd5 because Nxd5 is no longer possible. }
17. Rh3
{ White sacrifices the c3-knight to gain time on the kingside attack. Black does not yet have time to play ...bxc3 due to White's threat of Qh5. }

{ White gives a check and forces Black to choose a square for his king. } 18...
Kg7 { Black's king is safer on g7 than it would be on f8. } 19. Bxc6
{ White wants to play Qf3 to attack the f7-pawn, but ...Ne5 would defend it. Therefore, White exchanges Nc6 before Black can play ...Ne5. }
19... Bxc6 { Black recaptures on c6 with his bishop. } 20. Qf3
{ White ignores his hanging c3-knight and counterattacks Black's f7-pawn. }
20... Be8
{ 20...Be8 is the strongest move. It not only defends the f7-pawn, but prevents White from playing the Nd5 sacrifice due to Black's x-ray on c2. }
21. Nf5+

21... Kg8
{ Black should not accept this sacrifice. If he declines, White has nothing better to give a perpetual check. }
22. Nh6+ Kf8
{ Black avoids the perpetual, but allows White a powerful sacrifice.   22...Kh8  23.Nxf7+ }
23. Nxf7
{ This sacrifice would not work if Black's king was on g7 because White would not be threatening discovered attacks and because Black's king would guard the h7-pawn.   23...Bxf7  24.Rxh7 }
23... bxc3
{ Black can't safely accept the sacrificed knight on f7, so he accepts the knight on c3. }
24. Rxh7 cxb2+ { Black's only move which doesn't lose by force. } 25. Kb1 Nxe4
{ Black is now threatening ...Qxc2#. } 26. Nh6+
{ 26.Nh6+ is the alternative to taking the draw with 26.Rh8+. } 26... Nf6
{ 26...Bf6  27.Rxc7 } 27. Rd2
{ White defends his c2-pawn. To avoid getting crushed on the kingside, Black must counterattack the c2-pawn. }
27... Ba4 28. c4
{ White deflects Black's queen to a tactically vulnerable square. Black must take, or else White will win on the kingside. }
28... Qxc4 29. Rf7+ Ke8 30. Rxe7+
{ White removes the defender of Black's f6-knight with check. White must play forcing, or else Black will win with his queenside attack. }
30... Kxe7 31. Qxf6+ Kd7 { 31...Ke8  32.Qf7+  Kd6  33.Rxd6+ } 32. Qg7+
{ White continues his forcing sequence. 32.Qg7+ is stronger than 32.Qf7+ because White can later take the b2-pawn with his queen. }
32... Kc6 { 32...Kd8  33.Rxd6+   32...Ke8  33.Qf7+ } 33. Rxd6+
{ White has a tactic which wins Black's queen. } 33... Kxd6
{ 35...Kb5  36.Qb7+  Ka5  37.Qb6# } 34. Nf7+
{ Regardless of Where Black's king moves, White will win Black's queen due to a fork or a discovered attack. }
34... Kc6 35. Ne5+ Kd6 36. Nxc4+ Rxc4 37. Qxb2
{ White has a queen and a pawn against 2 rooks. The position is close to dynamically balanced, but White has slightly better chances due to Black's weak dark-squares and exposed king. }

The main issue with this line is the massive amount of theory and Black's variety of possible sharp plans that he can choose.

{ White's f4 idea is also strong in lines where Black doesn't play ...a6. } 7.

{ White usually wants to attack on the kingside. f4 is a useful move because White gains kingside space and prepares to play f5 or e5 after White finishes developing his minor pieces.   8.Be3  is also playable, but I prefer the 8.f4 line because Black is able to play  8...e5 !?  going into a 6.Be2 Najdorf down a tempo. This isn't the end of the world for White, but 8...e5 reduces the effectiveness of White's f4 plan because if Black captures on f4 and White recaptures with the bishop, White will have lost a tempo on Be3-xf4. It is ideal to recapture on f4 in one move, if Black plays ...e5 and captures on f4 before White plays Be3, White can take on f4 in one move and use the extra tempo to fight for the initiative. }

{ 9...Nd7 is another sideline which tries to deviate from mainline theory. The idea is to play ...Nb6 or ...Nde5 and try to control the c4 square with both knights. This plan is very slow. If Black wants to attempt to fight for the initiative, he should be rapidly developing his pieces instead of retreating or making slow moves. White can play his normal plan of O-O-O with h4-h5. White can even play Be2  (Bb3 is still good)  in response to ...Nb6 or ...Nde5 in order to play b3 controlling the c4 square which would negate Black's main point behind 9...Nd7. }

{ White has a decisive attack. According to chess.com's database, White has won all the games in this position  (11/11)  . White's plan is to trade knights with Ng3, double rooks on the h file, trade queens  (Qf4 with Qf6)  , and checkmate Black on the h file. Black can't stop this without making serious concessions worth more than the pawn White sacrificed. White can either meet ...e5 with Nf5 !  (usually a decisive breakthrough)  or Ne2-c3-d5 with good control of the d5 square. Stockfish doesn't immediately notice that White is winning but eventually realizes that White's attack is decisive. }

{ After Black plays ...Nc4 Bxc4 ...bxc4, Black can get counterplay on the b-file. Therefore, it is useful to play Kb1  (if given time Ka1 also, where White can play Rb1 to defend the b2 point)  . White could play Kb1 after 13.h5 but 13.Kb1 is more flexible. }

10. Nc2
{ White avoids the trade of knights because he has more space. White's c4 and e4 pawns really restrict Black, making it harder for Black to find a clear plan.

White can finish his development  (Qd2, Rfd1, Rac1)  and can consider playing a4 or Na3 to prevent ...b5 if Black manages to make it a threat. }

Instead, Black generally wants to place his pawns on a6, b6, d6, and e6 in order to guard key central squares and intends to develop his pieces in a harmonious way which exerts pressure on White's center. He hopes that White will prematurely attack, where Black's pieces will be well-placed for a counter-attack. Black isn't forced to go for the Hedgehog plan, but it's his best chance for counterplay in the 5.c4 variation. }
5... Nf6 6. Nc3
{ White defends his e4-pawn. Now that the e4-square is defended by a piece, White is threatening to play e5. }
6... Qc7 { Black defends the e5-square with his queen. } 7. a3
{ White prevents ...Bb4. Sidelines with ...Bb4 have been prevented, now Black is almost certain to play this in Hedgehog style. Other than preventing ...Bb4, a3 is a useful move to make in the Hedgehog because White wants to attack on the queenside. }
7... Nc6
{ Nc6 is not well placed in the Hedgehog. It would be better placed on d7, where it doesn't block the c-file or Black's bishop  (Black usually wants to play ...b6 with ...Bb7)  . Other than these positional reasons, ...Nc6 has a tactical drawback of increasing the danger of the Nd5 sacrifice, which will be illustrated by the following variation. }
8. Be3 Be7 9. Be2 O-O 10. O-O d6
{ Black can play for ...Ne5-g6, but then  (other than normal Hedgehog play)  White could fight for a kingside initiative with f4 and g4. This plan makes more sense than normal if Black plays ...Ne5-g6 because this pawn storm would come with tempo, attacking Black's knights. }
11. Rc1
{ The move order over the last few moves doesn't really matter. Black had several sidelines that he could have played, but none seriously challenge White because he would keep his space advantage, development advantage, and initiative. White plays Rc1 to create an x-ray on Black's queen. White is now threateing the thematic tactical shot Nd5 !, taking advantage of the positioning of Nc6. This idea would not be possible if it weren't for Black playing ...Nc6. }
11... b6
{ Black could play a stronger move, avoiding the following tactic, but White would still be positionally better due to his space advantage and Black's misplaced c6-knight. This line is shown for instructional purposes because Nd5 is a common idea after Black has undefended Nc6 with at least one pawn  (generally, Nd5 is most powerful after Black has undefended his c6-knight with both pawns)  after White has played Rc1 in the Hedgehog. }
12. Nd5
{ Black is obliged to accept this knight, or White will be able to play Nxc6 followed by Nxe7+ with a decisive material advantage. Even if it weren't for this resource, Nxe7+ would be enough for a significant advantage due to White's bishop pair, space advantage, and Black's pawn weaknesses on d6 and b6. }
12... exd5 13. cxd5
{ Black is unable to capture White's d4-knight because of the pin on Qc7. White will win at least a pawn by capturing on c6. Other than this, Black's queenside is very weak  (White's bishops are aimed at Black's weak a6 and b6 pawns and White can dominate the c-file)  (Rxc6 followed by Qc2 and Rc1)  (. For these reasons, White's position is won.) }

5... Nf6 6. Nc3 e6 7. Bd3
{ The most flexible move, preparing to castle kingside. 7.Bd3 is slightly stronger than 7.Be3 because White is closer to castling and can unpin faster if Black plays ...Bb4  (another bonus is that ...Bb4-xc3 allows Ba3 if White hasn't yet played Be3)  . White will force Black's queen to retreat with Be3, gain space with f4, and can play in Scheveningen style  (O-O, Qf3, Rad1 or Rae1)  or  (my preference)  play more aggressively with Qf3, g4, and O-O-O.

White's plan is to develop rapidly  (O-O, Bf4/Bg5)  , centralize his major pieces, and target Black's d4-pawn. If Black plays too slowly or makes another weakness, White could also play for a kingside initiative. Trading minor pieces generally favor White due to Black's isolated d-pawn. }

{ White delays committing his kingside knight, both Nf3 and Nge2 are possible. White intends on targetting Black's queen with Bd2 followed by a discovered attack  (Nd5-xf6+)  to damage Black's pawn structure. }
5... c6
{ Black supports the d5-square and prepares an eventual queen retreat with ...Qc7 or ...Qd8. }
6. Bd2 Qb6
{ Black moves his queen off of Bd2's diagonal and prepares to win a pawn with ...Qxb2. This approach is risky because White already has a big lead in development and White can sacrifice the pawn to increase his initiative. }
7. Nf3 { White develops his knight and protects his d4-pawn. } 7... Bf5 8. Qe2
{ White prepares to castle queenside. } 8... e6
{ Accepting either sacrificed pawn would help White open lines to increase his initiative.   8...Bxc2  9.0-0   8...Qxb2  9.Rb1 }
9. O-O-O { White has the initiative due to his lead in development. } *
