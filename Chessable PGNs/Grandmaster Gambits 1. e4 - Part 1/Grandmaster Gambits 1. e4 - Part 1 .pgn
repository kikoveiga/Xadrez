{ Welcome to Grandmaster Gambits: 1 e4 where we present some of Simon's favourite attacking and sacrificial lines! }
1. e4 e5
{ In this course we tackle the 'big four', which means that as well as the Open Games, we'll be taking a good look at the ever-popular Sicilian.     Against the French,  1...e6  , it's not so easy to gambit early on, so we'll settle for a space advantage with the easy-to-play Advance variation,  2.d4  d5  3.e5  . Play tends to continue  3...c5  4.c3  Nc6  5.Nf3  Qb6  when we rather like  6.Bd3  and then  6...cxd4  7.O-O!?  , a modern twist on the famous Milner-Barry Gambit and one deployed by Magnus no less.   Black's final big four move is  1...c6  , the Caro-Kann. Here even quite experienced practitioners of that venerable opening may be stunned by  2.Bc4!?  d5  3.Bb3  , Simon's favorite Hillbilly Attack and every inch a gambit. }
2. Nf3 Nc6
{ Just so you're not stranded when Black avoids this standard choice, we've also presented lines against his alternatives, not least involving countering the Petroff,   2...Nf6  , with  3.d4  . }
3. Bc4
{ White goes for classic development as in this repertoire we prioritise rapid development, which a subsequent gambit will but speed up even further. }
3... Bc5
{ Black's big alternative is   3...Nf6  , the Two Knights Defence, when a famous double-gambit is our plan,  4.d4!?  exd4  5.O-O  . }
4. O-O Nf6 5. d4
{ Yet again the d-pawn is sacrificed to seize a strong, early initiative whichever way Black takes on d4. As for studying this course, we recommend that you should first play through the following illustrative games which introduce our key gambit lines.  Do then familiarize yourself with the Quickstarter overview before undertaking some more detailed study of each variation in turn.  And, above all, have fun! Indeed, these gambits, all of which have their supporters in the GM ranks, are not just decent practical weapons which should catch out plenty an opponent at an early stage, but are also most enjoyable lines to play and have in your repertoire. }

2. Nf3
{ Against Black's classical response we recommend classical development in kind - at least for the first few moves! }
2... Nc6 3. Bc4
{ White goes for classic development as in this repertoire we prioritise rapid development, which a subsequent gambit will but speed up even further. }
3... Bc5 4. O-O
{ Completing our kingside development, while tucking the king away. Do observe that in contrast Black's king is still on e8, and that actually can work to our advantage. }
4... Nf6 5. d4
{ These days the quiet Giuoco Piano with 5. d3 followed by c3 is pretty topical, especially at the highest level, but the gambit introduced by the bold text move should really jolt your opponent awake. There won't be any slow maneuvering here. }
5... Bxd4
{ Black's most popular move, playing for exchanges and aiming to keep his pawn on e5.  Instead,   5...exd4  6.e5  would transpose to the Max Lange Attack, named after the feared German nineteenth century attacker and theoretician. Play tends to run  6...d5  7.exf6  dxc4  . Here we're advocating the immediate  8.fxg7  - see our next game, Li Chao - Wang Yu.  Instead,   5...Nxd4?  is by no means unknown, especially at club level. However, this is a capture we should most certainly welcome:  6.Nxe5  already carries a direct threat and, perhaps unusually for 1. e4 e5 lines, castling doesn't help Black:  6...O-O?  fails on account of  7.Be3!  .   Already White is almost winning a piece, as actually happened in two games from the semi-final stage of the famed Soviet Championship! On both occasions IM and future world correspondence champion Yakov Estrin was the lucky recipient as White:  7...d5!   The only way to save the piece. You might wonder about  7...Qe7  8.Bxd4  Bxd4  9.Qxd4  c5  , and if  10.Qc3  Nxe4  . However, after  11.Qe3  Qxe5  12.Nc3  Black nonetheless had to resign in Estrin-Klaman, Leningrad 1957, on account of  12...Re8  13.Rfe1  d5  14.Bxd5  when the knight is simply dropping off.   Do note too that  7...Ne6  8.Bxe6  Bxe3  9.Bxf7+  Kh8  10.Bb3  wins material, with the dual threats of fxe3 and Nf7+.  8.exd5  b5  Fairly forced, but clearly White cannot complain about how the opening is going.  9.Bxd4  Bxd4  10.Qxd4  bxc4  11.Nc3  Bf5  12.Rac1  . This simply left White a pawn to the good and with another set to fall on c4, and unsurprisingly he went on to win in Estrin-Ravinsky, Leningrad 1955. }
6. Nxd4
{ We might have sacrificed a pawn, but are happy to trade pieces, thereby pocketing the bishop-pair while freeing the f-pawn. }
6... Nxd4 7. Bg5
{ This pin is what attracted us to this line. White keeps the f-pawn in reserve, whereas a well-drilled or experienced opponent is much more likely to be ready for  7.f4  , quite possibly with  7...d6  8.fxe5  dxe5  9.Bg5  Qe7  , which is a fairly tough nut to crack. }
7... h6
{ There's no doubt that this gambit is a good choice for fast  (rapid and blitz)  games, but it is also a very good choice at classical time controls too - be that at club or even the top level! Indeed, that most creative of modern-day players, Daniil Dubov, did much to reignite interest in 7. Bg5 when he deployed it in Dubov-Radjabov, Hamburg Grand Prix 2019:   7...d6  8.f4  Bg4!  developing with tempo; we'll examine Black's alternatives in our main coverage of 1. e4 e5.  9.Bxf6!  White must exchange and go in for a queen swap as   9.Qd2  is well met by the cold-blooded  9...Nxe4!  9...Bxd1  10.Bxd8  Rxd8   10...Be2?  would be clever, but not wise in view of some simple captures:  11.Bxe2  Nxe2+  12.Kf2  . Black can avoid losing a piece, but after  12...Nd4  13.Bxc7  Kd7  14.Ba5  Nxc2  15.Nc3  Nxa1  16.Rxa1  White is somewhat for choice with his two minor pieces and the d-file to attack down.  11.c3!  Trying to entice Black into ...Nc2. If you like your minor pieces you might wish to explore   11.Rxd1!?  Nxc2  12.Nc3  Nxa1  13.Rxa1  exf4  , as in two recent Sindarov-Grischuk blitz games, when Black has a lot of extra pawns, but minor piece fans might not be so unhappy as White and might start with the AlphaZerolike  14.h4!?  h6  15.h5  or just go 14. Nd5 - compare with Line A1 in our coverage of 1. e4 e5.  Be2!  Radjabov continues to find all the right moves, but we can imagine that many an opponent would be enticed by   11...Nc2?  12.Rxd1  Nxa1  13.Na3  . However, this slams the lid on any escape by the black knight and appears to favour White: for example,  13...exf4  14.Rxa1  O-O  15.Kf2!  Rfe8  16.Kf3  . White makes good active use of the king and hopes to exploit Black's weakened kingside:  16...g5  17.Nb5  Re5!  18.h4!  . This rejects the poisoned c-pawn and intending Rh1, as well as Nd4-f5.  12.cxd4  a fairly forced capture  12...Bxc4  13.Rc1  the point of White's play  13...Bd3  14.Rxc7  Rd7  the only move seen thus far in practice, sensibly overprotecting b7. Instead,   14...Bxe4?!  15.Nc3  would not be wise for Black, and if  15...Bc6?!  16.d5  Bd7  17.Rxb7  with some advantage for White.  Instead, after   14...exd4  15.Rxb7  White is ready to go Nd2 and should welcome an exchange of pawns:  15...Bxe4  16.Rxa7  . This nets two connected passed pawns, while it should be possible to keep the d4-pawn under control with the white knight and king.  15.Rc8+  Rd8  16.Rxd8+  If you're happy to simply repeat moves, whether in the last round of a tournament or against a much higher-rated opponent, there's also   16.Rc7  Rd7  17.Rc8+  Rd8  ½-½, Beerdsen-Leko, German Bundesliga 2019.  Kxd8  17.dxe5   17.fxe5  dxe5  18.Nc3  exd4  19.Rd1  dxc3  20.Rxd3+  Ke7  21.Rxc3  Rd8  would only leave White with an isolated e-pawn.  Bxb1  18.Rxb1  . Here Dubov and Radjabov shook hands - typically good defence from the Azeri star. It would be remiss not to pause here and ask ourselves 'well?'. Firstly, the chance of an opponent below at least 2200 finding all the moves must be close to zero, especially when we factor in that many opponents will be on their own after 7. Bg5, if not already panicking and wishing they'd revised their gambit lines when 5. d4 hit the board. Secondly, White might deviate at move 11 or simply continue here with little to lose.  18...dxe5  19.fxe5   19.f5  Ke7  20.Rc1  Rd8  would be comfortable for Black,  but   19.g3!?  exf4  20.gxf4  Re8  21.Rd1+  Kc7  22.Rd4  is by no means ridiculous, injecting some imbalance and preparing to bring up the king, ideally to e4 after e5, to support White's central pawns.  Re8  20.Rd1+  Ke7   20...Kc7?  21.Rd5  is just a useful extra pawn; Black can try to counterattack, but:  21...Re6  22.Kf2  Ra6  23.a3  Rb6  24.b4  Ra6  25.Rd3  . This maintains control, after which White can go on the offensive himself:  25...Re6  26.Rh3  h6  27.Rg3  g6  28.Rf3  Re7  29.Ke3  . White has good chances to convert to the full point.  21.Rd2   21.Rc1  Kd7  22.Rc5  b6  23.Rd5+  is the alternative.  Rc8   21...Rd8?  22.Rxd8  Kxd8  23.Kf2  would not be wise:  23...Ke7  24.Ke3  Ke6  25.Kd4  . Here Black certainly doesn't have more useful pawn moves than White.  22.Kf2  Ke6  23.Kf3  . This should be OK for Black, but even here the onus has been on him to defend well and the possibility of  23...Rc7  24.Kf4  might well concern some defenders, even if this should still be a draw. }
8. Bh4 { Maintaining the pin and provoking Black's next. } 8... g5
{ What could be more natural than this way of breaking the pin? Isn't Black just going to be a solid pawn ahead after  9.Bg3  d6?  Black should, however, resist this push here and we'll see his alternatives in our main coverage of  1.e4  e5  . }
9. f4
{ Wow! Put that in your pipe and smoke it! White ignores the threat to his bishop and shows just why the f-pawn was kept in reserve on move 7. }
9... d5
{ This central counter-strike is probably Black's defense. The stem game Rosentreter-Hoffer, Berlin 1899, saw the attempt to keep lines closed with  9...gxf4?  . However, this was demolished by  10.Rxf4!  exf4  11.Qxd4  . White is the exchange down, but clearly the pin's a winner and Black gave up after  11...O-O  12.Bxf6  Qe8  13.Bh8  .   And what about the other capture? Well, after  9...gxh4  10.fxe5  , with both knights hanging, Black hasn't anything better than  10...d5!  11.exd5  and a transposition to our main game. }
10. exd5 gxh4
{ Pocketing the bishop feels greedy, but must be critical.  Once again, Black would be advised to avoid   10...gxf4?  11.Rxf4!  . Here even  11...Nf5  12.Rxf5  Bxf5  13.Qf3  left a 2267-rated player in huge trouble in Lopez Silva-Abarca Gonzalez, Punta Arenas 2014.  Rising Indian star Nihal Sarin demonstrated how to deal with the zwischenzug   10...Bg4?!  :  11.Qe1!  Nxc2   11...gxh4  12.Qxe5+  Kf8  13.Qxd4  leaves Black a pawn down and with a rather wrecked position  12.Qxe5+  Qe7  13.Qxe7+!  Kxe7  14.fxg5  Nd7   14...Nxa1?  15.gxf6+  Kd7  16.Na3  again traps the black knight  15.g6+  f6  . Now in Nihal-Vrana, Pardubice  @@StartBracket@@rapid@@EndBracket@@ 2017, White brought his knight into play, but there was likely something even stronger:  16.h3!  Bh5   16...Nxa1?  17.hxg4  Nc2  does save the knight, but Black will surely will not survive such an initiative for White:  18.Nc3  Nd4  19.Re1+  Kd8  20.d6!  cxd6  21.g7  and the g-pawn's a winner.  17.d6+!  cxd6   17...Kxd6  18.Bg3+  Ke7  19.Nc3  also looks most unpalatable for Black: for example,  19...Nxa1  20.Nd5+  Kf8  21.Nxf6!  Nxf6  22.Rxf6+  Kg7  23.Be5  Bxg6  24.Rf7+  Kg8  25.Rxc7+  Kf8  26.Bg7+  Ke8  27.Bxh8  . This recoups the material with an easy win. Such lines really do drive home the maxim that you should always be examining all checks and forcing moves!  18.Nc3  Nxa1   18...Bxg6  19.Nd5+  Kd8  20.Rac1  only leaves White a pawn down for his monstrous initiative.  19.Nd5+  Kf8  or   19...Kd8  20.g7  Rg8  21.Nxf6  20.Nf4  when White is regaining a bishop for starters and has far too strong an attack.  We should also explore a couple of knight moves:   10...Nxd5  11.fxe5  gxh4  12.Qxd4  regains the piece:  12...Be6  . Here White's best approach might be the as-yet-unplayed  13.Qf2  . This avoids any queen exchange while intending Nc3 or  13...Qd7?  14.Bxd5!  Qxd5  15.Nc3  Qxe5  16.Rae1  Qg7  17.Qxh4  with much the happier king for White.  Instead,   10...Nf5?!  offers White a number of tempting continuations. They include  11.fxe5  Ne3  12.Qe2  Nfg4   12...Nxf1?  13.exf6+  would not be wise  and   12...Nfxd5  13.Bxd5  Nxd5  14.c4  Nb6  15.Bf2  Be6  16.b3  followed by placing the knight on e4 or advancing the queenside pawns leaves Black's king still rather unhappy  13.Nc3!  gxh4  14.h3  Nxf1  15.Rxf1  . Black is a rook ahead, but his knight is trapped and f7 extremely vulnerable:  15...Qg5   15...Qe7  16.hxg4  Bd7  17.Qf2!  is pretty much winning followed by d6 or e6 or  17...O-O-O  18.Qxa7  16.hxg4  Qxg4  . This doesn't save the day in view of, for instance, a forcing line:  17.Bb5+  c6  18.dxc6  Qxe2  19.cxb7+  Qxb5  20.bxa8=Q  Qb7  21.Qxb7  Bxb7  22.Nb5  . White has a huge advantage in the endgame. }
11. fxe5
{ Once again we find White making this ideal capture, leaving both black knights en prise. }
11... Ng4
{ This pseudo-active move is music to White's ears. Instead,   11...Nxd5  12.Qxd4  Be6  13.Qf2  favours White, as we saw above, but is far from a decisive advantage. }
12. Qxd4 Qg5
{ The Paraguayan Grandmaster wants to invade on e3, but there's simply no time for such things. }
13. e6
{ Hitting f7, as well as the rook on h8, and so pretty much forcing Black's ugly reply. }
13... f6
{ 13...O-O?  would also deal with the threats, but then there's  14.exf7+  Rxf7  15.d6  . }
14. Nc3 c6
{ Trying to avoid the queen exchange:   14...Qe3+  15.Qxe3  Nxe3  16.Bb5+  . Here a neat finish might be:  16...Ke7  17.Rfe1!  Nxc2  18.d6+!  cxd6  or   18...Kxd6  19.Rad1+  19.Nd5+  Kf8  20.e7+  Kg7  21.e8=Q  Rxe8  22.Rxe8  Nxa1  23.Ne7  . White picks up a whole piece. }
15. Ne4
{ By no means the only good move, but the Danish GM wants to exploit his central majority to the maximum. }
15... Qe3+ 16. Qxe3 Nxe3 17. d6 { Olé! } 17... Nxc4
{ 17...Nxf1  18.Nxf6+  Kf8  or   18...Kd8  19.e7  19.Rxf1  would also be quite hopeless:  19...Kg7  20.Nh5+  Kg6  21.Rf7  Kxh5  22.Rg7!  . White is forcing mate. }
18. Nxf6+ Kf8
{ Once again,   18...Kd8?  would be rather embarrassingly met by  19.e7  . }
19. e7+
{ 19.Nd5+!  is the engines' preference, forcing the pace:  19...Ke8  or   19...Kg7  20.Rf7+  Kg6  21.Ne7+  Kg5  22.Rf5+  Kg4  23.h3+  Kg3  24.Rf3  20.Nc7+  Kd8  21.Rf8+  . However, the text is more than good enough, not least in a three-minute game. }
19... Kf7 20. Rae1
{ Inviting the final piece to the party, in true Seirawan-approved fashion. }
20... Nxd6
{ There was nothing better, as we can see from   20...Re8  21.Nxe8+  Kxe8  22.Rf8+  Kd7  23.Rd8  . }
21. e8=Q+ Nxe8 22. Nxe8+ Kg6
{ It would also have been mate soon enough after   22...Kg8  23.Nf6+  Kf7  or   23...Kg7  24.Nh5+  Kg8  25.Re8+  Kh7  26.Re7+  Kg6  27.Rf6+!  24.Nd7+  Kg7  25.Re7+  Kg6  26.Rf6+  Kh5  27.Re5+  , etc. }
23. Rf6+
{ In view of   23.Rf6+  Kh7  or   23...Kh5  24.Re5+  24.Re7+  Kg8  25.Rg7  there's just nowhere for the black king to hide. }

1. e4 e5
{ In this course we tackle the 'big four', which means that as well as the Open Games, we'll be taking a good look at the ever-popular Sicilian.     Against the French,  1...e6  , it's not so easy to gambit early on, so we'll settle for a space advantage with the easy-to-play Advance variation,  2.d4  d5  3.e5  . Play tends to continue  3...c5  4.c3  Nc6  5.Nf3  Qb6  when we rather like  6.Bd3  and then  6...cxd4  7.O-O!?  , a modern twist on the famous Milner-Barry Gambit and one deployed by Magnus no less.   Black's final big four move is  1...c6  , the Caro-Kann. Here even quite experienced practitioners of that venerable opening may be stunned by  2.Bc4!?  d5  3.Bb3  , Simon's favorite Hillbilly Attack and every inch a gambit. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch, but play soon transposes from the Scotch Gambit to a key line of our repertoire,   3.Bc4  Nf6  4.d4  exd4  5.O-O  . }
3... exd4 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. O-O
{ There's nothing wrong with   5.e5  d5  6.Bb5  Ne4  7.Nxd4  , but we prefer to offer a second pawn when we can. }
5... Nxe4
{ A major alternative is   5...Bc5  6.e5  , the famous Max Lange Attack. Black has long been advised to counter in the centre, leading to quite an imbalance:  6...d5  7.exf6  dxc4  8.fxg7  Rg8  . Traditionally White checked with the rook here, but recent practice has shown that there's something likely stronger:  9.Bg5!  . Just as in our main game here, a key motif is:  9...Qd5?  Black really has to retreat with   9...Be7  , as we'll see in Line B1 of our 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 coverage.  10.Nc3!  . This exploits the pin to develop with tempo. White has unsurprisingly scored very well from here, with the hero of our last game victorious here too:  10...Qf5  11.Re1+  Be6  12.Ne4!  everything continues to come with tempo  12...Rxg7   12...Be7  13.Bxe7  Kxe7  14.Nxd4  Nxd4  15.Qxd4  also leaves White dominating  13.Nh4  Qxe4  desperation, but the queen is trapped in view of   13...Qe5  14.Nf6+  and   13...Qxg5?  14.Nxg5  Rxg5  would have seen a noted theoretician having to quickly resign in Espinosa Veloz-Mikhalevski, Internet blitz 2020, had White simply gone  15.f4  d3+  16.Kh1  Rd5  17.f5  14.Rxe4  Rxg5  15.f4  d3+  16.Kh1  dxc2  17.Qxc2  1-0, J.

White will regain his pawn with interest following Bd5. }
7. Bxd5 { A little tactic to regain one of the pawns. } 7... Qxd5 8. Nc3

9. Nxe4 { The right way to recapture, with a certain threat. } 9... Be6 10. Bg5
{ Preventing Black's king from escaping to the queenside. White is a pawn down, but his lead in development supplies definite compensation and there's a little tactic coming up... }
10... h6
{ Black's second most popular choice after   10...Bd6  , which accepts some structural damage and will be heavily analysed in our coverage of how to counter the Two Knights Defence @@StartBracket@@1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6@@EndBracket@@.  Black can also return the pawn with   10...Bb4!?  11.Nxd4  We also spent some time analyzing   11.c3!?  dxc3  12.bxc3  Ba5  13.Nd6+!  , which is tricky and you may prefer, although after the calm  13...cxd6  14.Qxd6  Bc7!  15.Qxc7  O-O  Black has equalized, and more in the event of the greedy  16.Qxb7?  Bd5  - we want to be sacrificing pawns, not grabbing them and so ceding the initiative!  Qxd1  12.Rexd1  Nxd4  13.Rxd4  . At first sight this might look like pleasant equality for him with his bishop-pair, but...  13...Be7   13...Ba5?!  runs into  14.Nc5  14.Re1!  ...reveals that White's lead in development still counts. Now Black can't really exchange on g5:  14...Rd8   14...Bxg5?  15.Nxg5  picks up a pawn, and if  15...Ke7  16.Rde4  15.Ra4  . This still leaves Black having to be careful: for example,  15...f6  16.Bf4  a6?  17.Bxc7  Rc8  or   17...Rd7  18.Nd6+  Bxd6  19.Rxe6+  Be7  when White isn't in trouble due to a clever defense:  20.Ba5  . White has reasonable chances to unravel and gradually exploit the extra pawn after  20...Kf7  21.Re2  Rd1+  22.Be1  .  18.Nd6+!  Bxd6  19.Rxe6+  Kf7  20.Rxd6  Rxc7  21.Rb4  Re8  22.h4  . This left White a clear pawn to the good in Lorenzo de la Riva-Lillo Castany, Catalan League 2013. }
11. Bf6
{ A neat tactic to exploit the position of the black king and queen, as well as one which has caused many an opponent to go astray. }
11... Qf5
{ Played no doubt in anticipation of  12.Bxd4?  O-O-O  , but White can do much better than that. }
12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. Qxd4 Qd5
{ Only now may it have dawned on Wang that he couldn't touch the bishop:   13...gxf6?  14.Nxf6+  Ke7  . Here White has  15.Nd5+  , and wins. }
14. Qe3
{ A calm retreat. You might have been tempted by   14.Bxg7  , but after  14...Bxg7  15.Nf6+  Kf8  Black is able to fight on. }
14... Qf5
{ Clearly the bishop is taboo due to the fork and it's extremely hard to suggest an improvement here for Black: for example,   14...Qa5  15.Rad1!  . This simply prepares Qd4 and Qd8+!, or to activate:  15...gxf6  16.Nxf6+  Ke7  17.Nd5+  Ke8  18.Qe5  . White has far too strong an attack. }
15. Qd3 { Threatening Nd6+ as the queens continue to dance. } 15... Be7
{ 15...Qd5  would have continued the dance, but...  16.Qg3  ...sees White hit both c7 and g7,  although he might also maintain the theme with   16.Qf3!?  followed by Rad1. }
16. Bxg7
{ There goes an important pawn and White isn't done yet, not by a long way. }
16... Rd8 { The best try, in view of   16...Rg8?  17.Nf6+!  Bxf6  18.Qxf5  . }
17. Nd6+ { Forcing the pace. } 17... Rxd6
{ Of course, Black can't take with the bishop and after   17...cxd6  18.Qxf5  Bxf5  19.Bxh8  he would again just be an exchange down. }
18. Qxf5 Bxf5 19. Bxh8
{ And that was that, as the bishop will make it out after   19.Bxh8  f6  20.Bg7  . }

1. e4 e5
{ In this course we tackle the 'big four', which means that as well as the Open Games, we'll be taking a good look at the ever-popular Sicilian.     Against the French,  1...e6  , it's not so easy to gambit early on, so we'll settle for a space advantage with the easy-to-play Advance variation,  2.d4  d5  3.e5  . Play tends to continue  3...c5  4.c3  Nc6  5.Nf3  Qb6  when we rather like  6.Bd3  and then  6...cxd4  7.O-O!?  , a modern twist on the famous Milner-Barry Gambit and one deployed by Magnus no less.   Black's final big four move is  1...c6  , the Caro-Kann. Here even quite experienced practitioners of that venerable opening may be stunned by  2.Bc4!?  d5  3.Bb3  , Simon's favorite Hillbilly Attack and every inch a gambit. }
2. Nf3 Nf6
{ As well as   2...Nc6  3.Bc4  , we'll also cover the Petroff, as played by Giri here, the Philidor Defence, and the Elephant and Latvian Gambits. White can't gambit in every case, but can be assured of an aggressive game and attacking chances. }
3. d4
{ 3.Nxe5  remains very much the main move, but the aggressive text is a pretty decent alternative, already asking Black questions in the centre. }
3... Nxe4
{ Black's main move. As we'll see in much more detail in our later coverage of the Petroff,   3...exd4  4.e5  Ne4  5.Qxd4  d5  6.exd6  Nxd6  7.Nc3  Nc6  8.Qf4  leaves White's queen brimming with aggressive intent. }
4. dxe5
{ A combative alternative to the main line, 4. Bd3. Now Black normally opts for the solid 4...d5, but, of course, there is a critical alternative. }
4... Bc5 5. Bc4
{ Raising the stakes yet higher and a decent practical choice, especially away from elite level, although as we'll see, even Anish Giri was caught out by this sharp line. Instead, we weren't convinced by  5.Qd5  Bxf2+  6.Kd1  f5!  ,   but  5.Be3!?  isn't such a bad alternative. }
5... Nxf2
{ The right way to capture.   5...Bxf2+?  6.Kf1!  leaves Black's pieces badly coordinated. The large threat is obviously Qd5, so Black must push a pawn:  6...f5?   6...d5!  likely has to be tried, intending 7. exd6? O-O!, but White can do better than that:  7.Qxd5  Qxd5  8.Bxd5  f5  9.exf6  Nxf6  . This leaves White able to continue to strongly force the pace:  10.Kxf2!  Nxd5  11.Re1+  Kf7   11...Kf8?  12.Rd1!  either wins material or leaves Black terribly tied up:  12...Be6  13.c4  Nf6  14.Rd8+  Ne8  15.b3!  . Ba3+ follows or  15...Ke7  16.Bg5+  Kf8  17.Nc3  and Re1 with a decisive initiative.  12.Ne5+  Kf6  13.b3!  . This is again a sneaky switch of direction to bring the bishop powerfully into play, although Black can stay afloat, at least for now:  13...Nb4  14.Na3  N8c6  15.Bb2  Nxe5  16.Rxe5  Kg6  . However, after  17.Kg1!  followed by Re7, Re3 or Rf1, it's hard to believe that he should be able to survive in the long run.  7.exf6  Qxf6  . Now White might already have won a piece in Khusnutdinov-Hovhannisyan, Aeroflot Open, Moscow 2008:  8.Qd3  Qe7   8...d5  9.Bxd5!  doesn't help  and neither does   8...Nc5  9.Qe2+  9.Nc3!  Nxc3   9...Nc5  10.Qe2  traps the bishop on f2  10.Bg5!  Qe2+  The knight won't make it out after this, but what else?   10...Qc5  11.b4!  . Here the attack is simply far too strong, as shown by  11...Qxb4  12.Re1+!  Bxe1  13.Qe3+  Kf8  14.Qf4+  Ke8  15.Qf7  .  11.Qxe2+  Nxe2  12.Kxf2  . }
6. Bxf7+ { As  6.Qd5  Qe7  would defend, White continues to force the pace. }
6... Kxf7
{ Brave, but critical. Even after   6...Kf8  White should go  7.Qd5!  , as we'll explore later on. }
7. Qd5+ Kg6
{ This wouldn't be an easy move to decide on over the board, but is best.  Clearly Black can't go to f8 and e8 isn't ideal:   7...Ke8?  8.Bg5!  causing immediate problems  8...Be7  9.Bxe7  Qxe7  10.Kxf2  . White has regained the piece. Clearly he can't castle here, but he can do so by hand and, meanwhile, Black's king position is hardly one to write home about.   Don't forget that he can't castle and, indeed, Black should be suffering:  10...Na6   10...Qe6  11.Nc3  c6?  12.Qd4  followed by Ne4 would be a positional nightmare for Black.  11.Nc3  Qc5+  The point of Black's last becomes clear, but he is falling even further behind in development.  12.Kg3!  A safe spot for the king and one where it doesn't get in the way of the rooks.  12...Qxd5  13.Nxd5  . Petroff expert GM Bogdan Lalic was caught in this position in Kurnosov-Lalic, 4NCL 2009:  13...b6   13...b5  14.a4  b4  15.Rad1  c6  16.Nf4  had left Black rather tied down and with a rather ugly queenside structure in the earlier Belov-A. Saric, European Individual Championship, Budva 2009.  14.c4  Bb7  15.Rhe1  Rc8  16.e6!  d6  .  Or   16...dxe6  . Here 17. Rad1!? is tempting, as is the direct approach:  17.Rxe6+  Kd7!  Black isn't going to survive after   17...Kf8  18.Ne5  18.Re7+  Kd6  19.Rae1  Bxd5  20.cxd5  Kxd5  . Now White has at least the simple  21.Rxg7  Rhg8  22.Ree7  .  Here a prophylactic approach would have been pretty strong:  17.Rad1!  . White prevents ...Bxd5; cxd5 Nb4 from being annoying, while intending to expand:  17...Rf8  18.h4!?  . This seizes space while preparing Rd4-g4 or Ng5-f7:  18...Bxd5  19.cxd5  c6  20.Rd4!  cxd5  21.Ra4  Nc5  22.Rxa7  Ne4+  23.Kh2  . White will follow up with Rxg7 or Nd4 with excellent chances to win. }
8. Qxc5
{ The bishop should go. White has also tried  8.Rf1  , but doesn't have quite enough for the piece after  8...d6  .   We possibly shouldn't mention this, but in a bullet game you might also wish to consider  8.e6?!  when  8...d6?  9.g4!  is winning for White, but Black is doing well if and only if he finds @@StartFEN@@rnbq3r/pppp2pp/4P1k1/2bQ4/8/5N2/PPP2nPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 8@@EndFEN@@  8...h6!  . }
8... Nxh1 9. Nc3
{ Unable to successfully trouble the black king further for now, White wastes no time in completing his development. He is ready to go Be3 and O-O-O, with Nd5 another handy resource. }
9... d6
{ A natural if risky choice.  Even less advisable is nudging the queen:   9...Qf8?  10.Qc4  . White threatens Nh4+ Kh5; Qe2+! Kxh4; Ne4, trapping Black's king in a mating net. As such, Black might try to escape to h7, but he won't make it:  10...h6   10...d6  prepares a timely ...Bg4, but fails to  11.Qe4+  Bf5  or   11...Kh5  12.e6!  12.Nh4+  Kf7  13.Nxf5  11.Qe4+  Kf7  12.Be3  . White will collect the knight on h1 at his leisure and has too much for the exchange: for example,  12...d6  13.Nd5  Na6?   13...Nc6  is a better try, if still pretty good for White:  14.Nxc7  Rb8  15.e6+  Kg8  16.Bxa7!  , and if  16...Nxa7?  17.e7  14.O-O-O  Be6  Black's cause is already a hopeless one, as we can see too from   14...Kg8?  15.exd6  cxd6  16.Ne7+  Kf7  17.Ng5+!  , which is winning in view of  17...hxg5  18.Rf1+  Ke8  19.Nxc8+  Kd7  20.Rxf8  Rxf8  21.Qe7+  ,  and   14...Qe8!?  15.Rf1  Kg8  16.Qh4!  when the threat of Ne7+ Kh7; Ng5# is a killer  15.exd6  cxd6  or   15...Qxd6  16.Ne5+  Kg8  17.Nf6+!  winning the queen for starters  16.Ng5+!  hxg5  17.Rf1+  . Black is actually getting mated:  17...Kg8  18.Qxe6+  Kh7  19.Rf7!  Qxf7  20.Qxf7  followed by Nf6+ and Qh5# or Ne7 and Qg6#.  This all suggests that Black should free a square for his king with a prophylactic nudge:   9...h6!  10.Qc4  . We'll analyse this in our detailed coverage of the Petroff later on in the course. }
10. Qc4 { A crafty retreat, threatening e6 as well as various checks. } 10...
h6
{ After   10...dxe5?  11.Nxe5+  Kf6  White can do even better than win the queen:  or   11...Kh5  12.Qf7+  g6  13.Qf3+  Kh4  14.Qf4+  Kh5  15.Qh6  12.Qf7+!  Kxe5  13.Bf4+  Kd4  14.O-O-O+  Kc5  15.Be3+  Kb4  16.Qb3+  Ka5  17.Qa4  .   10...Nc6?  11.e6!  would be welcomed, followed by Qg4+ Kf6; Nd5# or...  11...Bxe6  12.Qxe6+  Qf6  13.Nh4+  Kh5  . This position is a good test of your creativity and calculation! What's the only way for White to win?  14.Qe2+!  Kxh4  15.Qe4+  Kh5  16.g4+  Kh4  . Now the point should become clear:  17.g5+  Kh5  18.Qe2+!  Kg6  19.gxf6  Rhe8  20.Be3  and the extra queen will prove far too much.  We should also investigate centralizing the rook:   10...Re8?  . This prevents e6, but permits a check:  11.Nh4+  Kh5  . Unsurprisingly, there is a path to success, albeit only a narrow one:  12.Qf7+!  Kxh4  13.g3+  Kg4  Forcing some accuracy.   13...Kh3?  14.Qh5+  Kg2  15.Qe2+  Kh3  16.Nd5!  , threatens Nf4#, as well as Ne3, or if  16...Rf8  17.Qh5+  Kg2  18.Bf4  followed by the neat Ne3+ Kg1; Ke2#,  and   13...Nxg3  14.hxg3+  is also quite hopeless for Black, and if  14...Kxg3  15.Qf4+  Kh3  16.Ne4!  Qh4+  17.Nf2+  Kg2  18.Qxh4  .  14.Qxg7+!  A check which reminds us of mating with bishop and knight against a lone king; you have to seemingly but not quite fully let the king out of the box at a key moment.  14...Kh3   14...Kf5  makes a run for it:  15.Qf7+  Kxe5  16.Bf4+!  Kd4+  17.Kf1  Bh3+  18.Kg1  . Black's extra rook and knight won't save his hapless king; the threat is mate on d5:  18...d5  or   18...Be6  19.Be3+!  Kxe3  20.Qf4  19.Bxc7  Qd7  or   19...Rf8  20.Qh5  Qd7   20...Qxc7  21.Qxd5+  Ke3  22.Re1  would be worthy of a 19th century odds game  21.Qe5+  Kc4  22.b3+  . Now White mates with checks, be it with Nb1# or via  22...Kc5  23.Ne4+  Kc6  24.Qc3+  Kb5  25.a4+  Ka6  26.Nc5  20.Qf4+  Kc5  21.b4+!  Kc6  22.b5+  Kc5  23.Rd1  . There's simply no defence, and if  23...d4  24.Bd6+!  Qxd6  25.Na4+  Kxb5  26.Qxd6  , picking up the queen while retaining an overwhelming attack.  15.Qxh7+!  Removing another pawn while preparing to re-route the queen with check.  15...Kg2   15...Kg4  16.h3+!  Kxg3  17.Ne2+  forces mate:  17...Kg2  or   17...Kh2  18.Bf4+  Kg2  19.Qg6+  Kxh3  20.O-O-O  18.Qe4+  Kh2  19.Qf4+  Kxh3  20.Ng1+  Kg2  21.Qf3+!  Kxg1  22.Bf4  Rxe5+  23.Kd2+  Re1  24.Rxe1  16.Qe4+  Kh3  Or   16...Kxh2  17.Qe2+  Kh3  18.Qf1+!  Kg4  19.Be3  followed by a decisive 0-0-0, possibly after first Qf4+, or:  19...dxe5  20.Qxh1  Rh8   20...Kf5  21.Qh7+  Ke6  22.Qg6+!  prevents the king from escaping  21.Qe4+  Kh5  22.Nd5  . The attack is overwhelming, 0-0-0 and Rh1+ being on their way.  17.Qxh1!  Remarkably calm - and very strong. Qf1+ Kg4; h3 is the immediate threat.  17...Rxe5+   17...Qf6  18.Bf4  Rxe5+  19.Kf2  transposes  18.Kf2  . Black remains a rook to the good and White's king has also had to move, but there's simply no defence:  18...Qf6+  Or   18...Rf5+  19.Kg1  Kg4  20.Qe4+  Kh3  21.Qg2+  Kg4  22.h3+  Kh5  23.g4+  , collecting the rook en route to forcing mate.  19.Bf4  Qg6   19...Nc6  20.Qg2+  Kg4  21.Qf3+  Kf5  22.Bxe5+  Kxe5  23.Re1+  wins the house  and, unfortunately for Black,   19...Bg4  fails to  20.Qg2  .  20.Bxe5  dxe5  Or   20...Qxc2+  21.Ne2  dxe5  22.Qf3  Qf5  23.Ng1+!  Kxh2  when White can even exchange:  24.Qxf5  Bxf5  . That's because it's mate:  25.Nf3+  Kh3  26.Rh1+  Kg4  27.Rh4  21.Ne4!  Threatening Qg2+ Kg4; Qf3+ Kh3; g4+ and refusing to fear the checks.  21...Qb6+  22.Ke2  Qa6+   22...Bg4+  23.Kf1  merely increases the size of the threat of Nf2+.  23.Kd2  Qh6+  24.Kd3  Qa6+  25.c4  . This leaves Black out of useful checks and quite lost:  25...Qg6  or   25...Bf5  26.Qf1+  Kg4  27.Qe2+  Kh3  28.Qh5+  Kg2  29.Qxf5  26.Qf1+  Kg4  27.h3+  Kh5  28.Qf8!  followed by g4+ or  28...Bxh3  29.g4+!  Kh4  30.Qh8+  Kxg4  31.Rg1+  . A somewhat lengthy, but very fun line! }
11. Nd5 Rf8
{ This cannot have been at all an easy position to navigate with little time and no sight of the board, and unsurprisingly the Dutch superstar goes astray.  With e6! threatened and moving the rook failing, it wasn't easy for Black:   11...Re8  12.Qe4+  Bf5   12...Kf7?  13.Bxh6!  is even worse, as per the game, followed by Ng5+, a direct attack on g7 or  13...gxh6  14.Qh7+  Kf8  15.Qxh6+  Kg8  16.Qg6+  and Nf6  13.Nf4+  Kf7  14.Qxf5+  Kg8  15.e6  .  Black absolutely needs to find   11...c6!  12.Nh4+!?  The most scary move to face over the board. Instead,   12.Nf4+  Kh7  13.Qd3+  Kg8  14.exd6  Na6!  15.Qc4+  was agreed drawn in Legemaat-S.Larsen, correspondence 2009. Here we wanted to make  15.Ng6  work, but after the super accurate  15...Nb4!  16.Qc4+  Kh7  17.Nxh8  Qb6!  Black has enough counterplay to force White into taking the repetition.  12...Kf7  once again,   12...Kh7??  would fall for  13.Nf6+!  13.Nc7+  d5  Another only move in view of   13...Ke7??  14.Ng6+  Kd7  15.Qf7+  .  14.Qf4+  Kg8  , This allows White to negate the threat of ...g5 with a strong advance:  15.e6!  Bxe6  16.Ng6  . Both Black's rooks hang and while he can be materialistic, the defense is far from easy:  16...Rh7   16...Nd7!?  17.Nxh8  Rc8  18.Nxe6  Qe7  is also possible when White needs to return the extra piece:  19.Qf7+!  Qxf7  20.Nxf7  Kxf7  21.Nf4  . We've reached an unbalanced late middlegame, where the onus is surely on Black with his knight still stranded in the corner.  17.Nxe6  Qf6!?  Or   17...Qe8  18.Qf8+  Qxf8  19.Nexf8  . This creates a most visual position, where Black might try to attack c2:  19...Na6!  20.Be3!  Rxf8  21.Nxf8  Kxf8  22.Bxa7  . Here White might, in turn, try to exploit his superior minor piece and potential outside passed pawn after rounding up the knight:  22...c5  23.O-O-O  Nf2  24.Rf1  Ke7  25.Rxf2  .  18.Qxf6  gxf6  . White is certainly not worse here, as shown by:  19.Kf1!?  Nd7  20.Ngf4!  Preparing a regrouping sequence to keep Black's counterplay under control.  20...Re8  21.Bd2  Rhe7  22.Nd4  Re4  23.Nf5  . Indeed, we'd prefer to take his chances, with the active knight-pair in a rather unbalanced and unclear position where one day the stray knight will be collected. }
12. Qe4+ Kf7
{ Yet again Black can't block:   12...Bf5  13.Nh4+  . Here you might wonder about a crazy defence:  13...Kh7  14.Nxf5  Nf2!?  15.Kxf2  g6  . However, White has a decisive check:  16.Nf6+!  Rxf6  17.exf6  Qxf6  18.Qe7+  , which goes a piece ahead. }

{ Invariably played.   7...dxc3  8.Nxc3  should lead to a promising version of a Milner-Barry Gambit for White, who hasn't had to spend time defending e5. Practice has been extremely limited here, but should Black advance his f-pawn, as he's been known to, White need not be too worried:  8...f6   8...f5  9.Be3  Qd8  10.Rc1!  is similar, calmly completing White's development, after which Black can easily run into difficulties: for example,  10...Nge7   10...d4?  fails to a standard tactic on the a4-e8 diagonal:  11.Nxd4  Nxd4  12.Bxd4  Qxd4??  13.Bb5+  11.Nb5  Ng6?  12.Bxf5!  . The bishop is immune:  12...exf5  13.Bg5  Be7  or   13...Qd7  14.e6!  14.Nd6+  Kf8  15.Qxd5  Ncxe5  16.Nxe5  Nxe5  17.Bxe7+  Qxe7  18.Rfe1  . White regains the piece with quite some interest.  9.Be3  Qd8  . This offers White a number of decent continuations, including a simple overprotection of e5:  10.Bb5  Bd7  11.Re1  . Now Nxd5 is on the agenda and Black also needs to be rather wary of the potential check on h5:  11...fxe5?   11...Nge7  12.exf6!  gxf6  13.Nh4  followed by Qh5+ restricts White to lasting compensation.  12.Nxd5!  exd5  13.Nxe5  Be7   13...Nxe5  14.Qh5+  Ng6  15.Bb6+  picks up the black queen.  14.Qxd5  Threatening mate.  14...Nxe5  15.Qxe5  Bxb5  16.Rad1!  Not forgetting to involve all the pieces.  16...Bd7  17.Qxg7  . Black surely shouldn't survive.  After   7...dxc3  8.Nxc3  Black likely does better to develop a piece, but even here White cannot be unhappy:  8...Nge7  Or   8...Bd7  9.Be3!  - here too 9. Re1 is quite viable, as we'll see by transposition in Line C of our detailed French coverage, below -  9...Qd8   9...d4?!  10.Nxd4  Nxd4  no longer drops material to a check on b5, but White will favourably regain the piece after  11.Qg4  10.Rc1  . Here a3 and b4 is one plan, Nb5 another, and there might also be Na4-c5:  10...a6  11.Na4!  b5  . Indeed, here 12. Nc5 is one strong continuation,  12.Nb6  Rb8  13.Nxd7  Qxd7  14.Bxh7!  another, and if  14...Rxh7  15.Qc2  .  9.Re1  9. Be3 is again also an option, and if 9...Qd8 10 Bg5 with the threat of Nb5.  9...Ng6  10.h4!  . We refuse to allow Black to settle and maintain full compensation:  10...Be7  11.g3  . This keeps the knight out of h4. The key, cramping bridgehead on e5 is secure, leaving White with pleasant, lasting compensation: for example,  11...Bd7?!   11...O-O  12.h5  Nh8  13.Qc2  forces an ugly response:  13...g6  . Here White might proceed calmly with  14.a3  .  Even   11...a6!?  12.h5  Nf8  13.h6!  g6  14.Bg5  feels a bit suspicious for Black, with such weak dark squares and White able to go Rc1 and Na4, as well as Qd2  12.h5  Nf8  13.Nb5!  a6   13...Nxe5  14.Nxe5  Bxb5  is a tactic, but:  15.Be3  not forgetting to claim a tempo and heading for d4  15...Qa6  16.h6!  g6   16...gxh6?  17.Qf3  f6  18.Qh5+  is crushing  17.Bxb5+  Qxb5  18.Bd4  Rg8  19.Rc1  . White controls the board and has far too much play for the two pawns with Qf3 next up.  14.Be3  Qa5  15.Nd6+!  Bxd6  16.exd6  Qb4  17.Bf4  . White enjoys excellent play, who is ready to go a3, as well as Ne5, and will also flick in a timely h6 to force further weaknesses. In short, Black is surely too weak on the dark squares.  Before we examine the game continuation, it should be pointed out that   7...Bc5?  8.b4!  Be7  9.b5  Na5  10.Nxd4  followed by Qg4 would leave Black badly cramped,  and that   7...Nge7  8.cxd4  Nf5  , while solid, allows White a fairly pleasant edge with  9.Bxf5  exf5  10.Nc3  Be6  This position is known to theory, but with it being Black's move, White having gone Be2-d3xf5.  11.Na4  Qd8  12.Be3  .

{ Harikrishna wants to press against a weak pawn on c3, but this move doesn't do a huge amount for his development.  As such, you might wonder about Black developing:   8...Nge7  . Here   9.cxd4  Nxd4  10.Nxd4  Qxd4  11.Nf3  is by no means ridiculous and should promise decent compensation and there's also John Watson's line:  9.Nb3!?  This echoes our main game.  9...dxc3  10.bxc3  Ng6  Play is pretty similar after Anish Giri's recommendation:   10...Qc7  11.Qe2  Ng6  . This is from his excellent 'Lifetime Repertoires: French Defense' course and even transposes in the event of the natural continuation  12.Re1  Be7  13.Nbd4  O-O  14.Rb1  11.Qe2  Be7  . The French guru ended his analysis here, which does leave Black ready to complete development, but even here White has lasting compensation:  12.Nbd4  O-O  13.Rb1  13 h4!? very much comes into the equation too  13...Qc7  14.Re1  . Once again, that bridgehead on e5 supplies a cramping influence, the tactics work so that h4 is very much on the agenda and a natural pawn break fails to fully free Black's position:  14...f6  15.Bxg6  hxg6  16.Bf4  fxe5   16...Qd8  17.exf6  Rxf6  runs into  18.Bg5  17.Bxe5  Nxe5  18.Nxe5  . You'll rarely see such a fine knight-pair and one ideally placed to target Black's weaknesses.  As such, the critical line is likely the materialistic exchange:   8...dxc3  9.bxc3  Qc7  . This occurred in a subsequent game. Now Carlsen might have gone 10. Qe2, which could easily transpose to our main game, and there's also a rather sensible option in:  10.Re1  Nge7  11.Nb3  Ng6  12.Qe2  . This was Schmakel-Escalante Ramirez, Internet  blitz 2020, where play continued instructively:  12...Be7  13.Nbd4  a6  It's actually not clear how much Nb5 Qd8 inconveniences Black, so this isn't forced:   13...O-O!?  14.Rb1  . We quite like this rook nudge, the idea is revealed after...  14...Rac8?!  15.h4!  ....when Black doesn't have any tactics involving ...Ncxe5 and ...Qxc3 and so is just in some trouble, with h5 next up or if  15...Nxh4?  16.Nxh4  Bxh4  17.Qh5  .  14.Rb1  Rc8?!  Watson points to an improvement:   14...Nxd4  15.cxd4  . However, even here Black is a little cramped:  15...O-O  16.h4!  . Again the tactics work, as if  16...Bxh4?  17.Bxg6  fxg6  18.Nxh4  .  15.h4!  Bxh4?   15...h6  would have been the lesser evil, if still pretty pleasant for White:  16.h5  Nf8  17.Bf4  . This keeps Black rather cramped and has definite ideas of Qe3, Nxc6, Nd4 and Qg3 to increase the pressure.  16.Nxh4  Nxh4  17.Ba3  It was well worth a second pawn to prevent Black from castling.  17...Nxd4  18.cxd4  Bc6  19.Qg4  Ng6  . Now, as shown by Watson in his annotations for ChessPublishing, there's a strong move with a simple idea:  20.Re3!  Qd7  21.Rh3  . White tees up a sacrifice on h7, as well as intending to crash through with f4-f5. }
9. Nb3
{ Carlsen is determined to force Black to exchange on c3, as otherwise White could now make a positionally desirable recapture with Nbxd4. }
9... dxc3 10. bxc3 Qc7
{ 10...Nge7!?  might be a more precise move order:  11.Rb1  Qc7  12.Re1  . Even here after White would maintain full compensation thanks to his grip on the position. Once again, Qe2 and h4-h5 might well be seen and there are also ideas of Nbd4-b5.  Note too that Black shouldn't be too ambitious, or to keep trying to make some exchanges if you prefer:   10...Na5?!  11.Rb1  Nxb3  12.Rxb3  Qc7  13.Ng5!  . With this idea of Watson's, White seizes the initiative:  13...Qxe5!  14.Re1  Qf6  . Here White can either snaffle h7 or take full control of the board with  15.Rxb7  Bc5  16.Qe2  . }
11. Re1 Nge7
{ 11...Na5  would head for c4, but White should not mind exchanges:  12.Nxa5  Qxa5  13.Rb1  b6  14.Bd2  . Qe2 and Nd4 may follow or even Ng5, once again looking to turn White's lead in development into a handy initiative. }
12. h4
{ Carlsen continues vigorously and finds a decent alternative to the simple   12.Rb1  , which is ever a useful move, as we've seen above. }
12... Ng6
{ Here too John Watson pointed out that Black might have activated on the queenside.   12...Na5!?  is possible when 13. Nxa5 Qxa5 14. Bd2 Qa4! is now a little annoying. As such, perhaps Carlsen would have gone forwards:  13.Ng5!?   13.Nbd4!?  Qxc3  14.Rb1  is also possible, threatening Nb5 and surely leaving White with decent practical compensation in a highly unclear position.  Qxc3   13...Nxb3  14.axb3  Qxc3  enables the rook to leap into the game with  15.Rxa7  .  14.Nxf7!  Nxb3!   14...Kxf7  15.Qf3+  Kg8  16.Bd2  favourably regains the piece on a5.  15.Nd6+  Kd8  . That said, here it's not so easy to see a good way for White to avoid the repetition on offer. }
13. Qe2
{ Naturally White wants to hang on to his key advanced pawn at all costs. }
13... Be7
{ Prevention is even worse than the disease here:   13...h5?!  . Here White can either whip off the knight or keep Black rather tied up:  14.Bd2!?  Be7  15.g3  . That h5 point would be rather tender after  15...O-O  16.Nbd4  . }
14. h5
{ Forcing the pace and in an unfamiliar position, and at such a fast time control, it's no surprise that Harikrishna now loses his way. }
14... Ngxe5
{ Creative, but it just doesn't quite work.  No doubt the Indian no.2 was rather concerned by the alternative:   14...Nh4  15.Nxh4  Bxh4  16.Qg4  . However, the engines show that Black can just about stay afloat here:  16...Nxe5!  17.Rxe5  Bxf2+  18.Kxf2  Qxe5  . That said, this feels rather risky to a human!  19.Bd2  Watson's idea of   19.Ba3!?  Rxc3  20.Qb4  Qf6+  21.Ke2  is also rather dangerous-looking.  O-O  20.Re1  Qf6+  21.Kg1  . In practice one would surely take White's minor pieces, dark-square control and attacking chances over Black's extra rook and pawns. }
15. Nxe5 Qxe5 16. Qxe5 Nxe5 17. Rxe5 Bf6
{ The point of Black's play, but he may have overlooked White's calm response. }
18. Re3 Rxc3

19. Rb1
{ Calm, materialistic and strong play from Carlsen. With so many pieces still on the board, Black's three pawns are not enough for the piece. }

20. Rg3
{ Carlsen wants to keep playing actively. Black's king is not going to be a happy bunny for some time to come. }
20... O-O 21. Bb2 Rfc8

30. Nxa7 Rb4 31. Nb5 Rb2 32. Rc1

4... g6
{ This tempo-gaining advance has been played fractionally more than the alternative.   4...e6  blocks in the light-squared bishop on c8:  5.Nc3  Nf6  and now we'll focus below on  6.Qh4  ,  but   6.Qe2  is also possible, as played by a great fan of the Hillbilly Attack, the Icelandic GM Bragi Thorfinnsson. His idea isn't to regain the pawn, but to continuing offering a pawn to open lines, i.e.  6...Nbd7  7.f3!?  exf3  8.Nxf3  . The position should be compared with a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit and you might like the look of the half-open e- and f-files. Objectively White shouldn't have quite enough compensation, but he will get to attack:  8...Nc5   8...Bd6  9.d4  O-O  10.O-O  c5  would be a logical try to free Black's position when perhaps Bragi would have got his king off a key diagonal:  11.Kh1!?  and only then Bg5.  9.d4  Nxb3  10.axb3  Be7  11.O-O  O-O  12.Bf4  b6  13.Rad1  . This was Br. Thorfinnsson-Halldorsson, Icelandic League 2018. White has calmly centralised all his pieces and is ready to head forwards with Ne5. You may be sceptical that White can land a powerful blow against Black's solid position, but that's also a slightly cramped one and just watch what happened in the game:  13...Nd5   13...Bb7  14.Ne5  c5!  would have slightly favoured Black, since White shouldn't be able to drum up quite enough play:  15.dxc5  Bxc5+  16.Kh1  Qc8  . That said, he can certainly have a good go beginning with  17.Rd3!  .  14.Bc1  Nxc3  15.bxc3  Bb7?!  Natural, but Black really needed to prevent White's next.   15...f6!  16.c4  Bd7  17.Bf4  is a little passive for Black, but at least his structure is solid and he can break out with ...a5-a4.  16.Ne5!  Qc7  Not the best of squares for Black's queen, but his passive position isn't so easy to play, something which is even the case after a natural break:   16...c5  17.dxc5  Bxc5+  18.Kh1  . Black suddenly finds himself in some trouble, as we can see from:  18...Qc8?   18...Qh4?  19.Rf4  leaves the queen without a good square and  19...Qe7  20.Rd7  wins a piece,  but   18...Bd6!  19.Ba3  Bxa3!  20.Rxd8  Raxd8  should only be slightly better for White after, say,  21.h4!?  .  19.Bh6!!  There's simply no good defense to the threat of Bxg7, e.g.  19...gxh6   19...--  20.Bxg7!  Kxg7  21.Qg4+  Kh8  22.Rxf7  20.Qg4+  Kh8  21.Nxf7+  Rxf7  22.Rxf7  wins.  17.Rd3  Bd6  18.Rh3  A dream attack post for the rook.  18...f6?   18...c5  simply had to be tried, intending 19. Qh5? Be4, and leaving everything to play for:  19.Ng4  or even the startling 19. Rf6!?, which Black must decline.  19.Qh5  g6?   19...g5  20.Ng4  f5  21.Qxg5+  Qg7  22.Qxg7+  Kxg7  23.Bh6+  would have been a sign of desperation, but was Black's last try to prolong the struggle.  20.Nxg6!  Rf7  Hopeless, but there was no defense:   20...hxg6  21.Qh8+  Kf7  22.Rxf6+  is also a killer, and if  22...Ke8  23.Rxf8+  Bxf8  24.Rh7  Qd6  25.Qg8  21.Ne5!  Bxe5   21...fxe5  22.Rxf7  Qxf7  23.Rg3+  Kf8  24.Bh6+  Ke7  25.Rg7  picks up the queen while maintaining the initiative.  22.dxe5  f5  23.Bg5  Black's dark squares are simply too weak.  23...Raf8  or   23...Qxe5  24.Re3  followed by Rg3 or  24...Qc5  25.b4  Qc4  26.Bh6  24.Bf6  Rxf6  25.exf6  1-0.

{ Time-trouble. White should not exchange queens with his king so badly restricted.   33.Qd1  would have retained control and good winning chances.  There was also   33.Rd8!  : for example,  33...Rxd8?!   33...Qxf3  34.Rxe8+  Kf7  35.gxf3  Kxe8  36.Kg2  should be winning - with care  34.Qxe4  Rd1+  35.Be1  Bf2  36.Qg6+  Kf8  37.Qxh6+  Ke7  38.Qxg5+  , leaving the black king out of safe squares. }
33... Rxe4 34. Rd5
{ Creating some much-needed luft with   34.h4!?  also came very much into the equation, and if  34...g4?  35.Rg7+  . }
34... Bf2 35. Re5 Ra4
{ Berg has defended well with his nifty rook manoeuvre and after   35...Rxe5  36.Bxe5  Kf7  was ready to seize some much-needed space with  37.g4!  , with good winning chances in the bishop ending. }
36. a3 Rc4 37. Re2 Bb6 38. Be1
{ Simple chess in the run-up to the time control.  Objectively   38.Re7!?  was likely a stronger try, and if  38...Bf2  39.h4!  Bxh4  40.Kg1  , returning a pawn to crucially bring the king into play. }
38... Kf7 39. Bf2
{ Easy to criticise, but even after a superior version of the same plan, Black may be active enough to hold: for example,   39.b3!?  Rc7  40.c4  Rd7  41.Rd2  Re7  42.Bf2  Bxf2  43.Rxf2  Re1+  44.Kh2  Ke6  . }
39... Bxf2 40. Rxf2 Kg6
{ Allowing White some chances. Black should have claimed an open file:   40...Rd4  41.Kg1  Rd1+  42.Rf1  Rd2  43.Rc1  Ke6  . Here Black should be active enough to hold with ...h5 and ...g4 on their way. }
41. Rd2 h5 42. Kg1 g4
{ Consistent, but now White's king is in play and Berg now gradually edges forward. }
43. Kf2 a5 44. c3 { Freeing the rook for action. } 44... a4 45. Rd5 Re4 46. Ra5
{ Trying to tie down the black rook, but White might have done better to reduce Black's potential counterplay with   46.h4!?  . }
46... Kh6 47. Rb5 Kg6
{ Refusing to fear Rb4.   47...gxh3  48.gxh3  Re3  is a fairly easy draw:  49.Rb4  Rxh3  50.Rxa4  Rh2+  51.Kf3  Rxb2  52.Kxf4  Rb3  53.c4  h4  . }
48. Ra5
{ Play would have been very similar after   48.Rb4  Kf5  49.h4  g3+  50.Kf1  Re8  51.Rxa4  Kg4  , which is very similar to the game, but with Black's rook more actively placed on e8 than e3 - and that looks like a sizeable gain for him:  52.Rd4  Kxh4  53.Rxf4+  Kg5  54.Rf3  h4  55.a4  Rd8  and despite White's trio of connected passed pawns, it's far from clear that he can win. }
48... Kh6 49. Rb5 Kg6 50. h4 { Berg is determined to win, if he can. } 50...
Re3
{ 50...f3!  51.gxf3  Rf4  was a nifty way to open lines:  52.Rb4  Rxf3+  53.Kg2  Rd3  54.c4  Kf5  and Black is surely active enough. }
51. Rb4 g3+ 52. Kf1 Kf5 53. Rxa4 Kg4
{ The point of Black's play, but after White's next his rook turns out to be not at all well placed. }
54. Rd4 Re8
{ 54...Kxh4  55.Rxf4+  Kg5  56.Rf8!  reveals an important difference with the note to White's 48th move, and Black's counterplay with his h-pawn is surely too slow. }
55. a4 Rf8 56. Ke2 Re8+
{ White is also in control and too quick after   56...Kxh4  57.Kf3  Kg5  58.Rd5+  Kg6  59.a5  . }
57. Kf1 Rf8 58. a5
{ The pawns would have proved too strong too after   58.b4!  Kxh4  59.c4  . }
58... Kxh4 59. a6 Kg4 60. a7 h4
{ Berg has staked everything on his a-pawn, but the win is no longer so easy especially with little time remaining. }
61. Rb4 { Forcing Black's rook to a8 ahead of going behind the pawn... } 61...
Ra8 62. Rb7
{ ...only for White to fail to do so.   62.Ra4!  h3  63.Kg1!  wins, as Black doesn't have quite enough resources:  63...h2+  64.Kh1  Re8  or   64...Kf5  65.b4  f3  66.gxf3  Kf4  67.Kg2  65.Ra1  Ra8  66.b3!  and not   66.b4??  f3  67.b5  f2!  68.b6  Re8  when Black even wins  f3  67.Ra4+  Kf5  68.gxf3  . }
62... h3 63. Rg7+ Kf5
{ Returning the favour just when Black could have drawn.   63...Kh4  64.Rh7+  Kg4  65.gxh3+  Kf3  66.Kg1  Rd8  67.Rd7!?  Re8  68.Re7  Rd8  69.Re1  Ra8  70.Ra1  Ke2  71.Kg2  f3+!  72.Kxg3  f2  followed by ...Rxa7, as pointed out by Berg. }
64. gxh3 Kf6 65. Rg4 Kf5 66. Rg7
{ 66.Kg2!?  wouldn't have repeated to emphasise control and gain time on the clock, but might have avoided some adventures. }
66... Kf6 67. Rg4
{ 67.Rd7!  was ice-cool and a simpler method:  67...Ke6  or   67...f3  68.Rd3  68.Rb7  f3  69.Rg7  , thereby picking up both black pawns with an easy win. }
67... Kf5
{ 67...Ke5!?  was worth a try, even if White is still winning thanks to an accurate sequence:  68.Rg5+!  Ke4  69.Ra5  f3  unfortunately for Black,   69...Kf3  70.b4  g2+  71.Kg1  Re8  72.a8=Q+  comes with check  70.c4!  , which clears the third rank just in the nick of time. }
68. Kg2 Rd8 { 68...Rxa7  69.Kf3  Ra4  transposes. } 69. a8=Q Rxa8 70. Kf3 Ra4
71. b4 Ra3
{ 71...g2!?  was the last try, although White is surely winning:  72.Rxf4+  Ke5  73.Re4+  Kf5  74.Re1  . }
72. Rxf4+ { A titanic tussle. } *

13... h6
{ It's much easier for an engine than a human to want to go   13...O-O  14.Bxf6  gxf6  as Black. Here White might continue in unhurried fashion with  15.Nc2  :  15...Bxc4  16.Qxc4  Qe6  17.Qe2  Ne7  18.Ne3  .   This retains excellent compensation. The simple plan is Rf3 and Raf1, with Qh5 and Ng4 other important possibilities. Note not just how well placed the knight on e3 is, but how White doesn't need to rush. }
14. Bxf6 gxf6 15. Rf2

{ Adams digs in, but unfortunately for Black his kingside weaknesses aren't going away and it's just much easier for White to improve his pieces. }

17... Kf8
{ Heading for g7, but Black is certainly suffering after this. As such, he should likely have tried to disrupt with   17...Bg4!  18.Qe3  Be6  when  19.Be2!  is probably only slightly better for White. }
18. Ne3 { Clamping down on Black's two main weaknesses, d5 and f5. } 18... Nb8

23. Qf4 Rd6

30... Kh8 { Freeing up g8 for any rook retreat. } 31. Rfe1 a5

Nc6  7.Re1  just looks like an excellent version of our anti-Two Knights Defence coverage. Bc4 is next up or if  7...Qc5?  8.Bd3  , simply trapping the knight and leaving Black set to lose a miniature after  8...f5  9.exf6  d5  10.Nbd2  . }
6. Qxd4 h5

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6
{ The solid Petroff Defence. These days your opponent is likely to be either expecting the main line with  3.Nxe5  d6  4.Nf3  Nxe4  5.d4  d5  6.Bd3  or here the fashionable  5.Nc3  variation, but White has another aggressive choice, and one with plenty of grandmaster supporters. }

4... d6
{ 4...Bc5  is logical and play can quickly become very sharp after  5.Bc4!?  , as we'll see in Line A1,   while Line A2 will focus on the solid main line,  4...d5  and then  5.Be3!? }
5. Bc4 { To stay afloat Black really needs to find } 5... c6

15... Bd7 16. Nxc7 { It's time to cash in before Black simply goes ...Rc8. }
16... Qxe7 17. Qxe7 Nxe7 18. Nxa8
{ Taking stock, White has regained the rook, but in view of his own trapped knight, he should only emerge slightly for choice, as is the case after  18...Kf7  19.Nc7  Rc8  20.Bxa7  Rxc7  21.Kd2  Ng3  22.hxg3  Nf5  23.Bf2  While the g-pawns are doubled, one of them is an extra pawn and White can aim to combine playing actively  (Rf1 and g4-g5)  with an advance of his queenside majority, probably best begun with b3 and c4. }

{ An old pet line of Jobava's and a move which may surprise even booked-up opponents. Indeed, you won't find it in Lakdawala's 2019 work 'The Petroff Defence' or his earlier 'The Petroff: Move by Move'.   White develops the bishop before going Nbd2. Instead,   5.Bd3  Nc5  is very solid for Black and while White's main move,  5.Nbd2  , is a decent try for the advantage, it can become pretty theoretical, whether Black exchanges on  d2  , goes  5...Nc5  or even tries Fabiano Caruana's  5...Qd7!?  . }
5... Be7
{ A solid choice, as well as that of Alexander Grischuk's and also Black's most popular response in the limited practice there's been thus far with 5. Be3. It's far from obligatory though. }

6... O-O 7. c3
{ White increases his control over  d4  , thereby taking most of the sting out of any  ...c5  advance. Jobava has also tested the immediate  7.Bd3  , but do avoid  7.Nxe4?!  dxe4  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Ng5  Nc6  which merely helps Black to develop. }
7... Nc6 { Black wants to obtain counterplay against e5. } 8. Qc2
{ Forcing the pace and this as-yet-untested approach is probably a better choice than allowing  8.Bd3  Bc5!  . }
8... Nxd2 9. Qxd2 Bg4
{ Consistent play from Black, but now White can reveal one of the main points to his move order. }
10. O-O-O Bxf3
{ This must be critical.   10...Nxe5?  11.Nxe5  Bxd1  12.Qxd1  would be excellent for White with the minor pieces and attacking chances,  and   10...Be6?!  11.Bd3  also looks rather attractive with h4 and Ng5 on their way, not to mention a timely Bc2 and Qd3. }
11. gxf3 Nxe5
{ There's no other real move for Black and at least this way he gets the queens off. }
12. Qxd5 Qxd5 13. Rxd5 Nxf3 14. h4
{ By no means forced, but the most critical move. White's activity and bishop-pair supply full compensation, as they certainly do after }
14... Bf6
{ Unsurprisingly Black can't snaffle a second pawn with   14...Bxh4??  because of  15.Be2  ,  and   14...Nxh4?!  15.Rh5  Rfe8   15...Ng6  16.Rxh7  Rad8  17.Kc2  followed by Bd3 and Bd4 does not look too appealing for Black  16.R1xh4  Bxh4  17.Rxh4  also looks rather attractive for White with two such fine bishops and very much the chance to target the black queenside as well as kingside. }

5... Ba6 6. Bxa6 Nxa6 7. h5
{ Consistent. In such a fairly closed position there's plenty of time for such manoeuvring and, in any case, it's not as if Black is able to make active use of his early queenside development. }
7... c5 8. Ne2
{ Keeping the f-pawn unobstructed and f3 free for the other knight. } 8... f6
{ Criticised by Movsesian, but one can hardly blame Tibensky for wanting some counterplay.   8...Ne7  9.Nd2  Nc6  10.Nf3  would largely have denied Black any play.   Here Black's king clearly won't be happy on the kingside and even  10...O-O-O  11.a4!?  feels a little risky for him. White might castle short or, perhaps better, leave the king on f1 and is already ready to strike, as we can see from  11...Be7?!  12.a5!  , and if  12...Nxa5?  13.dxc5!  when Black has nothing better than  13...Nxc5  14.b4!  Nab3  15.bxc5  Nxa1  16.cxb6  axb6  17.Be3  Qa7  18.O-O  , excellent for White though this must be on account of his much safer king position after picking up the stray knight. }
9. Bf4 Ne7
{ 9...fxe5!?  10.Bxe5  Nb8  might have been a better try, regrouping the knight and leaving White only slightly for choice after, say,  11.Qd3!?  Nc6  12.Nd2  Nxe5  13.dxe5  when the queen may take up residence on g3 or h3 and White would also quite like to advance the f- and g-pawns. }

{ Here and on the next move, Black might have tried   12...f5!?  , which would have been preferable to what occurs in the game, if still very pleasant for White:  13.Qd3  Nab8  14.Bg5  Be7  15.Nf4  . White has an ideal piece configuration and options to increase the pressure with a timely c4 break. }
13. Re1 Be7 14. exf6

25. Qc2 Ke8 26. Rxc4
{ Regaining his pawn. One might imagine White would have had to sacrifice, for instance, an exchange to enjoy much the more active and better coordinated pieces so, but, no, the material count is level. Tibensky has been completely outplayed. }

15. h5
{ Hector knows no fear and typically plunges into complications, but a decent case might have been made for the calmer   15.a3  Nbc6  16.Bd3  followed by Bf4 and Rc1, which would ideally tee up b4 and Qd2 to follow. }
15... gxh5
{ The German IM is up to the challenge and avoids the obvious   15...g5?  on account of  16.Nh2!  , which isn't just a thematic retreat in such a position, but also a pretty strong one, as shown by  16...Bg7  17.Ng4  Qb6  18.Nf6+  Bxf6?  19.exf6  , leaving the knight on e7 badly short of a good square. }

18. Qh3 Qc4 { Again preventing Ng4, but now White can gain a useful tempo. }
19. Bh4
{ 19.f4  would likely have also netted the exchange, but after  19...Rxg3!  20.Qxg3  Nf5  Black would again have enjoyed a fair amount of activity in return for it. }
