1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Be7 {This move is quite common against 3. Nd2. However
against 3. Nc3 it is not effective as White's pieces develop quickly and White
creates a lot of weaknesses on Black's kingsde. IM Demidov had several games in
this variation from the Black side.} 4. e5 $1 {Not the only way to fight for an
advantage. White has several other interesting options which I looked at but I
came to the conclusion that 4. e5 is both simple and effective.} 4... c5 (
4... b6 {Black is trying to exchange his light-squared bishop, quite a common
theme in most of the French variations. The majority of the games went 5. Nf3,
then 5. Qg4 and 5. h4. I like} 5. Nce2 {here for White as he is able to get the
upper hand with a rather simple plan. We are temporarily crossing Black's bishop
exchanging plans, although we are not completely against it if we manage to get
some targets on the kingside in return. White has natural squares for his pieces
and he plans to go Nf3 and then either develop the bishop with the g3-move or
even allow the bishop exchange under favourable circumstances. The same thing
cannot be said about Black's development as he will mainly struggle with the
g8-knight.} 5... Ba6 6. c3 c5 7. Nf3 {White managed to have a compact central
pawn formation. He will further develop with the natural g3 and Bg2, or perhaps
even h4 taking some space on the kingside and Bh3. If he manages to stop Black's
knight from coming to f5  (meaning if he manages to swap it for his bishop),
White is also fine with playing Nf4 and accepting the ...Ba6xf1 exchange.}
7... h5 (7... Nc6 8. g3 h5 { Black needs to get the g8-knight out somehow so
...h5 is more of a developing rather than attacking move. Because the knight
would be simply monstrous on f5, White would be more than happy to kill it on h6
with his bishop. Therefore a waiting game begins, as Black wants to go ...Nh6
only after the Bc1's diagonal is blocked...} 9. h4 {Actually Black can get to
this crossroad in more ways and the same position arises after 7. .. .h5 too. In
the main line we analyse 9...g6, here we will focus on other options for Black.}
9... Qd7 {Black is waiting for White's knight to move from e2 to f4, which would
allow Black to get his jumping beast to f5 via h6.} ({It is true that after} 
9... cxd4 10. Nexd4 { (White is hesitant to allow the check on b4 after
recapturing with a pawn)} 10... Bxf1 {Black manages to execute his bishop
exchanging plan, but as anything in life, it comes at a cost. White's knights
occupy the d4-square, the light squares on Black's queenside are quite weak and
Black still needs to solve the matter of developing his kingside.}) (9... Qc8
{forces us to change our plans a bit. The queen is obviously not so well placed
on c8, but it has a clever idea against our favorite Nf4 set-up in mind. We
should develop normally with} 10. Bh3 {and let Black untangle his strange
queenside piece placement. At some point he will have to either play .. .Qd7 and
lose a tempo or go for} (10. Be3 Nh6 11. Bxh6 Rxh6 12. Nf4 {does not work so
well due to the a6-bishop being covered. White has some troubles keeping
everything under control, say} 12... cxd4 13. cxd4 Bb4+ $19 {and White loses the
d4-pawn.}) 10... cxd4 11. Nexd4 Nxd4 12. Nxd4 {once again giving us the
d4-square.} 12... Bc5 {Seemingly now Black can develop his knight to e7 safely,

preparing the} 13... Ne7 14. b4 $1 $18 {trick}) 10. Be3 Nh6 (10... cxd4
11. Nexd4 Bxf1 12. Kxf1 {having the d4-square under control, is as always quite
nice for White}) 11. Bxh6 Rxh6 12. Nf4 $14 { White has a pleasant position
here.}) (7... g5 {Another French style move which is effective in 4. Nd2 setups.
Here white has several choices. I chose} 8. h4 {which is quite forcing, but
White can also play the simple Be3.} 8... g4 (8... gxh4 9. Nf4 Bxf1 10. Kxf1
{Black is temporarily a pawn up. However White's position is much better as
Black cannot develop his pieces easily and it's only a matter of time before the
weak h4 pawn falls.}) 9. Ng5 Qd7 (9... h6 $2 {Many Black players would be
tempted to win a piece here! White does not need to worry about anything here
thanks to the following tactics.} 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Nf4 $18 {At first sight it
might look premature to judge this position as being lost but Black is unable to
prevent the White queen from penetrating his defences.} 11... Bxf1 (11... h5
{also does not stop White due to} 12. Bxa6 Nxa6 13. Qd3 $1 {double attacking the
knight and the g6-square.}) 12. Qxg4 Ke8 13. Kxf1 {Like in a game of checkers
Black loses all his pawns. And White attack continues!}) 10. Nf4 Bxf1 11. Qxg4
$1 {We should not hesitate here otherwise Black might be able to fortify the
kingside.} (11. Kxf1 Nh6 {and it is not so easy to break through Black's
defences.} (11... h6 $2 {is of course the kind of position we enjoy.} 12. Nxf7
$1 Kxf7 13. Qxg4 {Black cannot defend from all the checks White's queen is about
to deliver, e.g.} 13... Bf8 14. Qh5+ Ke7 15. Ng6+ $18 {winning a rook.}))

...h6 as} 12. Nxf7 $1 Kxf7 13. Qh5+ Kf8 14. Rh3 $18 {with Rf3 to follow is a
killer.}) 12. Qh5 Bxg5 13. hxg5 Bxg2 14. Nxg2 Nf5 15. Ne3 $16 {White has the
better pawn structure (especially the h7-pawn is very likely to become a
target), more space and a safer king.}) 8. h4 Nc6 9. g3 {Remember we need to
have the BxNh6 option so that Black's knight cannot get to f5. Therefore we
refrain from playing Nf4 too soon. For more information about this little tabiya
you can see the 7...Nc6 move order too as we discuss some clever ways for Black
to shake up our setup there.} 9... g6 10. Bh3 Nh6 11. O-O {Because we cannot go
for the Nf4 plan with bishop on h3 anymore, it is time to change the set-up.} (
11. Bxh6 Rxh6 12. O-O {is a legal position too but what to do about the bishop
on h3?}) 11... Nf5 12. Bxf5 gxf5 13. Re1 $16 {Now White's plan is to exchange
the dark-squared bishops on g5 and doing so gain the f4 and g5-squares for his
knights.}) 5. Qg4 {Making use of the obvious downside of Black's 3rd move. The
g7-pawn is under attack and it is not so easy to defend it.} 5... g6 (5... g5 $6
{This is a very courageous defence to say the least.} 6. dxc5 (6. Qh5 {Equally
good and stopping Black's advancement of h5.} 6... cxd4 7. Nb5 Nc6 8. Nf3 a6
9. Nxg5 $1 {Black was asking for trouble and he surely is getting into some.
White threatens to capture on f7.} 9... Nxe5 10. Nxe6 $1 {Another nice blow.
There is no choice for Black but} 10... Bxe6 11. Qxe5 Bf6 12. Nc7+ Kd7 13. Nxe6
$1 {Black can choose either a bad middlegame with his king being on the run in
the centre or a miserable endgame with a broken pawn structure.} 13... Qa5+ (
13... fxe6 14. Qe2 Qc7 15. g3 {Getting a nice outpost for the black-squared
bishop.} 15... Ne7 16. Bf4 e5 17. Bd2 $14 {White lured Black pawns forward and
after Bh3+ he will start attacking them with c2-c3. After he liquidates Black's
centre Black's king will be very vulnerable.}) 14. Bd2 Qxd2+ (14... Bxe5
15. Nf8+ $1 {is quite an important move, not allowing Black to improve his
structure with ...fxe6.} 15... Rxf8 16. Bxa5 Re8 17. O-O-O $14 { There is no
doubt that White has a comfortable advantage here. His bishop pair is very
strong and Black's isolated pawns on the d-file will be very tough to defend.})
15. Kxd2 Bxe5 16. Nc5+ Kc6 17. Nd3 $14 {Even though there are opposite-coloured
bishops on board Black's defensive task is far from being easy. Moreover since
the d5-pawn is on a white square it is impossible for the Black bishop to help
defending it. White will put a sniper on g2 and start besieging the weakness
very soon.}) 6... Nc6 (6... h5 7. Qe2 Nc6 8. h3 { Stopping the ...g4 push before
White develops his knight to f3.} 8... Bxc5 9. Nf3 Be7 10. Bd2 {followed by
O-O-O. It is quite difficult for Black to play this position as his king has
nowhere to hide. Castling kingside would be an obvious suicide after ...g5 and
...h5, but at the same time it cannot go queenside because Black needs to
constantly protect g5, therefore Black's queen cannot leave its d8 stand.})
7. Nf3 h5 8. Qg3 {This is a more reasonable try for Black as White's queen might
feel a bit uncomfortable on the kingside.} 8... g4 (8... Nb4 9. Kd1 {is not such
a horrible concession considering Black cannot really defend his kingside after}
9... g4 10. Ne1 $14 {with h2-h3 to come.}) 9. h3 $1 {This is an important move
to remember after 6. dxc5.} 9... gxf3 10. Qg7 { White will regain the sacrificed
piece and enjoy a better endgame with the bishop pair advantage.} 10... Bf6 (
10... fxg2 11. Bxg2 Bf6 12. exf6 Qxf6 13. Qxf6 Nxf6 14. Be3 $14 {is more
peaceful and good for White too. Black's bishop is suffocating behind black
pawns and White's spatial advantage should tell in the long run. He will surely
castle and then he can start bothering Black with Nb5 or just tighten the grip
with f2-f4.}) 11. exf6 Qxf6 12. Qxf6 Nxf6 13. gxf3 Nd4 14. Nb5 $1 {A bit more
tactics is needed before all the smokes clear.} 14... Nxc2+ (14... Nxb5
15. Bxb5+ Bd7 16. Bd3 $16 {leaves White a pawn up and with the bishop pair.})
15. Kd1 Nxa1 16. Nc7+ Ke7 17. Nxa8 $16 {White's knight will be able to get back
into the game as any attempts by the Black king to trap it will be stopped by
white bishops from b5 and f4. It is difficult to say the same thing about its
Black counterpart on a1 though. White will get his knight out with Nc7, then
develop his bishop to f4 and collect the unfortunate beast on a1 with his king.}) (
5... Kf8 {The} 6. dxc5 {reaction is a good one against all moves defending g7.
Unsurprisingly Black will have troubles with king in this line.} 6... h5 (
6... Bxc5 7. Nf3 {Simple development works very well.} 7... Nc6 8. Bd3 Nge7
9. O-O Ng6 10. Re1 $14 {The e5-pawn was secured and now White can start
disrupting Black's kingside with an h-pawn push. There is no obvious way for the
defender to untangle his pieces.}) 7. Qd1 Bxc5 8. Nf3 Nd7 9. Bd3 { Again White
is keeping things simple, mobilizes the rest of his army and counts on the
awkward position of opponent's king.} 9... Ne7 10. O-O a6 11. Bf4 Nc6 12. Qd2
$14 {White can strengthen the e5-outpost with Rae1, then possibly start focusing
on the kingside.}) (5... Bf8 6. dxc5 {White does not really hope to hold the
c5-pawn for long but he definitely intends to cause Black some inconvenience
while Black is recovering it.} 6... h5 7. Qf4 Nc6 8. Nf3 Bxc5 { Eventually Black
managed to get his pawn back but he paid a high price. Three bishop moves and
weakening the queenside is a bit too much.} 9. Be3 {Naturally. If the Black
bishop disappears, then all the time it spend going back and forth was wasted.}
9... Be7 ({Besides,} 9... Bxe3 10. fxe3 {gives White an easy plan of O-O-O and
e3-e4.}) 10. Bd3 {Black's knight will most likely come to h6 and threaten to
jump to both f5 and g4, therefore we should take some countermeasures as soon as
possible.} (10. O-O-O Nh6 11. h3 {is also acceptable, though my recommendation
is to secure the f5-square too.} (11. Kb1 Ng4 {is a move we'd like to avoid.})
11... Nf5 12. Kb1 Nxe3 13. fxe3 g5 14. Qg3 h4 {It is a playable position for
White but it might be not so easy to break the black-squared fortress without a
black-squared bishop.}) 10... Nh6 ({ It is true that} 10... Nb4 {takes the
bishop pair but at the same time it leaves the d4-square for White's knight
unattended.} 11. O-O-O Nxd3+ 12. Rxd3 Nh6 13. Kb1 {A useful move in any case,
mainly against a possible future ... Bg5 pin.} 13... Nf5 14. Nd4 Nxe3 (14... g5
15. Qf3 Nxd4 16. Rxd4 {is also nothing special. White will move his queen away
and prepare f2-f4, opening the freshly weakened kingside.}) 15. fxe3 $16 {White
has full control of the position and an immediate threat of e3-e4.}) 11. Qg3 (
11. h3 {would be lovely but it unfortunately does not work due to White's Be3
being overloaded after} 11... g5 12. Nxg5 d4 $1) 11... Kf8 ({Thanks to the queen
being on g3 there would be no point in} 11... Ng4 {because firstly the bishop
can move away as f2 is covered, secondly White can castle and Black needs to
think twice about capturing it as g7 is hanging.}) 12. O-O-O Nb4 13. Nd4 Nxd3+
14. Rxd3 {Once again taking the d3-bishop costs the control over the d4-square.}
14... b6 15. Qf3 $1 $14 {A clever move. It stop ...Ba6 because of the Nxe6+
strike and at the same time prepares the h3 & g4 advance on the kingside. White
has a nice attacking position.}) (5... cxd4 {is of course bad due to} 6. Qxg7
$18 {picking up a rook.}) 6. Nf3 h5 {Black needs the h6-square for his knight,
but all his dark squares will be weak now.} 7. Qf4 Nh6 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bd3 $14
{White has a nice position. He will continue with casling kingside and then
starting the familiar knight maneuvers with Ne2, fighting for the d4 square with
Be3 and Ned4. If Black threatens his d3-bishop with Nc6-b4, he can secure its
position with a2-a3. At the same time the fate of the h6-knight is uncertain as
it cannot stay on h6 forever and if it comes to f5, then Black needs take the
Bxf5 plan into account.} *

kingside is always very risky as many White's pieces are directed against it and

smashed on the queenside after c4 and possibly a3 and b4 or just d5, therefore
he tries to play either ...e5 or ...c5.} 6... Nc6 {This forces White to alter

is too symmetrical for White to claim an advantage. However there are many
examples of seemingly dry opening positions that suddenly came back into fashion
in modern chess. The supposedly 'boring' Exchange Slav which is being employed
even at top level these days could be one example. Exchanging on d5 as early as
on move 3 is not completely without poison as well and there are some games
where White was able to pose Black some problems. Our situation is a bit more
advantageous as the b4-bishop is not placed so well.} (4... Qxd5 { The so-called
Katalymov variation was featured in one of the early issues of Secrets of
Opening Surprises. We already saw similar positions in the Rubinstein variation

fact you can simplify the workload by playing 3. ... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Qd5 5. Nc3,

to play 5. ...Bb4. I prefer not to move backwards when I have the choice

fight for an edge here.} 10. Ra2 $1 {The idea of this move is rather deep. White
removes the rook from possible Qc3+ attacks and doing so prepares the Bd3-move.
It also gives White the option of Rd2 in case of ... Nxd4, Nxd4 and b4. Let's
delve into the variations now and see the differences in comparison with other
White's options on move 10.} 10... b5 {Here we change the pawn structure quite a
bit.} 11. dxc5 Qc7 12. b4 a6 13. Bd3 {Unfortunately we are unable to protect the
e5-pawn so Black will be able to restore the material balance. However our
pieces will enjoy more space now and the passed c5-pawn can be an important
trump.} 13... Ndxe5 14. O-O Nxd3 15. Qxd3 Bb7 16. Nd4 { We'd like to reinforce
our control over the position with Re2, Nh5 and f4, getting a grip on the
e5-square. If Black managed to somehow miraculously open the position with ...e5
and breathe some life into his b7-bishop then he would be able to solve his
problems but we will certainly not allow him anything like that, e.g.} 16... Bf6
17. Nxc6 Bxc6 18. Nh5 Bd8 19. f4 {We intend to play Re2 next and also ideas like
f5-f6 start coming to mind, but if Black decides to counter such moves with
...f6 then a weakness on e6 emerges.} *

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {The starting point of the French defence. It is a sound
opening choice which managed to stand the test of time and we can sometimes see
it being played even in high profile games. Black's philosophy is similar to the
one he employs in many semi-open variations. He lets White grab space in the
center, but at the same time tries to counterattack it immediately, claiming the
first player might be overextended. I chose} 3. Nc3 {for this book as it is the
most principled response, developing the knight in the most active way possible
while protecting White's central pawn. Now I consider 3... dxe4, 3...Nf6 and
3...Bb4 as the main possibilities for Black as other moves have rather obvious
downsides, although one should always remember to do their homework and we will
have a deeper look at sidelines like 3...h6, 3...a6, 3... c5, 3...Be7 and
3...Nc6 as well.} 3... g6 {is a move we don't consider in the following chapters
and it has some logic too, intending to attack White's center with the
dark-squared bishop from g7. It is not very harmonious though and White has a
strong antidote.} ({On a waiting move like} 3... h6 {we continue our development
with} 4. Bd3 {, utilizing the} 4... dxe4 5. Nxe4 Qxd4 $2 6. Bb5+ $1 $18 {trick,
winning the queen. Of course Black is not obliged to lose the game in five moves
but as you'll see in the 3...h6 chapter White is able to claim a sizeable
advantage.}) (3... a6 {is a slightly better try but we dismantle it in a similar
fashion as in the 3...h6 line with} 4. Bd3) ({ The violent} 3... c5 {would be a
reasonable option for Black had White put his knight on d2 on the move 3 instead
of c3. Thanks to the strong position of the c3-knight we capture the offered
material with} 4. exd5 exd5 5. dxc5 {when Black is in trouble from the early
stage of the game.}) (3... Be7 {is another move which works much better against
the 3. Nd2 system than in the current position. We pinpoint the obvious
drawbacks of the bishop move with} 4. e5 $1 c5 5. Qg4 $1 {when firstly Black has
problems developing the g8-knight because the e7-square is occupied and secondly
he needs to defend the unprotected g7-square.}) ({The only slightly offbeat
variation remaining is} 3... Nc6 { which has in fact been employed by several
strong grandmasters too. Black is sometimes missing the option of attacking
White's center with ...c5, but it is a move which definitely has to be taken
seriously. We will analyse two promising options for White,} 4. e5 {immediately
closing the center} ({and} 4. Nf3 {, aiming for more direct play. Ultimately the
choice will be yours to make.})) ({Out of the three main moves for Black the
Rubinstein variation,} 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 {is probably the easiest to play
against. Since Black released the tension rather early he will often find
himself suffering for a long time in slightly cramped positions as White has a
clear spatial advantage here.}) (3... Nf6 {is together with 3...Bb4 the most
popular system for Black by a wide margin. We will explore many fresh ideas for
White after} 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Nce2 $5 {, sidestepping the heavy theoretical load
that comes with including the most popular 5. f4 system in one's repertoire.}) (
{Finally} 3... Bb4 {is inviting White into the most complex and unbalanced
French positions which arise after 4. e5 c5. We combat the so-called Winawer
variation by means of} 4. exd5 $5 {claiming that Black's dark-squared bishop is
not positioned that well on b4. Although the position is quite symmetrical, we
will often be able to make good use of the slightly misplaced b4-bishop and even
launch an attack on the black king with a quick queenside castling in some
lines. It is very likely that your opponents will feel much less secure on the
territory we recommend against the 3...Nf6 and 3...Bb4 set-ups as Black usually
focuses on the main theoretical lines instead.}) 4. h4 $1 {Provoking a weakness
on the kingside.} (4. e5 {is also a possibility, limiting the scope of the
f8-bishop. It would look rather useless on g7 with White's pawn standing on e5.})
4... h6 5. exd5 $1 {It will be very obvious that Black's pawn moves don't go
well with the rest of his set-up after} 5... exd5 6. Qe2+ $1 {Now Black is
forced to play} 6... Be7 {defying his own strategy with fianchettoing the
bishop, as other moves are even worse.} (6... Ne7 7. Qe5 {forces Black to make a
really ugly rook-move.}) (6... Qe7 {loses a pawn to} 7. Nxd5 $16) ({And finally}
6... Be6 {also loses a pawn to} 7. Qb5+ $16) 7. Bf4 $16 {White will castle and
have a great position, possibly he can continue with Nf3-e5.} *

8. cxd4 f6 9. Nf4 $1 {This is the principled response, hitting the weak e6-pawn.
We will have to enter complications but at the end of the day we should always
be able to steer the game towards some favourable endgame.} 9... Bb4+ 10. Bd2 {
Exchanging the dark-squared bishop is as always positionally risky for Black as
his light-squared colleague on c8 can find itself being very passive behind
Black's pawn formation.} 10... Qe7 11. Bxb4 Qxb4+ 12. Qd2 Ke7 {White actually
should force the queens off with Nd3 so it makes sense for Black to make a
useful move instead of capturing on d2 immediately. The king move neutralizes
White's threat to take on e6 with his f4-knight.} 13. Nd3 Qxd2+ 14. Kxd2 fxe5
15. dxe5 {Here Black experiences some difficulties too as the c8-bishop is
passive.} 15... b6 {is a nice attempt to develop the light-squared bishop but it
is not much better on b7 after} 16. Rc1 Bb7 {We simply double our rooks on the
c-file with} 17. Be2 Rac8 18. Rc3 $14 *
