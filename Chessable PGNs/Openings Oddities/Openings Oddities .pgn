1. b4
{ 1.b4 is at best a surprise weapon for the uninitiated. The Polish/Sokolosky is at best a club or surprise weapon with little venom. In this chapter, we will focus on the major themes and Memory Markers so you have no real issues in facing this or other peculiarities, oddities, or any other out of bounds opening.  Throughout the repertoire we really need to focus on the concept of comfort with the ideas and structures. In order to learn the lines within this text we need to have two ideals in mind when studying: 1  Remember the general structure we are attempting to reach and 2  Remember the Memory Markers as they will guide the planning and play through the structure. In many specific variations I will suggest for the reader to investigate key games in the colors reversed  (Actual Opening without the extra move)  structure so they have flexibility to apply knowledge in multiple scenarios and get context on future study and deeper understanding. These concepts will be expanded upon throughout the text, consider this your road map! }
1... c6
{ A move with direct prophylaxis against the idea of White playing b5 which is in many variations exactly what White has in mind to pose Black difficulties. }
2. e4 e5
{ Making this gear swap seems like the best choice for Black as we are placing the question to the b4 pawn now. }
3. a3
{ Protecting the extended b-pawn is logical and seen in many variations. } 3...

{ Putting the question to the over-extension. } 10. b5
{ This move frees up the c5-square for our pieces. } 10... Bc5 11. Be2 O-O 12.
O-O Re8
{ The pressure has mounted nicely. Black is better as we will continue to apply pressure to the extended e-pawn. Look to clip the Knight on f3 to further weaken the pawn. }

It should be noted that whatever your opening is for White, do that colors reversed and you should be fine as long as it doesn't have a b6 movement to justify the a-pawn’s expansion and White’s play. As it is not feasible to cover every line in chess colors reversed  (in this and all of the other moves with a non-critical first moves)  we hope that the lines covered give the reader an idea of structural orientation and plan with how the Ware and other first move can be handled without fear. Consider the lines where we go in-depth in these chapters as a bonus, there is not a plan to add indefinitely to these chapters as it is not feasible to cover every line in chess colors reversed  :  . }
1... d5 2. c4

1. f3
{ At first glance if we had to pick a worst opening move this should come to mind. White is choosing willingly to add air around his King and deprive his g-Knight of the best square that it could travel to. I have just one question for the history of chess, who is Mr. Barnes and why was he cursed by having his name placed on this opening }
1... e5 2. Kf2
{ Research shows different names, according to the completely reliable resource of Wikipedia: The move 2. Kf2?  (ECO code A00)  is called various things in various parts of the world. Most commonly known as the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening but also known throughout much of Europe as the Hammerschlag. In the United States, some theory has been published to award-winning praise under the name Schmoe Attack. }
2... d5
{ Takes the space and is strong, our entire plan in this position revolves around a direct assault on the King. }
3. e3
{ The only move that can be taken semi-seriously.   3.Kg3  Nc6  4.f4  exf4+  5.Kxf4  Find a faster mate than a world class GM, but to be honest who is going to be super critical here  Bd6+  6.Kf3  Qf6+  7.Ke3  Qf4+  8.Kd3  Qe4+  9.Kc3  Qb4+  10.Kd3  Qe4+  11.Kc3  Qd4+  12.Kb3  Qc4#  Schneider, Igor - Van Wely, Loek, 0-1, Kuppenheim 12h blitz final, 2005, not quite sure how this game exists but something tells me their is an interesting story behind it. }
3... d4
{ A move played only once before in the database but a logical one that places pressure on the pawn structure around the white King. This deviates from the only 'serious' game in the database between Williams, Simon Kim - Simons, Martin, 1-0, BCF-ch 86th, 1999. }
4. Bd3
{ One of the engine's choice moves...one of my chess playing colleagues found it hilarious when I responded to the question what are you analyzing: The Barnes Opening...I had to be the first human ever to say this and I count this as a win.   4.g3  In these positions, Black should develop normally and continue to apply pressure, keep in mind: just because the position is optically bad for white it is not completely busted and remember the maxim: 'Only fools rush in'.  Bc5  Keeping with the same theme of eyeing the Black King through the X-ray.  5.Kg2  Nc6  6.Bc4  a6  Getting ready to bother the Bishop.  7.e4  b5  8.Bd5  Nge7  Taking away the Bishop Pair in an open position always in the very least feels like a moral victory.  9.Bxc6+  Nxc6  10.d3  O-O  11.Nd2  Ne7  This move is a Memory Marker and will be useful with the coming attacking plan.  12.a4  Rb8  13.axb5  axb5  14.Nh3  f5  The plan is realized in the position. White is lagging behind in development and generally has issues in this position. We will end this line with this pawn lever where black is comfortably better. }
4... Nc6 5. Ne2 Bc5
{ Handled in the same fashion across variations making for an easy Memory Marker putting an X-ray on the King. }
6. c3 a5 7. Re1 Qh4+ 8. Kg1 dxe3 9. dxe3 Be6 10. Ng3 O-O-O

{ Of course our main move order to reach this position. In the Exchange lines we will see the move order with 1. e4 for the rest of the Chapter. As these lines stem from Master the French Defense and have been through trials of months of testing by the Chessable faithful they are hardened. }

{ The exchange variation is often played by the unambitious or those uncomfortable with the theory in the main lines of the French. While leading to immediate equality for Black, this line is critical from the standpoint of creating winning chances. It is crucial that Black think in terms of imbalances in order to avoid symmetrical positions. }
4. Nf3 Bg4

{ Isolated pawn structures are definitive in chess. The player with the isolated pawn needs to play for activity and limit the exchange of attackers typically going directly after the opponents King. The player playing against the isolated pawn typically seeks to create a blockade of the pawn and gradually exchange off potential attackers reaching a favorable ending due to the magnified weakness of the isolated pawn. In this text we play with and against the pawn. The very best chess players have no preference, they simply understand what needs to be done in the position and accomplish their goals. }

1. h4
{ The main goal facing 1. h4 is to prevent white from using the h-pawn for any effective future attack. We need to avoid systems with g6 if possible. Again in this line we lean towards suggestion a d-pawn system to deal with the issues of the dreaded h-pawn march. }

20. Ke2 Nxa3 21. Bc4 Nxc4
{ This begins a forcing continuation which is strong. When up material, Trade Down ! It is stronger to capture on e5 first though as we gave White the opportunity to play Nxc4. }
22. bxc4 Bxe5 23. Bxe5 Qd3+ 24. Kf2 f6
{ 24...Rhd8  Black is fully flexible here, the move from the main game spoils the edge. }
25. Qb4+
{ 25.Qxb7+  Black made the 7th weak, White should take notice of this.  Qd7  26.Bd6+  This game is filled with missed tactical bombs. The Bishop is immune to capture due to Rd1+.  Ke8  27.Rb1  Black's h8-Rook is out of the game, White has a big edge. }
