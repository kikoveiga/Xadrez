In comparison the transpositions to French   2...e6  and Caro-Kann   2...c6  have both been played roughly ~12 000x. We'll look at these and other ways of declining the pawn in Chapter 2. }
3. Nc3

3... Nf6
{ The main move, played in ~56 000 games. Black can also try the Lemberger Counter-Gambit:   3...e5  which we'll look at in Chapter 3 ~ 7900 games. }
4. f3
{ Diemer's move, the aim is to accelerate development and open the central lines. White can also try Gedult's   4.Bc4  or von Popiel's   4.Bg5  , but neither are even semi-serious tries for an advantage. See, again, my 'Beating the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit'. }
4... exf3 {  } 5. Nxf3
{ The main move of the BDG Accepted. White is ahead in development and has the half-open e- and f-files to work with. His biggest weakness is the d-pawn. He can castle either side, develop the bishops as needed and involve the Queen freely as needed, frequently via Qd2 to Qf4 or Qe1 to Qh4.  From here we will look at a host of minor moves like   5...Nc6  - Chapter 6.  the Euwe Defense   5...e6  , 2nd most common ~11  000  games  - Chapter 7.  the Bogoljubov Defense   5...g6  , 3rd/4th most common ~4400 games  - Chapter 8.  the Teichmann Defense   5...Bg4  the most common, ~18  000  games  - Chapter 9.  the Gunderam and Ziegler Defense   5...Bf5  , ~3000 games  and   5...c6  , 3rd/4th most common ~4400 games  - Chapter 10. }

1. d4 d5 2. e4
{ To play a gambit is to sacrifice material, usually a pawn, right in the opening. This is done to get something in return = compensation. The concept of compensation is essential in understanding gambit play. In general, a good principle to keep in mind is:   To understand a gambit, you have to know what the compensation consists in! Thus, to know how to play a gambit you need to know what your compensation is and how to exploit it. To know how to play against a gambit you need to know what your opponent's compensation is and how to negate it.  Now, a gambit is sound when its compensation is objectively sufficient. What this means is that even with best play  (correspondence play, computer analysis etc.)  neither side is better or worse than usual. In other words, when you play a gambit with White it is sound when you retain at least your usual advantage. When you play a gambit with Black it is sound when you have no more than your usual disadvantage.  Of course, most gambits are not sound. However, some, like the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, are nevertheless pretty good. A gambit is good when it is not fully sound, but works well in practical play. Some of the reasons why are the same as in the case of non-gambit sidelines or rare openings:  - Your opponent won't know the frequently unintuitive best line and plays something intuitive, but 2nd-rate  - You have more experience with the ensuing types of positions than your opponent  - There is a psychologically unsettling effect in having to face the unfamiliar  However, good gambits work for further sorts of reasons:  - A good gambit puts your opponent under some sort of pressure, forcing them to face concrete threats   - Best gambits feature an unintuitive & narrow path to equality or an advantage.  - The unintuitiveness means that the relevant moves are harder to remember and hard or impossible to find over the board  - The narrowness means that only specific moves will do, otherwise your opponent will be at a considerable disadvantage  Now, even though the BDG is a pretty good gambit, I wouldn't make it a mainstay in your repertoire for over, say, 1800, in Classical games where your opponent can prepare for you...  But things are very different in fast time controls  (e. g. Blitz, Rapid)  where your opponent CAN'T prepare for you. In such situations, the BDG is a great weapon since it usually gives you a big initiative, forces them into a tactical dogfight from the get-go, features a clear & rehearsed attacking plan, and has a high likelihood of causing your opponent to burn lots of clock time.  Relatedly, I have one comment about the way this repertoire is built up. A lot the theory of the BDG that eventually made it to Scheerer's book was developed in correspondence games up to the early to mid-2000s. In many ways, the BDG is a pre-computer era correspondence opening. But some of what's ok in correspondence is not good for fast time controls  (e. g. you wouldn't necessarily want to play super messy lines with your own king under attack...)  .   The idea in this repertoire is to strike a balance between what's objectively strongest, what's nettlesome for Black, and what's practical. Thus, even though there are many lines where we go for standard theory and improve upon it  (e. g. Euwe, Teichmann)  , there are also some lines where we go for shortcut sidelines since the main lines are just not good for White or at best very double-edged with lots to learn. I will comment on this in more depth once the relevant moments come up. }

{ The BDG player's worst nightmare :   Honestly, if you're already a d4-player and adding BDG for fast time controls then perhaps the best thing to do would be to simply play your regular repertoire here, e. g.   2.c4   2.Nf3   2.Bf4   2.Bg5   2.Nc3  etc.  For maximum fun, you could combine the BDG with FM Kamil Plichta's Raptor-Trompowsky.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. e4 e6 3. exd5 { The dreaded Exchange French. } 3... exd5 4. c4
{ Surprise. This is the Monte-Carlo variation which is played by GM Normunds Miezis with great success and was also developed in an original way by GM Maurice Ashley and the 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' star and a BJJ black belt, IM Josh Waitzkin.  The reasons for the success are partly psychological - it's the sort of open game most French players are just not used to.  The main line is   4.Nf3  and for that go see IM Christof Sielecki's award-winning KIS 1. e4 and, for deep structural discussion, GM Axel Smith's e3-Poison. }
4... Nf6
{ Black can start with   4...Bb4+  5.Nc3  Nf6  , but it transposes. However, he does get the option of   4...Bb4+  5.Nc3  Ne7  which used to be recommended by IM John Watson in his books on the French. }
5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bd3 { The Ashley-Waitzkin plan, intending Nge2 next. } 6... O-O
{ For   6...c5  seek out the game Ashley vs Shabalov, 1994. } 7. Ne2
{ Why this move? As Waitzkin puts it in one of his old Chessmaster videos, in this position Black's idea is to give White an isolated queen's pawn and then play ...Nbd7 to ...Nb6 to ...Nd5. White's idea with Nge2 is to be able to play Nf4 and challenge Black's control over  d5  , if needed.  For this plan in effect, see the model game Waitzkin vs. Moskow. }
7... dxc4 8. Bxc4 Nc6
{ The natural move, given by Aagaard & Ntirlis, but Black can also play ...Bd6 first, given by Berg. }
9. O-O Bd6
{ Black's best move, returning the bishop which has done it's job in provoking Nge2. Now best play for both sides is to make a series of prophylactic moves. }
10. h3 { Prophylaxis against ...Bg4. } 10... h6
{ Prophylaxis against Bg5. If Black develops the light-squared bishop instead as is natural, it's much to his detriment since then we get Bg5 in   10...Bf5  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  Be7  13.Re1  or   10...Bf5  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  Na5  13.Bd3  Bxd3  14.Qxd3  Nc6  15.Ne4 }
11. Qc2 a6 { Prophylaxis against Nb5, attacking the bishop. } 12. a3
{ Prophylaxis against ...Nb4. After this the manuevering starts. Black's best idea is to try ...Ne7 and to force through ...Bf5 and then blockade the d-pawn, White can meet it with Bd3. But it's very unlikely your opponent gets here, unless they've studied this in depth. And even then, it's just equal, not better for Black. }

As we will see, how to choose depends mostly on whether f3 allows Black to play ...e5 under good circumstances or not. }

{ The ambitious move. Lakdawala comments:   @@StartBlockQuote@@This is a radical option which may appeal to the true red-blooded Veresov player. ... Let's see what White gains and what he must give up in the 7. Nf3 line of the Veresov:  1. White allows damage to his pawn structure, isolating his e-pawn and creating a hole on e5. 2. White often must sac his b-pawn to some form of ...Qb6 and ...Qxb2. 3. White gets the open f-file for his attack. This in conjunction with Bc4 and a timely e5 could be deadly for black who implodes on f7. 4. White in general gets great piece activity, with a powerful bishop on c4, potentials of Nd4 and Nf5, and play along the f-file, d-file, and b-file, if White has sac-ed his b-pawn. 5. You will probably lose most endgames if you get there without doing some damage to Black, but as Tarrasch once said: 'Before the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame!@@EndBlockQuote@@ }

For starters, while the old main line   5.fxe4  Nxe4  6.Qf3  Nd6  7.Bf4  e6  8.O-O-O  gives White what he wants, both   5.fxe4  Nxe4  6.Qf3  Nxc3  7.Qxf5  e6!  or   5.fxe4  Nxe4  6.Qf3  7.bxc3  e6!  8.Qxb7  Nd7  9.Nf3  Rb8!  see White relinquish his initiative and be just worse.  Second, the Hara-Kiri continuation   5.g4  is a ton to learn, while being a complete double-edged mess where Black is eventually just better e. g. Smerdon's   5.g4  Bg6  6.g5  Nd5  7.Nxe4  e5!  8.dxe5  Nc6  or   5.g4  Bg6  6.h4  h6  7.fxe4  e5!  I don't know about you, but I would not like to play this position at fast time controls. Furthermore, Black has numerous annoying sidelines along the way all of which would need to be learned and none of which promise White much.  Finally, 5. Bg5 combined with 6. Qe2 is just not something White sees, nor is it covered in any detail in any of the sources that recommend the Vienna, meaning that Black is going to be on his own from the get-go. }

8. a3
{ They used to play O-O here and that was also Scheerer's recommendation, but this isn't good for White as explained later in an informational line. In general, White is much better off with Qe2 and O-O-O and a more slow-burning attack, rather than the old miniature-plan of O-O and Qe1 to Qh4.  a3 is one of two Lc0's favorite moves  (the other one being Qe2)  . The main point is that White doesn't have to rush the attack. He has plenty of compensation and can take some time to prophylactically prevent Black's main ideas and wait to see what he does next. }

{ Scheerer considered this dubious, but I think current engines show that it's actually Black's best. }
8. O-O
{ This is what has usually been recommended and what Scheerer recommended, but I'll show why we need a different move.  Here White's usual plan is Qe1 to Qh4 with targets on  f6  and  h7  . }
8... Nc6
{ This is the strongest move here. Somehow Scheerer had this as a sideline and discounted the best continuation for Black. There are two points here. First, Black has a simple threat of ...Nxd4 and ...Qxd4 which now comes with check, making it a safe move. Second, Black still threatens ...Nb4, chopping White's prized light-squared bishop.  The other lines are not cakewalk for White either. For example   8...h6  9.Be3  Nbd7  10.Qd2  c6  11.Bxh6  gxh6  12.Qxh6  Re8  13.Ng5  Bf8  14.Bh7+  Kh8  15.Nxf7#  is a typical miniature, but 9... Nc6 or 9... c5 put up much better resistance. Scheerer gave as Black's best 8...c5 and   8...c5  9.dxc5  Bxc5  10.Kh1  Nbd7  11.Qe1  Be7  12.Qh4  g6  13.Bb5  is another miniature line, but, again 10... Be7 or 10... h6 is better for Black. }

9... Nxd4 10. Qh4 Nf5

Be2
{ Simple chess, developing the last piece on the only square which makes sense for it. The idea is twofold. First, if allowed, White will play Ne5 followed by Bf3 and Re1 or Rf1 etc. Second Black now needs to play ...Nbd7 after which the d6-push gains in strength. After this even engines give equality.  Scheerer gave the direct d6 which can be played. See the model game Mann-Zielinski. However, it isn't objectively as good, as shown by current engines   10.d6!?  Nc6  11.Qe3  exd6  12.Bxd6  Re8  13.Qxc5  Ne4!?  14.Nxe4  Rxe4  or even better   10.d6!?  Nc6  11.Qe3  exd6  12.Bxd6  Re8  13.Qxc5  Be6!  14.Ng5  Nd7!  15.Nxe6  Rxe6  16.Qa3  b5.   Interestingly, in his review of Scheerer's book GM Glenn Flear also focuses on the ...g6 lines as Black's best bet, discusses 10. d6, but not 10. Be2. }
10... Nbd7
{ Now the d6 push gains in strength.  If   10...b6  11.Ne5  Bb7  12.Bf3  followed by Rhe1 and White has a perfectly centralized position. }

{ the Gunderam Defense. This is quite a tough nut to crack. } 6. Bd3
{ Here I propose a shortcut, namely this sideline which is good enough for fast time controls.   Black usually plays it like a Caro-Kann with the light-squared bishops exchanged and a pawn up, but White gets a bit of time and some open lines on the kingside to attack.   I chose it because it's hard to trust the main line with   6.Ne5.   6.Ne5  e6  7.g4  gives Black a host of messy options with a lot to learn. However, all of this is relatively moot since even better is   6.Ne5  c6!?  after which   6.Ne5  c6  7.Bc4  e6  leads to the Ziegler Old Main line which doesn't promise White much and   6.Ne5  c6  7.g4  Be6!  is the line I recommended in my Anti-BDG course as good for Black. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4
{ I'm including this game here since:  1. it is rare to see a BDG position at the super-GM level, especially in classical games;   2. it features a very interesting transposition where White is a tempo up over usual lines;  3. there are some surprising moves played by White where a BDG player familiar with the usual patterns would've easily found the better continuations. }
1... d6 { Anand goes for ...d6. } 2. e4 Nf6 3. f3

dxe4 { Now it's a BDG, but it's White's move so White is a tempo up! } 5. Bg5

5... exf3 6. Nxf3 g6 7. Bc4
{ Now it's essentially the so-called Studier Attack against the Bogoljubov. However, White's still a tempo up. }
