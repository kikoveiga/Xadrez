{ Why is a repertoire based on the Slav Defence a good idea ? I think there are two main reasons - it is reliable and it is universal. Another attraction of the Slav set-up is that it leads to diverse and strategically rich positions where Black can outplay his opponent.   The idea behing the Slav is simple: Black wants to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 or g4 and then play .. .e6, ...Nbd7, ...Bd6  (or ...Be7)  and ...O-O. This set-up guarantess Black a harmonious development with good central control, no weaknesses and no bad pieces.   The Slav set-up can be used against the vast majority of White's openings  (except 1 e4, of course)  and that is what this repertoire is based on - wherever possible and applicable the Slav set-up was the suggested way of development. }
3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 a6
{ Black's last move characterises the Chebanenko Slav, named after its inventor, the Moldovan chess coach Vyacheslav Chebanenko. Even though the variation came into existence in the mid-1970s and slowly began to show promise in the early 1980s, which is rather late compared to the other lines of the Slav like the Classical   4...dxc4  or the Semi-Slav   4...e6  , it is in fact the 'purest' when it comes to implementation of the Slav set-up.   The idea behind the move is to allow the development of the bishop to f5 or g4 without abandoning the centre  (like in the Classical Slav)  . If Black plays   4...Bf5  immediately White can take on d5 and play Qb3, putting immediate pressure on the b7-pawn, but with the pawn on a6 Black can easily defend that pawn either by ...Ra7 or ...b5. A very simple idea really, if you look at it, but nevertheless a very practical one !   The development of the bishop to f5 or g4 is Black's primary idea, but in case it is not possible then he has 4 more opening set-ups that he reverts to:   
 To fianchetto the dark-squared bishop in order not to close the h3-c8 diagonal for the light-squared bishop;    To play ...e6 with the idea to take on c4 and expand with ...b5 and ...c5 in order to develop the bishop on b7;    To play ...e6 with the idea to to push ...c5 and develop the knight on c6, in order to put pressure on White's centre;    To play ...e6 and ...a5 in order to fix the b4-square when White has played a4.   
These 5 ideas cover all the theory in the Chebanenko Slav and they are all you need to remember in order to orient yourself in the variations that follow ! If sometimes you forget the concrete lines remember these 5 ideas and the solution is going to be one of them. The reason for creating a lifetime repertoire based on the Chebanenko Slav comes from the essence of the variation itself - relying on general principles and knowing the basic plans Black should be able to obtain safe and reliable positions that do not require a lot of memorisation or regular updates.  If we compare the Chebanenko to the other Slavs - the Semi-Slav   4...e6  and the Classical Slav   4...dxc4  , the main advantage of the Chebanenko is that it is more easy to grasp conceptually. Both the Semi-Slav and the Classical have many diverse set-ups for both colours and are much more complex both theoretically and practically. The Chebanenko is a practical choice and I think this is of utmost importance when creating a lifetime repertoire.  The principles of the Slav are valid against the vast majority of other lines, like 1 Nf3 or even 1 b3 and 1 f4, so absorbing them well and playing the opening with understanding will serve the player faithfully for a lifetime. }

{ With this move Black makes sure that his bishop will not remain passive. Depending on circumstances it will either go to a6, b7 or it may stay on c8 in case Black decides to push ...f5, from where it will safely defend the pawn on e6. }
16. Qg4 O-O
{ Black finished development and we enter a complex middlegame position with mutual chances. Black has the better structure while White has some activity on the kingside. Black's ideas here are either to play ...Ba6-d3, to exchange the light-squared bishops, which would eliminate all White's activity since it's based on the bishop on b1, or to play ...f5, again shutting the bishop on b1 while after exf6, ...Bxf6 he will have good central control. A good move in both cases can be the rook lift ...Ra7, as the rook can be useful both on the kingiside and in the centre for a possible ...Rd7 idea supporting the ...d4 push. }

{ Since the e4-square wasn't covered by Bd3, Black takes advantage to force an exchange of the knights. The knight on c3 is an annoying piece as often it can go to a4 and c5, so exchanging it makes life easier for Black on the queenside. Additionally, it's important not to play   7...Bf5  because then after  8.Nf3  e6  9.Rc1  we have been move-ordered out of the repertoire into the line 6 Nf3 a6 7 Rc1 Bf5, instead of our preferred 7...

Note that the dark-squared bishops are not exchanged here  (as in the main line of the Exchange)  because Black prefers to have his one control the dark squares on the queenside  (c5, b4 and a3)  while White's doesn't do much since Black will put a rook on c8, so control over the b8-square is less relevant. }

Therefore, it is very important for Black to know precisely what he is doing. In that case the tables can be turned - if White is not precise then Black can start playing safely for a win ! }

{ White can also start with   4.Bf4  but generally this move will be played anyway, so we take 4 Nc3 as the main move as the more natural one. }
4... Nf6
{ Not only developing, but also preventing e4, which is possible in case of 4... Nc6. }
5. Bf4
{ This is the usual spot for the white dark-squared bishop in the Exchange Variation from where it actively supports White's queenside play. White can also start with   5.Nf3  but that will only transpose later on.  The move   5.Bg5  makes less sense now as Black can play  5...Ne4. }
5... Nc6
{ Black continues to develop. We have come to the critical junction in the opening as White here has two principled plans:   
 He can play   6.e3  followed by ...Bd3 and ...Nge2 or,   He can play   6.Nf3  to keep the option to jump to e5.   Both plans are equally popular, so Black needs to be prepared against both. }
6. e3
{ With this move White starts the plan to put a bishop on d3 and a knight on e2. }

{ The move   9.Rc1  will transpose after  9...Bd6  as later in the main line White inevitably plays Rc1, for example  10.f3  Bh5  11.O-O  Bg6  and we have arrived at the position after   9.O-O  Bd6  10.f3  Bh5  11.Rc1  Bg6. }
9... Bd6
{ A direct move, aiming to also have the queen developed on d6 if White takes on d6. With the queen on d6 one of Black's plans is to play for the ...e5 push. This is particularly good after White had played f3 since then the pawn on e3 will be exposed on the open e-file and will compensate for the IQP on d5. }
10. f3
{ White breaks the pin and wants to be able to take on f4 with a knight. The ideal square for the e2-knight is d3, from where it controls the important squares c5 and e5, and the knight can easily get there via f4 once the light-squared bishops are exchanged. }

{ The rook always ends up on c1 in these positions, so White plays the move immediately. Taking on d6:   11.Bxd6  Qxd6  12.Nf4  Bg6  13.Rc1  O-O   is a transposition to the line after  11.Rc1  Bg6  12.Bxd6  Qxd6  13  Nf4  O-O. }

{ The development of the knights on c3 and f3 is the most ambitious set-up by White against the Slav because he still keeps the option to develop the bishop on g5 or f4. }
4... a6
{ The move that characterises the Chebanenko Slav. The move 4... a6 is a very useful one whose main idea is the development of the light-squared bishop before playing ...e6 since the pawn on b7 can now be defended either by ...Ra7 or ...b5. The reason is that the immediate   4...Bf5  is met by  5.cxd5  cxd5  6.Qb3  and Black has issues with the pawn on b7. With the increased control of the b5-square Black also threatens to take on c4 and then defend that pawn by ...b5, thus winning a pawn. The move ...b5 can also be played as an attempt to gain more space on the queenside. 4... a6 also serves as a waiting move as now White must show his intentions. Not surprisingly, White has a lot of moves and plans at his disposal. }
5. e3

He simply defends the pawn on c4 and if allowed wants to develop by Bd3, b3, Bb2 etc. However, in spite of its simplicity this move shouldn't be underestimated as it poses Black problems in several lines.

He will develop the knight to c6 and the bishop to d6 with a harmonious position. }

The reason is that the immediate   4...Bf5  is met by  5.cxd5  cxd5  6.Qb3  and Black has issues with the pawn on b7. With the increased control of the b5-square Black also threatens to take on c4 and then defend that pawn by ...b5, thus winning a pawn. The move ...b5 can also be played as an attempt to gain more space on the queenside. 4... a6 also serves as a waiting move as now White must show his intentions. Not surprisingly, White has a lot of moves and plans at his disposal. }
5. e3
{ The easiest move for White to make. He simply defends the pawn on c4 and if allowed wants to develop by Bd3, b3, Bb2 etc. However, in spite of its simplicity this move shouldn't be underestimated as it poses Black problems in several lines. Note that the move   5.cxd5  leads to the Exchange Variation  and   5.Qd3  transposes to 5 Qb3 after  5...dxc4. }
5... Bf5
{ Black develops the bishop to the natural f5-square since in case it is attacked by Qb3 the pawn on b7 can be defended either by ...Ra7 or ...b5. Now White has three critical lines where Black needs to be precise in order to achieve good play. These are   6.Qb3  ,   6.Ne5  and   6.Nh4  The other lines, though less critical theoretically, also require some attention. }
6. Qb3
{ White takes immediate advantage from the bishop leaving the b7-pawn without defence. }
6... Ra7
{ Defending the pawn on b7. As usual in the Chebanenko Slav, the rook on a7 sooner rather than later will either be rerouted via a8 and then to the centre or Black will play ...b5  (or . ..b6)  and the rook will be useful on the 7th rank. }
7. Nh4
{ The most direct. The alternatives are not testing. Note that the move   7.Be2  transposes to 6  Be2  after  7...h6. }
7... Bc8
{ This is the best move, as the alternatives give White an advantage. } 8. Qc2
{ We have examined the alternatives in the previous several variations. } 8...
b5
{ Black employs one of the ideas behind the ... a6 move, the b5-push. Here it is even more favourable for Black because of the knight on h4 - from there it doesn't control the e5-square. }
9. b3 { The only reasonable option for White. } 9... e5
{ This strike is again possible thanks to the knight being on h4. Black sacrifices a pawn  (temporarily even two)  but gets excellent compensation. }
10. dxe5 Ne4
{ Another move that takes advantage of the loose position of the knight on h4. }
11. Nxe4 dxe4 12. Qxe4
{ White is now two pawns up, but after Black's next his king will be very badly placed. }
12... Bb4+ 13. Ke2 O-O
{ Black has excellent compensation here as White's pieces are terribly uncoordinated. Besides, Black will likely win the pawn on e5 so he will only be a pawn down and his initiative will continue. }
14. g3 Nd7
{ Black develops and threatens ...Nc5 or ...Bc3 and ...Ne5. This move is more precise than   14...Qa5  as played in the model game Ponomariov-Antipov. }
15. Bg2 Bc3
{ Now Black gets one pawn back, but his initiative still continues. } 16. Rb1
Nxe5 17. Qc2 b4
{ Black has excellent play for the pawn. White still needs to get his pieces into play while Black's do so easily by ...Bg4, ...Qf6 the rooks come on the e and d-files, wherever they are needed. Another idea is to harass the knight with ...g5 and ...Qf6. }

5. c5
{ This is one of White's most ambitious tries as he immediately fixes the weakened b6-square. }
5... Bf5
{ Black continues with the usual plan. He managed to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain and wants to play ...e6, ...Nbd7, ... Be7 and ...O-O. This set-up  (also with the bishop on d6)  is typical for the whole Slav defence. }
6. Qb3
{ This is an attempt to immediately take advantage of the bishop leaving c8. }
6... Ra7 { The usual defence in the Chebanenko. } 7. Nh4
{ Harassing the bishop and since Black doesn't want to go back to e6 or c8 White wins the bishop pair. Still, Black continues with his development and his position is solid - the loss of the light-squared bishop is compensated for the strong pawn chain on the light squares. }
7... Bg6
{ The simplest retreat, but also the best one. White wants to push e4, so provoking it with   7...Be4  8.f3  with e4 next makes little sense.  Also, White wants to fianchetto his bishop, so again helping him with   7...Bg4  8.h3  Bh5  9.g4  and Bg2 next is not very advisable. }
8. Nxg6 hxg6 9. Bg5 e6
{ It is important to start with this move because White's most ambitious attempt is to push e4, and then recuperate the pawn after g3 and Bg2. The point of keeping the knight on b8 is to leave the 7th rank open  (after Black pushes ...b5)  for the ...Rd7 idea and the d-file open, so the pawn on d4 will hang. Note that if White doesn't push e4 then Black will inevitably play ...Nbd7 so the move-order won't have a difference. }
10. e4 { This is the most ambitious attempt. } 10... dxe4 11. g3
{ White plans to fianchetto his bishop and take the pawn on e4. } 11... b5
{ An important move to give Black sufficient counterplay. Note that taking the pawn on d4 loses to Rd1 and the queen has no good square to go to - taking on c5 loses the rook on a7 after Be3 and going to e5 drops the knight on b8 after Bf4. }
12. cxb6
{ In case White plays   12.Rd1  Black has the important resource  12...Rd7  ,  made possible by postponing the development of the knight from b8,  while in case of   12.O-O-O  Black can simply play  12...Be7  and then push ...a5-a4-a3, trying to weaken White's queenside. }
12... Rb7
{ Black has good play here - he will take the b6-pawn and will have active play on the b-file. White needs to defend his pawn on d4 and also spend time to take on e4  (remember that Black is still a pawn up after taking on b6)  . }

17. Ne5
{ In case of   17.Na5  Rfc8  the knight on a5 can easily be attacked after ...Qa4. }
17... Bxe5 18. Bxe5 Qc6
{ This move keeps control over the e4-square so White cannot open the game by playing e4. Black never risks losing since with his control over the light squares and the c4-square in particular White's extra pawn will never move forward from c3. He will use the c-file for active counterplay against the pawn on c3  (his next move will likely be ...Rfc8)  while White's bishop is left useless roaming on the dark squares where there's nothing to attack. A possible idea for Black can be ... Nc4-a3-b5 or ...Na4, putting maximum pressure on the c3-pawn. In case Black manages to return the pawn he will stand better because his knight is the superior light piece in this position. }

With the increased control of the b5-square Black also threatens to take on c4 and then defend that pawn by ...b5, thus winning a pawn.

13. e3 Bb4+ 14. Ke2

14... Nd5
{ In the model game Aronian-McShane Black played   14...Nc6  ,  which is also quite good. The point of this move is to liberate the path for the f-pawn. Black wants to push ...f5-f4 and also to continue to improve his position by developing the knight from b8 to c6 and then perhaps to a5 and b3. Since White is hopelessly entangled, Black has a considerable advantage here. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3
{ With this move-order White avoids the Classical Slav that arises after   4.Nf3  dxc4  Against the Chebanenko it offers White some options revolving around the delay of the development of the knight from g1, thus making the development of the bishop from c8 more problematic. }
4... a6
{ Black plays the usual Chebanenko move to prepare the development of the bishop. White now has two main options,   5.Bd3  and   5.Qc2  both of them aimed at controlling the f5-square.  The other moves here are not critical and they can be met by common sense development along the usual lines. Note that the move   5.a4  transposes to the variation considered in another chapter after  5...e6  6.Nf3.  While the move   5.Bd2  transposes to the varation analyzed in another chapter after  5...Bf5  6.Qb3  Ra7 }
5. Bd3
{ White controls the f5-square and prevents the development of Black's bishop. }
5... dxc4
{ Black wins a tempo by forcing the bishop to move again and prepares for the queenside expansion by .. .b5 and ... c5. }
6. Bxc4 e6 7. Nf3 b5
{ Black expands on the queenside and liberates the b7-square for the bishop. In fact now we have transposed to the Queen's Gambit Accepted, but in these non-critical lines for that opening Black has easy and smooth play because he quickly manages to develop his pieces in harmonious manner: the bishop goes to b7, the knight from b8 to d7 or c6, the bishop from f8 to e7 or d6, the queen on c7, b8 or b6 and Black will castle short. Now White's bishop can retreat to d3, b3 or e2. }
8. Be2 c5 9. O-O Bb7
{ Black will quickly be ahead in development since White has problems with the bishop on c1. Therefore White is practically forced to go for the endgame after the exchange on c5. }
10. dxc5
{ The endgame is fine for Black, but White didn't have much choice. In case of   10.b3  Nbd7  11.Bb2  Be7  followed by ...O-O, . ..Rc8, ...Qb6 and ...Rfd8 Black has a problem-free position. }
10... Bxc5
{ Black prefers White to exchange on d8 as after that the king will move to e7 and remain in the centre, as it is better to have a centralised king in an endgame. In the model game Karjakin-Carlsen Black played   10...Nc6  here, which is possible, though White didn't make the most out of his chances. }
11. Qxd8+ Kxd8 12. Nd2
{ The knight goes to b3 and a5. This is time consuming and in the meantime Black finishes development, but it is White's most testing continuation. Against other plans Black simply plays ... Ke7, ... Nbd7, ...Rac8 and ...Rfd8. }
12... Ke7 { The e7-square is very safe for the king. } 13. Nb3 Bd6
{ The bishop retreats to d6 so as not to be in the line of attack in case of   13...Bb6  14.a4  b4  15.a5 ! }
14. f3 { White intends to push e4 and develop the bishop to e3. } 14... Bc7
{ Black follows the same plan as in the line 14 Rd1 - he anticipates the white bishop coming to e3, so he plays ... Bc7 and ...Nfd7, intending ...Bb6 to exchange it. }
15. e4 Nfd7
{ The same logic applies here too - Black will play ...Bb6 only when the white bishop appears on e3, in order to exchange it. Putting the bishop on b6 prematurely will make it subject to the attack after a4-a5. }
16. Be3 Bb6 17. Kf2 Rc8 { Black brings his pieces to the queenside. } 18. Rfc1
{ This is the difference with the 14 Rd1 line - in case of   18.Rfd1  we would have had a direct transposition, when the move  18...Nc5  equalizes. Here the rook is on c1, making the move ...Nc5 impossible in view of the discovered check Nd5. }
18... Bxe3+
{ Luckily, Black can simply follow the same plan as from the line 14 Rd1 - exchange of bishops followed by ...Bc6, ... Ra7-c7. }
19. Kxe3 Nb6
{ Controlling both c4 and a4 before embarking on the afore-mentioned plan. Black has a very solid position in this equal endgame. }

{ This move-order is mainly aimed against Semi-Slav players because then White can start with b3 and Bb2 before committing the knight from b1. Against the Chebanenko it has the same benefit of the possibility to develop the knight on d2, though objectively speaking this doesn't bring much to White. }
4... a6
{ The usual Chebanenko move for Black. In this situation it is more of a waiting move to see how White intends to continue. What Black awaits is to see where to put the light-squared bishop, on f5 or g4. }

{ Black doesn't mind the loss of the right to castle because in the closed position he can calmly play ...g6 and ... Kg7. }
8. Bxf8 Kxf8
{ Black will play ...g6 and ...Kg7 for an artificial castle and will also develop the knight to d7. }
9. Bd3

This move controls the f4-square where Black would want to put the knight, which in turn would liberate the h5-square for the bishop. With the bishop on h5 he may consider the move ...Ng6, hitting the pawn on h4. Whether or not White allows ...Nf4 in either case Black will attack White's centre by ...f5, or in case White pushes e5 by ...f6.   He wants to open the f-file and again fight for the f4-square. With all these constructive ideas Black can be confident in this middlegame and can in fact easily take over the initiative if White doesn't manage to control Black's activity. }

2... c6

3. e3
{ White can also start with   3.Nf3  but it will lead to the same position after  3...Qb6  when he will have the same choice like in the main line, to play  4.b3  or   4.Qc1  White will inevitably play e3 next and then we will have a transposition. }
3... Qb6
{ Hitting b2. Now White has two plans at his disposal:  
 To expand on the queenside by c4-c5, b4-b5 etc. or    To expand in the centre by c4 and e4. }
4. b3
{ With this move White's plan is to exchange the bishops on d3 and expand in the centre with c4 and e4. }

5... Bxd3 6. Qxd3 Nf6 7. Nf3 e6
{ Both sides continue along their intended paths. } 8. O-O Nbd7 9. c4 Qa6
{ An important moment. The queen on a6 is putting pressure on the c4-pawn and also uses the fact that the queen on d3 is undefended so the pawn on c4 cannot move. We also saw this idea in the Trompowsky line. Now Black will finish development and exchange on e4 when the white pawn gets there. }
10. Nbd2 Be7 11. e4

{ Naturally, the exchanges favour the side with less space. } 13. Qxe4 O-O
{ Black finished development and has a compact position. The space disadvantage isn't felt as he has only two light pieces to accomodate. Black will play ...Qa5, put the rooks on e8 and d8 and then he has several ideas at his disposal: the ...c5 push to exchange the d4-pawn that gives White the space advantage, the ... b5 push, to weaken the c4-pawn and fight for the d5-square, the ...Nf8-g6 maneuver to continue controlling the e5-square but not blocking the d-file, the advance of the a-pawn  (after the queen moves from a5)  to create activity on the queenside by ...a4. All these ideas mean that Black is very comfortable here. }

{ The difference with the line 10 c4  is that here the maneuver ...Nb6-a4 can be met with Na5 and Black cannot give check on b4 to win the knight because White's king is not on e1 anymore. With the move 13... a5 Black gains space on the queenside and wants to harass the knight on b3. Now if White plays a4 he weakens the b4-square and if he doesn't Black will push ... a4, gaining more space. Obviously the endgame is quite alright for Black. }

He can also spend a move on ...h6 to secure the bishop if necessary. }
3... Nf6
{ Developing the knight and keeping the option to develop the bishop on g4. }
4. Bd3
{ The most flexible move, keeping the options to play either the Colle or the Zukertort. At the same time it prevents the development of the black bishop to f5. In case White starts with   4.b3  Bg4  and now puts the bishop on e2 with  5.Be2  ,  this doesn't affect Black's play as he continues with the typical development with  5...e6  and then  ...Nbd7  ,  ...Bd6  and  ...O-O  , which would lead to a transposition to the lines analysed after 1 b3. }
4... Bg4
{ Black develops the bishop on the other sensible and available square on the h3-c8 diagonal. Black's play against these systems is very simple and straight-forward as he follows the typical Slav development of ...e6, ...Nbd7, ...Bd6 and ...O-O. }
5. Nbd2 e6 6. O-O Nbd7
{ Now White should decide whether to play the Colle with 7 c3 or the Zukertort with 7 b3. }
7. c3
{ This pawn formation is typical for the Colle System and in fact it's a Slav reversed ! White will try to push e4 now. }
7... Bd6
{ Black continues with his usual development. If you compare White's and Black's position you will notice that Black's light-squared bishop is outside the pawn chain and more active than White's dark-squared bishop. Now White achieves the central push, but Black has nothing to complain about. }
8. e4 dxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxe4
{ Naturally, Black doesn't lose tempo by withdrawing the bishop on d6. } 10.
Bxe4 Bh5
{ Another typical maneuver we have seen in some other lines - Black wants to exchange White's active light-squared bishop by ...Bg6, but he will only play that when the moment is right. }
11. Re1 O-O
{ Since Black can play ...Bg6 at any moment he first finishes development and keeps White guessing when the move ...Bg6 will come. Another point of keeping the bishop on h5 is the tactical idea of preventing the natural move Bg5 because then Black wins a piece by ...Bf3. }
12. Bc2
{ The bishop was somewhat exposed on e4, but Black can continue to make useful moves and keep the ...Bg6 idea in reserve as without the bishop on e4 to defend the knight on f3 the white queen is restricted in her movement as she must keep an eye on the knight to prevent the doubling of the pawns. }
12... a5
{ Generally useful move, grabbing some space on the queenside. Black is very comfortable here, he can continue to make useful moves like ...Re8, ...Qc7  (both with the idea to push ...e5)  and the move ... Bg6 can come in case White tries to get out of the pin by Qd3. }

{ With this move White still keeps the option to go for the Reti after playing g3 or b3 on the next move, but in the majority of cases this is the start of the option number 3 above - being flexible against the Slav set-up. Note that there are several transpositions:   2.b3  transposes to the Various 1st Moves chapter where the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack is analysed;  the move   2.e3  after  2...c6  3.c4  transposes to another line from this chapter.  the move   2.b4  transposes to the chapter Various 1st Moves where the Sokolsky Opening  is analysed. }
2... c6 { Black wants to play the Slav. } 3. g3
{ With this move White enters the Reti Opening. } 3... Bg4
{ The bishop goes to g4 in order to have the option to take on f3 if necessary. This is important because Black's plan is to obtain a pawn centre by pushing ...e5. It is also important to make this move before ...Nf6 because Black needs to bolster his centre by .. .e6 first. }
4. Bg2
{ It's important to know that the attempts at a blitzkrieg don't work, as seen from the alternatives. }
4... e6
{ As a rule of thumb, if Black manages to establish the triangle of e6-d5-c6 in the centre he is safe against any quick attempts by White. Now White has 3 main plans:   
 To take on d5 in order to take advantage of his small lead in development and the exposed pawn on b7 coupled with the possibility to jump to e5;   
To play b3 and develop in the original Reti style with Bb2, d3, Nbd2 or Nc3 etc. and    To play d4. }
5. d4

5... Nf6 6. O-O

6... Nbd7 { Black develops the queenside first. } 7. Qb3 Qb6
{ The typical reaction is applicable here as well.. } 8. Nc3 Be7
{ Black continues with his development and wants to castle. } 9. c5 Qa6
{ With ...b6 to come next Black eliminates the advanced c5-pawn  (the pawn cannot remain on c5 and White will be forced to take on b6)  and obtains good play after recapturing with the pawn. He will castle and will have a compact central mass to play with. Play can continue }
10. Re1 { White wants to push e4. } 10... b6 11. cxb6 axb6 12. e4
{ White's only active plan. } 12... O-O 13. h3
{ In case of   13.e5  Ne8  the knight will be well placed on c7 from where it can go to c4 via b6  (after ...b5)  and Black can also attack White's centre by ...c5. }
13... Bxf3 { Not wasting time, Black creates an IQP on d4. } 14. Bxf3 dxe4 15.
Nxe4 Nd5
{ Black has easy play in this position. His pieces are harmoniously placed and he controls the centre. White has the bishop pair, but the robust Black position leaves little for it to attack. }

{ 24.h3  A rather vague move, but it was played by Ivanchuk, so worth taking a look how Giri handles the Black side.  Rd8  A good defensive idea. The rook wants to occupy the d7-square, from where it will cover the 7th rank and the sensitive pawns on a7 and g7. Additionally it both covers and supports the passed d5-pawn.  There was nothing wrong with   24...Rh4  25.Re6+  Kc5  26.Rc1+  Rc4  Which is very similar to the lines after 24 Re6 below.  25.Re6+  Kc7  26.Rc1  Rd6   26...Rxc1+  27.Kxc1  Rd6  28.Re7+  Rd7  29.Re6  Would have led to a repetition.

{ This move shows that White has nothing and plays for simplifications.   16.Bd2  Keeps both bishops, but after  Bc6  Black has more space and more constructive ideas, like ...Qb7, ...Nd5, ...Bf6, ...Rc8 etc. }
16... Bxf6 17. Nd2 Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Rc8
{ The position is equal, but Black is on the better side of it. He has more space and more ideas to play with. Caruana demonstrates this beautifully. }
19. Qb3 Rb8 20. Nce4 Be7 21. Kg1 f5 { Pushing the knight back. } 22. Nc3 Ne5
{ The knight sits pretty on e5, but it can also hop to d4 via c6 after Black defends the pawn on e6 by ...Kf7. }
23. h3 h5
{ This move introduces the threat of ...h4, even though 23... Kf7 was possible. }
24. Nf3
{ White prevents ...h4 at the expense of his pawn structure. 24 h4 looks ugly, weakening the g4-square and allowing ...g5 at some point. }
24... Nxf3+ 25. exf3 Bf6
{ The bishop is obviously better than the knight in this position. It also has the strong d4-square at his disposal. }
26. Re1 { It was better to fix the kingside by   26.h4. } 26... Kf7 27. Ne2 g5
{ The engine prefers   27...h4  ,  but even after } 28. g4
{ The point of this move is to obtain the e4-square for the knight after the exchanges on g4. }
28... hxg4 29. hxg4 fxg4 30. fxg4 Qd6 { Black keeps the pressure. } 31. Ng3 Qd5
32. Qc2 Bd4 33. Qe2 Rh8 34. Ne4
{ The strong knight gives White hopes to defend successfully, though it will be a difficult task. }
34... Qe5 35. Qf3+ Kg7 36. b3
{ This exposes the pawn. It was better to leave it on b2 where it was easier to defend it  (taking it by ...Bxb2 would lose the b5-pawn due to Rb1)  . }
36... Rf8 37. Qe2 Qd5
{ Threatening ...Rf4, continuing to pile up the pressure. } 38. Rf1 Kg6
{ Defending the pawn on g5 and threatening to take on b3. } 39. Qd1 c4
{ Undermining the knight on e4. } 40. bxc4 bxc4 41. Kg2 Ba7 42. f3
{ White managed to reinforce the knight on e4, but this cost him the pawn on d3. Still, thanks to the strong knight he still has good chances. }
42... cxd3 43. Qa1 Be3 44. Rd1 { After   44.Qb2  White was still in the game. }
44... Qc4 { Now the threat is ...Qc2 and it's devastating. } 45. Qc3 Qa2+ 46.
Nd2 Qc2 { White is tied down and his position collapses. } 47. Qe5
{ Losing a piece. White will give a lot of checks now but eventually the king manages to hide. }
47... Bxd2 48. Qxe6+ Kg7 49. Qe7+ Rf7 50. Qe5+ Kf8 51. Qb8+ Ke7 52. Qe5+ Kd8
53. Qb8+ Kd7 54. Qb7+ Kd6 55. Qb6+ Ke5 56. Qb5+ Kd4 57. Qb6+ Kc4 58. Qe6+ Kc3
59. Qe5+ Kb3 60. Qd5+ Kb2 61. Qb5+ Bb4+
{ Finally Black gets to give check and the game is over. } 62. Kg3 Qxd1 63.

O-O Bd6 9. e4 dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Qxe4 O-O
{ This is a typical position that can arise from many lines of the Slav. } 12.
Bd2 Qf6
{ A notable moment. Capablanca immediately seeks to address the issue of the active queen on e4.   12...a5  Was a typical move that was perfectly fine. }
13. Rad1
{ 13.Bc3  Qg6  14.Qe2  This is an attempt to keep the queens on board.  Qh5  The queen can arrive there with the ...Qa5-h5 maneuver  (though not in this game as White played Bd2)  and she is useful on the kingside to prevent any White activity there.  15.Rfe1  Rfd8  16.Rad1  Nf8  With the idea of ...Ng6. The knight is useful on g6 because it still covers the e5-square, but without covering the d-file. }
13... Qg6 14. Qxg6 { 14.Qe2  Qc2  Would have been annoying for White. } 14...
hxg6 15. Bc3 Rfd8
{ 15...b5 !?  Would have been more forcing, immediately fighting for the d5-square, a positional idea that is utmost importance in these positions. The tactical point is that after  16.b3  Black can actually play  Nb6  Not fearing the fork  17.c5  Nd5  Because the bishop on c3 hangs. }
16. Rfe1 Bc7 { The bishop moves from the d-file. } 17. Kf1 Nf8
{ A very instructive defensive maneuver. The knight covers the e6-pawn so that Black can play ...f6 to take control of the e5-square, thus eliminating the Ne5 jump forever. }
18. Bd2
{ 18.Bb4  Would have prevented ...f6 temporarily as after  a5  19.Ba3  Bd6  The bishops will be exchanged and Black will play ...f6 eventually. }
18... f6 19. h4 { Preventing a possible expansion by ...g5. } 19... Kf7 20. g3
Nd7
{ The knight did its job on f8 and now that the king took over the defence of the e6-pawn it goes to another journey - this time to e7. }
21. Be3 Nb6 22. Rc1 Nc8 23. Re2 Ne7
{ The knight reached its destination. From e7 it controls the d5-square, so no d5-breaks are possible and it can also go to f5 for more pressure on the d4-pawn. The control over d5 also makes the positional idea of ...b5 attractive as the knight can jump to d5 immediately. }
24. Rc3 a6
{ Black doesn't threaten ...b5 just yet, but he is planning to do so. } 25. a4
Rab8 { Now ...b5 is a threat as the rook can capture on b5. } 26. b4 b5
{ Black finally obtains the d5-square for his knight, but allows a protected passed pawn in return. }
27. cxb5 axb5 28. a5 Bd6 29. Rb3 Nd5 { Finally achieving his positional aim ! }
30. Bd2 Rdc8 { Both positions are impregnable, so a draw was agreed. } *
