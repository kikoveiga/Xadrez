{ Hi and welcome to this Quickstarter!  This is a part of an update that I am doing now, in June 2020, as this course is about to go in print as a physical book.  Let me tell you a few words about how I think you should use it and based on what factors I chose the lines for it!  Back when I was creating it, Quickstarters weren't a thing yet. But, considering I have been doing my best to make the process of studying my repertoires as enjoyable and convenient as possible, I thought it wouldn't hurt to add it.  Since this work was published, I've made a few more courses that have already been received very positively, and have prepared a few more ones that are yet to be published. Besides shameless self-advertising you might see implied in the last phrase, this also means I have gained tons of experience with Chessable, as well as with the Quickstarters.  My first QS, done for the Accelerated Queen's Indian repertoire, was good in many ways, but it was too large.  I would simply include a few core lines from each chapter, and considering there are more than a dozen chapters in that course, the QC turned out 50 lines long. A bit too much, in my opinion.  My second QS, done for my course on the Dynamic Italian for White, which is about to be published soon, saw a slightly different strategy. I picked some key mainlines as well as sidelines that are simply bad, as they are rather popular. I've included typical mistakes in the QC. And, I've also tried including lines from each chapter, that's what most authors do.  For this QS, though, I have decided to break this tradition. I have ignored most chapters, such as one on King's Gambit, Vienna game, sidelines, etc. I have only added lines from a few key chapters, as I believe the point of the Quickstarter is to get you up and running quickly - quite logical, isn't it? - so it's not worth discussing sidelines here. After all, they are covered in the actual chapters, feel free to take a look!  So, I've given some lines from the Italian here, a few from Scotch and the Scotch four knights, a couple from the Exchange Ruy and the 5.d3 Ruy and a few from the Open Spanish, the heart of this repertoire.  I am offering two solutions vs the Spanish - 6...exd4 and 6...Be7. While the latter is a much more serious theoretical option, I have included 6...exd4 in the Quickstarter. My reasoning behind this was very simple: if you are a player of 1800 and below, or even 2000 and below, most likely you will be using the line 6...exd4. So, that's what you need.  If you are a stronger player or a lower-rated one who wishes to play 6...Be7, then you don't need any shortcuts, feel free to just start with the actual chapter!  I hope such a way of organizing this QS makes sense, and while some may be unhappy about it, I think most users will find it practical, as the Italian/Scotch/Scotch 4 knights/Ruy is 95% of what they encounter in their games!  Good luck, dear students!  Cheers,  Yuriy }

{ For me personally, the Italian was the toughest nut to crack for this course. This is not because of theoretical problems Black encounters, but due to a tremendous amount of transpositions. When we play 3... Bc5 in the quiet Italian, White has the following options:  1  d3 without c3  2  d3 with c3  3  advancing the a-pawn with d3-a4 or d3-c3-a4  4  aim for a pawn on b4  The gambits and sidelines weren't an issue and are quite easy to handle, provided you carefully study the suggested lines. On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own. If we understand how we develop our pieces and what the typical maneuvres are we will do really well. The approach has always worked for me. I hope that you will be understanding regarding this and that the material is useful to you dear friends! }

{ I still feel it could be possible, although very difficult, to play for a win. Especially if White doesn't immediately exchange the knight for the bishop, as our bishop is better in the long run. Objectively there is not yet an advantage for Black. However, in certain scenarios, Black will gain an edge. For example when the rooks get traded. Ideas like Bf5-Bb1 ! can disturb White on the queenside. If the White pawns then end up on a3 and b4 with an inactive king, Black can make use of the g8-a2 diagonal with a lovely route for his king. In many situations, the bishop can immediately start restricting the knight, let's say with a bishop on d5 and a knight on d2. }

All these moves can transpose into another, but let us first take a look at d3-d4.

{ You could also look at Nc5 to keep more pieces. Nc5 is obviously pursuing the idea to go Nd3 and ask White to give us a bishop against a knight. However, after Nc5 b4!? things don't look as simple to me, because Nd3+ can be met with Ke2 after which Black doesn't achieve his goal. That's why Nxd2 seems like an easy solution to me. }
17... Nxd2 18. Kxd2 Rd8+ 19. Ke1 Be4
{ After g3 Black can try Bf3 or Rd6 after which the rook can go to h6 or b6. If you are satisfied with equality, just trade the rooks and shake hands. This is definitely not a line to be scared of. }

After d6-d5, if Black achieves this move, the c3-pawn is weak ! Imagine how hard it would be for White to develop queenside pieces with for example a Black knight on d5. Things are not that simple though, as d6-d5 isn't yet possible. However, plans you can rely on include:   1  Ne7-Ng6 followed by Re8, c7-c6, and d6-d5.

{ Only this move has been tried, which makes sense: White needs to either bring this knight to e3, or make the room for the bishop on c1, which can also go to e3. }

{ Now we reach a rather critical position where White needs to understand what his plan should be. This is some very new stuff with no games, and it's always not easy to predict what the theoretical developments would look like. But, it makes sense to look at a few continuations. As I understand it, it's crucial for White to try and get the counterplay in the center, because if Black had played ...Bd7 and ...O-O-O, White's business would be about to close down. }

{ The main advantage of this line is that it's rare and you can easily equalize, especially if White isn't well-prepared. I won't delve into a lot of complications after Qf6, especially because Be3 is a very rare variation. I hope that you are happy with this suggestion of mine because I have enjoyed this line myself and so far no one has played the most challenging move against me. However, I do understand we are taking some risks. }
6. Bxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 Qf6
{ This is when people usually delve into deep thoughts. White can count on a slight edge provided he is precise, but I think it's a good idea to take risks at some point. I would also like to emphasize again that this course is supposed to be a good balance between suggesting objectively good, sound lines and keeping it user-friendly, as opposed to some GM Repertoire books which are of extremely high quality but must feel like a foreign language to most players below 2000-2100. }

{ I have decided to cover the Scotch Four Knights because this is something club players face a lot. The simplicity of the arising positions and straightforwardness of White's plan largely contributed to the popularity of this variation. So did some good books such as Keep It Simple, published by fellow Chessable author Sielecki. I have decided to come up with a slightly offbeat approach. This approach should enable you to get a rather complex and fighting position where White is unable to play the first 15 moves on autopilot but would rather need to solve some new tasks. I can't promise an advantage for Black, but we will try to present our opponent with some new challenges. }
4... Bb4 { This suits our task best. } 5. d5
{ This might seem very reasonable to many players because it gains space. This closed position is similar to the Nimzo-Indian and, as we will see, the bishop pair doesn't matter here. Black can try to play a long-term game against White's worse structure. This is a very unpleasant scenario for a 1. e4 player to face ! }
5... Ne7 6. Bd3 d6 7. O-O Bxc3 8. bxc3 Nd7
{ I think that this is a great choice to play for a win where your opponent has long-term weaknesses. His space advantage matters less after trading some pieces, while White's weaknesses become more noticeable. It is interesting to know that this position has only been reached in one game ! I will give a few possible variations on how the game can develop, but also strongly suggest that you study this typical Nimzo-Indian structure that arises in the so-called Huebner Wall variation. Black would like to push f7-f5, while White can try g3-f4. We will first take a look at what happens if White plays without a plan. After that, we'll study some variations which seem to be more active for White. However, I've realized that it's near impossible for White to be able to play g3-f4 ! So these seemingly active variations are actually Black ! }
9. Be3
{ This might look like a normal developing move, but in closed positions, it's important to choose the correct squares for your pieces. The bishop isn't doing much on e3, just like it wouldn't on d2, b2 or a3. And importantly, White is not pursuing any plan, which makes matters even worse. }
9... O-O 10. c4
{ This will demonstrate Black's plan, provided White is passive. } 10... b6
{ This is a very important move. It prepares Nc5 and prevents variations with Bxc5 where we need to take with the d-pawn. Taking with the b-pawn only strengthens our center and opens up the b-file. }
11. Qe2 Nc5 12. Rab1 Nxd3
{ Our plan includes this and f5. In some other lines, I was afraid that f5 would be met with d3-d4 !, which is impossible here. That is why it's such a timely decision. }
13. cxd3 f5
{ It's obvious that Black seized the initiative. The f-file is opening up and Black's pieces are ideally placed. The knight can go to g6, the bishop to g4. Then we'll develop our queen and the other rook, for instance with Rf7-Raf8. }

However, I could not find this edge even after many hours of analysis and with the help of an engine ! That's why I feel good about recommending it. }

{ Please, take a look at this line first to understand the ideas behind Qf6 in the main line. This is the way people used to play back in the day. The idea is very simple: trade all the pieces and win the pawn endgame. White wants to castle queenside, so that 1  when he advances the pawn on the kingside, his king is safe, as it is not being opened up. 2  it's faster to get to the center from c1 rather than g1.

4... dxc6 5. O-O
{ This has become the absolute main line as of late, however in order to understand the reasons why it is the case, and why my recommendation is Qf6, please study the 5. d4 line first. }
5... Qf6
{ This is not a huge surprise anymore, unfortunately - previously this move was really rare - but it's way less frequent than Bg4 or f6, which I find too dull and well-studied. The idea will be revealed in the next annotation }
6. d4 exd4 7. Bg5 { Why not win another tempo on the Black queen ? } 7... Qd6
8. Nxd4 { The most problematic path, actually. } 8... Be7
{ Now we'll study both the attempt to trade Black's bishop pair as well as the one to play with the bishops. }
9. Bxe7 Nxe7 10. Nc3 Bd7 11. Nb3
{ This was tried by a player non less than Leko himself - an amazing, fantastic technical player, who perhaps wanted to squeeze the young Magnus in some sligthly better endgame. It didn't prove the case though, let's see what happened. }
11... Qxd1 12. Raxd1 b6 13. Rd2 O-O-O 14. Rfd1 c5 15. Nd5 Nxd5
{ Now, White should, of course, take with the rook.  Why is it a bad idea to capture with the pawn?  Let's again discuss both sides' advantages - White has sort of an extra pawn on the kingside, while Black's doubled pawn is less valuable. Black, on the other hand, has a clearly superior minor piece - his bishop is way better than the White's knight. So, if White takes with the pawn, he loses his advantage  - a possibility to later create a passer on the kingside, Black on the other hand will still have his amazing bishop. I would simply go Bf5 then, followed by Rhe8, maybe then my king could walk to d6, I can look to double up the rook over the e-file at some point, or on the other hand I could go Rd7, Rd8, maybe f6 to play Bf5-g6-bf7 and tackle the new weakness - the d5-pawn. Black is clearly better! }
16. Rxd5
{ I think that 16...f5!, as Carlsen played, is very idea-based and good. But, 16..Be6 is also simple enough and good enough - let us say both are good moves. I made Carlsen's game informational, so you don't train both moves, you can consider them to be alternatively good. Hope, that helps! }
16... Be6 17. Rxd8+ Rxd8 18. Rxd8+ Kxd8 19. f3 Kd7
{ With a good position - the bishop is much superior to the knight. But, a very strong idea 17...f5 is also interesting, please take a look at the quoted game Leko-Carlsen in the corresponding chapter. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3
{ Now it's time to consider this little pawn move. Just as 6. d3, it is usually used by people, who would like to play calm positional chess and avoid analyzing forcing lines, which we study later in this course. However, everything comes at price - Black gets to develop in a very smooth way, and I am about to explain the subtleties of the setup now. }
5... d6 6. c3 g6
{ This is the reason, why 5. d3 is less dangerous than its 'older sibling', the 6. d3 line  (which we don't face though with our repertoire)  . Why is this move so good and so important ? Because in the very main Ruy Lopez very often Black plays Bf8-e7 and then tries to defend his king with such manoeuvres as Rf8-e8, Be7-f8, then g7-g6 and Bf8-g7 ! Count, how many tempi did we just save ? This is why I think that 5,d3 gives Black such an easy game. The next moves don't matter that much - White can play Nbd2, O-O, Re1, Nf1, Ng3,h3 - these are all typical Ruy Lopez moves to get more presense on the kingside. We will play Bg7, O-O, then a few options are possible. Let's proceed with the line to discuss them soon. }
7. Nbd2 Bg7 8. O-O O-O 9. Re1 b5
{ Now this is the interesting point. White can retreat his bishop to two different squares - and we will react differently, too ! }
10. Bc2
{ Please, pay attention that there is also a move Bb3 and consult other chapters to cover this one - it's very important here, as we react in a different way to the other retreat! }
10... Nb8
{ It is a typical Breyer regroupment, which I really like as a person, who has played around 20 classical games in Breyer so far to never lose one, even to many GMs. This setup is so flexible ! Your next moves include Nbd7, Bb7, Re8, then often pawn to c5, pawn to d5. The point of removing the knight is that on c6 it was not doing much - it couldn't go to many squares and was also obstructing the bishop on b7. And now from d7 it can often go to c5 or b6, for example. }
11. d4 Nbd7 12. Nf1 Bb7 13. Ng3 Re8
{ Is funnily a direct transposition to the Breyer variation of the Ruy Lopez, when White is two tempi down! That is because d2-d4 was played in two moves, he also has not managed to get h2-h3 in Black already installed his bishop on g7 and did it without losing the time. You can consider the simplifying d6-d5 break on the next move, for instance. Or play a tense game with c7-c5, keep the tension going. }

I do agree that objectively White is better in this ending, which is why I would propose another, solid opening variation as well. However, first of all, even GMs went for this position to successfully hold it versus other GMs - White's advantage is small.

I think we could emerge with an advantage in this line, but I believe that it's most important to have a secure way to reach a good position. You don't want to remember dozens of transpositions and move orders to get a slight edge in a very rare line. All the subtle nuances will likely be forgotten by the time the position appears on the board. So we play a simple variation and reach equality.  The pawn structures are a bit unbalanced here, with White having pretty weak light-squares with d5 and c4. We want to play Rc8, Na5, and Nc4. After that Qd5 could be a nice blockading move. After accomplishing this we are clearly better. In such a position we don't mind trading some pieces because of a better endgame due to White's weak squares in the center.  You will encounter this pattern and structure in several other suggested lines in this, including the Scotch Four Knights where we are pursuing the same structural goals. }

3... Ne7
{ This rare move was played by GM Bacrot in 7 or 8 games with Black ! I tend to trust this player in his opening choices, and it was in his games that I found this idea. Black wants to play Ng6 and keep the pawn. In some lines, the knight goes to d5 and then e3, with Black returning the pawn to get a stable positional edge or a solid position. Importantly, we deprive White of his typical attacking ideas, which are precisely the reason why he would play the King's Gambit. 3... d5 and 3... g5 are the main moves, but White should be very well-prepared to meet them, obviously. }

{ And now I want to suggest the following improvement over 7... Be6 and 7... O-O. We play 7... c6 ! What makes this a better move ?  For example, after   7...Be6  White can trade on d5  8.Bxd5  Bxd5  take the pawn on f4  9.Bxf4  and then try to play b3 and c4 to get a nice center.  We play c6 to anticipate Bxd5 and meet it with cxd5. It does create an additional pawn island, but that will prevent White from playing c2-c4 and will give us an extra pawn and more influence in the center ! Then our development would be very easy as we have seen in several previous lines. We will play Nc6, O-O, develop the bishop to e6, f5 or g4 and play Rc8. If White doesn't take, we have plans with Ne3, which sacrifices the pawn but ensures the bishop pair for Black and makes White part with his dark-squared bishop ! }

{ Black has a great game with his bishop pair and pressure on the center. White's bishop on b3 isn't great either. White will never have attacking chances here. One more cool idea for Black is to play b7-b5 !?, trying to win the d5-square after both cxb5 cxb5 or c4-c5. That is something we can do at some point - no need to hurry right now. }

11. Bd5 c6 12. Bf3 Ba6
{ The point of our development is that the White pieces will be rather misplaced now. Please note why the a5-knight is so useful - Be3 will be effectively parried with Nc4 ! }
13. Re1 g6
{ Another good move - the knight is coming to f5 ! The position is somewhat non-standard, but it looks good for Black. Black's plan is primitively simple, win many tempi and develop by attacking the weird queen on f4 ! Some moves are Nf5, d7-d5, and Bd6. The White knights and the bishop on f3 aren't doing much either. }

{ The Bishop's Opening is an interesting variation that is mostly played because of two reasons.  1  Avoiding well-known theoretical positions.   2  Getting an Italian and avoid, for example,  a Petroff:   2.Nf3  Nf6  I am extremely happy with this part of the repertoire because of the simplicity of the recommendation. This was shown to me by a Ukrainian player and friend of mine, whose name I don't feel entitled to disclose. It turns out that White can't really avoid a transposition into an Italian with 3... Bc5 ! This is a nice point of playing 3... Bc5. Let's delve into the variations ! What if White tries to actually pursue a Bishop's Opening as an independent opening system ? }
2... Nf6 3. d3 Bc5
{ Now, obviously,   4.Nf3  Nc6  transposes to the Italian, which is what I mentioned. So the only independent attempt is to play Nc3 and try to push f2-f4. }
4. Nc3 O-O
{ This is a really nice move order. It seems like we are letting White push f2-f4, aren't we ? }
5. f4
{ Even though White is able to keep equality after this move, it is much easier to play with Black. So this doesn't seem like a smart practical choice for White. But many players would go for it, as it's very logical to play this way if you want a pure Bishop's Opening on the board and not an Italian ! So get ready to collect your points ! }
5... d5
{ The whole point of Black's move order. We are trying to prove that we have developed enough to punish White's premature activity. Now, White has many possibilities at his disposal, but at best he may aspire to reach equality. }
6. fxe5
{ Common sense should yell at the White player that this isn't a good move. But it is useful to know how to punish White's centralized king. }
6... Nxe4 7. Nxe4 dxe4
{ Now, obviously, threats like Qh4+ and Qd4 prove to be simply devastating. Black is already almost winning. }
8. dxe4 Qh4+ 9. Ke2 Qf2+

6. Bxd5
{ This isn't a good move because of several reasons - both tactical and positional ones. Why give up an important and developed bishop ? }
6... Ng4
{ Now the threat is obvious and strong, but things aren't so simple this time. Of course, Nh3 is a bad move because of Qh4. We have seen that in another line, but White has a strong sacrificial idea here. }
7. Qe2 Nf2 8. Na4
{ Black cannot quit the g1-a7 diagonal now as the f2-knight would hang. So the next move is forced. }
8... Bd4 9. c3 Nxh1 10. cxd4 exd4
{ What is the difference between this position and a possible situation where Black lets White take the c5-bishop with the knight ? The point is that the a4-knight is horrible here ! Actually, Qe7/d6 followed by b7-b5 even traps the knight. That is why Black has great counterplay here. He is now an exchange up. What matters in such positions are time and initiative, so even if White will ever win the h1-knight, Black will be in time to get counterplay. }
11. Bd2 c6 12. Bb3 Nd7 { Threatening b7-b5 ! } 13. Rc1 Qe7
{ Black keeps insisting. You might be surprised, but there is no way White can prevent b5, so he loses the knight ! The position remains very complicated, but it's definitely a great one for Black. You will simply end up with an extra rook. While White tries to get the h1-knight, you can continue to develop. This is a position with many possibilities, but the fact that you're going to be a rook up should be convincing. }

{ White has a slightly weakened kingside, so optimists can claim that Black has a small edge. I would say that this shouldn't be too dangerous for White and is likely equal.

We will just keep developing and playing good moves in the center - Rfe8, maybe Rad8 followed by c7-c5, or c7-c6 to gain more control over some central squares. Activating the king with f6/f5 followed by Kf7 is also a plan. }

{ For me personally, the Italian was the toughest nut to crack for this course. This is not because of theoretical problems Black encounters, but due to a tremendous amount of transpositions. When we play 3... Bc5 in the quiet Italian, White has the following options:  1  d3 without c3  2  d3 with c3  3  advancing the a-pawn with d3-a4 or d3-c3-a4  4  aim for a pawn on b4  The gambits and sidelines weren't an issue and are quite easy to handle, provided you carefully study the suggested lines. On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own. If we understand how we develop our pieces and what the typical maneuvres are we will do really well. The approach has always worked for me. I hope that you will be understanding regarding this and that the material is useful to you dear friends! }

{ Although not an obligatory move, it is a good one after which we can stop. White has an extra pawn in the center, Black has one on the queenside and his structure is a bit better. Normally, an extra pawn on the queenside tends to matter more as we approach the endgame, so it is a good idea to trade a few pieces, like the active White knight on e5, here. A possible follow-up is Be6, Nd7  (trading or chasing the knight)  , Rad8 and Rfe8 to centralize the rooks or f7-f5 with a rook on f8. The knight on a5 can return to c6 or go to c4 when possible, which is a great outpost. This is definitely a good position. }

Objectively there is not yet an advantage for Black. However, in certain scenarios, Black will gain an edge. For example when the rooks get traded. Ideas like Bf5-Bb1 ! can disturb White on the queenside. If the White pawns then end up on a3 and b4 with an inactive king, Black can make use of the g8-a2 diagonal with a lovely route for his king. In many situations, the bishop can immediately start restricting the knight, let's say with a bishop on d5 and a knight on d2. }

On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3...

The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own.

{ For me personally, the Italian was the toughest nut to crack for this course. This is not because of theoretical problems Black encounters, but due to a tremendous amount of transpositions. When we play 3... Bc5 in the quiet Italian, White has the following options:  1  d3 without c3  2  d3 with c3  3  advancing the a-pawn with d3-a4 or d3-c3-a4  4  aim for a pawn on b4  The gambits and sidelines weren't an issue and are quite easy to handle, provided you carefully study the suggested lines. On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own. If we understand how we develop our pieces and what the typical maneuvres are we will do really well. The approach has always worked for me.

9. Nc3 O-O 10. Be3 Ne7 11. Bd3
{ This is perhaps the most testing move for White. Some strong players tried taking on c3 or playing f5, but I trust Harikrishna's choice. Is it because he's a top player or by being a Chessable author that him more credible ? :  Whatever the reason, we follow his game }
11... Bf5 12. O-O Nxc3 13. bxc3 Qd7
{ Speaking of this position, I need to mention the following ideas. White has an extra pawn in the center, we do on the queenside. In some positions, our ideas may include f7-f6, but sometimes we can go for Rc8-c5 to help activate our bishop and create certain pressure on White's center. The engine tends to prefer White slightly because of his space, but I have a lot of trust in Black's position. It's flexible, contains active ideas and we have no weaknesses. I think the best move for White is }

{ And now Hari chose the interesting blockade f7-f5 !?, but I think another good solution would be }
15... f6 16. f4 Qa4
{ An unexpected move, planning to play Qc4 ! If White takes, we will get a fantastic d5-square for the knight. If he doesn't the queen is very well-placed there. It controls the f1-square, which comes in handy if the f-file opens up, and keeps an eye on the queenside. }

{ All the previous moves and ideas behind them have been explained in other variations.  Now that I'm adding this line, it's been a year since the publication of this repertoire. A diligent student noticed this move wasn't covered, so here we go!  With c2-c3, White is just wanting to see where the knight will go. For example, after ...Nc6 the issue is that there's no ...Ne6-related ideas in the future.   Here, 8...Nc6 has been played 37 times and 8...Bg4 was seen in 20 games. I like the rare alternative }
8... Ne6
{ The knight is keeping an eye both on the f4-pawn as well as on the g5-square.  Instead, 8...Be6 9.Bd3 does not look clear to me as the bishop might get hit by f4-f5. }
9. f5
{ 9.fxe5 was also tried, but after dxe5 I fail to see any compensation for the missing pawn whatsoever.  Now, White locks the position, hoping to play g2-g4 or Bg5 later on. }
9... Nc5 10. Nd2 c6
{ Black prepares such ideas as ...b7-b5 and ...d6-d5. It's also possible to continue ...a7-a5-a4, grabbing space on the queenside and stopping b2-b4. }
11. Qe2 b5
{ In my opinion, White is simply a pawn down. The statistics/results and the way the games went confirm my assumption.  Please check out the game Chelushkina - Abramovic, 2005, where Black went on to win extremely easily. }

When we play 3... Bc5 in the quiet Italian, White has the following options:  1  d3 without c3  2  d3 with c3  3  advancing the a-pawn with d3-a4 or d3-c3-a4  4  aim for a pawn on b4  The gambits and sidelines weren't an issue and are quite easy to handle, provided you carefully study the suggested lines. On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own.

{ Now it's time to stop and evaluate the consequences of the complications. White is a piece down, he has just one pawn for it, and it looks like this pawn is about to be lost. However, Black's king is not very comfotrable in the center and Black will need quite a lot of time to develop his queenside pieces. I believe that White definitely has compensation here. However, with a few precise moves Black will extinguish White's initiative, reaching a position where White's compensation will be enough only to fight for equality. }

{ I believe that at this point White's initiative is already vanishing. Now the engine suggests some move Rae1, giving up the g7-pawn.

On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian.

{ For me personally, the Italian was the toughest nut to crack for this course. This is not because of theoretical problems Black encounters, but due to a tremendous amount of transpositions. When we play 3... Bc5 in the quiet Italian, White has the following options:  1  d3 without c3  2  d3 with c3  3  advancing the a-pawn with d3-a4 or d3-c3-a4  4  aim for a pawn on b4  The gambits and sidelines weren't an issue and are quite easy to handle, provided you carefully study the suggested lines. On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own. If we understand how we develop our pieces and what the typical maneuvres are we will do really well. The approach has always worked for me. I hope that you will be understanding regarding this and that the material is useful to you dear friends! }

{ The a5-approach has lately been really popular with top GM's, but I think placing the pawn on a6 entails simpler ideas and can be applied almost universally. Why do we make this move ? Most importantly, we create an escape square for our bishop on a7, should it be attacked with b2-b4. It would be normal for White to develop with Bb3, Nbd2, a4, and similar moves. All these moves can transpose into another, but let us first take a look at d3-d4.

True, most players don't go there, but you should know everything ! Finally, I have decided to stick to 3... c5 as the main repertoire choice, as I felt it would be easier for me to rely on ideas after this move rather than knowledge and keep it more user-friendly in chessable format. The general approach towards Italian chapters - I hope, dear students, you will understand my reasoning ! - is to cover in detail all the sidelines, such as Evans gambit, the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is quite possible that we will not touch base regarding some particular move order, as every single player seems to be having a move order of his own, but if we understand how to develop our pieces, what the typical maneuvres are, we will do really well - at least, this approach had always worked for me. I hope you will be understanding regarding this matter and that the material will be useful for you, dear friends ! }
4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 a6
{ Lately the ...a7-a5-approach has been really popular with top-GMs, but I think placing the pawn on a6 entails easier ideas and can be applied almost universally. Why do we make this move ? Most importantly, we prepare the a7-square for our bishop to retreat to, should it be attacked with b2-b4. Now, it would be normal for White to develop with Bb3, Nbd2, a4, whatever. All these moves can transpose one into another, but first let's take a look at d3-d4. This may seem illogical on the one hand, as White achieves d2-d4 in two moves, but on the other hand might be attractive for some White players, as it seems to be opening the game up when the Black king still is not castled. }
7. a4 Ba7
{ It doesn't make sense to go Bg5 before Black had castled, as simple ... h7-h6 followed by ...g7-g5 would kick the bishop away, and Black's king would not even be weakened. That is why we would consider Bg5 on move 9 for White, this is where it makes sense. }

But, this is a really important line to at least look at, because if you don't know, you might have a hard time making all those precise moves in the practical settings. By the way, this is another very fresh position as only one correspondence game has reached it ! }

{ Now some weird draw should occur, strangely enough. } 18. Qh4 Nf4 19. Qg3 Nh5
{ Fortunately or not, both parties have to take this funny repetition. The problem is that the f7-knight, while it's clearly nearly trapped, is doing an important job of stopping us from castling long, so we need to repeat this way. }

7... Ba7 8. Re1 O-O 9. b4
{ We cannot analyze every single possible line here, but I can say that you can pursue a few plans and that b2-b4 is a typical disadvantage. After d6-d5, if Black achieves this move, the c3-pawn is weak ! Imagine how hard it would be for White to develop queenside pieces with for example a Black knight on d5. Things are not that simple though, as d6-d5 isn't yet possible. However, plans you can rely on include:   1  Ne7-Ng6 followed by Re8, c7-c6, and d6-d5. I call this the Central Approach.   2  h6, Nh5, Qf6, and Nf4. This is more aggressive, let's take a look at one line to illustrate what I mean. }
9... h6 10. Nbd2 Nh5 11. Nf1

On the other hand, 3... Nf6 is more straightforward but then you need to learn a number of forcing lines in the Two Knights. True, most players don't play it, but you should know everything! Eventually, I decided to stick with 3... Bc5 as the choice for the repertoire, as I felt it would be easier for me to keep it user-friendly in the Chessable format, relying on ideas rather than knowledge after this move. The general approach towards the Italian chapters is to cover the sidelines in detail, such as the Evans Gambit and the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is possible that we will not stick to a particular move order, as every single player seems to have a move order of his own. If we understand how we develop our pieces and what the typical maneuvres are we will do really well. The approach has always worked for me. I hope that you will be understanding regarding this and that the material is useful to you dear friends! }

{ The a5-approach has lately been really popular with top GM's, but I think placing the pawn on a6 entails simpler ideas and can be applied almost universally. Why do we make this move ? Most importantly, we create an escape square for our bishop on a7, should it be attacked with b2-b4. It would be normal for White to develop with Bb3, Nbd2, a4, and similar moves. All these moves can transpose into another, but let us first take a look at d3-d4. This might seem illogical, as White achieves d2-d4 in two moves, but it might also be attractive for some White players, as it seems to be opening up the game when the Black king has not yet castled. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5
{ For me personally, Italian was the toughest nut to crack for this course. The reason is not theoretical problems Black encounters, but a huge, tremendous amount of transpositions. If we choose 3... Bc5, in the quiet Italian White can play d3 without c3,with c3, advance the pawn on a4 with d3-a4 or d3-c3-a4 or keep it on a2, try to place or not to place the pawn on b4. The gambits and sidelines weren't an issue, as it's quite easy to handle them, provided you study the suggested lines carefully. On the other hand, 3..Nf6 is better in terms of being more straightforward, but I did not want you to learn a number of forcing lines in Two Knights. True, most players don't go there, but you should know everything ! Finally I have decided to stick to 3... Bc5 as the main repertoire choice, as I felt it would be easier for me to rely on ideas after this move rather than knowledge and keep it more user-friendly. The general approach towards Italian chapters - I hope, dear students, you will understand my reasoning ! - is to cover in detail all the sidelines, such as Evans gambit, the c3-d4 lines, and explain the key ideas in the Main Quiet Italian. It is quite possible that we will not touch base regarding some particular move order, as every single player seems to be having a move order of his own, but if we understand how to develop our pieces, what the typical maneuvres are, we will do really well - at least, this approach had always worked for me. I hope you will be understanding regarding this matter and that the material will be useful for you, dear friends ! Again, 4. d3 or 4. c3 followed by 5. d3 would just lead us to the same positions. }
4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 a6
{ Lately the a7-a5-approach has been really popular with top-GMs, but I think placing the pawn on a6 entails easier ideas and can be applied almost universally. Why do we make this move ? Most importantly, we prepare the a7-square for our bishop to retreat to, should it be attacked with b2-b4. Now, it would be normal for White to develop with Bb3, Nbd2, a4, whatever. All these moves can transpose one into another, but first let's take a look at d3-d4. This may seem illogical on the one hand, as White achieves d2-d4 in two moves, but on the other hand might be attractive for some White players, as it seems to be opening the game up when the Black king still is not castled. }
7. a4
{ I will show you a brand-new exciting idea now, but please do note that because of many transpositions you will need to play around with the variations yourself as well to make sure all the ideas work in these slightly different positions - whether White's pawn is on a2, a4; c2 or c3 etc. Most games nowadays do feature a4 though, as this grabs space on the queenside. }
7... Ba7 8. Na3
{ This is another move which has always been fairly trendy. Why is the knight going to a3 ? White wants to re-route it to e3 via c2. Possibly, he will go Nc2 and then Be3, offering the bishop trade, followed by Nxe3. }
8... Ne7
{ We can continue in many ways, but here it is best to refrain from this plan of castling followed by ... Kh8 and ...f7-f5, as the pride and joy of our position - the a7 bishop - is about to be traded. We are re-routing our knight to the kingside, to g6, which is a very typical theme in the Italian. }
9. Nc2 Ng6 10. Be3 Bxe3
{ Most games saw castling, which is also possible, but I find the idea of allowing White to take on a7 and force our rook to that pretty clumsy square rather odd. }
11. Nxe3 O-O 12. a5
{ Here comes an interesting moment. Black undoubtedly has many decent continuations. You might think it would be a good idea to copy Anand's play, who got here and went ... Ng4, or Xiong's game, who chose ...b7-b5. While these are fairly interesting moves, I think the cleanest is }
12... c6
{ Black prepares ...d6-d5. This was already seen in several games, mostly of 2400-2600-rated players. }
13. Bb3 Rb8

{ We almost always make this move, avoiding any potential trouble related with the possible d3-d4, b2-b4, where White could win a tempo on our bishop.

In this chapter, we will try to extract the best out of the typical modern chess ideas to give White as hard of a time as possible ! While typically in this book I've tried to keep things clear and simple, in some principled variations we do need to react in the principled ways - and if we do, the reward will be extremely high ! White has several options, such as 8. Nbd2, 8. Re1, 8. h3, etc. While these moves are likely to end up transposing into each other, I would like to go as far as to claim that h2-h3 is a rather serious mistake in most of these positions, which immediately gives Black the upper hand ! }

While typically in this book I've tried to keep things clear and simple, in some principled variations we do need to react in the principled ways - and if we do, the reward will be extremely high ! White has several options, such as 8. Nbd2, 8. Re1, 8. h3, etc. While these moves are likely to end up transposing into each other, I would like to go as far as to claim that h2-h3 is a rather serious mistake in most of these positions, which immediately gives Black the upper hand ! }
8. Nbd2
{ This is arguably the most natural move in the position, as well as the most frequent one. }
8... h6
{ The little quiet move. Taking the g5-square under control, or why do we play this ? Let's see. Now most White players have continued 9. Re1, but 9. h3 and 9. Nc4 also make sense. }
9. Re1
{ This has been White's main move. It is a very natural continuation, and importantly, it does not weaken White's king, which proves crucial especially against our hyper-aggressive ...g7-g5-g4 plan. }
9... g5 { Nevertheless ! } 10. Nf1
{ This has been the absolute main move, and that's what Adamn, Gledura, Andriasian and Amin did with Black. Yet, the list of the Black players is by no means less impressive - McShane, Alekseenko, Fedoseev, Naiditsch, Vitiugov, Bachmann and many others trusted this aggressive setup a bunch which should say a word or two about it's objective value. }

{ We are preparing ...Qf6 and ...Nf4 followed either by the immediate pawn storm with ...h5-h4, or by the calm ...Bd7 and long castling, where Black would take his time and attack only a few moves later. }
12. Nc4
{ Only this move has been tried, which makes sense: White needs to either bring this knight to e3, or make the room for the bishop on c1, which can also go to e3. }
12... Qf6
{ Black attacks the f2-pawn and forces some action. Be3 has been played in both games - by the way, these are the rather old games, played in 1988 and 2000 - but Ne3 also makes sense. }
13. Be3 Nf4 14. Bxa7 Nxa7
{ As I keep emphasizing throughout the entire chapter, it is extremely important to take with the knight, because Black keeps the opportunity to castle long open. }
15. Nce3 Nc6
{ Now we reach a rather critical position where White needs to understand what his plan should be. This is some very new stuff with no games, and it's always not easy to predict what the theoretical developments would look like. But, it makes sense to look at a few continuations. As I understand it, it's crucial for White to try and get the counterplay in the center, because if Black had played ...Bd7 and ...O-O-O, White's business would be about to close down. }
16. Nd5 Nxd5 17. exd5 Ne7 18. d4 exd4
{ At this point, White should demonstrate a rather inhuman desire and willingness to ignore that d4-pawn. }

{ Eventually White will transpose anyway in that immediate cxd4 line, but at least, he kept his options open for a little longer. }
21... Kd8
{ It is always exciting and challenging to end the analysis with such a move. The thing is that we need to escape that nasty pin over the e-file, but there's no desire and need to castle long as something like Qc2 will quickly slaughter that Black king. Now Black enjoys multiple fun attacking ideas, such as ...h5-h4, ...Nf5, ...Qg5 and ...f7-f5-f4-f3 ! If we queens get traded at some point, our king will easily enter the game via d7 or e7, and we'll have a very nice position because the White structure isn't that impressive by any means. Conclusion: this plan with ...h7-h6 and ...g7-g5 is a great opportunity to create murky unclear positions with mutual chances, while also playing in an objectively sound way. In my opinion, one big goal in the opening should also be to get your opponent out of his comfort zone and this line does exactly that for two reasons: for one, no one likes to be under attack, but also, these positions are highly atypical of the standard boring maneuvring stuff we normally see in the Quiet Italian ! So, White's life is made difficult with this plan - guaranteed. And, it is approved by both the best engines as well as by the correspondence players, who usually play chess of an extremely high quality. }

I will give a few possible variations on how the game can develop, but also strongly suggest that you study this typical Nimzo-Indian structure that arises in the so-called Huebner Wall variation.

After that, we'll study some variations which seem to be more active for White. However, I've realized that it's near impossible for White to be able to play g3-f4 !

9. Nd2 O-O 10. g3 Nc5

9. Be3
{ This might look like a normal developing move, but in closed positions, it's important to choose the correct squares for your pieces. The bishop isn't doing much on e3, just like it wouldn't on d2, b2 or a3. And importantly, White is not pursuing any plan, which makes matters even worse. }
9... O-O 10. c4
{ This will demonstrate Black's plan, provided White is passive. } 10... b6
{ This is a very important move. It prepares Nc5 and prevents variations with Bxc5 where we need to take with the d-pawn. Taking with the b-pawn only strengthens our center and opens up the b-file. }
11. Qe2 Nc5 12. Rab1 Nxd3
{ Our plan includes this and f5. In some other lines, I was afraid that f5 would be met with d3-d4 !, which is impossible here. That is why it's such a timely decision. }
13. cxd3 f5
{ It's obvious that Black seized the initiative. The f-file is opening up and Black's pieces are ideally placed. The knight can go to g6, the bishop to g4. Then we'll develop our queen and the other rook, for instance with Rf7-Raf8. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4
{ I have decided to cover the Scotch Four Knights because this is something club players face a lot. The simplicity of the arising positions and straightforwardness of White's plan largely contributed to the popularity of this variation. So did some good books such as Keep It Simple, published by fellow Chessable author Sielecki. I have decided to come up with a slightly offbeat approach. This approach should enable you to get a rather complex and fighting position where White is unable to play the first 15 moves on autopilot but would rather need to solve some new tasks. I can't promise an advantage for Black, but we will try to present our opponent with some new challenges. }
4... Bb4 { This suits our task best. } 5. Nxe5
{ The most challenging move and the reason why many players are afraid to play 4... Bb4 }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Qe7
{ This is a very interesting variation which allows us to get a rather non-standard position, although White keeps a solid position in many lines. A few continuations are possible, but they all lead to more or less the same kind of position. When I started analyzing it I was sure that it was a combative line where White could get an edge with some precise moves. However, I could not find this edge even after many hours of analysis and with the help of an engine ! That's why I feel good about recommending it. }
7. Nxc6 Qxe4+
{ I believe that White is more likely to trade queens here. Be2 is also a good move, just more counterintuitive. }
8. Be2 Qxc6 9. O-O Qxc3
{ It's possible to take this pawn, but I myself would be somewhat scared of White's initiative. I think that it's a good decision against opponents who play the Scotch Four Knights with you to trade some pieces and then make a draw, as they will need to prove their compensation here. }
10. Rb1 O-O
{ Feel free to investigate this yourself. We concentrate on another line though. }

8. Be2 Qxc6 9. O-O O-O
{ Black's cherished dream is to play d7-d5, trade the light-squared bishops and the queens. Then his knight and better structure would ensure an advantage. However, things are not so simple yet, as White has two bishops and the center. His main move is 10. c4, which prevents our d5-idea. }
10. c4 d5 { Nevertheless ! } 11. Qd3 dxc4 12. Qxc4 Qxc4 13. Bxc4 Bf5
{ 13...Be6   or  13...Rd8  are good moves as well. } 14. c3 c6
{ This is a great position for Black where we have no simplifications. The structure is unbalanced enough for us to have winning chances. We can play Rfe8, Rad8, and try to trade pieces. Nd5 can also be a good move in order to attack the weak c3-pawn. If White ever trades with Bxd5 we will just have a slight edge in a position with opposite-colored bishops and rooks due to a superior pawn structure. Another idea is to prevent the c3-c4 plan through b5 !? at some point, which ensures the d5-square for the knight. All in all, this seems like a lot of fun for Black ! }

12. Qd2
{ And now there is a rather strange idea.   12.Qd2  b5 !?  I think that   12.Qd2  Qc3  is another good choice. It forces an endgame similar to the previous note, where White answered d5 with Qd3. }
12... Qc3 { 12...b5 } 13. Rb1 c6 14. Rb3 Qxd2 15. Bxd2 b5
{ I believe our long-term idea is to establish firm control over the light squares. How can this be done? By means of Nb6-Be6-Bc4 or Nc4-Bd5. White can try to play a4 !? right now, after which bxa4 should lead to a good position.  For example,   15...b5  16.a4 !?  bxa4  White can also stick to the conservative   16...a6 !?  Now if we get to play moves like Be6 and Nb6 we would be doing great. This is why White should perhaps take drastic actions with  17.c4 !?  which feels to be critical. But we take with  17...bxc4  18.Bc4  and  a5 !  now makes sure that both sides have weaknesses. d4 and a4 for White, c6 and a5 for Black. Our knight also gets an outpost on b4. I felt that this extensive explanation was crucial, as this is one of the critical positions in this chapter. They won't reach this position as White, but it still needed to be covered.  17.Ra3  Re8  18.Bd3  Nb6  19.c4  Ba6 !  putting pressure on White's center.  20.Rc1  Rad8 !  Another pressuring move. White is now unable to ever make progress as he is too busy defending his pawns. }

{ I have chosen this forcing move and not the position and symmetrical 4... Bb4 for several reasons.  1  After 4... Bb4 there is more theory.  2  4...

Bb5 clearly indicates that White wants a positional struggle with all the pieces on the board, so we are trying to go for something a bit more tactical. It is possible for White to avoid tactical lines here, but then it is much easier for us to equalize on the spot. If White dares to enter complications we get excellent attacking chances and are happy to sacrifice material for a tremendous initiative in a lot of lines. }
5. Bc4
{ Back in the day, this move was considered a dangerous one, but the following strong answer proved good enough to solve Black's problems. I consider 5. Bc4 as our mainline, because both sides are entering very dangerous waters and need to know a lot in this highly complex position. }

I could stop the analysis here, but I think that you might like an illustrative line to see Black's development. }

4... Nd4
{ I have chosen this forcing move and not the position and symmetrical 4... Bb4 for several reasons.  1  After 4... Bb4 there is more theory.  2  4... Nd4 is more likely to surprise your opponents where they are less aware of the variations.  3  I like to prevent opponents from getting the kind of position they want !   4. Bb5 clearly indicates that White wants a positional struggle with all the pieces on the board, so we are trying to go for something a bit more tactical. It is possible for White to avoid tactical lines here, but then it is much easier for us to equalize on the spot. If White dares to enter complications we get excellent attacking chances and are happy to sacrifice material for a tremendous initiative in a lot of lines. }
5. Bc4
{ Back in the day, this move was considered a dangerous one, but the following strong answer proved good enough to solve Black's problems. I consider 5. Bc4 as our mainline, because both sides are entering very dangerous waters and need to know a lot in this highly complex position. }

{ Hi everyone! My name is Yuriy Krykun, I am a 20-year-old Fide Master from Ukraine and it's my first course for Chessable. I have been one of the best-reviewed coaches on lichess during the last years as well a 1...e5 player myself. I have realized the need for an easy-to-understand, yet sound repertoire, as I was teaching my students 1...e5, but never wanted to overload them with massive theory, which exists in the main lines. In this course, I have attempted to share my knowledge and experience in such important positional lines as Exchange Ruy Lopez and the 5.d3 variation - one of the most trendy ones nowadays. The idea was to create a course, suitable both for 1500s and for master level players - a very tough task to accomplish. That is why I am suggesting two different lines in the Main Ruy Lopez for Black - chapter 3 is the easier one, that will provide amateurs with ample practical and attacking chances, but objectively it might be not the best theoretical variation - I am discussing the pros and cons, the defensive ideas in the toughest theoretical tests etc. However, Chapter 4 can be used by players of my level and even above - I do believe in the quality of this analysis, and the line is incredibly new to the high level, as it made appearance on the top scene less than a year ago, actually.   An attempt was to focus on understanding, not memorization - in the first 2 chapters, I believe, it was easily achieved, while it was more complicated with the main Ruy Lopez - but I hope, I have managed to generalize the key concepts there as well, so that you can confidently treat the arising position, even if you forget concrete variations.  I would like to mention a few good products that helped me learn e4 e5 myself, even though I cannot really say I used references all that much : Ntirlis produced a great 1.e4 e5 book with fantastic explanations and analysis, while Jan Gustafsson had created a great DVD on e4 e5, which I had also benefited from. At the same time, all the analysis  (besides some basic traps, knows for centuries)  are original, so hopefully you'll be the first ones to gain points with these lines and enjoy them.   I hope this work will provide you with a long-term repertoire, a lot of joy, will increase your chess understanding overall and award your effort with practical results! }

However, we would also take a look at the rare, old move 5.d4 and discuss the standard ideas, plans and setups for both sides. I have rather tried to make it informative and full of explanations, rather than super theoretical, but I believe the provided informational should perfectly suffice.

{ This move signifies the Exchange Ruy Lopez. Its idea is to double the Black pawns, then play d4 at some point, which will trade the e5-pawn and create a position when both sides have two pawn islands. Since Black's extra doubled pawn on the queenside isn't as important, White sort of has an 'extra' pawn on e4. This is noticeable for the whole game, unlike the doubled pawns on c6 and c7. White would like to trade pieces and win the endgame thanks to his extra kingside pawn. However, Black has his own trumps, such as a pair of bishops. }

{ Please, take a look at this line first to understand the ideas behind Qf6 in the main line. This is the way people used to play back in the day.

White wants to castle queenside, so that 1  when he advances the pawn on the kingside, his king is safe, as it is not being opened up. 2  it's faster to get to the center from c1 rather than g1. However, later such ideas were neutralized and people switched to 5. O-O }

On e5 the knight also discourages the f3-f4 ideas, as Ng4! might be an unpleasant answer. Then we grab additional space with h7-h5 and have a great position. }

{ Now, White should, of course, take with the rook.  Why is it a bad idea to capture with the pawn?  Let's again discuss both sides' advantages - White has sort of an extra pawn on the kingside, while Black's doubled pawn is less valuable. Black, on the other hand, has a clearly superior minor piece - his bishop is way better than the White's knight. So, if White takes with the pawn, he loses his advantage  - a possibility to later create a passer on the kingside, Black on the other hand will still have his amazing bishop. I would simply go Bf5 then, followed by Rhe8, maybe then my king could walk to d6, I can look to double up the rook over the e-file at some point, or on the other hand I could go Rd7, Rd8, maybe f6 to play Bf5-g6-bf7 and tackle the new weakness - the d5-pawn. Black is clearly better! }

Because in the very main Ruy Lopez very often Black plays Bf8-e7 and then tries to defend his king with such manoeuvres as Rf8-e8, Be7-f8, then g7-g6 and Bf8-g7 ! Count, how many tempi did we just save ? This is why I think that 5,d3 gives Black such an easy game. The next moves don't matter that much - White can play Nbd2, O-O, Re1, Nf1, Ng3,h3 - these are all typical Ruy Lopez moves to get more presense on the kingside. We will play Bg7, O-O, then a few options are possible. Let's proceed with the line to discuss them soon. }

10... Nb8
{ It is a typical Breyer regroupment, which I really like as a person, who has played around 20 classical games in Breyer so far to never lose one, even to many GMs. This setup is so flexible ! Your next moves include Nbd7, Bb7, Re8, then often pawn to c5, pawn to d5. The point of removing the knight is that on c6 it was not doing much - it couldn't go to many squares and was also obstructing the bishop on b7. And now from d7 it can often go to c5 or b6, for example. }
11. d4 Nbd7 12. Nf1 Bb7 13. Ng3 Re8
{ Is funnily a direct transposition to the Breyer variation of the Ruy Lopez, when White is two tempi down ! That is because d2-d4 was played in two moves, he also has not managed to get h2-h3 in: Black already installed his bishop on g7 and did it without losing the time. You can consider the simplifying d6-d5 break on the next move, for instance. Or play a tense game with c7-c5, keep the tension going. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3
{ Now it's time to consider this little pawn move. Just as 6. d3, it is usually used by people, who would like to play calm positional chess and avoid analyzing forcing lines, which we study later in this course. However, everything comes at price - Black gets to develop in a very smooth way, and I am about to explain the subtleties of the setup now. }
5... d6 6. c4
{ This is an interesting line, which is actually rather popular. It has clear advantages and downsides, some of them are: 1  White grabs space and wants to play d3-d4 in the future, achieving large spacial advantage 2  White takes the d5-square under control, making it easier for him to plan such ideas as Nc3, Bg5, Nd5.3  White makes it more difficult for us to ever play ...d6-d5 or ...b7-b5. However, the disadvantages are rather obvious as well, the key one being the fact the the d4-square is much weaker now and ...Bg4 followed by ...Nd4 can be a very unpleasant strategic threat in many situations. Besides that, the a1-h8 diagonal also gets weaker which is especially important because Black's bishop will come to g7, putting pressure all over it. }
6... g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. h3 { White stops ...Bg4 ideas. } 8... O-O 9. Be3 Nd7
{ I removed my knight from f6 as it was not doing much there - it was not letting me go ...f7-f5 and was stopping the g7-bishop from controlling the d4-square. One of the useful strategic ideas Black may want to pursue is ... Nc5-e6-d4, bringing this knight over to the best spot in the position. However, as we will see, this plan should be executed extremely carefully as White has a very nice strategic trap along the way. }

[Result "*"]

{ In this chapter, we are going to study sidelines on move 5. They are by no means challenging from the theoretical perspective, but it's definitely important to know how to best deal with them. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. Bxc6
{ In my opinion, 5. O-O Be7 6. Bxc6 is quite a reasonable line, because White wins a tempo - the black bishop goes to e7, and later it has to go to d6. However, this line is not possible within our repertoire, as we play Open Spanish and meet 5. O-O with Nxe4. That is why we will study the 5. Bxc6 line only and I believe Black should be very happy to see this variation. }
5... dxc6 6. d3
{ White's idea is to calmly develop, castle, go Nd2-Nc4, remove the f3-knight and prepare the eventual f2-f4. I don't think we need to know concrete stuff here. However, I would like to introduce you to some plans. Why did White take on c6 on move 5, not move 4? How is this line different from the Exchange Spanish ? The answer is our f6-knight. Now that it's developed to f6, it is rather misplaced, and we will need to improve it. The best square for it evenutally is d4, so the route is Nd7, then it goes to f8-e6 or c5-e6 to end up on d4. However, it stands well on e6, too, as it prevents f2-f4 ideas. Our bishop belongs to d6, because it helps protect the e5-pawn. Let's see how Black develops, keeping these ideas in mind. Again, forcing lines don't exist here - it's understanding that matters. }
6... Nd7 { Immediately starting to execute our plan. } 7. O-O Bd6 8. Nbd2 O-O
9. Nc4 Re8 10. b3
{ It makes sense to develop the bishop to b2 to put more pressure on the e5-pawn. Black will defend it easily, though. }
10... Nf8 11. Bb2 f6
{ 11..Ng6 was possible, but it is inconsistent, as we want our knight on e6. Please, enjoy the following masterpiece by a living legend, a Ukrainian GM, a top-5 player in the past Beliavskiy. }
12. Nfd2 Ne6
{ Now that Black has the knight on e6, f2-f4 isn't possible. White starts playing without a plan. }
13. Kh1 b5 { Starting active play on the queenside } 14. Ne3 c5
{ Taking control over d4 } 15. a4 Rb8 16. Nf5 Bf8
{ Not letting White trade the bishop. It's not that this bishop is super-strong right now, instead Black rather hopes to use his space advantage. As we know, the rule if we have space advantage is not to trade pieces ! }
17. axb5 axb5 18. Qg4 Kh8
{ White's play on the kingside shouldn't reach anywhere, as Black has many more defenders. }
19. Qh4 Nd4 { Attacking c2 and trading the White's f5-knight. } 20. Ne3
{ Please, stop for a second and find a winning tactical idea for Black ! }
20... Nxc2 21. Nxc2 Qxd3
{ Black gets two pawns for a piece and attacks two pieces. However, you had to see more than this, as White has a defensive idea now ! }
22. Qh5
{ The only challenging move, even though it still loses. White attacks the rook and goes Qd1 next. If you hadn't seen this, stop and think ! }
22... Be6 23. Qd1 Red8 24. Nf3 Qxe4
{ Black didn't get a piece back, but he already won three pawns and will take the fourth one on b3 right now. Also, white's pieces - let's say, the c2-knight and the b2-bishop are very passive. There is no salvation for White. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. Qe2 b5
{ I really like the idea of inserting b7-b5 as soon as possible, mostly because it deprives White of flexibility in the future - for example, in the future he would not be able to play c2-c3 and go Ba4-c2 in one go. The bishop would need to go to b3 now. I think that 6... Be7 setups are good as well, but since we go for Open Spanish, there is no need for us to know such lines as 5. O-O Be7 6. Qe2, so our options are open, and we will develop the bishop to the active square - c5. This is what I did recently in a very important game for my IM norm versus a strong GM Sarunas, who used to be the best Lithuanian player for many years. }
6. Bb3 Bc5
{ Of course, White can try to go d2-d3 fast, but in my opinion, this is quite inconsistent with the move Qe2. What is the whole idea behind Qe2 ? I think it's reasonable only if White tries to keep the pawn on d2, go Rd1 and then c2-c3 followed by the quick d2-d4. In this case his rook is quite annoyingly aimed at the Black queen. On the other hand, if White never plays d4, his setup is sort of toothless. }
7. c3
{ I think this is the line we must concentrate on, as 5. Qe2 is a very rare line and I want to provide you with general understanding of it, not with the coverage of every single little move order, which you'll never see in your games. }
7... O-O
{ As I had said, changing the roles of the queen and the rook could be beneficial for White, because sometimes the Black queen might be hit over the d-file. However, this setup has cons as well. One of them is that it's easier for Black to go d7-d5 right now and play in Marshall Gambit style. The point is that in many lines when White captures on e5 with the queen, his queen is getting rather exposed. Now White had tried two moves - 8. O-O and 8. d3 }

{ I really like the idea of inserting ... b7-b5 as soon as possible, mostly because it deprives White of flexibility in the future - for example, in the future he would not be able to play c2-c3 and go Ba4-c2 in one go. The bishop would need to go to b3 now. I think that 6... Be7 setups are good as well, but since we go for Open Spanish, there is no need for us to know such lines as 5. O-O Be7 6. Qe2, so our options are open, and we will develop the bishop to the active square - c5. This is what I did recently in a very important game for my IM norm versus a strong GM Sarunas, who used to be the best Lithuanian player for many years. }
6. Bb3 Bc5
{ Of course, White can try to go d2-d3 fast, but in my opinion, this is quite inconsistent with the move Qe2. What is the whole idea behind Qe2 ? I think it's reasonable only if White tries to keep the pawn on d2, go Rd1 and then c2-c3 followed by the quick d2-d4. In this case his rook is quite annoyingly aimed at the Black queen. On the other hand, if White never plays d4, his setup is sort of toothless. }
7. c3
{ I think this is the line we must concentrate on, as 5. Qe2 is a very rare line and I want to provide you with general understanding of it, not with the coverage of every single little move order, which you'll never see in your games. }
7... O-O
{ As I had said, changing the roles of the queen and the rook could be beneficial for White, because sometimes the Black queen might be hit over the d-file. However, this setup has cons as well. One of them is that it's easier for Black to go d7-d5 right now and play in Marshall Gambit style. The point is that in many lines when White captures on e5 with the queen, his queen is getting rather exposed. Now White had tried two moves - 8. O-O and 8. d3 }
8. O-O
{ Another popular move. White keeps his options open, he can play both d3 and d4 }
8... d5
{ I like this active approach. I think many other moves, such as 8... d6, are possible, but we follow the same setup for the sake of clarity and simplicity. }
9. d3 dxe4
{ Again, I suggest taking the same approach of capturing on e4, as the one we choose in the case of 8. d3 d5 9. Bg5 dxe4. This structure is very comfortable for us, particularly due to the idea of ... Nh5-f4 which is really powerful in many situations. }
10. dxe4 Qe7 11. Nbd2
{ If White does not try to pin us, I think we should immediately activate the h5-knight. }
11... Nh5 { The knight is coming to f4, of course. } 12. g3 Bh3 13. Re1 Nf6
{ The move g2-g3 just weakened White's position. Most importantly, he does not have any good follow-up, as the pieces lack good squares. We can continue with ...Ng4, threatening the f2-pawn and asking White a question tough to answer. Another idea is to play ...Na5, ...Bb6, ...c5-c4, getting an outpost on d3. We are doing just great here ! }

No, we are stopping the idea Bd5 !, which could be rather unpleasant as the f6-knight is pinned and there would arise an irritating pin over the d5-a8 diagonal.

13... g5 14. Bg3 Nh5
{ The bishop is extremely passive on g3, which is a rather frequent occurence is this line and in this course overall. One possible plan is to continue with ...g5-g4, ...Qg5 etc. We could also continue with ...Nd8-e6, getting closer to the f4-square with another knight.

Actually, things are not so easy here as White's bishop is very powerful on b3 and White's weakness on d3 can easily be protected. However, Black also has ideas - for example, g6 followed by Kg7, some knight move and f7-f5 ! looks strong. Another powerful idea I was thinking about in the game is...Nf5-d6-b7-c5 !, the point being to attack the only weakness - the d3-pawn. Of course, we'll remove the bishop with Bb6 first. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d4

5... exd4
{ Now, White normally castles. However, 6. e5 is also a possibility we need to look at. }
6. e5 Ne4

7... Nxf2 8. Kxf2 Qh4+ 9. Ke3 Bc5 10. c3 b5 11. Bc2 Bb7
{ And now the problem for White is that he cannot develop his pieces ! For example, after 12. Nd2 ? White loses control over e4. I will give a sample line here. Our ideas are very simple - to castle, put the rook on e8 and crush the king on e3 ! Also, Ne5-Ng4 or Ne5-Nc4 are huge threats. }
12. Be4 { The best defense, trying to keep the long diagonal safe. } 12...
O-O-O { Now Rae8, f7-f5, Nxe5 are big threats. } 13. Qe1
{ Trying to trade queens, which is something we don't do, of course. } 13...
Qh5
{ The threats are so strong, that White would rather sacrifice the material back just to get to safety. }
14. Kd2 Bxd4 15. cxd4 Nxd4 16. Bxb7+ { A logical attempt to trade pieces. }

18. Nc3 Rhe8
{ Black will collect one more pawn on e5 and is just winning - three pawns for a piece plus a huge attack - the white king on d2 is clearly not something White was planning to have. }

Ne4 8. Nxd4
{ This is rather innocuous, in my opinion. The problem for White is that his bishop on a4 is likely to be traded as after the eventual Nc5 it cannot escape. }
8... Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Nc5 10. Nc3 O-O
{ There is no need to hurry with Nxa4, the bishop isn't running away ! In my opinion, after the logical d7-d6 Black simplifies the situation in the center and is doing great. Let's see a sample line. }

16. axb3 Be6
{ I am sorry as I was trying to be too thorough and almost reached a draw as a result of good play by both sides ! Now we have a position with opposite-coloured bishops, and of course, it's very drawish. Black has nothing to worry about, as after d6-d5 played whenever he wants, White will never get this pawn. Your next moves can be just logical ones in the center - go Rfe8, f6, improve your king with Kf7 etc. We have no problems in the opening ! }

15. Rf1 Bf6
{ Black keeps a serious advantage because he has the bishop pair and all of his pieces are better developed and very active. White has nothing to boast of here.  One idea for Black is to go ..Qb8 with ideas of ..Qb7 or ..Qb6. The Bishop on f6 exerts a lot of pressure on the f6-a1 diagonal, combined with the Knight on c4. }

For the sacrificed pawn, we've obtained fantastic compensation as the a2-bishop is simply dead, we have the bishop pair and ideas over the h-file, such as ...Qh6.

{ This move introduces the Open Spanish - the variation, which I consider really interesting. It is rather theoretically heavy if you want to play the main lines. We have a few tricks in our bag though, which will allow us to avoid the mainstream theory, yet get good positions.  Before we dig into the main variations starting with 6.d4, let's take a look at some other moves White may want to try, such as Re1. They are by no means pretending for the theoretical advantage, however, we definitely need to understand, what are the typical ideas we will rely on and how to proceed in all the possible variations. }
6. Re1
{ White can play this way, too. He just gave up a pawn and now he wants to get it back - there is nothing flawed in this logic ! But the problem is that he will need to part with his bishop, as you will see now. }
6... Nc5 7. Nxe5
{ Of course, Black should not blunder his queen now :  Some people might play this way, as without the inclusion of a6 Ba4 it's a very hot theoretical position of the Berlin variation of Ruy Lopez. However, now that these moves are included, it's different - the White bishop ends up traded! }

{ True - White is better. But that was achieved after some 15 perfect moves in a very rare line - I would consider this to be a calculated risk. However, if you don't agree, please study the next chapter to see an objectively very good line, which does require more work though. I would like to mention in the conclusion, that you don't need to remember all these lines - in my opinion, the attacking ideas at Black's disposal are rather straightforward, so to play over the board should be pretty easy for you. }

We can retreat on e7, and the White king is actually rather weakened now. However, I like the following option more: to capture on d2 and meet Qxd2 with Be4 !, hitting the knight. Then the pawn on e5 becomes weak, the knight on a4 definitely isn't the pride and joy of White's position. It seems we have again attained our goal - got an imbalanced position with clear play versus the opponent's king ! }

However, White does win a pawn in all the lines in this variation while spoiling Black's structure as well, so in fact that's not the best solution. Now for a very small material deficit, we have a great positional compensation - namely, a few tempi, an open a-file, and of course, White will miss his dear bishop! }

13. Qd1
{ Black is counterattacking in the center, and as we see in many other lines, if White captures on c5, after Kf7 Black gets fabulous counterplay. That is why here White attempts to maintain control over the d4-square. }
13... O-O { Black simply finishes his development } 14. Nc3 a3
{ A very typical pattern in this variation: the a4-pawn is doomed pretty much anyways, so it makes sense to give it up in a way that deforms White's pawn structure. Now White's extra a-pawn isn't of any significance. }
15. bxa3 Bf5
{ Again, we just continue the development. White can never take on c5, because d5-d4! comes as a nasty fork. }
16. Re1
{ This move might seem to be losing time, but it's very logical as White wants to finally develop his queenside bishop and the rest of the pieces. }
16... Rc8 { Of course, we keep developing, too. } 17. Qf3
{ This might be a slightly tricky moment, so I'd like to pay your attention to a few things here. Why does White make such a weird move as Qf3?   Of course, it would be natural to play something like Be3 here instead, but then Black can at least start getting his material back. I don't want to overload this course with additional sublines, so I will mention it with words and arrows.  Be3 hangs the a3-pawn after cxd4! followed by Bxa3! I believe, you don't really need to know much more than that to have a very comfortable life with this line. Just remember that White has developmental issues, related to the weakness of his pawns.  Now after 17.Qf3 quite a forcing line begins. }
17... Bxc2 18. Nxd5 Re8
{ If White does something else, Black is ready to simply retreat the bishop. Or, for instance, after dxc5 Bxc5 he has a great position too. Again, look - we are a pawn down, but we have the bishop pair. Is this extra pawn that useful? It is a doubled a-pawn! So not really. Instead, our bishops have limitless opportunities in this position. }
19. Nxe7+ Rxe7 20. Rxe7 Qxe7
{ Again, you should be considerate about the amount of lines you need to learn by heart. I cannot make every single line informational, but of course, when the forcing play ends, the rest is not something to memorize. For example, here White can play Bb2, Bd2, Be3 intending to regain the pawn after cxd4 Qd5+. This all doesn't change the evaluation - it is just equal, as this doubled a-pawn is absolutely useless. }
21. Qc3 Bf5 22. dxc5 Qxc5 23. Qxc5 Rxc5
{ White can boast of having this extra pawn, but perhaps this is all he had achieved. There is simply no position, where this pawn would matter. The opposite-coloured bishops favor us as well, as they make it impossible for White to ever aspire for any advantage here. }

To get it back takes a lot for time, meanwhile Black, who enjoys the two great bishops, the newly opened h1-a8 diagonal and the b and e-files, gets counterplay. 2  We do have the weird pawn on a4, but we can use it for both a4-a3 break, which spoils the White queenside, we also have the open b-file. I believe that these factors are the bottomline of Black's hopes and do actually provide Black with tremendous counterplay. I hope you would pay attention to these ideas in all the following variations. }
12. Nxd5
{ This doesn't seem critical at first, however the resulting positions do require accuracy, as White might opt for some middlegame/endgame with a slighly more useful bishop. But there is an important manoeuvre that seems to provide sufficient counterplay. }
12... Bd6
{ Now we get a rather forcing line. The rook might retreat to Re3, e2, e1, it is very likely to transpose on 15th move anyway. Also, again we are in a situation where understanding on a few key patterns matters more, than the concrete knowledge. }
13. Re3 Bxh2+ { Black simply regains his pawn and wins back the d5-knight. }
14. Kxh2 Qxd5
{ Now let's look at the position again, as some significant changes took place. What happened? We have traded a lot of pieces, now we have only queens, rooks and opposite-colored bishops on the board. In such a situation, Black's queenside pawns might seem rather weak. However, there is an idea that provides us with more than sufficient counterplay, which I will demonstrate in the next chapters. Now, please, look at the potential problem for us in this line. Let's say Black makes a few imprecise moves. }
15. Re5 Qd6 { I don't really like Qd6 as it runs into the x-ray after Bf4 } 16.
Bf4 f6 17. Rf5
{ This is a position which is definitely holdable for Black  (you can just put the pawn on c6 and White wouldn't ever win it)  , but it's not a position to opt for, as we are trying to hold on only.  Instead, look at the next line to see the right way for Black to handle this typical position. }

{ The solution to all of our problems! The only issue was that White could annoy our c7-pawn. Now we make full use of our a4-pawn, which fixes the whole queenside and the b2-pawn as a weak one, and also we trade the active rook on the opponent! That's enough for you to have a good position, the next moves are rather illustrative, so you shouldn't remember everything, but I think it's a nice line to look at. }

18. c4 Rxe5 19. Bxe5 Rd8

20. Qh5 f6 21. Bg3 axb3 22. axb3 Qxd4
{ With a roughly equal position. For instance, White can take on c7, Black will take White's rook, so will White, and we have an endgame with queens opposite-colored bishops. The material is equal. But there's a more important factor - the safety of kings. And this is the component where Black isn't lacking either! So our position is definitely good here. }

14. Rxd6 cxd6

{ I think, Black has a good position. We have a few ideas here, actually. If you feel materialistic, you might simply go Bd7 to defend that pawn on a4. However, I am inclined to treat this variation as dynamically as possible, when it works, that is why I suggest to simply go }
16... Re8
{ And here I am cutting the line. However, I think there are a few moves we can already predict Black will make. It's reasonable to expect that White will take the a4-pawn, then I think we should consider the following attacking ideas: Qf6-g6, then Bh3!?; Bf5, Re8-e6-g6!?; even a6-a5, then Ra6 followed by Rg6/h6/f6 swing whenever we want. I definitely believe Black is very comfortable here, even though obviously ample practical test is required, as all these lines are very new and untried. }

12. Rxd5 Bd6 13. Bg5
{ The critical attempt. We had just looked at ♗f4, now let's consider this move.   Here I will be suggesting two possibilities, which I think is very important, because this is sort of a main position of the whole variation, so it is nice to be able to vary. However, I would like to mention the disadvantages of both moves. So I will scare you a bit by explaining the potential minuses of the move f7-f6.  Please, pay attention to the following idea, it's very important!! What are the disadvantages of the move f6? It can prove bad, because....White simply retreats ♗f4, and we get the previous line with an 'extra' f7-f6 move. But it proves an actual 'extra' move because in many lines we are deprived of such an important idea, as ♕d8 to g5! However, of course, such verbal explanations require lines that prove the mentioned disadvantages.   Here I would like to describe the moves Qe8 and f7-f6 from the practical perspective. I believe that both are good and both give equality, but there is way less to learn after Qe8. Both also give positions complex enough to play for a win. But in case if White is familiar with the line, or manages to find good moves over the board, I think that the f6 lines enable us to play for a win anyway, while in the Qe8 ones White can actually have possibilities to arrive to some drawish scenarios. This is how I feel about it, this is why I give you both moves and analyze both in detail, but feel free to choose yourself!   I am marking Qe8 lines as an alternative not because it's worse, but because there is less to learn and these are less chapters. }
13... Qe8
{ In this chapter, we go for this move! I am suggesting Qd3 as White's main attempt, as otherwise he cannot develop his pieces. }
14. Qd3 Rb8
{ You should be already recognizing this idea if you had studied some of the previous lines, especially ones where White takes Nxd5 early, and we get that position with an open b-file, where we go Rb8-Rb5!   Now we again are using the b-file }
15. b3 { White wouldn't go Rb1, right? It would be too miserable. } 15... axb3
16. axb3 Bb7 17. Rf5
{ Going to a5 is possible too, but I don't want to overload you with variations that aren't needed at all. To cut it short, the rook is useless on a5 - what is it doing? Attacking the a6-pawn, which is protected by the bishop? }
17... f6
{ One more important idea for us to learn! The queen is coming to Qg6, which is very handy. Remember, I told you not to play f6 earlier on, but in this position things are already different, as we didn't lose any time, and now our queen's got this nice route. However, I offer an alternative idea as well! }
18. Bh4
{ Again, let's not focus on too many concrete lines, but just in case if you were wondering, 18.Bf4 transposes after Qg6 Bg3. }
18... Qg6 19. Bg3
{ We arrive at a very exciting position now. I hope, you are thrilled to try it out! Here you have many possibilities - Bc8!? might be an interesting move, then after Rf3 you can trade queens and go Bf5!  But I like another move a lot as well. }
19... Rbe8
{ The point is very simple - we improve the worst piece! The rook went to b8 to use the open file, now the file is closed, so we reposition it! }
20. Nd5 Bxg3 21. hxg3 Bxd5 22. Rxd5 Qxd3 23. cxd3 Re6
{ The endgame is a simple draw, because White's doubled d-pawns aren't that useful. The worst you can get if you misplay it is a position where you have 3 vs 3 on the kingside and White has a d-pawn or something, but this a draw too, of course. By the way, this is where I would like to reach out to you and encourage you to work on the rook endgames, too! I hope you will not be disappointed to read such a note in the opening course, but I strongly believe that it's important to concentrate on all the aspects of chess. }

But in case if White is familiar with the line, or manages to find good moves over the board, I think that the f6 lines enable us to play for a win anyway, while in the Qe8 ones White can actually have possibilities to arrive to some drawish scenarios. This is how I feel about it, this is why I give you both moves and analyze both in detail, but feel free to choose yourself!   I am marking Qe8 lines as an alternative not because it's worse, but because there is less to learn and these are less chapters. }
13... Qe8
{ In this chapter, we go for this move! I am suggesting ♕d3 as White's main attempt, as otherwise he cannot develop his pieces. }
14. Qd3 Rb8
{ You should be already recognizing this idea if you had studied some of the previous lines, especially ones where White takes ♘xd5 early, and we get that position with an open b-file, where we go ♖b8-Rb5!   Now we again are using the b-file }
15. b3 { White wouldn't go ♖b1, right? It would be too miserable. } 15... axb3
16. axb3 Bb7 17. Rf5
{ Going to a5 is possible too, but I don't want to overload you with variations that aren't needed at all. To cut it short, the rook is useless on a5 - what is it doing? Attacking the a6-pawn, which is protected by the bishop? }
17... Qe6
{ The alternative suggestion. We still get the queen to g6 without playing f6, which might be up to your liking if you are determined to not make such moves as f7-f6. }
18. Bf4 { Again, 18.Bh4 is the same thing. } 18... Qg6 19. Bg3 h5
{ A very typical idea. The point is that we threaten with h5-h4, obviously, and after White's answer he weakens his king. }
20. h4 { Now White can never move his bishop, as long as our queen is there. }
20... Rfe8
{ Just a useful move, getting a piece on the open file. Here White has a few moves, but the line I'm giving is designed to emphasize on the next typical maneuvre }
21. d5
{ Panic! The bishop is not working anymore over the long diagonal! Is it a bad piece now?! No, again it proves a great one! }
21... Bc8 22. Rf3 Qxd3 23. Rxd3 Bf5
{ Again, Black has a great position. Despite the roughly equal chances, promised by the engine, I'd obviously prefer Black thanks to his absolutely gorgeous bishops. White already needs to be extremely precise so as not to drop material to Bb4 and other pins. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 Be7
{ An idea, which was known years ago, but actually got seriously discovered and used at the highest level when Mamedyarov played this line to beat Aronian at the 2018 Olympiad, which already means something. Now, it seems, White has quite a few moves, but actually only one is dangerous. }
7. Re1 b5 8. Rxe4 d5 9. Nxe5 Nxe5 10. Rxe5 bxa4
{ We get this position almost by force, now though there's the key crossroads - a huge list of possibilities for White, the main one undoubtedly being Nc3. }
11. Nc3 { The most popular move by far and the best one, in my opinion. } 11...
O-O
{ Now I would like to introduce to the readers/viewers a few ideas, which make the line attractive to me. 1  When White takes the pawn, his rook usually proves very-very misplaced on d5 - 'an elephant in a china shop', so to speak. To get it back takes a lot for time, meanwhile Black, who enjoys the two great bishops, the newly opened h1-a8 diagonal and the b and e-files, gets counterplay. 2  We do have the weird pawn on a4, but we can use it for both a4-a3 break, which spoils the White queenside, we also have the open b-file. I believe that these factors are the bottomline of Black's hopes and do actually provide Black with tremendous counterplay. I hope you would pay attention to these ideas in all the following variations. }
12. Rxd5 Bd6 13. Bg5 { The critical attempt. } 13... f6
{ In this and next chapters, we will be analyzing the 13...f6 move. } 14. Bf4
{ Another attempt by White. But this is not a move any opponent will make, as it leads to tremendous complications and may imply the exchange sacrifice, as we will see in this example. However, White can shy away from sacrificing, too. }
14... Be6 15. Bxd6
{ Once again, we study what happens, if White is so unwilling to sacrifice the exchange. }
15... cxd6 16. Rh5
{ As a careful reader might have noticed by now, White's main problem consists of the clumsy rook. }
16... a3
{ Again this standard pattern, we spoil his pawns and make the c3-knight unstable and vulnerable. }
17. bxa3 Rc8 18. Qd3 h6
{ I am giving the next moves to better illustrate the ideas Black has. } 19.
Re1 Re8
{ How would White get the h5-rook back in the game? Don't count the pawns, look at that rook! The move ♖e8 serves a purpose of 1  placing a rook on the open file 2  creating potential threats of some discoveries. The position is still balanced, but let's see how easily things can go wrong for White. }
20. Qd2
{ Now let's take a look at the variation, which is rather informational again, but where White makes perfect moves, too. }
20... Qc7 { The c-file is hanging, so Re3 is the only move } 21. Re3 Bg4 22.
Rxe8+ Rxe8 23. Rh4
{ We could actually retreat with the bishop and keep a fighting complex position, but the next line is the most straightforward one in terms of proving the theoretical soundness of this whole Be7 concept. }
23... Rc8 24. Rxg4 Qxc3 25. Qxc3 Rxc3 26. d5 Rxc2 27. g3 Rc5 28. Rd4 Kf7
{ Again, this extra doubled a-pawn is entirely useless, that's a simple draw. The White rook is also completely tied up defending the d5-pawn, while our rook is attacked. }

{ I think, it's fair to recommend to students only what you consider viable yourself, so when I had a chance to play this line, I didn't hesitate. I got to use it in two games - one vs a fellow Ukrainian rated 2230 FIDE, but that's a good player - he beat a GM 2640 Aryan Tari of Norway in the first round of this event, for instance ! My other game   a draw in 9 moves  ! - was vs a German IM 2459. What's very interesting, in my opinion, is that I didn't expect  1.e4  at all in both games while preparing  ! Opponents clearly had something in mind in my main variations, so I tried to play this one - it allowed me to get them out of book very quickly  ! My game from the 9th round went this way -  7.Re1  b5  8.Rxe4  d5  9.Nxe5  , here I took  Nxe5  and offered a draw. Here is the link to the live transmission - @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2019-rtu-open/09-Hirneise_Tobias-Krykun_Yuriy@@LinkEnd@@ I had a tough tournament and wanted to finish well, but also it's a good idea to check opponent's mood - he may want to play for a win, but knows you're still in your preparation. He had spent 15 minutes to get to that position  (!)  (and 15 after my offer, just to realize it's very complex, so he agreed. In the game you're about to see I was playing for a win, but unfortunately it was too solid all the way through. Still, a great experience - also, I feel very honest in front of my readers !) }
7. Qe2 b5
{ 8. d5 !? is interesting, but doesn't give White much on account of the simple Nc5, then dxc6 Nxa4 cxd7 Bxd7 would be rather balanced - Black has nothing to worry about. }
8. Bb3 d5 9. dxe5
{ Here, as both my opponent and I knew, 9... Be6 10. Rd1 O-O transposes to the main Open Spanish - and a line which isn't dangerous for Black at all. I was tempted to steer the game in some new direction, so, say, 10... Nc5 seems interesting, but then 11. Bxd5 ! comes as a disappointment, as 11..Bxd5 12. Nc3 regains the piece with advantage. So, I've decided to go for a weird-looking position after }
9... Na5 10. Rd1 c6 11. Nd4
{ He just created a threat of Nxc6 Nxc6 Bxd5 ! 11... c5 ? loses to both 12. Nxb5 ! and then Bxd5, and 12. Nc6 ! }
11... Qc7 12. c3
{ Now White's bishop wants to escape, so it's crucial to capture now. } 12...
Nxb3 13. axb3 O-O
{ The very critical moment. I felt that 14. f3 and 14. b4 could be dangerous and spent a great deal of time figuring out how to act after these moves. My opponent quickly chose a less dangerous move, though. }
14. Nd2
{ 14.b4  aims to take control of the weakened dark squares: c5, a5, fix the weak a6-pawn, but then  14...f6 !  gains counterplay, since  15.f3  falls into  15...fxe5 !   14.f3  on the other hand, is more dangerous, but then after  14...Nc5  15.b4  Ne6  16.Nf5  Trying to trade the bishop pair. Both Bd8 !? and  16...Re8  17.Nxe7  Qxe7  yield Black counterplay, as White is tremendously behind in development - the f6 ! ideas will prove really strong. }
14... Nxd2 15. Bxd2
{ The positional threat is b4, then something like Nb3. Again, the c5 and a5-squares are weak, so is the a6-pawn. Even though I wanted to play for a win, I realized it's time to just bail out with the following idea }
15... c5 16. Nxb5 { It seems, Black just blundered ? } 16... Qb8
{ Now Na3 Qxb3 is ugly for White, so he forces simplifications. } 17. Nd6 Bxd6
18. exd6 Qxd6
{ If White gets to play b3-b4, then eliminate the c5-pawn  (the only defender of the d4-square !)  and install the bishop on d4, Black will clearly be worse. So we'll sacrifice that pawn by d5-d4 in that case, or will try to swap queens ! }
19. b4 cxb4 20. cxb4 Qe6 21. Qd3 Qe4 22. Bc3 Qxd3 23. Rxd3
{ My bishop seems a bit worse, but it's okay - even if I give up the d5-pawn, I install my bishop on the f1-a6 diagonal and it's a dead draw, especially without rooks. }
23... Bb7 24. Re1 Rfe8 25. Rde3 Bc6 26. Rxe8+ Rxe8 27. Rxe8+ Bxe8
{ White didn't try to extract anything out of this position, and offered a draw - it should obviously be one, but I had tried to press a little. }
28. f3 f6 29. Kf2 Kf7 30. Ke3 Ke6 31. h4 h5 32. Kf4 Bb5 33. g4 g6 34. gxh5 gxh5
35. Bd4 Be2 36. Bc3 Bd1 37. Bd4
{ Now my idea is to bring the king to c4 and try to push d4. Of course, it's a dead draw versus a master, but it doesn't hurt to check how careful the opponent is, right ? }
37... f5 38. Bc3 Kd6
{ If the king gets to c4, it might become a bit unpleasant, so } 39. b5 axb5
40. b4
{ The pawns don't matter as much as activity in the endgames with the opposite-coloured bishops. Now there's no way I can break through, so a draw. Actually, I had missed the Qe2 idea while preparing the course ! It's not dangerous at all and you DON'T need to memorize a lot - but I thought it would be a nice game for you to follow, especially if you also want to be creative and get off the well-known roads. }
