{ Welcome to 1. e4 e5 Club Player's Dynamite!  The idea of this course is to give you a fully playable repertoire with 1... e5 against 1. e4, which is intended to be as fun as possible. The idea is to give you underrated lines which are often not well considered by your opponent. This should make playing these lines not only entertaining but potentially give you the upper hand very quickly.   There are many traps for your opponent to avoid and inevitably some of these will come off, but the repertoire is more than that. There are one or two speculative lines which may be risky against a well-prepared opponent, but experience tells us that you will be richly compensated by early victories or strong entertaining positions against the uninitiated.   Given that we know White has the advantage of the first move in chess, it has sometimes been a little difficult to find a line against a very solid variation by White. I will attempt to make it clear that sometimes as Black it is difficult to seize the initiative from White. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try!   The order the course is presented in broadly mirrors the most popular lines by White. It should therefore not surprise you that we present our challenge to the Ruy Lopez first. Most players of the White pieces - when confronted with 1... e5 - continue 2. Nf3 and after 2... Nc6 play 3. Bb5, the starting position of the Ruy Lopez @@StartBracket@@also known as the Spanish@@EndBracket@@.   Each part of the chapters also follows this principle of considering White's most popular tries first. The idea behind this is to allow you to focus on the most likely responses by your opponents. As many of these lines are not seriously researched by players of the White pieces, they could respond in any manner. However, the sooner they deviate from the best moves, the better your position should be. In order to give you a taste of what is possible let me show you the following game. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7
{ This is known as the Cozio Variation/Defence to the Ruy Lopez. Experience has shown that this move is not well considered by the majority of White players and this already confers a practical advantage to Black. }
4. O-O Ng6
{ We will look at and explain Black's moves in greater detail in the Cozio chapters. }
5. d4 { A natural choice. } 5... exd4 6. Nxd4 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxd4 8. Bxd4 Nxd4 9.
Qxd4 Qg5
{ Attacking the Bishop on b5 but also setting a devilish trap and one which many players of all levels have missed. }
10. Nc3 Nh4
{ This effectively wins on the spot. White is unable to prevent checkmate on g2 and save his Queen as Black is also threatening ...Nf3+ forking White's King and Queen.  You may be wondering who this game was between, and in actual fact it was a blitz game between Hikaru Nakamura and David Howell. It goes to show that virtually anything is possible!    I very much hope you find many fun and interesting ideas throughout this course. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7
{ This is my main recommendation against the Ruy Lopez. Experience shows that many players of the white pieces are unprepared for this move, even dismissive of it, and assume that with some simple moves, found over the board, they will get an easy advantage. This is not the case.     This is not just a playable variation from a practical point of view; it is entirely objectively playable and there are very few lines where White can claim a clear edge and these almost certainly need to be known beforehand.  The first idea behind 3... Nge7 is to cover the knight on c6, making it inadvisable for White to exchange bishop for the c6-knight, as Black would be delighted to recapture with ...Nxc6, once again supporting the e5-pawn.    There are many chances in this line to take the initiative from White, especially if they do not play actively. Even against active play, there are many lines which steer the game away from standard Ruy Lopez positions which should keep any underprepared opponent guessing. This is currently a highly underrated way to play. }
4. O-O
{ This is the most often played 4th move by White against the Cozio defence. It is a perfectly understandable choice, as now that Black has developed his kingside knight to e7, there is no immediate pressure on White's e4-pawn. }
4... Ng6
{ Black must consider how to further the development of his kingside. I think this is the best way to play. Previously I had considered the option of  4...g6  , intending to fianchetto the dark-squared bishop, but this proves to be a little slow. I know that many players also like to play  4...a6  but I very much prefer keeping this in reserve. }
5. c3
{ Here too we first consider the most tried continuation by White. The idea behind this move is clear. As Black has not developed his kingside knight to f6, pressuring e4 White feels he can attempt to build a big centre with c3 followed by d4. As you may have guessed, Black has something to say about this. }
5... a6
{ Only once White has played 5.c3 do we play this move. Black's intention is to try and play ...d5, challenging White's centre. This is a recurring theme in many opening positions when White has moved a pawn to c3. By countering in the centre with ...d5, if White then plays exd5, Black is able to recapture with the queen on d5 as White has occupied his own c3-square with a pawn, thereby preventing the move Nc3 hitting the queen on d5 with tempo.   A good example of this can be found in the Alapin Sicilian which can begin @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.c3  d5   Note that  5...d5  immediately would be an error as White can reply with  6.Qa4  which puts Black in a very tricky position.   For this reason, we play  5...a6  , as the most common retreat by White of  6.Ba4  takes away this square from White's queen. }
6. Ba4
{ This is by far the most common move in this position, right the way up to Grandmaster level but I actually think that  6.Bc4  is better. }
6... d5
{ Very much a key move for me and one that is consistently underrated. White must now play very accurately to prevent Black from seizing the initiative which is our clear intention. }
7. exd5 Qxd5
{ So Black has successfully managed the ...d5 break. This position has been reached many times and it is here that White must proceed accurately as there are a number of lines which are favourable to Black, who is close to taking over the initiative. }
8. d4
{ The most often played continuation by White, but it's one of the moves you should be happy to see. }
8... Bg4 9. Re1
{ This very natural move is common, but it immediately hands Black not just the initiative but the advantage! }
9... Bxf3
{ Black removes White's knight from the board, which was putting some pressure on e5, but more importantly shatters White's kingside. }
10. Qxf3 Qxf3 11. gxf3 O-O-O
{ This is a move which Black loves to play in this line. The king finds shelter and the rook is activated on d8. A lovely move to play. }
12. Bxc6 bxc6 13. dxe5
{ After a series of exchanges, White has emerged a pawn ahead but the neglect of his development will prove costly as Black's next move immediately demonstrates. }
13... Nh4 14. Kf1
{ White doesn't even bother to defend the pawn on f3 in attempt to avoid getting tangled up, but Black is in control. }
14... Nxf3 15. Re4
{ Now White's back rank is weakened and Black seizes his opportunity to exploit this. }
15... Rd1+ 16. Ke2 Rxc1 17. Kxf3 Bc5
{ Black dominates and White's queenside is crippled. } *

[Result "*"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7 4. Nc3
{ This is a line which Black needs to know and respect, particularly if White follows up with d4 and Nd5 which is a tactical shot and threatens to undermine Black's play. }
4... g6
{ Now that White has placed a knight on c3 he is no longer threatening to build up a big centre with c3 and d4. Therefore Black is able to fianchetto the kingside bishop to a strong diagonal putting where it will support e5 and intends to restrict any central grab by White. }
5. d4 exd4 { Black does not want to allow White to capture on e5. } 6. Nd5
{ This move should be noted. White threatens Nf6#, but perhaps, more importantly, seeks to undermine the dark squares and positioning of the Black knight on e7. The plan after ...Bg7 is to play Bg5 and threaten Bxc6 which would win the e7-knight. Black must know what to do! }
6... Bg7
{ Black develops the bishop as planned and also protects the f6-square, preventing checkmate. }
7. Bg5 h6
{ The only decent move. Black accepts that his king will be temporarily displaced. It leads to a very interesting position where both sides will have chances.  7...O-O?  8.Bxc6  f6  9.Nxe7+  Qxe7  10.Bd5+  Â± White is a piece up. }
8. Bf6 Bxf6 { Once again the only decent move. } 9. Nxf6+ Kf8
{ Black has lost castling rights but has the option of effectively 'castling by hand' with ...Kg7 to come. The absence of dark-squared bishops makes this safer but there are still dangers from the white queen getting onto the dark squares. }
10. O-O
{ This is the best variation for White and could even lead to a very slight advantage. Kudos to your opponent if they find, or more likely, know this move, but Black still has a perfectly good position provided you know what to do. }
10... a6
{ Forcing White's bishop to make a decision will make Black's next choice easier. It is definitely best for White to preserve this piece and so he needs to retreat. }
11. Bc4 Kg7
{ Black effectively castles by hand. The absence of dark-squared bishops makes the king on g7 far less vulnerable. }
12. Nxd4 Ne5 { Once again hoping to capture White's light-squared bishop. } 13.
Nf3
{ A clever idea. White vacates the d4-square for the queen which would threaten some serious discovered checks, so it is inadvisable to take the bishop on c4 and allow this. }
13... N7c6 14. Nxe5 Qxf6
{ Recapturing this knight puts the queen on a strong diagonal which also protects the king. }
15. Nxf7
{ Winning this pawn is what we want to see as Black. White has strayed too and Black's activity will give him a good position. }
15... Rf8
{ Black will now win two minor pieces for the rook as the knight on f7 has no safe retreat. }

12. Qxd8 Rxd8 13. fxe3 Rb8

[Black "Italian 4.d3"]
[Result "*"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4
{ The Italian Game is a solid choice for White, and if White continues in a conservative fashion it is admittedly hard to find a very active line for Black. The line we are giving promises to catch out White if they continue without sufficient thought. }
3... Nf6
{ The advantage of playing  3...Nf6  is that it attacks the pawn on e4 unlike the immediate 3... Bc5 so White cannot safely play  4.c3  without simply losing the e4 pawn. }
4. d3
{ 4.c3 ?  Nxe4  5.O-O  d5  6.Bb5  The extra pawn is secured. Black has a strong centre to boot and will castle kingside at the earliest opportunity. White has no serious compensation for the lost pawn. }
4... h6
{ This is the key move and one which very much hopes that White will somewhat thoughtlessly continue with c3. This in itself is not an outright mistake, but it certainly plays into the Club Player's Dynamite. At first glance ...h6 might appear to be a defensive move, and it certainly stops White from putting either his knight or bishop on g5 should he wish, but it actually has a more aggressive intent which is the ...g5 thrust. }
5. c3 g5
{ This is the key idea behind ...h6. Black has the potential of playing ...g4 hitting White's knight on f3 which is a key piece in assisting the advance of the White pawn to d4. }
6. a4 g4
{ Black continues the advance and forces the f3-knight to retreat to an inferior square where it no longer supports the centre. }
7. Nfd2 d5
{ This was seen in a game between Karjakin and Dubov. The advantage of Black's play is that he has not wasted a tempo on ...d6 but has found a position where he can play ...d5 in one move. Time is often of the essence in chess and this is a clear example. }
8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6
{ Developing, supporting the knight on d5 and blunting the Italian bishop on c4. }
10. b4 f5
{ There is everything to play for, but who wouldn't be happy with this position as Black? White's pieces are currently getting in each other's way and Black has much central control - albeit his position may feel a little airy. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5
{ This move is experiencing something of a renaissance of late, possibly influenced by the game between Jorden van Foreest and Magnus Carlsen in Wijk aan Zee 2020 which followed the main line. }
4... d5
{ This is the main move but you shouldn't be surprised to hear that we will not be sticking to the main line for long. }
5. exd5 b5
{ We need something different for the Club Player's Dynamite and this is it. Magnus himself has played this online. It's definitely a playable variation and one which can lead to complicated and messy positions, which is just what we are looking for!  5...Na5  This is the main line, as seen in the van Foreest vs Carlsen game.  6.Bb5+  c6  7.dxc6  bxc6  and Van Foreest eventually got a very promising position. }
6. Bf1
{ This is the key move to strive for an advantage for White, but it's a very hard move to find over the board. Your opponent could indeed know this so you must be prepared to fight back, but all too often this is not the move you will face. }
6... Nd4
{ Even computers readily overestimate White's position here. Black has many resources and a number of attractive options all of which suit The Club Player's Dynamite! }

{ Computers seem to think White has a clear edge here, but I'm not equally convinced especially when you take into account practical considerations. }

{ This might even hand the advantage to Black. He already has the initiative and must continue actively. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ng4
{ 5...d5  is played by the majority of players against this line. It is, of course, a perfectly decent move, but Ng4 can lead to much more interesting positions and has the advantage that your opponent, despite choosing this line, may not be well prepared. Moving the knight to g4 attacks e5 and Black will capture here if White is switched off and allows this. If White wishes to preserve the pawn, he will allow Black some active possibilities. }
6. O-O
{ This is a very natural move. White removes his king from the centre but more importantly is ready to play Re1. The e-pawn is poisoned. }
6... Be7
{ Black puts a piece on the potentially dangerous e-file and threatens to capture on e5. This is an important point in the opening. White's next move, choosing which way of defending e5 is best, will determine how aggressive Black can be.  6...Ngxe5 ??  7.Nxe5  Nxe5  8.Re1  The knight is pinned and when f4 follows the knight will fall. }
7. Bf4
{ This is a sound way of defending the pawn, but it plays right into our Club Player's Dynamite. }
7... g5
{ Boom. Black seizes the opportunity of pushing Gary, both expanding on the kingside and pushing White back. }
8. Bg3 h5

9. h3 { Just asking for trouble! } 9... h4 10. hxg4 hxg3 11. fxg3 Bc5
{ Threatening ...d3+ } 12. Qd3 Qe7

8. Qxd4
{ White goes a pawn up but at the expense of the bishop pair, development and king safety. It's simply not a good trade-off. If White decides to keep the bishop pair, Black will also be better after  8.Bb3  h6  9.Nf3  Nxf3  10.Qxf3  Bd7 }

{ I showed you a game in the introduction to highlight the sort of lines which we will be aiming for in this course. Whenever possible we have tried to include active lines which seek to quickly wrestle the initiative away from your opponent. They are also supposed to be fun and relatively easy to learn so we have deliberately not gone down every line and variation in too much depth.   I am going to highlight a few of the fun lines and also talk about one of our key moves. It is ...d5 and you should take a close note throughout the course of when it can be played.

{ I must confess to very much looking forward to this chapter. The move I am advising here is not without its risks but it can lead to some wild positions which reach into the heart of The Club Player's Dynamite. }
4... Qh4
{ So here we go. The archetypal Club Player's Dynamite variation. There is no doubt in my mind that you will rack up some quick wins and have some great fun along the way. Experience has taught me that this offbeat line has been almost totally dismissed by Scotch players and that is a serious risk given the complications and sharp variations that can follow. The well prepared and cautious opponent will make us work in the quieter lines but the trade-off is very much worth the risk. }
5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Be2
{ This is easily the best approach by White and frankly one which we would rather our opponents not play.

7. O-O O-O
{ Black immediately puts the king to safety as White's key counterplay is based around the e-file and potential advance of e4-e5 so removing the king from the centre at the earliest opportunity makes this far less dangerous. }
8. Re1
{ White develops the rook in line with his intention of supporting the e4-e5 advance which is now a threat as it would fork the knight and bishop. Black must act to prevent the loss of material. }
8... Ne5
{ Being a pawn up and with less space, Black is more than happy to see pieces exchanged }
9. Nxe5 Bxe5 10. f4
{ This creates a good visual impression and gives White a hold of the centre but the rook is now on e1 so it doesn't lend full support to the f-pawn which makes this and the e-pawn less mobile. Black is happy to continue exchanging pieces to consolidate his extra pawn and remove White's minor pieces which restrict his attacking options. }
10... Bxc3 11. bxc3 d6
{ Having exchanged his dark-squared bishop, Black immediately puts his pawn on d6 to regain some control over the central dark squares. He also intends ...Be6 with the desire of exchanging White's active light-squared bishop, further limiting the scope of his attacking chances. As is often the case in chess if you are ahead on material to the good exchanging off pieces is to your advantage. }
12. Ba3
{ It would be fair to say that White's two bishops and space advantage provide compensation for the pawn but Black is better and the next move is congruent with our plan of exchanging. Throughout this line, White would need to make concessions to keep the material on the board. }

13... Re8 14. Rb1 b6
{ Black has consolidated his pawn advantage and has good control of the dark squares which blunt White's bishop on a3 and is a pawn ahead. The White c-pawn is isolated and Black's strong grip on c5 means it will struggle to be anything other than a future weakness. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ The Four Knights variation is considered to be a solid choice by White but that does not mean that we can't find some interesting lines. By avoiding the most popular continuations we also hope to benefit from greater knowledge than our opponent despite it being their variation of choice. }
3... Nf6 4. Bb5
{ This along with  4.d4  coveredhere are by far and away the most played moves. }
4... Nd4
{ This is my recommendation. I am somewhat surprised it is not the 'go-to move' in this position. Black would be more than happy to exchange the knight for the bishop. If White chooses to preserve the b5 bishop he makes concessions along the way. }
5. Bc4 Bc5
{ This is what we are looking for in The Club Player's Dynamite. White can play to win a pawn but does so at some cost and that's right up our street. }

{ This is another good example of the pitfalls which can befall our opponents in The Club Player's Dynamite. Black's continuation is unexpected and strong. }
10... b5
{ White is pushed back and anyone should be delighted with all this pressure for just one pawn. }
11. Bb3 O-O
{ The king finds safety and brings the kingside rook closer to the action before once again fully concentrating on mounting a kingside attack. It seems that White is solid but in reality, his position already hangs by a thread as demonstrated by his next move which is best but weakening. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4
{ Known as the 'Four Knights Scotch' as it combines d4 following by Nc3, this can lead to solid positions so it is important that we find a line that is not as well expected or prepared for by our opponent than the ubiquitous exd4. }
4... Bb4
{ This is the recommendation. It not only satisfies our requirement but it can also lead to some sharp positions which is exactly what we are looking for in The Club Player's Dynamite. }
5. Nxe5 O-O
{ This is my main move as the Club Player's Dynamite loves an active position. It has the big advantage of being played less often so you are much more likely to have the value of surprise and knowing the continuations. The solid move here is considered to be  5...Qe7  but that's not the Club Player's Dynamite way! }
6. Nxc6 dxc6
{ The idea of Black's opening is now indisputably apparent. Quick development and pressurising White's position before he has a chance to develop, organise and get his king to safety. From a practical point of view, I love Black's position and, as ever, when the computer assessment is close to equal despite being a pawn down it tells us that it's your opponent and not you who should have cause to worry. }
7. f3
{ Supporting the centre in the hope that White will have time to develop his light-squared bishop and castle but Black has a surprise in store. }
7... Nxe4
{ You must not allow your opponent time to develop. This inventive sacrifice opens up the White king and really puts White's position to the test. }
8. fxe4 { White is obliged to take the knight. } 8... Qh4+

14. Ke1 Rfe8+ { Now the rook develops with check. } 15. Kf1 Qf6+
{ The queen is now attacked by the bishop on c1 so is obliged to move and checking is logical. }
16. Qf2 Bxc3
{ Black has two pawns, open lines and the weakness of White's king is ample compensation at the least. He can win a third pawn by continuing with the text move or maintain the pieces on the board with the attractive looking  16...Re6.  Either way White would have a much harder task. }

{ This is often referred to as The Frankenstein-Dracula variation. We are not obliged to take on e4 but who are we to refuse such a wonderfully named variation! }
4. Qh5
{ The point of White's opening. The knight has been lured away from f6 so White develops the Queen to h5 in a declared Scholar's Mate type attack on f7. It may look crude but it has been played by Mamedyarov, Nakamura, Caruana and Firouzja amongst others. It is entirely playable and must be respected because many good players have met an early demise as a result of the many tricks and traps White has at his disposal. Beyond this, it is actually entirely playable but handled correctly Black should stand fine. }
4... Nd6
{ Retreating the knight from its threatened square on e4 serves two purposes. It attacks the bishop on c4 but more importantly guards against the threat of mate on f7. }
5. Bb3 { This is in the spirit of the opening for White. } 5... Be7

4. fxe5 Nxe4 5. Nf3 Bc5

The bishop retreats to c5 to prevent White from developing his queenside bishop to the active a3 square where it would prevent Black from castling. If White plays  5.d4  , the double c-pawns will become weakened and backward after  5...Nxc3  6.bxc3  and Black would play  6...Be7  continuing to prevent Ba3. }

That being said, it is still played and its worth having a prepared response as those remaining Kings Gambiteer's should be well versed in the potential of causing Black problems. My line is not intended to refute the King's Gambit but steer the game towards The Club Player's Dynamite style whilst avoiding the main lines that your opponent should be more than ready for. }
2... d5
{ The King's Gambit simply encourages us to play d5 and here we can do it on move 2! }
3. exd5
{ This is probably the move that will be played against you. For completeness, we gave a brief mention to White queen moves in the first two variations, although I truly find these hard to really believe. }
3... c6
{ So here it is. I readily admit this is no refutation of the King's Gambit but it is the sort of line we are looking for and one which may catch your opponent unaware. It will certainly steer the game away from their hope for lines and in any practical sense, this has considerable value. }
4. Qe2
{ This is the main move which from an objective viewpoint is White's best. }
4... cxd5 5. fxe5

5... Nc6
{ Black has succeeded in reaching a position which King's Gambiteer's may not enjoy. With no apology for reiteration, this is a practical success and the position is very playable to boot. }
6. Nf3 Bg4 { The bishop develops and pins the knight on f3. } 7. Nc3 a6

3... d5 { Surely by now this choice comes as no surprise! } 4. exd5

{ Recapturing the pawn on d4 with the queen is popular amongst some players. Black should be prepared as the switched off player could find themselves mired in complications that they are unfamiliar with. Given that a number of the lines result in castling on opposite sides of the board White queenside and Black kingside it is worth treating this early queen foray with some respect. The prepared mind should not be bothered but it is still worth noting the key lines. }

{ This is the key move to consider. White normally intends to follow up with Nc3, Bd2 and O-O-O. }

{ Once again developing the kingside knight is natural and Black is happy to accept the challenge of opposite side castling should it arise. }
5. Nc3 Bb4
{ This is our main recommendation. Pinning the knight at least temporarily and potentially being prepared to exchange it for the bishop will weaken the defence of the e4 pawn. Another line I would briefly like to show you was brought to our attention by the English Grandmaster Mark Hebden.

Experience shows that many players of the white pieces are unprepared for this move, even dismissive of it, and assume that with some simple moves, found over the board, they will get an easy advantage. This is not the case.     This is not just a playable variation from a practical point of view; it is entirely objectively playable and there are very few lines where White can claim a clear edge and these almost certainly need to be known beforehand.  The first idea behind 3... Nge7 is to cover the knight on c6, making it inadvisable for White to exchange bishop for the c6-knight, as Black would be delighted to recapture with ...Nxc6, once again supporting the e5-pawn.    There are many chances in this line to take the initiative from White, especially if they do not play actively. Even against active play, there are many lines which steer the game away from standard Ruy Lopez positions which should keep any underprepared opponent guessing. This is currently a highly underrated way to play. }
4. Bxc6
{ As Black has the obvious option of recapturing on c6 with his knight, this move plays into Black's hands. }
4... Nxc6
{ The position can already be said to be objectively equal. White has gained nothing from giving up the bishop pair. A sample continuation may be as follows: }
5. O-O Be7
{ Black develops safely and prepares to castle. Note that  5...Bc5  is not possible because of  6.Nxe5!  Nxe5  7.d4 }
6. Nc3 O-O { Putting the king safely behind the kingside pawns. } 7. Nd5

{ A most natural reply, putting the king to safety and guarding the g7-pawn. }
8. Qh5
{ This move looks more threatening that it is. There are no immediate threats to concern Black but he must remain alert. }
8... d5 { This is the most active option. } 9. Nc3 d4
{ As White currently has more active pieces, it is in Black's interest not to open up the position. This advance means the centre of the board will remain closed for the time being which gives Black time to complete development. }
10. Rd1 Bb6
{ Black retreats the bishop as White had the potential to unleash a discovered attack by moving the knight from f5 and capturing the c5 bishop with his queen. }
11. Nd5 Bxf5 { Eliminating White's well placed knight. } 12. Nxb6 axb6
{ Naturally capturing towards the centre and keeping the structure intact. }
13. exf5 Nge5
{ Black has ceded the bishop pair to White, but his strong knights and central control give him a perfectly playable position, e.g. after White plays  14.f4  Nd7  is an interesting idea.   But it's also possible to play more calmly with  14.f4  Qd5  attacking the bishop and if White retreats with  15.Be2  we play  15...Nd7  so d4 remains protected.  15.fxe5  would be better but then Black can play  15...Qxb5  when e5 is threatened. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7
{ This is my main recommendation against the Ruy Lopez. Experience shows that many players of the white pieces are unprepared for this move, even dismissive of it, and assume that with some simple moves, found over the board, they will get an easy advantage. This is not the case.     This is not just a playable variation from a practical point of view; it is entirely objectively playable and there are very few lines where White can claim a clear edge and these almost certainly need to be known beforehand.  The first idea behind 3... Nge7 is to cover the knight on c6, making it inadvisable for White to exchange bishop for the c6-knight, as Black would be delighted to recapture with ...Nxc6, once again supporting the e5-pawn.    There are many chances in this line to take the initiative from White, especially if they do not play actively. Even against active play, there are many lines which steer the game away from standard Ruy Lopez positions which should keep any underprepared opponent guessing. This is currently a highly underrated way to play. }
4. O-O
{ As explained in the introduction this is the most often played 4th move by White against the Cozio defence. It is a perfectly understandable choice, as now that Black has developed his kingside knight to e7, there is no immediate pressure on White's e4-pawn. }
4... Ng6
{ Black must consider how to further the development of his kingside. I think this is the best way to play. Previously I had considered the option of  4...g6  , intending to fianchetto the dark-squared bishop, but this proves to be a little slow. I know that many players also like to play  4...a6  but I very much prefer keeping this in reserve. }

10. Nd5 Bxf5
{ Eliminating this knight should ensure that Black's king will remain very safe. }
11. exf5 Ne7
{ As Black has less space it is in his interest to exchange off pieces, especially the active white ones like the knight on d5. It also means that he need not fear White advancing f6 to compromise his king's safety. }
12. Nxe7+ Qxe7
{ Although White has the bishop pair, Black's position is very solid, has no weaknesses and the compromised white structure with the pawn on f5 could prove to be a weakness and not a strength. }

9. c5
{ White takes up the challenge with a positional pawn sacrifice. However, this shouldn't give White any advantage if handled correctly. }
9... dxc5
{ Black has no intention of giving up his dark-squared bishop just yet. Being a pawn up, at least temporarily, he is happy to exchange queens despite displacing his king. As the queens will be exchanged in this scenario it is far less likely that White will be able to mount a successful attack. }
10. Qxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxc6 bxc6
{ This may look ugly for Black but White has given up his light-squared bishop and sacrificed a pawn, temporarily at least, in order to gain this. It's not enough compensation and I struggle to believe this is one of White's best tries. }
12. Be3 c4
{ Black gains space on the queenside, attacks White's knight and would welcome the untripling of his c-pawns with an exchange of bishops on b6. }
13. Nc5 Ne5

As we saw in theIntroduction to this course, this move has been played on numerous occasions and there is little denying the logic of this move. White seeks to develop quickly and increase his control over the centre. It is perhaps not the most accurate line for White, but it is entirely respectable. }
5... exd4
{ This is the best move as Black does not want to allow White to capture on e5. }
6. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Black develops his kingside bishop, attacks the knight on d4 and prepares to castle kingside. }
7. Be3
{ White develops, supports the knight on d4 and also spies the idea of playing Nxc6 attacking Black's queen whilst opening up a discovered attack on Black's dark-squared bishop on c5. }
7... Nxd4
{ As we saw in the introduction to the course, this move will set up a devious trap by allowing Black to develop his queen to g5 which the bishop on e3 is currently guarding against. }
8. Bxd4 Bxd4
{ I can't resist suggesting this move as it sets up the trap we saw in the introduction. Sometimes in chess we can play for tricks, provided we do not compromise our position too much. }
9. Qxd4 Qg5
{ This aggressive looking move which attacks the bishop on b5 also sets up the winning ...Nh4 if white errs. You might be amazed how many players in this position have played 10. Nc3?? }
10. Nc3 Nh4
{ Black is winning as white is helpless to prevent either 11... Qg2# or 11...Nf3+ forking White's king and queen. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7
{ This is my main recommendation against the Ruy Lopez. Experience shows that many players of the white pieces are unprepared for this move, even dismissive of it, and assume that with some simple moves, found over the board, they will get an easy advantage. This is not the case.     This is not just a playable variation from a practical point of view; it is entirely objectively playable and there are very few lines where White can claim a clear edge and these almost certainly need to be known beforehand.  The first idea behind 3... Nge7 is to cover the knight on c6, making it inadvisable for White to exchange bishop for the c6-knight, as Black would be delighted to recapture with ...Nxc6, once again supporting the e5-pawn.    There are many chances in this line to take the initiative from White, especially if they do not play actively. Even against active play, there are many lines which steer the game away from standard Ruy Lopez positions which should keep any underprepared opponent guessing. This is currently a highly underrated way to play. }
4. O-O
{ As explained in the introduction this is the most often played 4th move by White against the Cozio defence. It is a perfectly understandable choice, as now that Black has developed his kingside knight to e7, there is no immediate pressure on White's e4-pawn. }
4... Ng6
{ Black must consider how to further the development of his kingside. I think this is the best way to play. Previously I had considered the option of  4...g6  , intending to fianchetto the dark-squared bishop, but this proves to be a little slow. I know that many players also like to play  4...a6  but I very much prefer keeping this in reserve. }

5. c3
{ Here too we first consider the most tried continuation by White. The idea behind this move is clear. As Black has not developed his kingside knight to f6, pressuring e4 White feels he can attempt to build a big centre with c3 followed by d4. As you may have guessed, Black has something to say about this. }
5... a6
{ Only once White has played 5.c3 do we play this move. Black's intention is to try and play ...d5, challenging White's centre. This is a recurring theme in many opening positions when White has moved a pawn to c3. By countering in the centre with ...d5, if White then plays exd5, Black is able to recapture with the queen on d5 as White has occupied his own c3-square with a pawn, thereby preventing the move Nc3 hitting the queen on d5 with tempo.   A good example of this can be found in the Alapin Sicilian which can begin @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.c3  d5   Note that  5...d5  immediately would be an error as White can reply with  6.Qa4  which puts Black in a very tricky position.   For this reason, we play  5...a6  , as the most common retreat by White of  6.Ba4  takes away this square from White's queen. }
6. Bc4
{ This move prevents Black's key break of ...d5, so he must develop naturally and await his opportunity to expand. If White continues to play decent moves then Black may have to accept rough equality and proceed from there, using his skills to gradually improve his position. }
6... Be7
{ A natural developing move, not exposing the bishop on c5 which would allow White to play d4 with tempo and a fine position. Black prepares to castle short. }
7. d4 O-O 8. Be3 d6
{ A sound move, supporting the centre and preparing to develop Black's queenside bishop. }
9. Nbd2 Bf6
{ The bishop improves its position and puts some pressure on the White centre. It also encourages White to play d5, blocking his own light-squared bishop, when Black has freed up the e7-square for the c6-knight which can then head towards the kingside. }
10. Re1 h6
{ A sound move, giving extra cover to the g5-square and always preventing the outside chance of a bank rank checkmate later in the game. As the position is not yet open, such precautionary moves are well advised. }
11. Qc2 Bd7
{ Black has completed the development of his minor pieces, has no weaknesses and a hold in the centre. White's small space advantage may give the tiniest of edges but Black stands fine out the opening and that is more than acceptable. }

{ Here too we first consider the most tried continuation by White. The idea behind this move is clear.

As you may have guessed, Black has something to say about this. }

{ Only once White has played 5.c3 do we play this move. Black's intention is to try and play ...d5, challenging White's centre. This is a recurring theme in many opening positions when White has moved a pawn to c3. By countering in the centre with ...d5, if White then plays exd5, Black is able to recapture with the queen on d5 as White has occupied his own c3-square with a pawn, thereby preventing the move Nc3 hitting the queen on d5 with tempo.

8. Bb3
{ This has been played by a number of strong players but Black should be doing fine. }
8... Qd3
{ By advancing the queen to d3, White is prevented from developing the queenside. Therefore he is well advised to drop the bishop back to c2 to kick out Black's queen. This has the advantage for Black that White's light-squared bishop no longer occupies the active diagonal pointing at f7. }
9. Ng5
{ This seeks to take advantage of the f7 weak spot, but Black need not worry about this and should set about developing and gaining an initiative if White captures. }
9... Be7
{ An excellent move. White is only attacking with two pieces, so Black is more than happy to allow the f7-pawn to be captured even if it displaces his king! }
10. Bxf7+ Kf8
{ The knight on g5 is threatened which, if captured, will undermine the support of the bishop on f7. White's best move is to capture on g6, opening up the h-file for Black. It's a dream position for a gambited pawn. }
11. Bxg6 hxg6 12. f4 Bf5
{ Black develops and blocks the f-file. His attention will be to mount a kingside assault. }
13. Rf3 Qd5

{ This is my main recommendation against the Ruy Lopez. Experience shows that many players of the white pieces are unprepared for this move, even dismissive of it, and assume that with some simple moves, found over the board, they will get an easy advantage. This is not the case.     This is not just a playable variation from a practical point of view; it is entirely objectively playable and there are very few lines where White can claim a clear edge and these almost certainly need to be known beforehand.  The first idea behind 3... Nge7 is to cover the knight on c6, making it inadvisable for White to exchange bishop for the c6-knight, as Black would be delighted to recapture with ...Nxc6, once again supporting the e5-pawn.    There are many chances in this line to take the initiative from White, especially if they do not play actively. Even against active play, there are many lines which steer the game away from standard Ruy Lopez positions which should keep any underprepared opponent guessing. This is currently a highly underrated way to play. }

A good example of this can be found in the Alapin Sicilian which can begin @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.c3  d5   Note that  5...d5  immediately would be an error as White can reply with  6.Qa4  which puts Black in a very tricky position.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7
{ This is my main recommendation against the Ruy Lopez. Experience shows that many players of the white pieces are unprepared for this move, even dismissive of it, and assume that with some simple moves, found over the board, they will get an easy advantage. This is not the case.     This is not just a playable variation from a practical point of view; it is entirely objectively playable and there are very few lines where White can claim a clear edge and these almost certainly need to be known beforehand.  The first idea behind 3... Nge7 is to cover the knight on c6, making it inadvisable for White to exchange bishop for the c6-knight, as Black would be delighted to recapture with ...Nxc6, once again supporting the e5-pawn.    There are many chances in this line to take the initiative from White, especially if they do not play actively. Even against active play, there are many lines which steer the game away from standard Ruy Lopez positions which should keep any underprepared opponent guessing. This is currently a highly underrated way to play. }
4. O-O
{ As explained in the introduction this is the most often played 4th move by White against the Cozio defence. It is a perfectly understandable choice, as now that Black has developed his kingside knight to e7, there is no immediate pressure on White's e4-pawn. }
4... Ng6
{ Black must consider how to further the development of his kingside. I think this is the best way to play. Previously I had considered the option of  4...g6  , intending to fianchetto the dark-squared bishop, but this proves to be a little slow. I know that many players also like to play  4...a6  but I very much prefer keeping this in reserve. }
5. c3
{ Here too we first consider the most tried continuation by White. The idea behind this move is clear. As Black has not developed his kingside knight to f6, pressuring e4 White feels he can attempt to build a big centre with c3 followed by d4. As you may have guessed, Black has something to say about this. }
5... a6
{ Only once White has played 5.c3 do we play this move. Black's intention is to try and play ...d5, challenging White's centre. This is a recurring theme in many opening positions when White has moved a pawn to c3. By countering in the centre with ...d5, if White then plays exd5, Black is able to recapture with the queen on d5 as White has occupied his own c3-square with a pawn, thereby preventing the move Nc3 hitting the queen on d5 with tempo.   A good example of this can be found in the Alapin Sicilian which can begin @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.c3  d5   Note that  5...d5  immediately would be an error as White can reply with  6.Qa4  which puts Black in a very tricky position.

{ This move is played quite often by White. At first glance it looks very natural and very much in keeping, not just with Ruy Lopez ideas, but also seeking to exploit the Black's knight choice of e7. Had the knight been developed to f6, it would pure pressure on White's e4-pawn, and the move c3 would normally require preparation. Black's response to c3 is vital and actually uses the position of the knight on e7 to his advantage, where it gives added support to the knight on c6. }
4... d5
{ I give this move an exclamation mark, not so much because it's a particularly good move but because it's very important and should be remembered. As previously pointed out: when White plays c3, in many openings this allows the counter thrust of d5, as recapturing on d5 with the black queen cannot run into Nc3 as a pawn already occupies this square.    This position can already be considered equal! Pretty good after just 4 moves against a line which has been played by many a white player, and highlighting the lack of respect the Cozio often gets! }
5. Nxe5 { This less frequent move is White's best. } 5... dxe4

7. O-O
{ This is a try by White to turn d4 into a gambit and avoid the exchange of queens, but Black's position is solid and accurate play will lead to an advantage. }
7... Qd5

8. Bxc6+ Nxc6 9. Nxd3 { The safe option. } 9... Bd7

{ Black is an exchange down, but the bishop pair provides plenty of compensation as the dark squared bishop cannot be opposed. It's always a big tell when the side with a material advantage is barely favoured by a computer assessment. This tells us that there is considerable compensation and very high practical chances. A sample continuation could be as follows: }
17. Rab1 Rd6
{ Kicking the bishop away from its advanced position where it also put pressure on the d5-pawn. }
18. Ba4 Rb6
{ Now switching the rook to an active half-open file and pressurising the b2-pawn. }
19. b3 Bc3
{ Black's bishop takes up an active position blocking any advance of White's queenside pawns and controlling the e1-square, a natural posting for White's kingside rook. }
20. Rbd1 d4
{ Securing the bishop on c3 and blocking the d-file. White's rooks are failing to make any impact. White retains an exchange advantage but there is little, if anything else to advertise his position. }

9... Nxd5 10. Bxd5 Qf6
{ Now that Black's kingside knight has been exchanged for White's queenside knight, the Black king will be in less danger on the queenside and as we should know, opposite side castling leads to exciting positions. Black already has his g-pawn on g5 so his attack has something of a jump start. Black's plan is to develop his light-squared bishop, most likely to d7 to support the knight on c6, castle queenside and then start undertaking his advance on the kingside. }

8... g4
{ This is the most active reply. Black is prepared to gambit a pawn for activity. The Club Player's Dynamite option! The timing of g4 is very important in these lines and sometimes you retain the option which White will always need to consider. As we saw on the previous move 8. Nbd2?! switches off to the danger. Here White cannot retreat the f3 knight due to the pawn on d4 being under pressure. }

{ The White kingside is opened and despite the absence of queens from the board the White king has some concerns currently situated on the open g-file. Black should continue with ...Be6, developing and challenging White's light-squared bishop. If the exchange on e6 takes place Black will have improved his pawn structure and central control. He will then castle queenside. Black has ample compensation for the pawn. }

4... Qh4
{ So here we go. The archetypal Club Player's Dynamite variation. There is no doubt in my mind that you will rack up some quick wins and have some great fun along the way.   Experience has taught me that this offbeat line has been almost totally dismissed by Scotch players and that is a serious risk given the complications and sharp variations that can follow. The well prepared and cautious opponent will make us work in the quieter lines but the trade-off is very much worth the risk. }
5. Nb5
{ This is the move we would love White to play and you should be delighted to hear that far from backing down we are going to up the ante.  5...Bc5  used to be the standard here but I have something even more adventurous which should lead to immediate fireworks. }
5... Nf6
{ Hey what's a rook out of play on a8 really worth? The answer is not a lot in The Club Player's Dynamite. This is a great example of a move which computers think is a blunder until they look deeper. Better still, you will be facing a human opponent who is very unlikely to have even considered 5...Nf6 and probably thinks you are a patzer. If they do that, they could be in for a quick comeuppance. }
6. Be2
{ It's not too late for White to bail out with this move but it really doesn't fit with 5. Nb5. Black is already the beneficiary of White's confusion. }
6... Bb4+

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4
{ I must confess to very much looking forward to this chapter. The move I am advising here is not without its risks but it can lead to some wild positions which reach into the heart of The Club Player's Dynamite. }
4... Qh4
{ So here we go. The archetypal Club Player's Dynamite variation. There is no doubt in my mind that you will rack up some quick wins and have some great fun along the way.   Experience has taught me that this offbeat line has been almost totally dismissed by Scotch players and that is a serious risk given the complications and sharp variations that can follow. The well prepared and cautious opponent will make us work in the quieter lines but the trade-off is very much worth the risk. }
5. Nb5
{ This is the move we would love White to play and you should be delighted to hear that far from backing down we are going to up the ante.  5...Bc5  used to be the standard here but I have something even more adventurous which should lead to immediate fireworks. }
5... Nf6
{ Hey what's a rook out of play on a8 really worth? The answer is not a lot in The Club Player's Dynamite. This is a great example of a move which computers think is a blunder until they look deeper. Better still, you will be facing a human opponent who is very unlikely to have even considered 5...Nf6 and probably thinks you are a patzer. If they do that, they could be in for a quick comeuppance. }
6. Nxc7+ Kd8 7. Nxa8 Bc5
{ The idea behind Black's opening play and rook sacrifice become immediately apparent. We are not here to mess around and have some slow positional grind, we are only interested in one thing...checkmate! Black currently has no less than 4 pieces attacking or, in the case of the two knights, one move away from posing direct threats. The 'displaced' king on d8 is actually a great help to Black in his attacking/checkmating endeavour as the rook on h8 is ready to join the party on e8. Just 2 moves after 5... Nf6 and White must play very accurately to avoid a quick defeat. You do need to know the variations as it's a tactical line but be assured it's White who will do well just to survive the onslaught. }
8. Qe2 Nxe4
{ The knight enters, attacks f2 and clears the e-file for an intended ...Re8 }
9. g3 Qf6
{ Once again it is no hardship to retreat the Queen to f6 where it once again threatens f2 and keeps an eye on the b2 pawn. }
10. Bg2 Nxf2
{ It seems slightly strange to allow White to castle but if he does he puts his king in the firing line of the c5 bishop and the tactics that follow work out fine for Black. }
11. O-O Re8
{ More craziness but it's not impossible that once again the objectively best play for both sides is to accept a draw by repetition. }
12. Qh5 Nh3+ 13. Kh1 Nf2+ 14. Rxf2 Re1+ 15. Bf1 Qxf2
{ Mate is now unavoidable and White only has spite checks to stretch out the game. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3
{ We now move into 'sideline' territory. This is played on occasions but you will not meet this variation very often. It is, of course, important to be prepared as we don't want our opponents to turn the dynamite tables on us. }
4... dxc3
{ At first glance it may seem strange to accept White's gambit but the belief is that it's unsound so why not take on the challenge? }
5. Bc4
{ White ups the gambit ante. It's entirely possible to take on b2 here but that is surely what White is looking for so it's best to avoid this. As White has not committed to taking on c3 and will most likely O-O next move we cannot attempt to transpose into our main line because  5...Nf6  6.O-O  Bd6  runs into  7.e5!  which is very dangerous for Black. We can only play the ...Bd6 idea when we have enough time to O-O before White can play  e5  so we have an interesting idea which is seldom played and has much surprise value. }
5... c2
{ This move is intended to disrupt White's development and allow the kingside bishop to develop to b4 with a check so Black will have developed one of his kingside pieces making O-O much closer to happening. }
6. Qxc2 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d6
{ This is an important move as White's key hope for play is the e5 push. } 8.
O-O Bxc3
{ As Black is a pawn up and the knight on c3 is no longer pinned he is happy to exchange the knight off. }
9. Qxc3 Nf6 { The knight develops and in so doing prevents Qxg7. } 10. e5
{ This is the most dangerous move to face and Black needs to be aware of the best reply. Against other moves, Black achieves his desire to castle. White needs to open up the position for compensation for the gambitted pawn and e5 is the only way to achieve this. }
10... Nxe5
{ This is the best way to get O-O in which will remove the king from the centre where White is seeking his play. }
11. Nxe5 dxe5 12. Qxe5+ Qe7
{ This will either bring about an exchange of queens or allow Black to O-O. }
13. Qxe7+
{ 13.Re1  is perfectly playable but gives Black an easier route to king safety.  13...Be6  14.Bxe6  fxe6  15.Qxe6  Qxe6  16.Rxe6+  Kf7.  Black's king is perfectly safe on the f7 square and it is close to the centre should it wish to play an active role in the endgame. Black stands ever so slightly better and will continue by centralising his rooks. }
13... Kxe7
{ It's best to keep the Black king in the centre even at the cost of the queen exchange. }
14. b3 { White prepares the dangerous Ba3+ } 14... Be6
{ It's very important for Black to develop. } 15. Ba3+ Kd7 16. Rad1+ Kc8
{ The king seeks shelter. } 17. Bxe6+ fxe6 18. Rfe1 Re8
{ Centralising the rook and defending e6. } 19. Rd3 a5
{ This move facilitates the development of the rook via a6. } 20. Rg3 g6 21.
Rh3 Ra6 22. Bb2 e5
{ As the knight was threatened, which defended h7 Black must return the pawn. This leads to equality. }
23. Rxe5 Rxe5 24. Bxe5 Re6
{ Although White has bishop for knight the centralised Black king means the position is equal. }

7. O-O O-O
{ Black immediately puts the king to safety as White's key counterplay is based around the e-file and potential advance of e4-e5 so removing the king from the centre at the earliest opportunity makes this far less dangerous. }
8. Qe2
{ This is another, albeit less usual, try by White. The idea is to support the e-pawn with the Queen and potentially put the rook on d1 but putting the Queen on your opponent's half-open file is not normally to be recommended. }
8... a6 9. e5 Re8 { Pinning the pawn but White has a tactical shot. } 10. Bxf7+
Kxf7 11. Qc4+
{ The queen gets out of the pin with check so White will be able to regain the sacrificed bishop and having succeeded in destroying Black's king protection. }

8... Ne5
{ This is consistent with our approach against Re1 and immediately blocks any ideas that White had of advancing his e-pawn to e5 which was a potential threat as the following line demonstrates. }
9. Rd1 Re8
{ Black supports the knight on e5 but more importantly develops the rook to its best square on the half-open e-file lining up against White's queen. It also prepares to exchange the knight for the bishop now the rook is well placed on e8. }
10. Bb3
{ White preserves his best minor piece as now Black was prepared to exchange it off for the knight. }
10... b6
{ With the Bishop doing a strong defensive job on d6 it is necessary to fianchetto the queenside bishop. It is not often the case that this is a good idea against e4 openings but in this position Black has the time to place the bishop on an active diagonal covering the centre and pressurising White's pawn on e4. }
11. Nd4
{ White seeks to move the knight to b5 or f5 to apply pressure to the strong bishop on d6 but now the pressure against e5 has been relieved Black is free to move this bishop to an even more active square. }
11... Bc5 12. Bf4 Bb7
{ Black is a clean pawn up, has no weaknesses and well-placed pieces. There is little to fear and Black has the advantage. }

{ White develops the rook in line with his intention of supporting the e4-e5 advance which is now a threat as it would fork the knight and bishop. Black must act to prevent the loss of material. }

{ Being a pawn up and with less space, Black is more than happy to see pieces exchanged }
9. Nxe5 Bxe5 10. f4
{ This creates a good visual impression and gives White a hold of the centre but the rook is now on e1 so it doesn't lend full support to the f-pawn which makes this and the e-pawn less mobile.

13... Bg4 14. Qc1 Re8 15. fxe5 Nd7
{ This shows why Black wanted to exchange on e5 before moving the knight as the e-pawn is now a target. White does not have sufficient compensation for the pawn. Black is solid and well organised and White's pieces do not coordinate in an attacking formation. }

15. Bxf8 Qxf8 16. Qxb7 Qc5+ 17. Kh1 Rf8

7. h3 c6
{ A very sound move covering the d5 square and looking towards the ...b5 thrust to attempt to embarrass the White's light-squared bishop as ...a5 and ...a4 might follow. It's somewhat reminiscent of Black's approach in the Black Lion opening but with a knight already strongly placed on d4 its arguably a much better position for Black here. }
8. a3
{ White needs to give the bishop an escape square but already turning the attention to a defensive move is testament to the efficacy of Black's approach. }
8... O-O
{ We have reached a fairly normal position with, perhaps, one key exception which is the strong Black knight on d4. Once again, if either side is to be preferred it is Black who can decide between gaining space on the queenside with ...b5 or offering the exchange of light-squared bishops with ...Be6, both of which are pleasant options. }

{ The Ponziani is a rare choice by White but it has been tried by players such as Vachier-Lagrave, Nepomniachtchi and our old friend Jobava so it's not without its proponents especially as a surprise weapon. So, like most sensible opening variations, it's worth being prepared for and we have a line which has been played by Hikaru Nakamura which fits right in with our repertoire and gives the opportunity for White to go wrong. Black seeks to gambit a pawn for activity and you may even turn the tables on your opponent by surprising him! }
3... d5
{ By playing 3. c3 White intends to build up a big centre with d4 if allowed to, so that's a key consideration in planning our response. It really should come as no surprise that I want to play 3...d5. Once again playing d5 at the earliest given opportunity is the best way to make an early challenge to White. It can be noted again that as White has played the pawn to c3 this square is no longer available to the queenside knight so Black would have no fear in recapturing on d5 with the queen as it cannot be harassed by Nc3. }
4. Qa4
{ This is almost always played. The early queen development pins the knight on c6 so which in turn threatens to take Black's e5 pawn with the f3 knight. Black often plays ...f6 here defending e5, which is a solid choice but we want more action! }
4... Nf6
{ Black seemingly ignores the threat to e5 so this can lead to a gambit but we are seeking active piece play and if White wants to grab the pawn he will have to move his knight twice and combined with the early queen foray is violating opening principles which we will attempt to punish him for. }
5. Nxe5

1. e4 e5 2. f4
{ The King's Gambit has taken a reputational beating of late, helped in no small part by Jan Gustafsson pointing out that it's around the computer's 23rd choice of what White should play on move 2 after 1. e4 e5. That being said, it is still played and its worth having a prepared response as those remaining Kings Gambiteer's should be well versed in the potential of causing Black problems. My line is not intended to refute the King's Gambit but steer the game towards The Club Player's Dynamite style whilst avoiding the main lines that your opponent should be more than ready for. }
2... d5
{ The King's Gambit simply encourages us to play d5 and here we can do it on move 2! }
3. exd5
{ This is probably the move that will be played against you. For completeness, we gave a brief mention to White queen moves in the first two variations, although I truly find these hard to really believe. }
3... c6
{ So here it is. I readily admit this is no refutation of the King's Gambit but it is the sort of line we are looking for and one which may catch your opponent unaware. It will certainly steer the game away from their hope for lines and in any practical sense, this has considerable value. }
4. Nc3
{ This is an entirely understandable move as Black is now compelled to take on f4 as the e5 pawn can now be captured by White if allowed. The alternatives are poor. Far from being a concession, if anything, Black is to be preferred. }
4... exf4 5. Nf3 Bd6
{ Black develops his kingside bishop and supports the f4 pawn. } 6. dxc6 Nxc6
7. d4 Nge7
{ Material is equal. Black will castle and intend to use his kingside majority. }
8. Bc4 O-O 9. O-O h6
{ Preventing Ng5 is worth doing. The king also has luft so you needn't worry about any back rank mate, ever. }
10. Ne4 Bc7
{ Black wishes to preserve his dark-squared bishop and maintain the support of the f4 pawn. I like Black due to his nicely placed pieces directed towards White's kingside in combination with the pawn majority here. }

{ 6.e5  At first glance this looks dangerous for Black but there is a very clever solution to the pin on the f6 knight.  6...Nc6  Black develops and attacks White's queen.  7.Bb5   after  7.Qe3  Ng4  the knight moves from f6 exposing the attack on Black's own queen but the knight has moved to a square which attacks White's queen! The danger is dealt with and any subsequent exchanges will favour Black with his big lead in development.  7...Nd7!  The knight from f6 drops back, exposing the attack on Black's own queen but now the pin on the  c6  knight is blocked so the White queen is once again under attack and here the bishop on g5 is also threatened.  8.Bxc6   after  8.Bxd8  Nxd4  9.cxd4  Rxd8  Black's lead in development and the bishop pair ensure that he has a comfortable edge.  8...Qxg5  and Black is already winning. }
6... Be7 7. exd5 Bxd5
{ Black is better developed. To maintain some sort of equality White may be forced to cede the bishop pair which will aid Black's long term chances e.g. }
8. Bxf6 Bxf6 9. Qe3+ Be7

10. Ngf3 O-O

4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 g6
{ White has not committed to playing c3 so pushing ...d5 too early in these positions is not advisable as the queen on d5 would eventually be targeted by Nc3. The most active way for Black to play is by preparing to fianchetto the kingside bishop as the knight on e7 does an excellent job of supporting the knight on c6 so wishes to remain here, for the time being at least. }
6. Nxc6

9... Qe7
{ A sound move, developing the queen, lining up against White's king but also importantly able to support the bishop when it moves to g7. }
10. Nc3 Bg7 11. Bf4 f5
{ Suddenly the g7 bishop springs to life with tempo and there is some pressure on White's e4 pawn. }
12. Qe3
{ Once again the unfamiliarity with the Cozio variation and the pressure tells! White needed to play e5 to maintain any sense of equality.   12.e5  Putting the pawn on the dark square looks ugly and it's still vulnerable as it's on a half-open file and already attacked by two Black pieces but it was still the best move. Black will seek to target this pawn with ...d6 and use the half-open b-file for his queenside rook especially if White castles on the queenside. }
12... fxe4 13. h5
{ White realises he has gone wrong and understandably seeks counterplay. Recapturing on e4 is risky.  13.Nxe4  O-O  14.O-O-O  Rb8  A beautiful square for the rook which demonstrates that having double pawns always has the benefit of opening up a line for a rook and here it also targets the White king. }
13... d5
{ Supporting e4 and dominating the centre. Black's opening and the White responses have led to a strong position for Black. }
14. O-O-O Rb8
{ Activating the queenside rook to put pressure on the White king and again utilising the idea that a doubling of one's pawns is far from all bad. }
15. a3 Bf5 16. Bh6 Bf6
{ Black definitely does not want to exchange his powerful bishop. } 17. Qxa7
{ A very risky choice. Grabbing a pawn and open up another line for a Black rook against your castled king's position is a move I would relish my opponent playing. }
17... Kf7
{ A very clever choice. The rooks are connected but Black did not want to castle as the king would be much more vulnerable on g8 given White's potential to exchange on g6 and activate his h1 rook. }
18. hxg6+ Bxg6 { Black wisely keeps the h-file closed. } 19. Be3 Qd7
{ Black is keen to focus on a queenside attack so sidesteps the possibility of White exchanging queens with Qc5. I love Black's approach as it's all about the attack. }
20. Qa6 Ra8 21. Qe2 Rhb8
{ The computer may believe that Black has lost some of his advantages but computers don't appreciate a human approach and I fully support what Black is doing. Take a look at the two rooks and pair of bishops and we should love them and the problems they will create for White in a practical setting. }
22. Bd4 Bg5+ 23. Be3 Be7
{ Black is even prepared to retreat to preserve this bishop. } 24. f3
{ White is keen to create any sort of counterplay so as not to give Black a free rein and be demolished on the queenside. }
24... exf3
{ White may get a check but the bishop on g6 now becomes a serious player. }
25. Qxf3+ Kg8 26. Bh6 Qd6
{ With the idea of reinstating the dark-squared bishop to its favoured diagonal via the f6 square. }
27. Ne2 Bf6
{ Computers love  27...Ra4  but they are computers.  27...Bf6  , attacking b2, makes perfect sense to me and Black still stands very well and White's response is pretty forced and pretty desperate. }
28. b4
{ Pushing the pawns in front of your king in such position should not be survivable but this is actually better than the alternative of  28.c3 ?  Rxb2 !!  With so many Black pieces ready to attack and almost no White defenders it should not be surprising that such a breakthrough exists. The power of the g6 bishop is now crystal clear to see.  29.Kxb2  Qxa3 }
28... Qe5 29. Nd4
{ White attempts to block out Black's barrage but Black will not be denied. }
29... c5 { Ensuring the b-file is opened. } 30. bxc5 Ra4 31. Rhe1
{ 31.Rhf1  Bringing about exchanges was realistically White's last chance to fight for survival but Black is still well on top.  31...Rxd4  32.Rxd4  Bg5+  33.Bxg5  Qxd4  34.Rf2  White has avoided the fate of the game but the weakness of his king leaves him in trouble. }
31... Be4 32. Qg4+ Kh8 33. Bf4 Qe7
{ The queen will make a decisive entry after capturing the c5 pawn. Black has too many well placed attacking forces and will triumph. }
34. Nc6 Qxc5 35. Rxe4 Qxa3+ 36. Kd2 Qc3+
{ At the worst White will capture the rook on e4 and the knight on c6 with a decisive material advantage. An excellent game showing that even with a quick exchange of a couple of minor pieces in the opening the game could not be prevented from heading into a very dynamic game which led to a convincing Black triumph. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4
{ The Italian Game is a solid choice for White, and if White continues in a conservative fashion it is admittedly hard to find a very active line for Black. The line we are giving promises to catch out White if they continue without sufficient thought. }
3... Nf6
{ The advantage of playing  3...Nf6  is that it attacks the pawn on e4 @@StartBracket@@unlike the immediate 3... Bc5@@EndBracket@@ so White cannot safely play  4.c3  without simply losing the e4 pawn. }
4. d3 h6
{ This is the key move and one which very much hopes that White will somewhat thoughtlessly continue with  5.c3.  This in itself is not an outright mistake, but it certainly plays into the Club Player's Dynamite. At first glance ...h6 might appear to be a defensive move, and it certainly stops White from putting either his knight or bishop on g5 should he wish, but it actually has a more aggressive intent which is the ...g5 thrust. }
5. c3 g5
{ This was, arguably, the game that really put 5...g5 on the map. Black always has the intention of pushing the pawn to g4, if allowed, to harass the White knight which supports the centre. By omitting play ...d6 Black would dearly love to play ...d5 in one move and that is exactly what happens in this game. Sergey Karjakin, a former World Championship challenger to Magnus Carlsen simply didn't know how to handle it. If a player of such calibre can struggle so quickly against this line, then just imagine what could happen in your games. }
6. a4
{ Karjakin was clearly caught a bit like a rabbit in headlights. I believe he played this normal Italian like move to give his light-squared bishop a retreat square so as to avoid ...g4 when the knight on f3 would be kicked away from pressuring e5 then ...Na5 which would then be successful in exchanging the White light-squared bishop. I am not convinced that Black would even have done this, preferring I believe to focus on our key d5 break, similar to the game continuation. }
6... g4
{ Forcing the knight back and also removing it from its post where it puts pressure on e5. }
7. Nfd2 d5
{ The move order has enabled black to play ...d5 without first wasting a tempo on ...d6. This is a significant benefit and Black already gains greater central control than White. }
8. exd5 Nxd5 9. a5
{ White may have been intending Qb3 but this would be strongly met by ...Na5 so White advances the a-pawn also seeking expansion where he has a dominance of his pieces.   9.Qb3 ?  Na5  The queen is attacked and White is unable to preserve his best minor piece, the bishop on c4 from being exchanged. }
9... Bg7 10. a6
{ White continues the a-pawn advance seeking to create and then exploit the light square weakness on the Black queenside.  10.Qb3  This was possible but Black has a calm and sound reply.  10...Nce7  He will go onto castle kingside, retain better central control and piece placement. White's forces look particularly clogged on the queenside. }
10... b6 11. h3
{ 11.Qa4  This was the consistent follow-up and the strongest move as Black's best reply is to retreat the d5 knight so it would have been a minor success for White especially when compared to the game continuation.  11...Nde7  12.O-O  Bd7  Black is better developed than White who has spent a number of opening moves getting his pawn to a6. This has achieved its desired result but Black has everything covered and his piece deployment is far superior. }
11... Nf4
{ The knight jumps in. Now, g2 and d3 are attacked. It's a testament to this opening line that a World Championship challenger is struggling to find a playable 12th move. }
12. Ne4 gxh3
{ Amazing play by Dubov as it turns out that White can just about survive the obvious 12...Nxg2+ when Black is unlucky not to be winning on the spot.   12...Nxg2+  13.Kf1  gxh3  14.Qf3 !  Now the weakening of Black's light squares will prove a valuable source of counterplay for White. }
13. g3 Ne6
{ The safe option. I really feel Dubov was so comfortable he didn't want to complicate matters by delivering a check on g2 but at the cost of trapping this knight. I can't countenance him not considering the move but it is objectively best and it removes the one chance White had in the game and, therefore, should have been played.   13...Ng2+  14.Kf1  Na5  15.Bb5+  c6  16.Ba4  f5  Black is firmly on the front foot and the only two developed White pieces are being forced back. }
14. Qf3 Bd7
{ This absolutely sound looking move presents White with a difficult to spot the opportunity for redemption.  14...Na5  would have been best. }
15. Rxh3
{ 15.b4  This is a remarkable move and one which is incredibly difficult to find as it doesn't even develop a piece. The idea is to play b5 and most importantly Black does not have time to play ...Qe7 because of this. Black should still be very much in the game but he would need to play a move such as 15...Ne7 which is why he should have stayed on the front foot with 13...Ng2+.  15...Qe7 ?  16.b5 !  When the knight moves White will be able to move the e4 knight with a powerful discovered attack against the rook on a8. }
15... Qe7
{ A key move which protects the f7 pawn so the knight on e6 is free to move if desired. This now effectively prevents b4 which runs into a tactical sequence. }
16. Rh5
{ 16.b4 ?  Ned4 !!  Attacking the queen and the rook on h3 with the bishop on c8. This was not possible before 15...Qe7 as Qxf7 would have been mate.  17.cxd4  Bxh3  18.Nd6+  Qxd6  19.Qxf7+  Kd8  20.Qxg7  Re8  Black is an exchange ahead but more importantly has too many threats against the White king, notably exd4+ and Qxb4+. }
16... O-O-O { All the Black pieces are now in play! } 17. Be3 Rhf8
{ Intending to play ...f5 } 18. Rf5
{ 18.Nbd2 ?  f5 !  19.Rxf5  Rxf5  20.Qxf5  Ned4  The queen of f5 is attacked by both the d4 knight and d7 bishop so ...Nc2+ and Nxa1 will follow winning the rook on a1. }
18... Kb8 { All the best players play ...Kb8. } 19. Na3 Nf4 20. Nd2
{ 20.Nc5  Was actually surviving for White but it's entirely understandable that in such a complex position a move like this is so hard to find.  20...bxc5  21.gxf4  Qe8  Adding extra support to the c6 knight freeing up the d7 bishop. The position is absolutely crazy but White has survived. }
20... Bxf5 21. Qxc6 Bc8
{ And now an exchange down a clearly shocked Karjakin resigned. For the vast majority of us, this would be premature but Black is an exchange to the good which should be enough at the highest level and Karjakin probably wanted to use his time to find a better approach against this dangerous line. This game shows us the value of playing both ...g5 against c3 and following it up with ...d5. These are two key moves in this variation and should be carefully understood and noted. }

5. O-O
{ This is a good choice on move 5 by White as he does not commit to putting a pawn on c3. As a result, it is now not advisable for Black to immediately continue with ...g5 as it is necessary to play 5...d6 in order t support e5 before we do so. As this game shows it does not mean that we have to abandon our plans and take a more passive approach. }
5... d6 6. Re1 g5
{ Although White has not played c3 because the e5 pawn is now protected the central counter by White of 7.d4 is less effective. In this position, it is actually a poor choice but one that Maxime Vachier-Lagrave plays. Once again if a player of this calibre can err so quickly you can see the value of our approach. Our main plan is to develop our pieces, starting with ...Bg7, and focus our attention on the kingside. We do not want to rush into playing ...g4 as the threat can be stronger than the execution and this push is always hanging over White's head like the Sword of Damocles. }
7. d4 g4
{ Timing is everything. White has not prepared the d4 counter sufficiently so ...g4 undermines the knight's defence of this pawn. White does not have a good continuation. }
8. dxe5 gxf3
{ Not only is the knight on f3 removed from the board the g-file has been opened and Black will launch a quick kingside attack with the support of ...Rg8. }
9. exf6 Ne5
{ Black does not want to allow White to capture on f3 with the queen keeping the g-file closed. The knight also takes up a very strong central position from where it can join in the kingside attack if allowed. }
10. Nd2 Qxf6 11. gxf3
{ Winning a pawn. White was already under the cosh so decided to at least grab this pawn. }
11... Rg8+ 12. Kh1 Nxc4
{ The light-squared bishop is removed so it can't aid in the defence of the now weakened light squares around the White king by retreating to f1. The light squares are now at the mercy of Black and his light-squared bishop. }
13. Nxc4 Bh3 14. Ne3 h5
{ Ensuring White cannot play a well-timed Ng4 attacking Black's queen, blocking the g-file and slowing up the Black's kingside attack. }
15. Bd2 O-O-O
{ Black ensures there is no counter-attack on his king and brings his queenside rook into the game. }
16. Qe2 d5
{ Such is the strength of Black's position he is able to expand in the centre as well as maintain a strong kingside position. White must now defend on two fronts and ...d4 is an immediate threat kicking away the knight from defending g2. }
17. Rg1
{ 17.Nxd5 ??  The knight cannot leave its defence of the g2 square.  17...Bg2+  18.Kg1  Bxf3+  19.Kf1  Rg1+ !  20.Kxg1  Qg6+  21.Bg5  Qxg5+  22.Kf1  Qg2  Boom. }
17... Rxg1+
{ Black takes a very straightforward approach, exchanging rooks and allowing his queen to penetrate the now weakened White queenside. }
18. Rxg1 dxe4 19. fxe4 Qxb2 20. Qxh5 Be6
{ Despite being a pawn down, Black has the bishop pair and a safe king. The White pawns are very weak and at Black's mercy. }
21. Rg8 f6
{ A clever move as White was intending Qh8 attacking the f8 bishop and hoping for an exchange of queens. Such is Black's advantage that he doesn't need to rush. }

3... Nf6 4. Ng5
{ This move but White is not subtle, immediately targeting the f7 pawn but it should command respect. The uninitiated can get into trouble with Black very quickly especially as its sledgehammer like approach leaves it underestimated. }
4... d5
{ This is comfortably considered to be the best response. The really adventurous amongst you could consider the Traxler variation  4...Bc5  but the advent of strong computers has effectively rendered this obsolete as it is ultimately unsound. It's fun to play as a one-off or perhaps in blitz games but ultimately, if White plays well, Black is struggling to justify  4...Bc5 }
5. exd5 b5
{ This is our main choice in The Club Player's Dynamite. We are always on the lookout for something somewhat offbeat which offers many dynamic possibilities and this fits the bill. Black seeks active play often at the expense of a pawn or in some of the lines, even more. The idea is to get White to waste time capturing this pawn @@StartBracket@@not best@@EndBracket@@ or be forced to beat a retreat with his developed pieces. Either way Black seeks quick and active play so knowing all the options at your disposal is the key to making this work. }
6. Bf1
{ As you can see in the theory section, this move is considered White's best reply. }
6... Nd4
{ The knight takes up a central square and defends b5, temporarily at least. It is worth paying close attention to Black's active moves as the structural weaknesses in his position would leave him in a poor position of he doesn't take the fight to White. }
7. c3 Nxd5
{ Capturing the d-pawn and revealing a discovered attack on the g5 knight. } 8.
cxd4 Qxg5 9. Bxb5+ Kd8
{ Black is now obliged to keep his king in the centre. It is now critical to keep up the pressure. }
10. O-O Bb7
{ Black continues to find the best squares for his pieces. The white king is now under real threat with the bishop and queen lining up on the soft g2 pawn and the knight potentially joining in the assault with ...Nf4. Currently, White has no pieces actively defending the g2 square or the kingside @@StartBracket@@you could say the rook on f1 is defending f2 but this is not Black's primary target. }
11. Qf3
{ It's always dangerous to place the queen in the firing line of a minor piece, especially a very dangerous one such as the bishop on b7. This is in fact the only realistic way for White to fight for an advantage as the knight on d5 is pinned but this should be music to your ears as it would be realistic to expect your unprepared opponent to shy away from such a dangerous-looking move. }
11... Rb8
{ Black plays the most active and natural move defending the b7 bishop. Now, this is done Black has some potentially dangerous threats linked with moving the d5 knight with a discovered attack on White's queen and opening up the diagonal to g2. }
12. Qg3
{ This is a fairly meek move but I fully understand why White played this and he is a Grandmaster. The threats created by the bishop on b7 on its powerful diagonal and very scary for White so he decides to seek the exchange of queens which Black cannot realistically avoid. This comes at a great cost ceding any possible advantage. We will see the ways White can run the gauntlet and seek an advantage in thetheory section. }
12... Qxg3
{ There is no good way to avoid the exchange of queens but far from being a problem for Black he immediately emerges with a perfectly sound position albeit the focus must shift from a strong kingside attack. With Black's king already compelled to remain in the centre of the board, it could readily be suggested that the exchange of queens means White has very little chance of taking advantage of this. Black now fully switches his attention to the weaknesses of White's queenside. What follows next is an excellent demonstration of such exploitation. }
13. hxg3 exd4
{ Black has now regained the gambitted pawn and has better development than White. }
14. d3 Nb6
{ A very insightful retreat, covering the retreat squares from the White bishop on b5. Black is very keen to exchange off White's light-squared bishop. The open nature of the position means that the bishop should be stronger than a knight. }
15. Nd2 f6
{ This is a very safe move but I am somewhat uncertain why Black didn't continue with  15...a6  to immediately force the exchange of the knight for the bishop. It turns out that it works out perfectly as White decides to acquiesce to Black's plan without being forced to do so and Black then has the valuable f6 move, covering both the  g5  and  e5  squares. This goes some way to explaining his choice. }
16. Bc4 Nxc4 17. Nxc4 Bd5
{ Opening up the rook on b8 and giving the possibility of capturing the knight on c4 and creating a protected passed d-pawn with ...c5. This would be a very committal decision and should only be played at an appropriate time as Black has a strong unopposed light-squared bishop @@StartBracket@@and the bishop pair@@EndBracket@@. }
18. b3 Kd7
{ With the queens off the board the king is in less danger and ready to undertake active duties if rooks are exchanged. }
19. Na3 a5
{ An excellent move. Black advances his isolated a-pawn, seeking its exchange which will give Black a weak White pawn to target on the b- or perhaps the a-file. }
20. Nc2 c5 21. Bf4 Rb7 22. Rfe1 Be7
{ Calmly developing the bishop so that the h8 rook can swing over to the queenside. }
23. Na3 Ra8 { The pressure is building. } 24. Nc4 a4
{ White will struggle to hold onto both his a- and b-pawns. } 25. Rab1 g5
{ Being able to play on both sides of the board is a serious indicator of the strength of one's position. The bishop is forced to retreat which allows Black to double on the b-file. }
26. Bd2 Rab8 27. Na5 Rb5 28. Ra1 Ra8 29. Nc4
{ The only way to avoid losing the two minor pieces for a rook which would hasten White's demise but White must give up a pawn to do so which will be a decisive advantage as we are very much heading towards an endgame. }
29... axb3 30. axb3 Rxa1 31. Rxa1 Rxb3
{ Black has converted his positional superiority into a pawn advantage which at this level is actually quite a comfortable conversion as we will see. }
32. Ra7+ Ke6 33. Ra6+ Kf7 34. Ra7 Bxc4
{ Black now trades to guarantee that bishops of the same colour remain on the board. It also creates a @@StartBracket@@currently protected@@EndBracket@@ passed d-pawn. }
35. dxc4 Rb1+
{ Forcing White's king offside so it can no longer assist in stopping Black's passed d-pawn. }
36. Kh2 Rb2 37. Ba5 Ra2
{ Black finds the easiest way to win as White's bishop is effectively pinned to the exchange of rooks. With White's King offside, the d-pawn is too strong. }
38. f4 d3 39. fxg5 fxg5 40. Rd7
{ The only way to stop the d-pawn but losing the bishop is effectively game over. }
40... Rxa5 41. Rxd3 Ra4
{ The c-pawn will fall soon enough.  This shows that this line has much potential. White, a Grandmaster, feared for his position so much that he wanted to exchange queens. That stopped the onslaught in its tracks but it led to a very hard position to play and Black showed us the way with aplomb. }

3... Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ng4
{ This is our key move in his variation. It is a perfectly reasonable move which avoids the main line 5... d5 which is a benefit and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly many White players are taken back by this move. The knight pressures e5 which is the key pawn/square. the challenge is for White to hold onto this without giving Black lots of play. In this game, White succeeds in the former but certainly not the latter. Its perfect Club Players Dynamite with a swift kingside assault. }
6. O-O Be7
{ Developing the bishop to e7 blocks the e-file so the pawn on e5 is once again under attack. }
7. Bf4
{ This holds on to the pawn but we should lick our lips at this move as it simply invites a kingside pawn storm. }

8. Bg3 h5
{ Who is Gary without Harry? The team march in unison with an immediate threat of ...h4 trapping the bishop on g3. }
9. Nxd4 Ncxe5
{ This leads to an advantage for Black but I have a marginal preference for the immediate  9...h4  which you can see inthe theory section. The move chosen is perfectly decent. The knight captures the pawn on e5 and supports the knight on g4. It does provide with the opportunity of playing 10.Bxe5 which exchanges off his caged bishop. It's an option which White should have taken here. }
10. Bb3 d6
{ Black is already a pawn up and the kingside pressure shows no sign of abating. }
11. Nc3 c6
{ A sound move effectively snuffing out White's counterplay via the use of the d5 square. Black's position is so good he doesn't need to rush. }
12. Nf3 Nxf3+
{ This is a questionable approach as White has given Black a get out of jail free counterplay card. Perhaps Black was happy to attempt to consolidate his extra pawn but 12... f6 was a far better move.  12...f6  ensures Black retaining dominance in the centre and the e-file will remain closed. It also has the advantage of not welcoming White's queen to f3 which aids his development. }
13. Qxf3 d5
{ The attempt to solidify his position is too slow and White now misses a great chance, not only to get back on the game but turn the tables on Black. This slow approach when your king is stuck in the centre is very risky. }

It's more than worth the sacrificed piece for White. Let this be a huge lesson to us all about taking too many liberties when uncastled. }

{ This is the key point. Retreating the knight to f6 from its attacked position on g4 not only blocks Qf7#, but it also threatens the d5 bishop meaning both White bishops are under attack. There is no viable solution. }
17. Be5 Qxd5
{ Black finds the cleanest approach. White must exchange queens to regain some material by taking the rook on h8 but this bishop then gets trapped leaving Black with an overwhelming material advantage. }
18. Qxd5 Nxd5 19. Bxh8 f6
{ The bishop on h8 is entombed and now Black just needs to calmly round it up. }

Nf4 22. Re3 Bd7 23. Rd1 Bc6
{ The bishop on h8 will now be rounded up leaving Black with three minor pieces for a rook which is a comfortably winning material advantage. This line is definitely worth knowing and playing and this game shows us a big reason why. There are sounder ways for White to play against 5...Ng4 but I have yet to find one which gives him any clear advantage and the opportunity for our opponents to go wrong abound. }

5. O-O
{ White's intention is to allow the e-pawn to be captured, intending quick development and pressure along the e-file before Black has a chance to castle. }
5... Nxe4
{ I think it's best to take this pawn and in doing so take up the challenge. Provided Black plays well there are surprisingly few dangers in this line. Black will shore up his knight on e4 with ...d5 giving him time to castle. This line has become somewhat unfashionable as with decent play White struggles to achieve anything. Black must be alert not to allow his king to be caught in the middle.   5...Bc5  This is the main alternative but there is one line that puts me off.  6.e5  Ng4  7.Bf4  The e5-pawn is now defended so if Black O-O then h3 would force the knight back to h6 where it can be exchanged  7...O-O  8.h3  Nh6  9.Bxh6  gxh6  The opening of Black's king position is far from fatal but I really don't feel any compulsion to allow this when the line suggested does a very effective job without such concerns. }
6. Re1 d5
{ It's ...d5 again and its easily the best way to support the knight on e5. }
7. Bxd5 { The speculative  7.Nc3  is covered inthe theory section. } 7... Qxd5
8. Nc3
{ This looks quite flashy, taking advantage of two pins. The one on the knight to the king on e8 and the one on the pawn on d4 to the queen on d5. The move is effective but no more and White should be happy to stop the game here as it's more style over substance. All that being said, Black is well advised to have a prepared line and I have one that many White players are unfamiliar with. It leads very quickly to a comfortable game for Black, often with the bishop for the knight and also there are some lines where White can go astray but admittedly not too many. }
8... Qd7
{ This is my suggestion. At first glance, it looks odd.  8...Qa5  is the main move followed by  8...Qh5  but we are always looking for a decent move which could catch our opponent unaware. The reason to retreat to d7 and not d8 is the advantage of our knight being covered on c6 if White takes on e4 with his rook and then on d4 with his knight. These ideas are shown in greater detail in the theory section. }
9. Rxe4+
{ If you reach the position after 8... Qd7 you will be pleasantly surprised how many of your opponents will play this move. It looks so good, taking on e4 with a check but as we will see, the rook actually becomes a target and  9.Nxe4  should be preferred. }
9... Be7 10. Nxd4 f5
{ The key move. Now White's rook must leave the e-file as it must remain on the fourth rank defending the d4 knight. }
11. Rf4
{ The rook is misplaced on f4 with minor pieces on the board. It's not terminal for White but he is the one who must tread very carefully in order to regroup successfully. }
11... O-O
{ It's important to castle before trying to exploit the position of the rook on f4. White's lack of a light-squared bishop means that ...f5 somewhat exposing the now castled king is not readily exploitable by White. }
12. Nxc6 Qxc6 13. Qe2 Be6
{ The bishop develops to the most active square. Black is building up a good position courtesy of the bishop pair, the ability of the queenside rook to enter proceedings and White's discoordination. }
14. Nb5
{ White seeks to relocate the knight to d4 threatening a fork of queen and bishop. }
14... Bd5
{ Black's well aware of the purpose of White's last move and it actually allows him to put his bishop on the massive d5 square. It's a beast. This is a timely reminder to not just focus on your own moves and plans but always ask yourself the question, 'Why did my opponent play his move?' It's easy to get caught up in the moment and forget this golden rule @@StartBracket@@question@@EndBracket@@. }
15. Qxe7
{ I wanted to show you this game as it has been a perfect demonstration to this point but inexplicably Black now makes a game-changing blunder when victory was at his mercy. }
15... Rae8
{ Black moves the wrong rook to e8 as he needed his rook on a8 to support the advance of ...a5 when White retreats the queen to b4.   15...Rfe8 !  16.Qb4  Covering the knight on b5 but more importantly the e1 square to avoid a bank rank checkmate.  16...a5 !  17.Qd2  Bxg2 !  Black is a piece down but White is effectively pieces down as his queenside forces cannot aid in the defence of his king and his light squares are there for the taking. The knight on b5 is also vulnerable so he has no time to protect his kingside if he wastes time-saving his knight e.g.  18.Nc3  Bh3  Threatening mate on g2.  19.f3  Qg6+  The queen will not be denied her role and White is busted. A real shame this wasn't played as it would have been a fitting finish to our preferred line. }
16. Qb4

16... a5 17. Qd2 { 17.Qxa5  was the only way to stay alive. } 17... Qxb5
{ Incredibly: Black returns the favour.  17...Bxg2  would have led to similar positions after 15...Rfe8 but here it is even better as the black rooks are on f8 and e8 not a8 and e8. }
18. a4 Qc6 19. f3 Bc4

21. Be3 Rxe3 22. Qxc4+ Kh8

{ The rook invades on the second rank. The pressure is mounting. Note as well that White's rook has been on the f4 square since the move 11! }
25. Qc5 Rf6
{ Intending to go to g6. The c7 pawn is just a pawn and Black has a bigger target in mind ...the king. }
26. Rf1 h5
{ Completely understandable as it prevents White playing h5 so the g6 square is still available for the rook but ultimately this is too loose and  26...h6  was best. Black would actually welcome an h5 advance as this pawn becomes too weak. }
27. Rf2 Re1+ 28. Kh2 Rd1

29. Qc4 { 29.Qxc7  Going for checks would have led to a draw. } 29... Qe1

30. Re2 Qg1+ 31. Kh3 Rd8
{ Black panics and overestimates White's desire for a perpetual check. After  31...Kh7 !  the king is safe from any immediate checks and Black should win. White is basically in zugzwang, courtesy in no small part from his rook being stranded on f4.  32.Re8  Rd2  White only has one check on g8 and g2 will fall. }

{ A quite incredible game but we should not let the ultimate outcome of a draw obfuscate from the winning position this opening brought about. It's not the most exciting line in The Club Player's Dynamite but it is far from toothless. The key idea is to make sure you get your king castled to safety before White can stand it in the centre which would lead to disaster. Then your quest for advantage will centre around having the bishop pair or at least a bishop for a knight in an open position. }

10. g3
{ A perfectly understandable move but Black, despite being a rook down is already in a massively strong position.   10.Nc7  This bizarre-looking move is the only way for White to retain any semblance of hope. The idea is that if Black captures the knight the rook on e8 is no longer defended so discovered attacks on the e-file when facing the queen are not possible.  10...Re5  This is the best reply, keeping the rook active and defended.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ The start ofthe Four Knights variation, the name of which should be readily evident. Developing both the knights before making a bishop move is a very solid way to play so we need to conjure something up to steer the game towards choppier waters. }
3... Nf6 4. Bb5
{ This along with  4.d4  The Four Knights Scotch are the main moves. } 4... Nd4
{ This is our main move. I like it because it seeks to unbalance the position immediately and by offering a trade of knights on d4 the symmetrical pawn structure, which often leads to quieter positions, can be changed. }
5. Bc4 { White avoids allowing the bishop to be exchanged for a knight. } 5...

{ Our gambit line. Black's idea is to allow White to take on e5 and then use the half-open e-file to generate counterplay. }

For this reason and to make life so much easier for you, I have recommended  8...Nxd5  in the theory sectionhere but this line is very interesting and if anyone has the time and inclination you could study this line in-depth but you would need to lock yourself away to know it inside out and that is beyond the remit of this course. }
9. d3 c6
{ Black forces the bishop to retreat and ensures that the White knight on c3 will not land on d5. }
10. Bb3 Nd7

If White does take on e5 Black must develop as quickly as possible with the key line of attack being the e-file. }

3... Nf6 4. d4
{ We once again have the solid Four Knights Opening but this time instead of  4.Bb5  White plays 4.d4.The Four Knights Scotch is another solid choice and can transpose into a 'pure' Scotch if Black takes on d4. This is a perfectly reasonable approach but the Club Player's Dynamite needs something less well known and challenging. The line proposed, as played in this game is a gambit and our main tenet of seeking active play is once again to the fore. This game, featuring the very strong Austrian Grandmaster Markus Ragger is an excellent example. }
4... Bb4
{ Our key choice on move 4. Black develops the third piece, pinning the knight on c3 and is prepared to gambit a pawn for speedy development and activity. }
5. Nxe5 O-O
{ Black could have recaptured a pawn by taking on e4 but this can lead to a number of exchanges and I want to take the challenge to White. Black is comfortably the first to get his king to safety.   His intention is to bring his rook to e8 and counter-attack in the centre. He can also use a well-timed push of his soon to be doubled c-pawns to undermine White's central control. If White is just a little complacent he can end up with his king caught in the centre and in real danger. }
6. Nxc6 dxc6
{ Take a look at this position. Black is a pawn down but has castled, with two minor pieces already developed and the light-squared bishop able to be deployed. With the rook on f8 coming to e8 the Black pieces are very active and White is still at least two moves away from castling. }
7. Bg5
{ This move makes sense as White develops and pins the knight on f6. You can check the nasty surprise in store for White if he cements his extra pawn in the centre with  7.f3. }
7... Re8
{ Black continues in line with his plan, activating his rook on the threatening e-file, which also pins the White e-pawn. }
8. e5
{ This move shows the potential of this variation. The e-pawn advances which looks dangerous, especially as it is defended by the d4 pawn but White simply doesn't have time for this and Black quickly gains the upper hand by undermining the White centre, taking advantage of the pin on the e5 pawn so the knight on f6 is not currently in danger. }
8... c5
{ Time is of the essence and Black immediately targets the supporting pawn on d4. }
9. Bb5 { White realises the impending problems and now seeks to castle. } 9...

{ Blocking the attack on the e8 rook and attacking the bishop leads to a sound and strong game for Black. I suspect Markus was confident that this would lead to a strong game without the need for immediate calculations but it turns out there was a strong alternative but it would have required much deeper calculation and the move chosen is a very decent choice. I want to show you a bit of this alternative line as its pretty interesting.   9...cxd4 !  10.Bxe8  dxc3 !!

These two pieces combined will be far too strong in an opening position with weak White pawns there for the taking.  11...Kxf7  The following is a very forcing line with a number of pieces being taken so there is limited use in justifying the individual moves, particularly the captures.  12.Qxd8  cxb2+  13.Ke2  Bg4+  A discovered attack regaining the queen on d8.  14.f3  Rxd8  15.Rab1  Be6  The bishop saves itself and targets a2.  16.exf6  Bc4+  Despite having just three pieces, the potent combination of the bishop pair combined with the rook force the White king all the way to the side of the board and well offside.  17.Kf2  Bc5+  18.Kg3  gxf6  19.Bf4  Rg8+  20.Kh4  Ba3  -+  Black is an exchange down but has the pawn on b2. White is unable to do anything useful. Black will capture on a2 eventually but ca even advance his a pawn to a4 before taking to have two unstoppable pawns. A superb variation. }
10. O-O cxb5

4. fxe5 Nxe4 5. Nf3 Bc5
{ A very important move to note. Black targets the f2 square. It would appear that this is a poor move as it allows White to not only block this but do so with tempo by advancing his d-pawn. This allows Black to then advance his bishop to b4 where the pin on the c3 knight with the support of the strong knight on e4 is very hard for White to deal with and in this game he finds himself struggling to handle the pressure. }

{ The exchange sacrifice removes White's one active piece and leaves White'spawn there for the taking. The f4 and e4 pawns will be too powerful for White's major pieces to handle. }
20. cxb4 Qxd4+ 21. Qf2 e3 22. Qe2 Bd5 { Stopping any White counterplay. } 23.
e6 Qxb4 24. Qg4 h5 25. Qe2 Qe4
{ The e-pawn will now fall. White can do nothing of note. Demoralised, White resigned. The key move, as in so many of The Club Player's Dynamite lines is ...d5 and here we can do it on move 3! The idea is to challenge White's centre and develop the remaining pieces as quickly and effectively as possible. }

1. e4 e5 2. f4
{ The much-malignedKing's Gambit but it should still be treated with due consideration. It's complacency that will get you into trouble. }
2... d5
{ Throughout the course we have used the ...d5 as much as possible. It counters in the centre and opens up Black's light-squared bishop to be developed at a time of our choosing. }
3. exd5 c6
{ This is our weapon. We want to turn the tables on White. The gambitter could become the gambitted! }
4. Qe2 cxd5 5. fxe5
{ White has taken up the challenge of winning a pawn. Now all of Black's pieces can develop and the White queen on e2 currently impedes the development of his kingside bishop. Quick activity is the key to Black's approach before White can consolidate his pawn advantage and get his king to safety. }
5... Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. Qf2 Bxf3
{ Black decides to regain the pawn before White can play d4. } 8. gxf3 Nxe5 9.
d4 Be7
{ A very clever move, developing the bishop with tempo as ...Bh4 pinning and winning the white queen is threatened. }
10. Kd1
{ We have achieved our goal of standing the White king in the centre. Black will be the only side to castle and we love that in The Club Player's Dynamite. }
10... Nc6 11. Rg1 Bf6 { Defending g7 and putting pressure on White's centre. }
12. Be3 Nge7 13. Bd3 Qd7 14. c3 O-O
{ Castling into a half-open file is not without some risk but Black is fully developed and has many many pieces able to defend the king if required. As you will see from the game it is White's king which is the one which will be exposed. }
15. Na3 Nf5 16. Bf4 g6
{ A precaution. The only pressure White had was on the g-file. Now the king is fully secured Black turns his attention to centralisation and then to undermining and opening up the centre to expose White's king. He does this with aplomb. }
17. Nc2 Rac8 18. Kd2 b5 { Heading for b4. } 19. Bxb5
{ White does not allow the pawn to advance where it would succeed in pressuring White's centre but taking it gives Black other lines of attack, notably the b-file. }
19... Qb7 20. a4 Ncxd4
{ A breakthrough sacrifice. With the White king stranded on d2 this type of opening blow is always in the offing. }
21. Nxd4 Bxd4 22. cxd4 a6 23. Rgc1
{ White cannot allow the Black queen to invade on b2 which would skewer along the 7th rank winning White's queen. He must return his extra piece immediately. }
23... axb5 24. a5 Rc4 25. Be5
{ A desperate attempt to hold things together by protecting d4 but it simply doesn't work. White was busted in any event due to his exposed king. }
25... f6 26. Rab1 fxe5 27. dxe5 Nd4
{ Black has too many threats such as ...Nb3+, ...Nxf3+ and ...Rxf3. White cannot defend against them all. }
28. Rxc4 Nxf3+ 29. Kc2 bxc4 30. Qb6 Qd7
{ Black is a piece up but, perhaps, even more importantly the White king is still there for the taking and the passed d-pawn will also be unstoppable.  An excellent counter-attacking line against the King's Gambit.   It is not intended to refute the King's Gambit but steer the game into the type of position that suits The Club Player's Dynamite. The key idea is to immediately counter in the centre and be prepared to gambit a pawn, at least temporarily, in order to achieve faster development than White. Black should concentrate his efforts in the centre of the board and seek to castle kingside. Once development has been completed he can seek to put maximum pressure on White's centre and this game showed that perfectly. }
