{ Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide! The Janowski Variation is a modern marvel, it has the solidity of 1. d5 and the venom of the nastiest tactical openings in chess. The Quickstarter Guide Chapter is organized by popularity from author's personal statistics and database statistics. The entire text is laid out in order of importance to help the reader direct their study. }
1. d4
{ 1.c4  e6  Keep in mind the transpositions into our lines. For more options on handling these systems check out Openings Oddities  2.Nc3  d5  3.d4  a6  This is an important move as we do not want to allow the Exchange Variation from the Queen's Gambit Declined proper.  4.Nf3  Nf6   1.Nf3  d5  2.c4  e6  3.d4  Nf6  4.g3  Keep in mind our transpositions into the Catalan as well. }
1... d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3
{ 3.Nf3  Nf6  4.Nc3  a6  Also transposes into our repertoire. } 3... a6
{ The key move of the Janowski Variation. It has been picking up popularity with names like: Carlsen, Ponomariov, Fedoseev and Vallejo Pons playing the line frequently in the past decade. }
4. cxd5
{ The best practical move from White. In nearly all of the top level clashes this is the move of choice. We will start our investigation of the mainlines here and work backwards to why the elite avoid the other lines. }
4... exd5 5. Nf3
{ Other moves covered in the trainable variations include: 5. Bf4, 5. Qc2 and the dangerous 5. Qb3. In the Quickstarter Guide we will be focusing on the most critical and popular variations. }
5... Nf6 6. Bg5
{ By far the main move in the database getting the lions share of games. } 6...
Be6
{ A bit odd for a Queen's Gambit but it keeps the d-pawn completely stable and the rest of development flexible. Compare this position to the standard Queen's Gambit where the Bishop typically struggles to find a useful square, in the Janowski we make use of all of our pieces for effective development. }
7. e3
{ By far the main move staying within a Queen's Gambit structure. Other moves covered in the trainable variations include: 7. Qb3 and 7. Bxf6. }
7... Nbd7 8. Bd3 Bd6 { Flexible, Black is ready to begin a plan. } 9. O-O c6
{ The most flexible move for Black defining the pawn structure. } 10. Bf4 Qc7
{ It is an important motif to recognize that capturing the Bishop on f4 would provide White a clamp on the e5-square. We have no reason to allow this positional edge for the opponent. }
11. Bxd6 Qxd6
{ The Queen's placement has improved as she eyes the important b4 square. } 12.
h3 O-O 13. Qc2 g6
{ A solid and flexible move gaining luft and is the main choice of GM Maghsoodloo a champion of the opening. }
14. Rab1
{ A natural continuation seeking to generate the standard Minority Attack plan with the a and b pawns crashing into our structure. }
14... a5 { We quickly put damper on White's plans. } 15. a3 b5
{ Black will be the one pressing on the ladies wing. } 16. Ne2
{ The standard looking move does not work out well for the first player:   16.b4  Nb6  17.Ne5  Nc4  18.Qc1  Ra6  19.Bxc4  dxc4 }
16... a4
{ Deviates from 16...b4 in 0-1  (51)  Jarmula,L  (2504)  -Maghsoodloo,P  (2649)  Manavgat 2018. }
17. Rbc1 Rfc8
{ Black will look to continue on the Queenside with Nb6 eyeing the juicy c4 square.  Example game: Nesterov-Meskovs.  Main course. }

{ One of the most critical moves in the entire variation. A key Memory Marker which can't be missed. With this move Black is using the extra time gained from the exchange to put White on his back foot permanently. }
13. Be2
{ The main move in practice.   13.dxe5  This is a blunder, Black to play and take the edge.  Bxd2+  14.Qxd2  Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  Ne4+  Forking the King and Bishop with an edge for Black. }

3... exd5 4. Nc3 c6
{ Not allowing the pin of the f6 Knight with natural development for White. This is a key waiting move and Memory Marker that will either allow us to reach the positions of move 4. exd5 or to dynamic positions with no issues which we will be covering in the following variations. It should be noted that 4... Nf6 results in a direct transposition to the Mainline Exchange Variations. }
5. Qc2

{ We are now at a crossroads with multiple moves being played. The main defender of this position is GM Maghsoodloo who has played all three  (Ra7, Nbd7, b5)  with wins in each we may add. Sadly, after research we will show that there is only one true path for Black. }
7... Nbd7
{ An aggressive move, now lets look at why we did not suggest the other tested options: We do not have the most faith in Ra7 due to the following troublesome line:   7...Ra7  8.e4  Where both  dxe4  and  Be7  are met with White coming away with a better position.  Also, we are troubled by   7...b5  8.Bxf6  Qxf6  9.a4  b4  10.Nxd5  Qd8  11.e4  c6  12.Qe3  cxd5  13.exd5  has been scoring monstrously for White following 1-0 Lenderman, A  (2638)  (-Wheeler,C)  (2383)  (Charlotte 2020) }

Approximately 80 Years of World Chess Champions. Janowski vs Steinitz 1895 1-0,  Janowski vs Lasker 1896 1-0,  Janowski vs Capablanca 1913 1-0,  Janowski vs Alekhine 1913 1-0.
