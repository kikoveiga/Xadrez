{ @@HeaderStart@@Introduction@@HeaderEnd@@  In this course, you will find a complete repertoire for Black against 1. d4 based on the Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin, as well as recommendations on how to play against 1. Nf3.  These openings have been chosen with the purpose of providing a solid, reliable defence for Black which can last a lifetime. The Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin are top-class openings played at the very highest levels with success.  In many repertoires, it is nice to have an underlying 'theme' or pawn structure which features in all the variations. This has the advantage of allowing players to get a better feel for the arising positions and pawn structures. In this course, we'll be looking to play ...d5 in the majority of variations and head towards a QGD-style pawn structure with pawns on e6 and d5. Additionally, unless it is clearly the best way to play, we will try to refrain from ...dxc4 in the style of the Vienna.  The analysis in this course should be very solid as it has been checked thoroughly by both Stockfish and LeelaChess - however, if there are new developments, we'll do our best to update the variations. Also, in the event you spot any typos or similar errors, please let us know and it will be fixed quickly.  All that's left is for us to wish you luck on your journey of learning and playing the Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin!  Good luck and enjoy!  Christof and Daniel }

1. d4
{ Our 1.Nf3 chapter , recommends a way to meet  1.Nf3  in a consistent way , starting with  1...d5. }
1... Nf6 2. c4
{ 2.Bf4  - all the d4 deviations such as the London,  (Trompowsky and Colle are covered in the 1.d4 Deviations chapter.) }
2... e6 3. Nf3
{ In recent times this has been seen as more challenging than 3. Nc3. The Nimzo-Indian, after   3.Nc3  Bb4  ,  is rock-solid and White has a near impossible time trying to prove even the slightest of edges against it.  White's attention has shifted to trying to find something after 3. Nf3 instead. The idea behind delaying the knight's development to c3 is to avoid the ...Bb4 pin of course. This position is a fairly major crossroads. Black can try a number of different, decent openings here, each with its own set of plans and ideas:   1. The Bogo-Indian with 3... Bb4+ is typically followed up with play on the dark squares, such as ...Qe7, ...d6 and ...e5.  2. The transposition to the Modern Benoni with 3... c5 is another option too. Black's point is that by using this move order he has avoided some of white's scarier tries after the 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 move order.  3. The Queen's Indian, with 3... b6, is a classic complement to the Nimzo-Indian. Black persists with the idea of controlling the centre, especially the e4 square, with pieces and not pawns.  4. The Queen's Gambit Declined, as well as the Tarrasch and Semi-Slav can also arise after 3... d5.  5. However, our choice is 3... d5 followed by meeting 4. Nc3 with ...Bb4. This is known as the Ragozin, which can be described as a mixture between the solidity of the Queen's Gambit Declined and activity of the Nimzo-Indian. The Ragozin also has a very nice synergy with the Nimzo-Indian, since many lines can transpose and plenty of the ideas and plans are applicable to both.    3.Nc3  is still the most popular move in this position, however at the top level 3. Nf3 is being played for more often and it also scores better. If you know your theory well, you should look forward to facing 3. Nc3 as White typically struggles to get even the slightest of edges after  3...Bb4.  4.Qc2  White's second most common choice , with the point of trying to win the bishop pair without conceding doubled pawns. The Nimzo-Indian with  4.Qc2  chapter covers this.   4.Bg5  We begin examining the Nimzo with White's sidelines , and these are dealt with in the Nimzo-Indian Deviations chapter.   4.f3  is a sharp and topical try which can lead to very unorthodox positions. We'll cover this, together with 4. a3,  in Nimzo-Indian with  4.a3  and  4.f3  Chapter.   4.e3  is White's most popular choice and one of the big Nimzo mainlines. We examine 4. e3 in the longest chapter in the course  (- Nimzo-Indian with 4.e3.) }
3... d5 4. Nc3
{ 4.g3  signifies the beginning of the Catalan, one of White's more challenging options. White strives to get a small but stable positional plus while also not risking too much. It has become quite popular recently, in part due to the books GM Avrukh has written on it.  4...Bb4+  5.Bd2  Be7  In sticking with our repertoire theme, we have chosen a solid line where we refrain from taking on c4 and rather reinforce the pawn on d5.  This is covered in the Catalan chapter. }
4... Bb4
{ The starting point of the Ragozin. Black develops the bishop more actively than in the Queen's Gambit Declined  (where it goes to e7)  , but this also has its own set of disadvantages.   In addition to the QGD , Black could also play  4...c6  with a Semi-Slav ,   4...c5  with a Tarrasch   or  4...dxc4  which is the Vienna. }
5. Bg5
{ This natural move is White's most popular choice in the position and will be covered in the 5. Bg5 Ragozin Chapter.   5.cxd5  is one of White's most challenging tries against the Ragozin. It is examined in Ragozin with  5.cxd5  chapter.   5.Qa4+  is an idea which features regularly in the Ragozin, with the point of forcing our knight to c6 where it can be a bit misplaced.  This is covered in Ragozin with 5.Qa4+.   5.Qb3  is a move which was topical recently and was one of White's latest attempts to dent the Ragozin. We look at this and miscellaneous fifth moves in Ragozin Deviations chapter. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Key Points@@HeaderEnd@@  This is the biggest chapter in the book, covering one of the biggest, oldest and most important variations in chess: the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian.  There are 2 basic setups white has at his disposal here: 5.Nge2 and 5.Bd3.  5.Nge2 has the idea of recapturing on c3 with the knight. We meet this by playing in QGD style with 5...d5. The key idea here is after 8.Nf4 we go 9...Na6, with the plan of exchanging knights with ...Na6-c7-e6.  5.Bd3 is the classical mainline. We meet this with the relatively rare but strong idea of 6...b6, planning to trade off light bishops with ...Ba6. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3
{ 4. e3, commonly known as the Rubinstein Variation, is - together with 4. Qc2 - far and away White's most popular and challenging option against the Nimzo-Indian. It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Bd3
{ The most common move, fighting for the e4 square.   5.Nge2  White's second most common move here, behind 5. Bd3. It is an important line to know since it was the recommendation of GM Schandorff in his popular Playing 1. d4 series. White blocks his bishop, but this is meant to just be temporary. His idea is to play a3, kicking our bishop away, and recapture with the knight in the event of ...Bxc3+. Because of this, black should rather retreat his dark bishop to e7 or d6 after white plays a3. White will then usually redevelop his knight on e2 to either f4 or g3, or sometimes develop his light bishop with a kingside fianchetto - g3 followed by Bg2.  5...d5  The most natural and most common move, staking out our claim in the centre. Black does have one notable alternative though, which is the super flexible 5... Re8. It does score quite well for black, but 5... d5 is more in line with our repertoire and it is just as good.  6.a3  Kicking our bishop back. Of course, taking on c3 just fully justifies white's opening strategy, so retreating is the only good option.   6.cxd5  is often just another move order to reach the mainline - with 6. a3 followed by 7. cxd5, but white does have an extra, independent option here.  6...exd5  7.g3  This is White's independent option. White intends to just develop his kingside and ignore our bishop on b4 for now. He hopes that eventually we retreat our bishop, thus saving him a move since he didn't play a3. However, as we shall see, whether or not this helps him is very debatable because our bishop will retreat to f8, which is a better square than e7 in the mainline.   7.a3  just transposes to our mainline.  7...Be7  transposing to our mainline. Black does have the extra option of 7... Bd6, but they are not very different in objective strength and 7... Be7 saves us from learning 2 rather different setups against one variation.  7...Re8  A very natural multi-purpose move, putting the rook on the semi-open e-file. From here it supports a possible ...Ne4 later, and also frees up the f8 square for when our dark bishop retreats.  8.Bg2  c6  9.O-O  Bf8  Bringing the bishop all the way back to f8 is a very flexible way for black to play.  10.Nf4  Putting pressure on d5 and dissuading the ...c5 break.   10.f3  Planning the e4 break of course, however this does weaken the e3 pawn.  10...c5 !  The weakened e3 pawn and blocked bishop on g2 make this break much stronger than it would have been otherwise.  11.g4  Black has no problems after dxc5 so white has tried the g4-g5 idea the most here, in order to undermine the d5 pawn.  11...h6 !  Simply preventing white's idea.  12.h3  Nc6  =+  Black's activity and the weakness of e3 give us an edge here.  10...Na6  With the idea of rerouting the knight to e6 - ...Nb8-a6-c7-e6.  11.f3  Nc7 =  Black has developed harmoniously with no weaknesses. White's issue is that the e4 break is never quite as effective as he hopes, since black often has the ...c5 counter-break at his disposal.  6...Be7  Not the only move. The second most common choice, and also a good one, is 6... Bd6. On the plus side, the bishop is more active on d6 than on e7, but the issue is that it allows white the extra, pretty decent option of 7. c5.  7.cxd5  White's most common move. It is in white's favour for white to remove the central tension before black can liquidate the whole centre with ...c5 or play ...c6 and get the extra option of ...cxd5 later.   7.Ng3  The knight on g3 is useful since it controls the f5 square - which is often where our light bishop would go, but the downside is that it doesn't influence the centre at all.  7...c5  Black also has ...b6 at his disposal, however ...c5 scores better and is more popular.  8.cxd5   8.dxc5  The second most common move, although it isn't too critical.  dxc4  9.Qxd8  Exchanging queens isn't challenging at all here.   9.Qc2  White hopes to keep some pressure in this symmetrical pawn structure, but there is a slim chance of that.  9...Nbd7  Black can recapture on c5 with the bishop, the knight or even the queen. It doesn't really matter too much - they are all approximately of equal strength.  10.Bxc4  Nxc5  11.b4  Logically kicking our knight back, however the downside is that it makes our .. .a5 lever stronger.  11...Ncd7  12.Bb2  a5 ! =  Black has no problems at all.  9...Rxd8  10.Bxc4  Bxc5 =  White has absolutely nothing in this equal endgame.  8...cxd4  Recapturing on d5 with the pawn is not ideal, since we don't want to be saddled with an IQP.  9.exd4  Nxd5  We reach an IQP position where white lacks his usual kingside attacking potential. His knight is a bit misplaced on g3 as well - usually the knight is on f3, where it defends d4 and often goes to e5.  10.Bd3  Nc6  11.O-O  Bf6  Putting the bishop where it can pressure the d4 pawn.  12.Be3  Defending d4.  12...Nxe3 !  Grabbing the bishop pair is a long-term decision. White's d4 pawn will now be protected, but later on in the game, when the position opens up, it is the bishop pair that will shine.  13.fxe3  g6  =+  Fianchettoing the bishop and tucking it away on g7. Black has a slight edge thanks to his bishop pair.   7.Nf4  The advantage of having the knight on f4 is that it puts a lot of pressure on d5. This is quite useful for white, since it dissuades us from playing ...c5, which is a typical equalising break. However, as we shall see, there are also downsides to the knight being on f4.  7...c6  Supporting the d5 pawn.  8.Bd3  White's most popular move.   8.cxd5  exd5  transposing to 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Nf4.   8.Be2  This is less common than 8. Bd3 and it has no independent value since we meet it in the same way.  8...dxc4 !  9.Bxc4  This isn't a situation where white can sacrifice the c4 pawn and get some positional compensation. If white doesn't recapture, we just play ...b5 and hold the pawn.  9...Nbd7 =  transposing to 8. Bd3.   8.b3  Supporting c4 in anticipation of ...dxc4.  Nbd7  9.Bb2  dxc4  10.Bxc4  Recapturing with the pawn is met in the same way.  10...e5  =+  Once again, with the ...e5 break in white is fighting for equality.   8.b4  White doesn't commit his light bishop, instead prefering to expand on the queenside.  8...Nbd7  As is typical with the knight on f4, we prepare the ...e5 break.  9.c5  White tries to press his queenside advantage, but black is much faster in the centre.  9...e5 !  10.dxe5  Nxe5  =+  White's queenside play is far slower than black's initiative in the centre.  8...dxc4 !  The right time to play this, now that white has already spent a tempo moving his bishop.  9.Bxc4  Nbd7 !  We are planning the ...e5 equalising break and with the knight on f4, white is not in a good position to prevent it.  10.O-O   10.Nd3  White prevents ...e5, but the knight is awkwardly-placed on d3 which gives black good play on the queenside.  10...b5 !  Black switches his focus to the queenside.  11.Ba2  a5 !  Threatening ...b4.  12.b4  Blocking ...b4, but weakening the light squares.  12...Nb6  Targeting the light squares weakened by b4.  13.O-O  Nfd5  =+  Black's strong knights and queenside pressure give him a slight edge.  10...e5 =  With the ...e5 break achieved, white is on the back foot and fighting for equality. Black's light bishop is free to be developed, while white's dark bishop is still blocked by the e3 pawn.  7... exd5  We reach an important branching point in this variation. The position - the pawn structure - is reminiscent of the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation, however the key difference is that white's dark bishop is inside the pawn chain. White has 4 main options:   1. He can develop his kingside with a fianchetto, with 8. g3.  2. He can put his knight on f4 where it puts pressure on d5 and develop the bishop to d3/e2 - 8. Nf4. This was GM Schandorff's choice in his book.  3. The knight can go to g3 instead of f4, where it has more influence over f5.  4. White can prioritise queenside play with 8. b4.   8.g3  Fianchettoing the light bishop is white's second most common plan in this position.   8.Nf4  Together with 8. g3, this is white's main option. GM Schandorff recommended this move as well. The knight on f4 serves the important purpose of pressurising d5, which makes it harder for black to achieve the ...c5 break. Black tends to forego this break altogether and focus on other ideas instead.  8...c6  9.Bd3  This is quite an important junction for black. Black has a number of different plans and development schemes to choose from.  9...Na6 !  This is only the 5th most common move, but it is a strong one which has been popular at the top level recently. It has been played repeatedly by Karjakin and once by Carlsen, albeit in a blitz game. The knight is heading to c7, from where it can do 2 things. The knight on c7 supports d5 in the event that black wants to play the ...c5 break and it can also exchange white's knight on f4 with ...Ne6, which frees up our position a bit and grants our light bishop the e6 square.  10.O-O  Note that taking on a6 just hands black the bishop pair without any real compensation for white.  Nc7  11.f3  White's plan usually involves f3 at some point, usually with the idea of e4 later.   11.b4  White decides to play on the queenside with a minority attack, but black is very well placed to meet this.  11...Bd6  12.b5  cxb5  13.Nxb5  Nxb5  14.Bxb5  Bf5  =+  Black is a bit better thanks to his more active bishops.  11...Ne6  12.Nxe6  This exchange makes black's development a bit easier as we now have the e6 square for our bishop.   12.Nfe2  Slightly more common than exchanging on e6, but not any better. Black's knight is perfectly placed now to support the ...c5 break, so if white plays too passively this is a promising idea.  12...Bd6  A typical idea to improve the placement of our dark bishop slightly.  13.Bd2  Nh5  Preparing ...f5.  14.Kh1  f5 =  Black has decent play on the kingside, while white will get some queenside counterplay. Both sides have decent chances with approximate equality.  12...Bxe6  13.Bd2  Ne8  Not the only move, but this has the idea of rerouting the knight to d6 and playing ...f5.  14.Qc2  f5  Discouraging white from playing his e4 break.  15.Ne2  Nd6  16.Nf4  Qd7 =  Black doesn't have to worry about white exchanging his light bishop, seeing as it is his bad bishop and the position is relatively closed. Black can look to expand on the kingside in the future if white plays passively.   8.b4  White's third most common option prioritises white's queenside play. 8. b4 clamps down on the c5 square, making that break more difficult for us, but also it creates other possibilities for us involving ...a5 or the newly weakened c4-square.  8...c6  9.Ng3  The knight goes to f5 and sometimes h5 from here, while also preventing black's ...Bf5.  9...Re8  10.Bd3  Nbd7  11.O-O  Nb6  The knight is on a good square here. It supports the d5 pawn - which is useful, in the event of ...c5, emphasises the weakened c4 square and also blocks the white's pressure down the b-file when it opens after b5.  12.Rb1  a5 !  A typical pawn lever in this line.  13.b5  c5  Keeping the b-file closed and counterattacking in the centre.  14.dxc5  Bxc5 =  We reach an equal position with decent chances for both sides. Black can look at ideas such as ...Nc4 and ...d4 in the future, or maybe ...a4 to fix the weak pawn on a3.   8.Ng3  Preventing black's ...Bf5, however, unlike the knight on f4, it does nothing to pressure d5. Black should take advantage of this by using the typical ...c5 break.  8...c5 !  It is possible to play more slowly with moves like ...Rc8 as well, but this seems like a pretty easy equaliser.  9.dxc5  Bxc5  10.Bd3  We reach an IQP position where white's misplaced knight on g3 - since it has no influence over the important d4 square - allows black to equalise without any real problems. Even putting the bishop on e2 instead of d3 does not fix this - we just follow the same plan of ...Nc6 followed by ...d4.  10...Nc6  Black should also consider the immediate 10... d4, which also seems good.  11.O-O  d4  A rather natural move which wasn't mentioned by GM Schandorff. The more popular choice here is 11... Be6 though.  12.Na4  The knight on a4 dissuades the ...Bb6 retreat.   12.Nce4  Taking immediately on d4 doesn't challenge black, so white needs to try something else.  12...Nxe4  13.Nxe4  Bb6  14.Qh5  Black needs to be a bit careful here - Nf6+ with mate is threatened.  14...h6  15.exd4  Bxd4  =+  Black has the upperhand in a fairly symmetrical position thanks to his more active pieces.  12...Bd6  Preparing to grab on g3.  13.exd4  Bxg3  14.hxg3  Bg4 !  The point behind 13... Bxg3. White has no comfortable way to deal with this attack without giving back the bishop pair.  15.Be2  Basically forced.  15...Bxe2  16.Qxe2  Nxd4 =  With complete equality. White has the bishop, but black is more active.  8...Re8  The best square for black's rook, while also freeing f8 for the dark bishop.  9.Bg2  c6  10.O-O  Nbd7  The knight is on its way to b6.  11.f3  White's main plan involves e4 at some point, however we can take advantage of the blocked bishop on g2.   11.b4  White's queenside play is quite ineffective here.  11...Nb6  12.b5  Bf5  =+  White doesn't have any real pressure on the queenside. Black will have ...c5 coming soon, after which he will have the more active pieces and good play.  11...c5 !  This break is good enough to equalise here.  12.Nf4  Hitting d5.  12...cxd4  12... Nb6 is also possible, but this seems to be a bit more forcing.  13.Ncxd5  The only challenging move.   13.exd4  is not challenging of course.  13...Nb6 =  with complete equality.  13...Nxd5  14.Nxd5  dxe3  15.Bxe3  Nf6 !  It seems like white gets the bishop pair and a slight edge here, but as we will see this is just an illusion.  16.Nxe7+  Qxe7 =  White's bishop pair is nothing more than symbolic here, since black's bishop will reach d5 after ...Be6-d5 with easy equality.   5.Nf3  A very natural move, and the third in popularity - behind 5. Bd3 and 5. Nge2, however it doesn't have that much independent value, since it is most likely to transpose to either 5. Bd3 or 5. a3 within a couple of moves.  5...d5  Other moves are possible, but we need to cover 5... d5 due to the transpositional possibilities. We have, in effect, reached a Ragozin with 5. e3.  6.Bd2  This is quite a rare line but one which has picked up in popularity recently at the top level. We will cover this in the Nimzo-Indian chapter dealing with 4. Bd2.   6.Bd3  transposes straight into the mainline after  6...b6   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  c5  8.Bb2  This is an interesting idea from white. He is making as many useful moves as possible, while the bishop stays at home on f1. He hopes that black will play ...dxc4 prematurely, thus saving a tempo on the lines after 7. Bd3.   8.cxd5  is not too good with the white knight on e2.  8...exd5  9.Bd3  Bg4 !  With the knight on e2, developing the bishop actively like this wouldn't be possible.  10.O-O  c4 !  =+  White's terrible dark bishop and the closed nature of the position give the edge to black's knights.   8.Bd3  Qc7 !  Black gets an improved version of 7. Bd3.  9.Qc2  dxc4  10.Bxc4  b6  transposes to a position we look at after 7. Bd3. The queen on c2 isn't the best use white could have made of the tempo.  8...Nc6  9.Rc1  Continuing the waiting game.  9...Na5 !  Forcing white to take on d5, which in turn frees our light bishop.  10.cxd5  exd5  11.dxc5  Otherwise black just plays ...c4 with a good positional edge.  11...Be6  Covering d5.  12.c4  Otherwise black can just recoup the pawn with a good position after, for example, ...Ne4xc5.  12...Nxc4  13.Bxc4  dxc4  14.Qxd8  Rfxd8 =  With complete equality.  6...b6  reaching the line we looked at in Chapter 6.   5.a3  An idea we will encounter in the 4. a3 chapter.  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nc6 !  We will see this line in the 4. a3 chapter in the line 4. a3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 O-O 6. f3 Nc6 !. It is important for black not to play the automatic 6... d5 instead, as white scores well and gets a slight edge after 7. cxd5. The point behind ...Nc6 is two-fold: it prepares the ...e5 break and possibly ...e4 later as well, and also it allows black to target the c4 pawn in the typical way with ...Na5, ...b6 and ...Ba6.  7.Bd3  White's main move, developing naturally.   7.Ne2  This seems a little unnatural, but it has been played a few times. By not committing his bishop to d3 yet, white takes some of the sting out of our ...e5-e4 plan. Instead, we will now attack c4 in this line.  7...b6  8.Ng3  Ba6  9.e4  White threatens Bg5 now.  9...Ne8  Prophylaxis against Bg5.  10.Bd3  Na5  11.Qe2  c5  12.d5  f5 !  A difficult move to find over the board, but an important move to remember ! This break hits out at e4 and ensures that white's impressive-looking centre crumbles in a few moves.  13.exf5   13.dxe6 ?  f4 !  ∓  is an important intermezzo to see.  13...exd5  14.cxd5  Bxd3  15.Qxd3  c4  16.Qe2  Nd6  17.O-O  Nxf5 =  Black regains his pawn with full equality.   7.Nf3  Controlling e5, but all this means is that we must now prepare ...e5 a bit more.  7...d6  8.Be2  With ...e5-e4 coming, e2 is a better square for the bishop.  e5  9.O-O  Bg4  10.h3  Bh5  11.Bb2  Re8  =+  Black is at least equal here and probably even a bit better due to white's poor pawn structure and his bishops' limited scope.  7...e5 !  White doesn't have enough control over e4 which means that we can look to play ...e4 ourselves.  8.Ne2  White's most common choice by far.   8.f3  This has only been tried once, but maybe it is one of white's best options.  8...d6  Our idea in this line is to target the c4 pawn.  9.Ne2  Na5 !  This looks a bit funny, but we attack c4 which is surprisingly difficult to defend.  10.e4  Be6 !  Attacking c4 and provoking d5.  11.d5  Bc8 ! =  Our last few moves might look a bit strange, but all these provocative moves are very sound positionally. By provoking d5, we get the fantastic c5 outpost for our knight and ensure that the c4 pawn stays weak for a long time. The reason for retreating to c8 instead of d7 is to leave the d7 square free for our knight.  8...e4 !  Grabbing space.  9.Bb1   9.Bc2  has little independent value and should transpose to white's main move, 9. Bb1, in a couple moves time.  b6  10.Ng3  Ba6  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  Bxc4  transposing.  9...b6  Preparing to attack c4.  10.Ng3  White counterattacks our e4 pawn instead of defending c4.  10...Ba6  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  Bxc4  =+  This position has been reached in one game so far and black already has a slight edge. After  13.Bd3  we can now improve by playing  13...Na5 !  ∓  with a dream good knight vs bad bishop position for us. }
5... d5
{ The main move here. We continue to follow our ... d5 light-squared strategy in order to fight for the e4 square and the centre. }
6. Nf3
{ White develops, very naturally. This is the main position in the 4. e3 Nimzo-Indian, and possibly the whole Nimzo-Indian. Black has tried at least a dozen setups and variations from this position onwards, each of which have their own character, pawn structure and positional ideas. Naturally, we tried to choose the setup with the most synergy with the rest of the repertoire. The 3 main options examined were:   1. The ideal choice would have been 6... c5 7. O-O Nc6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qc7, as the structures we get after 10. cxd5 exd5 feature very frequently in the Ragozin. Unfortunately, white has a number of irritating deviations on the way to that mainline, such 8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5  (which leads it black getting an IQP where it is surprisingly difficult to equalise)  .  2. One of the current mainlines and a recommendation in a handfull of repertoire books is 6... c5 7. O-O cxd4 8. exd4 dxc4 9. Bxc4. This leads to a very topical position with decent chances for both sides. However, it is an IQP position where white has decent chances for an edge and where black needs to know his stuff. IQP positions have not featured too prominently in this repertoire, and additionally covering it in sufficient detail  (when this is just one chapter in a comprehensive repertoire)  for black to be truly prepared is a difficult task.  3. 6... b6 was the third option. It leads to a structure which does feature elsewhere in the repertoire. Additionally, it is only about a fifth as popular as the main move here, 6... c5, so white players should be a little less prepared for it. In recent years it has been played by a whole host of top players, including Carlsen, Karjakin and Harikrishna.  Finally, 6... b6 seems to be just as strong objectively as any of the other lines, so it seemed like the best choice for this repertoire.    6.Nge2  White's second most common with, with the same idea as 5. Nge2 - white wants to recapture on c3 with the knight. However, that extra tempo gives black the chance to liquidate most of the centre.  6...dxc4 !  Starting to break down white's centre.  7.Bxc4  c5  Continuing the central exchanges. Black can also try 7... e5 if he wants to avoid an IQP position, but this is a very good IQP position for black, so there is no need to avoid 7... c5.  8.O-O   8.a3  isn't very critical in this variation.  8...Bxc3+  9.Nxc3  The only independent try in this line.   9.bxc3  Qc7  just transposes to a position we analyse after 5. a3.  9...cxd4  10.exd4  We have reached a very poor IQP position for white. A pair of minor pieces have already been exchanged, and white's remaining knight does nothing to support d4, which makes tying white down to its defence easy.  10...Nc6  Hitting d4.  11.Be3  b6  Preparing to develop the bishop.  12.O-O  Bb7 =  Black is fully equal - it is difficult to find any attempt for an advantage for white. Next, black can reroute his knight to e7 and then to either d5 or f5.  8...cxd4  9.exd4  Nc6  Once again, white has a very innocuous IQP position. This is mostly due to the passive knight on e2, which has few prospects besides the defence of d4. White's usual kingside attack ideas aren't really present in this position, and black can easily restrain and attack the d4-pawn. Here are two sample lines of how play might go:  10.Bg5  The usual, active square for white's bishop.   10.a3  Bd6  Of course, there is no need to take on c3 in this situation. The bishop is active on d6, and moreover it keeps e7 free for our knight.  11.h3  h6 !  A good prophylactic move against Bg5.  12.Be3  Ne7  A thematic manoeuvre. From here the knight can head to d5 or f5.  13.Bd3  b6  =+  Black has the IQP locked down completely and is 100% in the driver's seat.  10...Be7  11.a3  b6  Getting the light bishop out.  12.Qd3  Bb7  13.Rad1  h6  Forcing white's bishop to choose a diagonal.  14.Bh4  Nh5 !  A nice little exchanging idea that fast-tracks simplifications and equality.  15.Bxe7  Nxe7 =  Once again, black has the IQP under control - white's best bet is just to go d5 and liquidate everything.   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  dxc4  Once white has moved his bishop, this is rarely a bad idea. What black wants to avoid in this position is a situation where white plays cxd5 and develops his knight to e2, as he gets simple and strong play based on f3 and e4 there.  8.Bxc4  c5  9.Nf3   9.Ne2  One of the two possible squares for the knight. f3 is slightly more popular, although it is very close. Ne2 has the benefit of protecting c3, while after Nf3 something like Ne5 could be possible later.  9...Qc7  Indirectly attacking white's bishop.  10.Bd3  The more popular of the two bishop retreats. White surrenders the g8-a2 diagonal, which makes the ...e5 break more effective, but does control e4 and the f1-a6 diagonal.   10.Ba2  White keeps control of the g8-a2 diagonal, but on the other hand white gives up f1-a6, which we will exploit.  10...b6  11.O-O  Ba6 !  Exploiting the diagonal left unprotected by white's light bishop.  12.Re1  Stepping out of the pin and preparing to support a e4 advance in the future.   12.Bb2  Developing the bishop to b2 first involves a different pawn expansion to 12. Re1: white is going for c4 here instead.  Nc6  13.Rc1  Rfd8  14.c4  White gets his desired c4 expansion, but it quickly becomes clear that this is not necessarily even so desirable.  14...cxd4  15.exd4  b5 !  Black tears apart white's hanging pawns, leaving more light squared weaknesses behind.  16.cxb5  Bxb5  =+  With just a lone IQP under heavy pressure, white can only hope for equality here.  12...Nc6  13.Ng3  White seems to be ready to start advancing with e4.  13...Rfd8  Black keeps piling the pressure on d4, making any e4 expansion impossible for now.  14.Bb2  Reinforcing d4.  14...Na5 !  Clearly e4 is on its way, so black switches plans and begins to exploit the weak c4 square.  15.e4  Bc4 !  By putting the bishop on c4, black is able to neutralise both of white's bishops.  16.Bxc4  Nxc4  17.Bc1  White holds onto his bishop and threatens 18. Bg5.  17...Ne8 =  Prophylaxis against Bg5. Black is doing well here - his knight on c4 is very strong and there is a lot of pressure against white's d4 pawn.  10...Nc6  With the light bishop off the g8-a2 diagonal, black is playing for the ...e5 break.  11.O-O   11.f4  has been tried, in a Stonewall fashion, to prevent black's ...e5.  11...b6  Natural development is fine for black here. Although he didn't carry out the ...e5 break, f4 is quite weakening and a definite concession.  12.O-O  Bb7  13.Ng3  Na5 =  with good play for black. Black's knights are well-poised to exploit the light squares which were weakened by f4.  11...e5 !  12.Bb2   12.Qc2  Preventing ...e4.  12...Be6  13.f4 ?  This has been tried a few times surprisingly, but it is just bad. It seems like white panicked and tried to get rid of the central tension.  13...c4 !  Forcing an exchange of white's light bishop, which leaves the light squares critically weakened.  14.Bf5  Bxf5  15.Qxf5  exd4  16.cxd4  Taking with the other pawn is just as bad, since it gives black a monstrous outpost on d5.  16...Ne7  Kicking the queen back.  17.Qc2  Qc6  ∓  Black's domination on the light squares, combined with his queenside majority give him a clear advantage.  12...Be6 =  Black has very good play against white's centre. Next he can just bring his rooks to the central files.  9...Qc7  Once again indirectly attacking white's bishop. Note that this time, Bd3 is a blunder because of ... cxd4 followed by ...Qc3+.  10.Ba2  The more popular of the bishop retreats keeps control over the g8-a2 diagonal.   10.Be2  The bishop seems quite passive on e2, and it has no influence over the g8-a2 diagonal, but on the other hand white is just looking to play c4 and get a hanging pawns pawn structure.  10...b6  11.O-O  Bb7  12.Bb2  Nbd7  13.c4  Rac8  14.Rc1  Rfd8 =  Black has a sound setup which has scored well in practice, including a notable win by Anand against Carlsen - in rapid. Black has a few ways to shuffle his knights around here, including ...Ne4, ...Ne4-d6 or ...Nf8-g6.   10.Qe2 ?  has been played a few times, although it is a blunder, for a similar reason to 10. Bd3 ?:  10...cxd4  11.cxd4 ?  b5 !  -+  followed by ...Qc3+.   10.Qc2  is bound to tranpose to either 10. Be2 or 10. Ba2, since white can't leave the bishop on c4 indefinitely:  10...b6  11.O-O ??  Already a losing blunder, which has been played 13 times to date !  11...cxd4  12.cxd4  Ba6  -+  White loses an exchange at least.  10...b6  11.O-O  Nbd7  12.Bb2  Bb7  Threatening ...Ng4 with the idea of ...Bxf3 and ...Qxh2#. White has to be careful here and deal with that threat.  13.Qe2   13.c4  immediately is also possible.  13...cxd4  14.exd4  Qf4 =  With the idea of ...Bxf3 at some point. Black has good play against white's hanging pawns.  13...Rfe8  It's always useful to put the rook on the same file as the opponent's queen, and moreover the rook helps support a possible .. .e5.  14.c4  Slightly inaccurate, but there is an important idea to illustrate here.  14...cxd4  15.exd4 ?!  White should rather recapture with the knight here with approximate equality.  15...Ng4 !  =+  An important idea to be aware of - ...Bxf3 followed by ...Qxh2#. White needs to defend against this threat, but he will need to make a serious concession one way or another.   6.cxd5  Exchanging on d5 leads to positions reminiscent of the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation, but with the key difference - in black's favour - being that white's dark bishop is trapped inside his pawn chain.  6...exd5  7.Nge2  As mentioned before, e2 is preferable for the knight in this structure since white usually plans f3 and e4. 7. Nf3 allows black to equalise very easily with ...Bg4.  7...Re8  The rook is well-placed here, and now the f8 is also vacated for our dark bishop or knight.  8.O-O   8.Bd2  Normal, slow play doesn't really challenge black's solid setup:  8...Bd6  The most active square for the bishop.  9.Rc1  c6  9... a6 is also possible to prevent Nb5 ideas.  10.O-O  Nbd7  Black has no problems here at all.  11.f3  c5 =  with similar to play as in our mainline with 8. O-O.  8...Bd6  The most active square for the bishop.  9.f3  White's only challenging plan is to play for e4.  9...c5 !  Now is the ideal time to counter-strike in the centre. f3 leaves the e3 pawn weakened, which means dxc5 ...Bxc5 is not desirable. Additionally, the central tension makes it very difficult for white to carry out his e4 break.  10.Qe1  White is trying to conjure up a kingside attack with Qh4.   10.Kh1  is perhaps white's safest way to play: he is going to try and simplify the centre.  10...Nc6  11.dxc5  Bxc5  12.e4  Necessary to equalise.  12...dxe4  The game just fizzles out now with mass exchanges.  13.Nxe4  Nxe4  14.Bxe4  Qxd1  15.Rxd1  f5 =  with complete equality.  10...Nc6  11.Qh4  Black needs to deal with the vulnerability of the h7 pawn sooner or later.  h6  12.Kh1  is a bit less direct and committal.   12.g4  is a direct way to attack black's king, but it objectively shouldn't be dangerous.  12...a6  Black begins his queenside play.  13.Qf2  b5  14.Ng3  So far this has been played once in a game between Giorgardze and Hjartarson, which white went on to win. It seems like black should get his queenside counterplay underway as quickly as possible and begin rolling those pawns forward:  14...c4 !  15.Bc2  b4  16.Nce2  a5  ∓  Black's queenside play is far faster than white's kingside play.  12...Bd7  =+  Black retains an advantage thanks to his well-developed pieces and white's weakness on e3. }
6... b6
{ As mentioned above, 6... b6 is our choice for this repertoire. The c7 pawn stays at home, at least for now, while we prioritise developing our light bishop. 6... b6 allows the light bishop to go to a6 or to b7, depending on what black prefers. In this repertoire, our fundamental plan will be to play ...Ba6, exchanging the light bishops and then playing for ...c5. }
7. O-O
{ Very natural and the most common move.   7.a3  is white's third most common choice here, but it leads to very similar play to our mainline.  7...Bxc3+  8.bxc3  Ba6  As mentioned before, our general idea is to exchange light bishops so that white is left with his bad dark bishop.  9.cxd5  exd5  10.Bxa6  10. O-O would transpose directly to one of our mainlines.  10...Nxa6  11.Qd3  Qc8  We usually defend the knight in this way. The queen can support the ...c5 advance from here, while black's rook is now free to go to d8.  12.c4  12. O-O would transpose to the mainline, once again.  12...c5  Carrying out the usual equalising break.  13.cxd5  cxd4  14.Nxd4  Rd8  Recouping the pawn.  15.Bb2  Rxd5 =  With black's active pieces and a good outpost for our knight on c5, he has fully equalised.   7.cxd5  exd5  8.O-O  We meet all other white moves in pretty much the same way: 8... Ba6, with a near-guaranteed transposition to our mainline.  8...Ba6  transposes to the position we examine after 7. O-O Ba6. Carlsen reached our mainline via this move order, after 8... Ba6. }
7... Ba6
{ This move is significantly less popular than 7... Bb7  (800 games vs 120 games)  , but it has been played by a number of top players and it seems like a rock solid choice. It is unclear why it is so much less popular than 7... Bb7, when 7... Ba6 seems to equalise even more easily. 7... Bb7 keeps more pieces on the board, which might appeal to players who are hoping for a double-edged, complicated fight. Both moves score very well for black  (around 50%)  and they are probably equally strong objectively, so it might just be a matter of choice. The idea behind 7... Ba6 is simple: we want to exchange white's good bishop, which leaves him with his bad bishop. On the other hand, this exchange leaves our knight on a6 a bit misplaced, but this can be rectified later, especially after ...c5. We typically will play for the ...c5 break in this variation. }
8. cxd5
{ White's most common move by far.   8.Qe2  White tries to make trading bishops difficult for us, by ensuring that after the c4 trades his queen will be active on c4.  8...c5  Taking on c4 would play into white's hands, so we rather play the standard ...c5 break first.  9.dxc5  White's main move.   9.cxd5  Bxd3  Forced.  10.Qxd3  cxd4  11.exd4  Bxc3  12.bxc3  exd5 =  with complete equality again. White's backward pawn on c3 makes it difficult to try for anything more, since playing c4 would leave white with a rather weak IQP.  9...Bxc3  The right time to damage white's pawn structure.  10.bxc3  Nbd7 !  The simple 10... bxc5 is also possible, but this is better. Black temporarily sacrifices a pawn, but because of some clever tactics this forces equality.  11.cxb6   11.Ba3  leads to mass exchanges.  11...dxc4  12.Bxc4  Bxc4  13.Qxc4  Nxc5  The isolated c-pawn is compensates for white's advantage of the bishop.  14.Bxc5  doesn't win a pawn because of  14...Qc7 ! =  Black regains the piece with complete equality.  11...Nc5  This leads down a long, rather forced line which equalises completely. Black's idea is to play ...Nxd3 followed by ...Bxc4, picking up the exchange on f1.  12.Ba3  White will win his own exchange on f8.  12...Nxd3  13.Qxd3  Bxc4  14.Qd4  Bxf1  15.Bxf8  Bc4  A good square for the bishop, where it hits a2.  16.Bc5  axb6  17.Bxb6  Qb8 !  Black threatens ...Nd7.  18.Ne5  Preventing ...Nd7.  18...Rxa2  19.Rxa2  Bxa2 =  With complete equality.   8.Ne5  White's third most common move. He tries to hold onto his light bishop by recapturing on c4 with his knight, but this is a bit awkward and takes a fairly long time.  8...dxc4  9.Nxc4  Black keeps his light bishop for now, but his knight is now effectively pinned.   9.Bxc4  This seems a little counterproductive, especially in conjunction with 8. Ne5, but it is white's safest choice.  9...Bxc4  10.Nxc4  c5  11.dxc5  Otherwise white gets saddled with an IQP.  11...Qxd1  12.Rxd1  Bxc5 =  With a symmetrical pawn structure and the better bishop, black has no problems at all.  9...c5  White's slow play gives us time to carry out this thematic break.  10.a3  Gaining the bishop pair, however this is only temporary.  10...Bxc3  11.bxc3  Qc7 !  =+  A nice move, indirectly attacking the knight on c4. Sooner or later the pressure on c4 will force white to move his knight, allowing us to exchange light bishop. Black's position is preferable thanks to white's bad c1-bishop. }
8... exd5
{ There is no need to take on d3 beforehand since this just activates white's queen for free. }
9. Bxa6
{ White's main move here by far.   9.Ne5  This was tried by Duda, as well as some others. The idea is to recapture on d3 with the knight.  Bxc3  This has only been tried once, but there is no need for black to take on d3 yet, unprovoked.  10.bxc3  c5  Carrying out the standard break. Note that if white takes on a6 here, we transpose to the mainline with 9. Ba6.  11.f3  This is white's other independent option, planning e4. The e3 pawn is weakened now though, which black will try to exploit.   11.Ba3  Putting pressure on c5.  11...Re8 !  Stepping out of the pin and preventing dxc5.  12.c4  Trying to open up the position for white's bishops.  12...dxc4  13.Nxc4  tries to hold onto the bishop pair, but this doesn't last long.   13.Bxc4  has been played twice.  13...Bxc4  14.Nxc4  b5 !  White needs to take care not to allow black 2 powerful passed pawns here.  15.Qf3 !  The only move to keep equality.  15...Na6  16.Ne5  Qd5 =  With complete equality.  13...b5  14.Ne5  cxd4  15.exd4  Taking on d4 is impossible due to Bxh7+.  15...b4  16.Bxb4  Bxd3  17.Nxd3  Recapturing with the queen is a blunder of course due to ...Rxe5.  17...Nc6  18.Bc3  Nxd4 =  Black has equalised fully.  11...Bxd3  12.Qxd3   12.Nxd3  Qd6 =  Black has no problems at all.  12...Re8  13.a4  Nbd7  Exchanging off the knight on e5.  14.Nxd7  Qxd7 =  Black is completely equal.   9.a3  Forcing ...Bxc3 probably isn't the best use of white's tempo, as we often play it anyway unprovoked.  Bxc3  10.bxc3  Bxd3  11.Qxd3  Nc6 !  A nice idea. The knight is headed to a5 where it can exploit the weak c4 square.  12.c4   12.Nd2  Covering c4.  12...Na5  13.Bb2  Rc8  Preparing ...c5.  14.c4  c5 =  Black can also play ...c6, but either way black has equalised.  12...Na5  Hitting the c4 pawn.  13.Ne5  c5 =  With good play against white's centre, black has equalised. }
9... Nxa6
{ Our knight on a6 is not ideally placed, but it will typically be redeployed later after an eventual ...c5 break. This is our final junction in this chapter. At the time of writing, 88 games have been played with black scoring above 50%! This is quite understandable, since our plan from here is quite straightforward. If necessary we will defend the knight on a6 with ...Qc8 and then play for the ...c5 break. Sometimes we will stay solid with ...c6 as well. The usual guideline is that if ...c5 activates white's dark bishop  (such as when the bishop is already on c3)  , we will play solidly with ...c6 instead. }
10. Qa4
{ This is white's other way to attack the knight on a6, and white's most popular move.   10.Bd2  Natural development is white's third most common move.  10...Re8  Improving the rook's position and clearing the f8 square for our dark bishop.  11.Rc1  Qc8  This hasn't been tried yet, but it seems simple and strong. It might be a simpler route to equality than 11... Bf8.   11...Bf8 !?  Ensuring that we keep the dark bishop. This has been black's most popular move.  12.Ne5  Note that 12. Qa4 here would transpose to our mainline, 10. Qa4.  12...c5  Carrying out our standard freeing break.  13.f4  Securing the knight on e5.  13...Nc7  14.Be1  Activating the bishop by bringing it to h4.  14...Rc8  Very natural play so far from both sides.  15.Bh4  Qd6 =  Stepping out of the pin, with a decent, equal position with chances for both sides.  12.a3  Bd6  Taking on c3 is also possible.  13.b4  White expands on the queenside.  13...Qb7  Black looks quite passive, but this is temporary. We are very solid and have no weaknesses.  14.Qb3  b5 ! =  A good positional move. Black blocks white's queenside play in its tracks. Next he can plan to reroute one of his knights to c4 - ... Nf6-d7-b6-c4 or ... Na6-b8-d7-b6-c4.   10.Ne5  Bxc3  11.bxc3  c5  12.Qe2  Qc8  13.a4  Re8 =  Black is still super solid here. Next he can activate his knight on a6 either by ...Nc7 or ...Nb8-d7/c6.   10.Qd3  Hitting the knight on a6.  10...Qc8  The queen covers a6 and clears d8 for our rook.  11.Bd2   11.a3  White probably shouldn't provoke ...Bxc3, without the bishop on d2, ready to recapture on c3.  Bxc3  12.Qxc3  We have seen the structure after 12. bxc3 many times before and it is clear that black has no problems there after 12... c5.  12...c5  13.dxc5  bxc5  Our hanging pawns are well supported by black's knights.  14.b3  A necessary evil to activate white's bishop. White would probably prefer the pawn to be on a2 instead of a3, since now we are able to target b3.  14...Ne4  15.Qc2  Rb8  Putting some pressure on b3.  16.Bd2  Rb5 =  Black prepares to hit the b3 pawn with ...Qb7 - we have fully equalised.  11...Qb7  A good square for the queen, where it supports d5 - which is important after ...c5 - and also frees up the rook on a8.  12.a3  Bxc3  13.Bxc3  The only challenging capture. The other two can just be met by ...c5.  13...Ne4  We can also play ...c5 here, but there is no need to give white an IQP to play against and activate white's bishop.  14.b4  c6  15.Rfc1  Nd6 =  Targeting the c4 hole. Black is super solid here - next he can bring his rooks - ...Rac8 and ...Rfe8 - into the game and his other knight - possibly ...Nb8-d7. }
10... Qc8 { Our usual way to defend the knight on a6. } 11. Bd2
{ Natural development while also making ... Bxc3 ineffective since white recapture with the bishop.   11.Qc6  leads to a possible draw after  11...Qe8  12.Qb7  Qc8 =  With a threefold repetition. White can also try 12. ..Bxc3 followed by 13... Qa4 if he is playing to win. }
11... Re8 { A standard move, activating the rook and clearing f8. } 12. Rac1
{ With white's other rook coming to d1, it makes less sense to open the d-file with ...c5. Instead, we will be playing solidly here with ...c6.   12.Rfc1  With white's other rook 'trapped' on a1, we can play for the standard ...c5 - if white's other rook could go to d1, ...c5 might not be as good since the d-file would be opened up.  12...Qb7  The usual square for our queen. We can also go for a different plan of ...Bf8 followed by ...c5.  13.a3  Bxc3  14.Bxc3  Rac8  15.b4  c6 =  Black is super solid here and has equalised. }
12... Bf8 { Tucking the bishop away. } 13. Rfd1 Qb7 { Preparing for ...Rac8. }
14. Be1 Rac8 15. Ne5 c6
{ Black is super solid. Next he can reroute his a6 knight to d7, with either ... Nc5-d7 or ... Nb8-d7. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ By pinning the knight, black indirectly fights for control over e4. This is the Nimzo-Indian, named after Aron Nimzowitsch, who promoted the hypermodern idea of controlling the centre with pieces as opposed to pawns. The Nimzo-Indian is seen as one of the strongest defences available against 1. d4 and it has caused many players to switch to 3. Nf3 since it is such a tough nut to crack. One of the most appealing things about the Nimzo-Indian is its flexibility. Since black hasn't committed his pawns anywhere, he is able to choose from a variety of pawn structures and strategies - for example, black can go for a dark-squared strategy based on ... d6 and ...e5  (or ...c5)  or a light squared strategy with ...b6 and ...Bb7, but our play will mostly revolve around staking out our share of the centre by playing ...d5. We have chosen this strategy since it synergises perfectly with the Ragozin, meaning that many of the ideas, plans and even variations are transferable. In some cases where this clearly isn't the best way to play we will opt for something else, but otherwise we will stick to the ...d5 strategy in most cases. }
4. e3
{ 4. e3, commonly known as the Rubinstein Variation, is - together with 4. Qc2 - far and away White's most popular and challenging option against the Nimzo-Indian. It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Ne2
{ White's second most common move here , behind  5.Bd3.  It is an important line to know since it was the recommendation of GM Schandorff in his popular Playing 1. d4 series. White blocks his bishop, but this is meant to just be temporary. His idea is to play a3, kicking our bishop away, and recapture with the knight in the event of ...Bxc3+.  Because of this, Black should rather retreat his dark bishop to e7 or d6 after White plays a3. White will then usually redevelop his knight on e2 to either f4 or g3, or sometimes develop his light bishop with a kingside fianchetto  (g3 followed by Bg2)  . }
5... d5
{ The most natural and most common move , staking out our claim in the centre. Black does have one notable alternative though , which is the super flexible  5...Re8.  It does score quite well for Black, but 5... d5 is more in line with our repertoire and it is just as good. }
6. cxd5
{ This is often just another move order to reach the mainline - with  6.a3  followed by 7. cxd5, but White does have an extra, independent option here. }
6... exd5 7. a3 { This just transposes to our mainline. } 7... Be7
{ We have transposed to variation 13. Black does have the extra option of 7... Bd6, but they are not very different in objective strength and 7... Be7 saves us from learning 2 rather different setups against one variation. }

{ The most natural and most common move , staking out our claim in the centre. Black does have one notable alternative though , which is the super flexible  5...Re8.  It does score quite well for Black, but 5... d5 is more in line with our repertoire and it is just as good. }
6. a3
{ Kicking our bishop back. Of course, taking on c3 just fully justifies White's opening strategy, so retreating is the only good option. }
6... Be7
{ Not the only move. The second most common choice , and also a good one , is  6...Bd6.  On the plus side, the bishop is more active on d6 than on e7, but the issue is that it allows White the extra, pretty decent option of  7.c5. }
7. cxd5
{ White's most common move. It is in White's favour to remove the central tension before Black can liquidate the whole centre with ...c5 or play ...c6 and get the extra option of ...cxd5 later. }
7... exd5
{ We reach an important branching point in this variation. The position  (the pawn structure)  is reminiscent of the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. However, the key difference is that White's dark-squared bishop is inside the pawn chain. White has 4 main options:   1. He can develop his kingside with a fianchetto, with 8. g3.  2. He can put his knight on f4 where it puts pressure on d5 and develop the bishop to d3/e2 - 8. Nf4. This was GM Schandorff's choice in his book.  3. The knight can go to g3 instead of f4, where it has more influence over f5.  4. White can prioritise queenside play with 8. b4. }
8. Nf4
{ Together with 8. g3, this is White's main option. GM Schandorff recommended this move as well. The knight on f4 serves the important purpose of pressurising d5, which makes it harder for Black to achieve the ...c5 break. Black tends to forego this break altogether and focus on other ideas instead. }
8... c6 9. Bd3
{ This is quite an important junction for Black. Black has a number of different plans and development schemes to choose from. }
9... Na6
{ This is only the 5th most common move, but it is a strong one which has been popular at the top level recently. It has been played repeatedly by Karjakin and once by Carlsen, albeit in a blitz game. The knight is heading to c7, from where it can do 2 things. The knight on c7 supports d5 in the event that Black wants to play the ...c5 break and it can also exchange White's knight on f4 with ...Ne6, which frees up our position a bit and grants our light-squared bishop the e6-square. }
10. O-O
{ Note that taking on a6 just hands Black the bishop pair without any real compensation for White. }
10... Nc7 11. f3
{ White's plan usually involves f3 at some point, usually with the idea of e4 later. }
11... Ne6 12. Nxe6
{ This exchange makes Black's development a bit easier as we now have the e6-square for our bishop. }
12... Bxe6 13. Bd2 Ne8
{ Not the only move, but this has the idea of rerouting the knight to d6 and playing ...f5. }
14. Qc2 f5 { Discouraging White from playing his e4 break. } 15. Ne2 Nd6 16.
Nf4 Qd7
{ Black doesn't have to worry about White exchanging his light-squared bishop, seeing as it is his bad bishop and the position is relatively closed. Black can look to expand on the kingside in the future if White plays passively. }

{ 4. e3, commonly known as the Rubinstein Variation, is - together with 4. Qc2 - far and away White's most popular and challenging option against the Nimzo-Indian. It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Ne2
{ White's second most common move here , behind  5.Bd3.  It is an important line to know since it was the recommendation of GM Schandorff in his popular Playing 1. d4 series. White blocks his bishop, but this is meant to just be temporary. His idea is to play a3, kicking our bishop away, and recapture with the knight in the event of ...Bxc3+.  Because of this, Black should rather retreat his dark bishop to e7 or d6 after White plays a3. White will then usually redevelop his knight on e2 to either f4 or g3, or sometimes develop his light bishop with a kingside fianchetto  (g3 followed by Bg2)  . }

{ White's second most common move here , behind  5.Bd3.  It is an important line to know since it was the recommendation of GM Schandorff in his popular Playing 1. d4 series. White blocks his bishop, but this is meant to just be temporary. His idea is to play a3, kicking our bishop away, and recapture with the knight in the event of ...Bxc3+.  Because of this, Black should rather retreat his dark bishop to e7 or d6 after White plays a3. White will then usually redevelop his knight on e2 to either f4 or g3, or sometimes develop his light bishop with a kingside fianchetto  (g3 followed by Bg2)  . }
5... d5
{ The most natural and most common move , staking out our claim in the centre. Black does have one notable alternative though , which is the super flexible  5...Re8.  It does score quite well for Black, but 5... d5 is more in line with our repertoire and it is just as good. }
6. a3
{ Kicking our bishop back. Of course, taking on c3 just fully justifies White's opening strategy, so retreating is the only good option. }
6... Be7
{ Not the only move. The second most common choice , and also a good one , is  6...Bd6.  On the plus side, the bishop is more active on d6 than on e7, but the issue is that it allows White the extra, pretty decent option of  7.c5. }
7. cxd5
{ White's most common move. It is in White's favour to remove the central tension before Black can liquidate the whole centre with ...c5 or play ...c6 and get the extra option of ...cxd5 later. }
7... exd5
{ We reach an important branching point in this variation. The position  (the pawn structure)  is reminiscent of the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. However, the key difference is that White's dark-squared bishop is inside the pawn chain. White has 4 main options:   1. He can develop his kingside with a fianchetto, with 8. g3.  2. He can put his knight on f4 where it puts pressure on d5 and develop the bishop to d3/e2 - 8. Nf4. This was GM Schandorff's choice in his book.  3. The knight can go to g3 instead of f4, where it has more influence over f5.  4. White can prioritise queenside play with 8. b4. }
8. g3
{ Fianchettoing the light-squared bishop is White's second most common plan in this position. }
8... Re8
{ The best square for Black's rook, while also freeing f8 for the dark-squared bishop. }
9. Bg2 c6 10. O-O Nbd7 { The knight is on its way to b6. } 11. f3
{ White's main plan involves e4 at some point, however we can take advantage of the blocked bishop on g2. }
11... c5 { This break is good enough to equalise here. } 12. Nf4
{ Hitting d5. } 12... cxd4
{ 12...Nb6  is also possible , but this seems to be a bit more forcing. } 13.
Ncxd5 { The only challenging move. } 13... Nxd5 14. Nxd5 dxe3 15. Bxe3 Nf6
{ It seems like White gets the bishop pair and a slight edge here, but as we will see this is just an illusion. }
16. Nxe7+ Qxe7
{ White's bishop pair is nothing more than symbolic here, since black's Bishop will reach d5 after ...Be6-d5 with easy equality. }

It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Bd3 { The most common move, fighting for the e4-square. } 5... d5
{ The main move here. We continue to follow our ... d5 light-squared strategy in order to fight for the e4-square and the centre. }
6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 dxc4
{ Once White has moved his f1-bishop, this is rarely a bad idea. What Black wants to avoid in this position is a situation where White plays cxd5 and develops his knight to e2, as he gets simple and strong play based on f3 and e4 there. }
8. Bxc4 c5 9. Ne2
{ One of the two possible squares for the knight. Nf3 is slightly more popular, although it is very close. Ne2 has the benefit of protecting c3, while after Nf3 something like Ne5 could be possible later. }
9... Qc7 { Indirectly attacking White's bishop. } 10. Bd3
{ The more popular of the two bishop retreats. White surrenders the g8-a2 diagonal, which makes the ...e5 break more effective, but does control e4 and the f1-a6 diagonal. }
10... Nc6
{ With the light bishop off the g8-a2 diagonal, Black is playing for the ...e5 break. }
11. O-O e5 12. Bb2 Be6
{ Black has very good play against White's centre. Next he can just bring his rooks to the central files. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3
{ 4. e3, commonly known as the Rubinstein Variation, is - together with 4. Qc2 - far and away White's most popular and challenging option against the Nimzo-Indian. It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Bd3 { The most common move, fighting for the e4-square. } 5... d5
{ The main move here. We continue to follow our ... d5 light-squared strategy in order to fight for the e4-square and the centre. }
6. Nf3
{ White develops, very naturally. This is the main position in the 4. e3 Nimzo-Indian, and possibly the whole Nimzo-Indian. Black has tried at least a dozen setups and variations from this position onwards, each of which have their own character, pawn structure and positional ideas.Naturally, we tried to choose the setup with the most synergy with the rest of the repertoire. The 3 main options examined were:  1. The ideal choice would have been   6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.a3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  Qc7  , as the structures we get after  10.cxd5  exd5  feature very frequently in the Ragozin. Unfortunately, White has a number of irritating deviations on the way to that mainline, such 8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5 - which leads to Black getting an IQP where it is surprisingly difficult to equalise.  2. One of the current mainlines and a recommendation in a handfull of repertoire books is   6...c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.exd4  dxc4  9.Bxc4.  This leads to a very topical position with decent chances for both sides. However , it is an IQP position where White has decent chances for an edge and where Black needs to know his stuff. IQP positions have not featured too prominently in this repertoire , and additionally covering it in sufficient detail  (when this is just one chapter in a comprehensive repertoire)  (for Black to be truly prepared is a difficult task.)  3.   6...b6  was the third option. It leads to a structure which does feature elsewhere in the repertoire. Additionally, it is only about a fifth as popular as the main move here, 6... c5, so white players should be a little less prepared for it. In recent years it has been played by a whole host of top players, including Carlsen, Karjakin and Harikrishna. Finally, 6... b6 seems to be just as strong objectively as any of the other lines, so it seemed like the best choice for this repertoire. }
6... b6
{ As mentioned above, 6... b6 is our choice for this repertoire. The c7-pawn stays at home, at least for now, while we prioritise developing our light bishop. 6... b6 allows the light bishop to go to a6 or to b7, depending on what Black prefers. In this repertoire, our fundamental plan will be to play ...Ba6, exchanging the light-squared bishops and then playing for ...c5. }
7. a3
{ This is White's third most common choice here, but it leads to very similar play to our mainline. }
7... Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Ba6
{ As mentioned before, our general idea is to exchange light-squared bishops so that White is left with his bad dark-squared bishop. }
9. cxd5 exd5 10. Bxa6
{ 10.O-O  would transpose directly to one of our mainlines - variation #10. }
10... Nxa6 11. Qd3 Qc8
{ We usually defend the knight in this way. The queen can support the ...c5 advance from here, while Black's rook is now free to go to d8. }
12. c4 { 12.O-O  would transpose to the mainline , once again. } 12... c5
{ Carrying out the usual equalising break. } 13. cxd5 cxd4 14. Nxd4 Rd8
{ Recouping the pawn. } 15. Bb2 Rxd5
{ With Black's active pieces and a good outpost for our knight on c5, he has fully equalised. }

Ba6 is simple: we want to exchange White's good bishop, which leaves him with his bad bishop.

Unfortunately, White has a number of irritating deviations on the way to that mainline, such 8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5 - which leads to Black getting an IQP where it is surprisingly difficult to equalise.  2. One of the current mainlines and a recommendation in a handfull of repertoire books is   6...c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.exd4  dxc4  9.Bxc4.  This leads to a very topical position with decent chances for both sides. However , it is an IQP position where White has decent chances for an edge and where Black needs to know his stuff. IQP positions have not featured too prominently in this repertoire , and additionally covering it in sufficient detail  (when this is just one chapter in a comprehensive repertoire)  (for Black to be truly prepared is a difficult task.)  3.   6...b6  was the third option. It leads to a structure which does feature elsewhere in the repertoire. Additionally, it is only about a fifth as popular as the main move here, 6... c5, so white players should be a little less prepared for it. In recent years it has been played by a whole host of top players, including Carlsen, Karjakin and Harikrishna. Finally, 6... b6 seems to be just as strong objectively as any of the other lines, so it seemed like the best choice for this repertoire. }
6... b6
{ As mentioned above, 6... b6 is our choice for this repertoire. The c7-pawn stays at home, at least for now, while we prioritise developing our light bishop. 6... b6 allows the light bishop to go to a6 or to b7, depending on what Black prefers. In this repertoire, our fundamental plan will be to play ...Ba6, exchanging the light-squared bishops and then playing for ...c5. }
7. O-O { Very natural and the most common move. } 7... Ba6
{ This move is significantly less popular than 7... Bb7  (800 games vs 120 games)  , but it has been played by a number of top players and it seems like a rock solid choice. It is unclear why it is so much less popular than 7... Bb7, when 7... Ba6 seems to equalise even more easily.   7...Bb7  keeps more pieces on the board , which might appeal to players who are hoping for a double-edged , complicated fight. Both moves score very well for Black  (around 50%)  (and they are probably equally strong objectively, so it might just be a matter of choice.)  The idea behind 7... Ba6 is simple: we want to exchange White's good bishop, which leaves him with his bad bishop. On the other hand, this exchange leaves our knight on a6 a bit misplaced, but this can be rectified later, especially after ...c5. We typically will play for the ...c5 break in this variation. }
8. Ne5
{ White's third most common move. He tries to hold onto his light-squared bishop by recapturing on c4 with his knight, but this is a bit awkward and takes a fairly long time. }
8... dxc4 9. Bxc4
{ This seems a little counterproductive, especially in conjunction with 8. Ne5, but it is White's safest choice. }
9... Bxc4 10. Nxc4 c5 11. dxc5 { Otherwise White gets saddled with an IQP. }
11... Qxd1 12. Rxd1 Bxc5
{ With a symmetrical pawn structure and the better bishop, Black has no problems at all. }

10. a3 { Gaining the bishop pair, however this is only temporary. } 10... Bxc3
11. bxc3 Qc7
{ A nice move, indirectly attacking the knight on c4. Sooner or later the pressure on c4 will force White to move his knight, allowing us to exchange light-squared bishops. Black's position is preferable thanks to White's bad c1-bishop. }

The 3 main options examined were:  1. The ideal choice would have been   6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.a3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  Qc7  , as the structures we get after  10.cxd5  exd5  feature very frequently in the Ragozin. Unfortunately, White has a number of irritating deviations on the way to that mainline, such 8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5 - which leads to Black getting an IQP where it is surprisingly difficult to equalise.  2. One of the current mainlines and a recommendation in a handfull of repertoire books is   6...c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.exd4  dxc4  9.Bxc4.  This leads to a very topical position with decent chances for both sides. However , it is an IQP position where White has decent chances for an edge and where Black needs to know his stuff. IQP positions have not featured too prominently in this repertoire , and additionally covering it in sufficient detail  (when this is just one chapter in a comprehensive repertoire)  (for Black to be truly prepared is a difficult task.)  3.   6...b6  was the third option. It leads to a structure which does feature elsewhere in the repertoire. Additionally, it is only about a fifth as popular as the main move here, 6... c5, so white players should be a little less prepared for it. In recent years it has been played by a whole host of top players, including Carlsen, Karjakin and Harikrishna. Finally, 6... b6 seems to be just as strong objectively as any of the other lines, so it seemed like the best choice for this repertoire. }
6... b6
{ As mentioned above, 6... b6 is our choice for this repertoire. The c7-pawn stays at home, at least for now, while we prioritise developing our light bishop. 6... b6 allows the light bishop to go to a6 or to b7, depending on what Black prefers. In this repertoire, our fundamental plan will be to play ...Ba6, exchanging the light-squared bishops and then playing for ...c5. }
7. O-O { Very natural and the most common move. } 7... Ba6
{ This move is significantly less popular than 7... Bb7  (800 games vs 120 games)  , but it has been played by a number of top players and it seems like a rock solid choice. It is unclear why it is so much less popular than 7... Bb7, when 7... Ba6 seems to equalise even more easily.   7...Bb7  keeps more pieces on the board , which might appeal to players who are hoping for a double-edged , complicated fight. Both moves score very well for Black  (around 50%)  (and they are probably equally strong objectively, so it might just be a matter of choice.)  The idea behind 7... Ba6 is simple: we want to exchange White's good bishop, which leaves him with his bad bishop. On the other hand, this exchange leaves our knight on a6 a bit misplaced, but this can be rectified later, especially after ...c5. We typically will play for the ...c5 break in this variation. }
8. cxd5 { White's most common move by far. } 8... exd5
{ There is no need to take on d3 beforehand since this just activates White's queen for free. }
9. Ne5
{ This was tried by Duda, as well as some others. The idea is to recapture on d3 with the knight. }
9... Bxc3
{ This has only been tried once, but there is no need for Black to take on d3 yet, unprovoked. }
10. bxc3 c5
{ Carrying out the standard break. Note that if White takes on a6 here, we transpose to the mainline with 9. Ba6 - variation #14. }
11. f3
{ This is White's other independent option, planning e4. The e3-pawn is weakened now though, which Black will try to exploit. }
11... Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Re8 13. a4 Nbd7 { Exchanging off the knight on e5. } 14.

It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Bd3 { The most common move, fighting for the e4-square. } 5... d5
{ The main move here. We continue to follow our ... d5 light-squared strategy in order to fight for the e4-square and the centre. }
6. Nf3
{ White develops, very naturally. This is the main position in the 4. e3 Nimzo-Indian, and possibly the whole Nimzo-Indian. Black has tried at least a dozen setups and variations from this position onwards, each of which have their own character, pawn structure and positional ideas.Naturally, we tried to choose the setup with the most synergy with the rest of the repertoire. The 3 main options examined were:  1. The ideal choice would have been   6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.a3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  Qc7  , as the structures we get after  10.cxd5  exd5  feature very frequently in the Ragozin. Unfortunately, White has a number of irritating deviations on the way to that mainline, such 8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5 - which leads to Black getting an IQP where it is surprisingly difficult to equalise.  2. One of the current mainlines and a recommendation in a handfull of repertoire books is   6...c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.exd4  dxc4  9.Bxc4.  This leads to a very topical position with decent chances for both sides. However , it is an IQP position where White has decent chances for an edge and where Black needs to know his stuff. IQP positions have not featured too prominently in this repertoire , and additionally covering it in sufficient detail  (when this is just one chapter in a comprehensive repertoire)  (for Black to be truly prepared is a difficult task.)  3.   6...b6  was the third option. It leads to a structure which does feature elsewhere in the repertoire. Additionally, it is only about a fifth as popular as the main move here, 6... c5, so white players should be a little less prepared for it. In recent years it has been played by a whole host of top players, including Carlsen, Karjakin and Harikrishna. Finally, 6... b6 seems to be just as strong objectively as any of the other lines, so it seemed like the best choice for this repertoire. }
6... b6
{ As mentioned above, 6... b6 is our choice for this repertoire. The c7-pawn stays at home, at least for now, while we prioritise developing our light bishop. 6... b6 allows the light bishop to go to a6 or to b7, depending on what Black prefers. In this repertoire, our fundamental plan will be to play ...Ba6, exchanging the light-squared bishops and then playing for ...c5. }
7. O-O { Very natural and the most common move. } 7... Ba6
{ This move is significantly less popular than 7... Bb7  (800 games vs 120 games)  , but it has been played by a number of top players and it seems like a rock solid choice. It is unclear why it is so much less popular than 7... Bb7, when 7... Ba6 seems to equalise even more easily.   7...Bb7  keeps more pieces on the board , which might appeal to players who are hoping for a double-edged , complicated fight. Both moves score very well for Black  (around 50%)  (and they are probably equally strong objectively, so it might just be a matter of choice.)  The idea behind 7... Ba6 is simple: we want to exchange White's good bishop, which leaves him with his bad bishop. On the other hand, this exchange leaves our knight on a6 a bit misplaced, but this can be rectified later, especially after ...c5. We typically will play for the ...c5 break in this variation. }
8. cxd5 { White's most common move by far. } 8... exd5
{ There is no need to take on d3 beforehand since this just activates White's queen for free. }
9. Bxa6 { White's main move here by far. } 9... Nxa6
{ Our knight on a6 is not ideally placed, but it will typically be redeployed later after an eventual ...c5 break. This is our final junction in this chapter. At the time of writing, 88 games have been played with Black scoring above 50%! This is quite understandable, since our plan from here is quite straightforward. If necessary we will defend the knight on a6 with ...Qc8 and then play for the ...c5 break. Sometimes we will stay solid with ...c6 as well. The usual guideline is that if ...c5 activates white's dark bishop  (such as when the bishop is already on c3)  , we will play solidly with ...c6 instead. }
10. Ne5 Bxc3 11. bxc3 c5 12. Qe2 Qc8 13. a4 Re8
{ Black is still super solid here. Next he can activate his knight on a6 either by ...Nc7 or ...Nb8-d7/c6. }

7. O-O { Very natural and the most common move. } 7... Ba6
{ This move is significantly less popular than 7... Bb7  (800 games vs 120 games)  , but it has been played by a number of top players and it seems like a rock solid choice. It is unclear why it is so much less popular than 7... Bb7, when 7... Ba6 seems to equalise even more easily.   7...Bb7  keeps more pieces on the board , which might appeal to players who are hoping for a double-edged , complicated fight. Both moves score very well for Black  (around 50%)  (and they are probably equally strong objectively, so it might just be a matter of choice.)  The idea behind 7... Ba6 is simple: we want to exchange White's good bishop, which leaves him with his bad bishop. On the other hand, this exchange leaves our knight on a6 a bit misplaced, but this can be rectified later, especially after ...c5. We typically will play for the ...c5 break in this variation. }
8. cxd5 { White's most common move by far. } 8... exd5
{ There is no need to take on d3 beforehand since this just activates White's queen for free. }
9. Bxa6 { White's main move here by far. } 9... Nxa6
{ Our knight on a6 is not ideally placed, but it will typically be redeployed later after an eventual ...c5 break. This is our final junction in this chapter. At the time of writing, 88 games have been played with Black scoring above 50%! This is quite understandable, since our plan from here is quite straightforward. If necessary we will defend the knight on a6 with ...Qc8 and then play for the ...c5 break. Sometimes we will stay solid with ...c6 as well. The usual guideline is that if ...c5 activates white's dark bishop  (such as when the bishop is already on c3)  , we will play solidly with ...c6 instead. }
10. Qa4
{ This is White's other way to attack the knight on a6, and White's most popular move. }
10... Qc8 { Our usual way to defend the knight on a6. } 11. Bd2
{ Natural development while also making ...Bxc3 ineffective since White recaptures with the bishop. }
11... Re8 { A standard move, activating the rook and clearing f8. } 12. Rfc1
{ With White's other rook 'trapped' on a1, we can play for the standard ...c5 - if White's other rook could go to d1, ...c5 might not be as good since the d-file would be opened up. }
12... Qb7
{ The usual square for our queen. We can also go for a different plan of ...Bf8 followed by ...c5. }
13. a3 Bxc3 14. Bxc3 Rac8 15. b4 c6
{ Black is super solid here and has equalised. } *

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3
{ 4. e3, commonly known as the Rubinstein Variation, is - together with 4. Qc2 - far and away White's most popular and challenging option against the Nimzo-Indian. It might seem strange to think that blocking White's dark-squared bishop in like this is critical, but as we will see in a later chapter, active development with   4.Bg5  can be met strongly by  4...c5  ,   and  4.Nf3  transposes to the Ragozin after  4...d5.  4. e3 seems quite inflexible and committal, however it is important to keep in mind that White hasn't committed his g1-knight yet. This means that he has a couple of possible setups involving Ng1-e2, in addition to the more obvious Nf3 plans. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most flexible option and probably the best. Black doesn't commit his central pawns too early, which allows us to opt for either a dark-squared strategy  (with ...c5)  or a light-squared strategy  (with ...d5)  , depending on how White continues. In most situations we will be opting for the light-squared strategy with ...d5, as this is in keeping with this repertoire's theme, but in one specific case we go for a dark-squared plan: when White plays an early a3 to gain the bishop pair. }
5. Bd3 { The most common move, fighting for the e4-square. } 5... d5
{ The main move here. We continue to follow our ... d5 light-squared strategy in order to fight for the e4-square and the centre. }
6. Nf3
{ White develops, very naturally. This is the main position in the 4. e3 Nimzo-Indian, and possibly the whole Nimzo-Indian. Black has tried at least a dozen setups and variations from this position onwards, each of which have their own character, pawn structure and positional ideas.Naturally, we tried to choose the setup with the most synergy with the rest of the repertoire. The 3 main options examined were:  1. The ideal choice would have been   6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.a3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  Qc7  , as the structures we get after  10.cxd5  exd5  feature very frequently in the Ragozin. Unfortunately, White has a number of irritating deviations on the way to that mainline, such 8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5 - which leads to Black getting an IQP where it is surprisingly difficult to equalise.  2. One of the current mainlines and a recommendation in a handfull of repertoire books is   6...c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.exd4  dxc4  9.Bxc4.  This leads to a very topical position with decent chances for both sides. However , it is an IQP position where White has decent chances for an edge and where Black needs to know his stuff. IQP positions have not featured too prominently in this repertoire , and additionally covering it in sufficient detail  (when this is just one chapter in a comprehensive repertoire)  (for Black to be truly prepared is a difficult task.)  3.   6...b6  was the third option. It leads to a structure which does feature elsewhere in the repertoire. Additionally, it is only about a fifth as popular as the main move here, 6... c5, so white players should be a little less prepared for it. In recent years it has been played by a whole host of top players, including Carlsen, Karjakin and Harikrishna. Finally, 6... b6 seems to be just as strong objectively as any of the other lines, so it seemed like the best choice for this repertoire. }
6... b6
{ As mentioned above, 6... b6 is our choice for this repertoire. The c7-pawn stays at home, at least for now, while we prioritise developing our light bishop. 6... b6 allows the light bishop to go to a6 or to b7, depending on what Black prefers. In this repertoire, our fundamental plan will be to play ...Ba6, exchanging the light-squared bishops and then playing for ...c5. }
7. O-O { Very natural and the most common move. } 7... Ba6
{ This move is significantly less popular than 7... Bb7  (800 games vs 120 games)  , but it has been played by a number of top players and it seems like a rock solid choice. It is unclear why it is so much less popular than 7... Bb7, when 7... Ba6 seems to equalise even more easily.   7...Bb7  keeps more pieces on the board , which might appeal to players who are hoping for a double-edged , complicated fight.

On the other hand, this exchange leaves our knight on a6 a bit misplaced, but this can be rectified later, especially after ...c5. We typically will play for the ...c5 break in this variation. }

[Black "Nimzo-Indian with 4.Qc2 Overview"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Key Points@@HeaderEnd@@
 We cover the Classical variation, 4.Qc2, of the Nimzo here. It has the idea of recapturing on c3 with the queen instead of the pawn.   There is a tricky sideline in the form of 5.e4. We meet this with 5...d5. Unfortunately, black really needs to learn his theory here - there is no way around it. Fortunately, black has absolutely no issues theoretically if he knows his stuff.   The mainline is 5.a3, gaining the bishop pair. We meet this by taking on c3 and then playing QGD-style with ...d5.   Typically, we are trying to exploit our lead in development here before white can take advantage of his bishop pair. To do so, we often take on c4, forcing white to recapture with his queen, and then follow up with moves like ...b6, ...Ba6 and ...c5. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ 4. Qc2, often known as the Classical Variation, is the most challenging and topical variation of the Nimzo-Indian, together with the Rubinstein Variation   4.e3  . White wants to get the best of the both worlds in this variation: the bishop pair  (after a3 ...bxc3+)  without incurring irritating doubled c-pawns after bxc3. Another important characteristic of 4. Qc2 is that white can now play 5. e4 without losing a pawn, if white chooses to. All is not doom and gloom for black, however. The issue with 4. Qc2 is that it does nothing to contribute to white's development. As a result, it is typical to reach positions in this variation where black has a lead in development, while white has won the bishop pair. In this situation, black needs to play actively in order to keep the initiative and not allow white's pair of bishops to wreak havoc. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most popular choice. He remains flexible in the centre. Black does have two other good options though: 1. 4... c5 exploits another consequence of 4. Qc2: the queen left d4 unsupported. This is a decent line, however it doesn't fit in with our ...d5 theme in this repertoire. 2. 4... d5 is the most logical move for this repertoire in terms of our ...d5 theme. In fact, it is quite likely to transpose to our choice, 4... O-O. The reason we didn't go for this option is that it can lead to some sharp and unconventional lines after 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bg5. Black often has to play ... h6 and ...g5, which is something we have tried to avoid in this repertoire. }
5. a3
{ The main move by far. White collects the bishop pair, which is what he set out to achieve.   5.e4  Grabbing the whole centre is certainly ambitious. Formerly quite a rare line, with the help of computer analysis it has become quite a formidable weapon.  5...d5 !  The main move here. Black immediately starts chipping away at white's centre before he has a chance to solidify. This line can get a bit sharp, but black fully equalises if he knows some theory here.  6.e5  White lunges forwards of course.   6.cxd5  is non-critical.  exd5  7.e5  Ne4  8.Bd3  c5  Continuing to attack white's centre.  9.Nge2  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Bc5 !  A very rare move, but probably the simplest path to equality.  11.Bxe4  White grabs a pawn.   11.Nxe4  dxe4  12.Qxc5  exd3  13.O-O  Nc6 =  With full equality. Black's activity and threats make it near impossible for white to pick up the seemingly exposed d3 pawn.  11...dxe4  12.Nb3  Bb6  13.Qxe4  Nc6 =  Our pressure on e5 together with our development lead and bishop pair give us full compensation for the pawn.  6...Ne4  7.Bd3  White's most common move, attack our knight.   7.a3  Forcing the capture on c3 so another pawn can support the d4 pawn.  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  c5  Once again, black plays actively and attacks white's centre.  9.Bd3  Attacking e4.   9.Bb2  White's second most popular choice.  cxd4  10.cxd4  Bd7  No need to give the very tempting check ...Qa5.  11.Ne2  Nc6  ∓  Black just seems to be better here. Next he can crack open white's centre with ...f6.  9...Qa5  Counterattacking c3, which indirectly defends e4.  10.Ne2  cxd4  This line does get quite sharp now.  11.cxd5  exd5  12.f3  Opening the diagonal for the bishop by forcing our knight away.  Nxc3  13.Nxd4  Ne4+  13... Nb5+ is the other option and it is simpler, as it leads to a roughly equal endgame.  14.Ke2  Nc5  15.Bxh7+  Kh8  16.Kf2  Bd7 =  The position remains very sharp with chances for both sides. Black will want to play actively and get the rest of his pieces into the game, with ...Rc8 and ...Nc6.  7...c5 !  Black should continue to attack white's unsupported centre.  8.Nf3  cxd4  We remove the pawn supporting e5.  9.Nxd4  Nd7  Attacking e5.  10.Bf4  Defending e5 is white's most common move by far.  Ndc5  Supporting e4 while simultaneously planning ...Nxd3+.  11.O-O  Bxc3  12.bxc3  Bd7  With the idea of ...Ba4 or playing ...Na4 to attack c3.  13.Be2  White retreats his bishop due to the threat of ...Ba4.  Na4  Attacking c3.  14.cxd5  exd5  15.c4  Advancing the weak pawn.   15.f3  White sacrifices his c3 pawn.  Nexc3  16.Bd3  g6  Blunting the bishop.  17.Rac1  b5 =  White has enough compensation for the pawn for equality, but nothing more. The position remains complex though, with chances for both sides.  15...Rc8  16.Rac1  Nac3  17.cxd5  Qa5  Recouping the d5 pawn.  18.Bf3  Qxd5 =  The position remains quite complex, but black should be equal.   5.Bg5  White develops actively, but this is slightly premature. A downside of 4. Qc2 was that it left white's centre   d4  unsupported, which is something black can certainly exploit.  5...c5  Attacking the unprotected d4 pawn. Now 6. dxc5 must surely be critical.   A:  5...c5  6.e3  is hardly challenging.  6...cxd4  7.exd4  h6  8.Bh4  Nc6  Forcing white's knight to f3 before we play ...d5.  9.Nf3  d5  Fighting for the centre.  10.a3  Bxc3+ !  This is rare, but quite good. The solid, usual 10... Be7 is perfectly fine too.  11.bxc3   11.Qxc3  g5  12.Bg3  Ne4  =+  Black is definitely to be preferred here thanks to his initiative.  11...b6  =+  Black is probably for choice here, as he will have good play down the c-file soon.   B:  5...c5  6.d5  A pawn sacrifice recommended in 'Dangerous Weapons'.  6...d6  Black can go for the pawn after ...h6 followed by ...g5, but this is simpler and better.  7.O-O-O  White's main move here.  7...h6  8.Bh4  Bxc3  9.Qxc3  Ne4 !  Forcing exchanges.  10.Bxd8  Nxc3  11.bxc3  Rxd8  =+  With his good bishop and the doubled white c-pawns, black is definitely for choice in this endgame.  C:  6.dxc5  Na6  Just like after 5. Nf3, we want to recapture on c5 with our knight - from there it can maybe go to e4.  7.a3  White's main move.   7.Nf3  Nxc5  8.Nd2  Fighting for e4.  h6  9.Bh4  b6  10.a3  Bxc3  11.Qxc3  Bb7  =+  Black's lead in development gives him the edge.  7...Bxc3+  8.Qxc3  Nxc5  Black threatens ...Nce4 here of course.  9.Bxf6  White goes for an endgame where black's pawn structure is slightly damaged.   9.f3 ?!  This looks like a logical way to stop ...Ne4 ideas once and for all, but it is ineffective.  Nfe4 !  Hitting white's queen.  10.fxe4  Qxg5  =+  Only black can be better here.  9...Qxf6  10.Qxf6  gxf6  11.b4  Na4  The knight is least vulnerable here.  12.e3  b6  Preparing to develop our bishop.  13.Nf3  Ba6 =  Black has no problems in this endgame at all. Next we prepare ...d5 with ...Rfd8.   5.Nf3  White's most flexible choice. Our issue here is that the most natural move, 5... d5, allows white to transpose into a line which is outside our repertoire after 6. cxd5 exd5.  c5  Black's main move here, exploiting the poorly supported d4 pawn. As mentioned before, 5... d5 6. cxd5 would take us out of our repertoire.  6.dxc5  Supporting the pawn with 6. e3 is completely innocuous.   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.Qxc3  Taking with the pawn makes little sense with the queen on c2.  cxd4  8.Nxd4  d5  =+  Black's lead in development gives him a good position.  6...Na6 !  We plan to regain the pawn with the knight - from c5, the knight can fight for the e4 square.  7.g3  Fianchettoing the light bishop is white's most popular and probably best choice.   7.Bg5  Nxc5  transposes to 5. Bg5.   7.a3  Bxc3+  8.Qxc3  Nxc5 =  Black's lead in development gives him a comfortable game. Next he can develop his light bishop with ...b6.   7.Bd2  Planning to recapture on c3 with the bishop.  Nxc5  8.a3  Bxc3  9.Bxc3  Nce4  Unfortunately for white, the bishop on c3 gets eliminated quite quickly.  10.e3  Nxc3  11.Qxc3  b6 =  Black is comfortably equal here.  7...Nxc5  8.Bg2  Nce4  Aiming to double white's c-pawns.  9.O-O  Nxc3  10.bxc3  Be7  11.e4  d6  12.e5 !  White needs to open the position for his bishops.  dxe5  13.Nxe5  Qc7  14.Qe2  Bd6  This position has been reached nearly a hundred times, and now there is a split.  15.Bf4  Probably the most natural way to protect e5.   15.Re1  Nd7  Initiating exchanges.  16.Bf4  Nxe5  17.Bxe5  Bxe5  18.Qxe5  Qxc4 =  with complete equality.  15...Ne8 !  Planning ...f6.  16.c5  Qxc5  17.c4  f6 =  White has full compensation for the pawn, but nothing more.   5.e3  We can reach this position via the Rubinstein   4.e3  as well.  d5  should transpose to either one of the Rubinstein lines, or our mainline in this chapter within a few moves. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Of course, retreating isn't really an option - we have already lost too much time. }
6. Qxc3
{ Taking with the pawn is completely pointless - there is no need to even analyse it, since play is similar to 4. a3. In this position, thanks to black's flexibility, black can choose from a wide range of setups: light square strategies start with 6... b6, while dark square strategies begin with 6... d6. However, true to our repertoire theme, we will be playing }
6... d5
{ . This is only black's 4th most common move, however it has become the near-exclusive choice of the chess elite in recent years   sometimes  6...b6  is also played  . Black's idea is to stake out a claim in the centre and try to take advantage of our lead in development. Often, to do this we will be taking on c4, thus making white lose more time moving his queen. }
7. Nf3
{ Natural development.   7.cxd5 ?!  White captures on d5, removing the tension, before we have a chance to take on c4. This is white's 4th most common move here, and it isn't very challenging. The issue here for white is that our bishop comes alive.  Ne4  We can play in a number of other ways here, however this is the main move. Before recapturing on d5 with ...exd5, we throw in a little intermezzo so that white doesn't have the Bg5 pin available any more.  8.Qc2  The most natural option - and the best, but as we shall see, even on c2 the queen is not entirely safe.  exd5  We are free to develop our light bishop actively now seeing as the diagonal has been opened.  9.Bf4  Developing the bishop outside the pawn chain before playing e3.   9.e3  Bf5 !  Threatening ...Ng3 and gaining more time on white's queen.  10.Bd3  Qg5 !  Hitting the now-vulnerable g2 pawn.  11.Kf1  c5 !  ∓  Black's initiative has white under huge pressure.  9...Nc6  It seems a bit unusual to block our c-pawn like this, but keep in mind that we need to prioritise active play to keep our initiative. An interesting alternative here though is 9... Bf5.  10.e3  Re8  Setting up tactical ideas along the e-file based on ...Nxd4.  11.Nf3   11.O-O-O  is a common try of white's, getting the king off the e-file. However, white's king isn't very comforable on the queenside either, black's initiative has not fizzled out yet.  Bf5  Keeping up the pressure.  12.Bd3  Ne7  Protecting f5 and preparing ...c5.  13.f3  Nd6  14.e4  Ng6 !  A strong intermediate move.  15.Bxd6  cxd6  Our bishop is immune thanks to ...Rc8.  16.Ne2  dxe4  17.fxe4  Rc8  18.Nc3  Be6  ∓  Black's activity gives him a commanding advantage.  11...g5 !  Keeping up the pressure on white.  12.Bg3  g4  Again, forceful.  13.Ne5  Nxe5  14.Bxe5  c5  =+  Black retains his initiative with a good position. Possible ideas in the future are ...f6, ...Bf5 and ... Qa5+.   7.Bg5  White's most common choice and a very natural one. By pinning our knight white prevents the irritiating ...Ne4 hop.  dxc4  Luring white's queen to c4, where we can gain more time by attacking. 7... c5 is another decent option.  8.Qxc4  b6  The thematic follow up to ...dxc4. Our bishop heads to a6 to attack white's queen.  9.Rd1  White's only serious independent option here.   9.Nf3  Ba6  transposes to our mainline after 7. Nf3.  9...Ba6  Developing with tempo.  10.Qa4  White's more popular choice. The point is to pressure a6 so that black can't develop his knight.   10.Qc2  The queen has the advantage of supporting e4 from here.  h6  11.Bh4  Nbd7  12.e4  Bxf1  13.Kxf1  White has good control over the centre, but his kingside remains undeveloped and his king is still in the centre.  Qc8 !  Intending to activate the queen via a6, while also supporting ...c5.  14.Qc6 !  Blocking black from playing his ...c5 break.   14.Ne2  allows the immediate  c5 =  Black has fully equalised.  14...Qa6+  15.Ne2  Rac8  Preparing to kick white's queen back and play ...c5.  16.f3  Nb8  17.Qc2  Nbd7  The immediate 17... c5 is also good.  18.Kf2  c5 =  Black has good play here and approximate equality.  10...h6  Kicking the bishop back.  11.Bh4  Qe7  Freeing up d8 for our rook.  12.Nf3  Rd8  Black is now in a good position to play ...c5.  13.g4  is an interesting idea to develop white's bishop to g2, while simultaneously introducing the idea of g5.   13.e3  Bxf1  14.Rxf1  Nbd7 =  followed by ...c5 with full equality.  13...Bb7  Pulling the bishop back so we can develop our knigh.t  14.Bg2  Nbd7  15.O-O  c5 =  With the ...c5 break in, black has fully equalised.   7.e3  White wants to recapture on c4 with his bishop, but by playing e3 he blocks in his dark bishop, which makes his one advantage, the bishop pair, less effective.  b6  Black is satisfied with white's concession on the previous move - now we are simply planning to develop the light bishop to b7.  8.Nf3   8.cxd5  Nxd5  All the other recaptures are also decent options.  9.Qc2  Bb7  We will simply be playing for the ...c5 break.  10.Nf3  Nd7  11.e4  Ne7  Better than ...Nf6, due to e5.  12.Be3  c5 =  Black has no issues here at all.  8...Bb7  Natural development.  9.Be2   9.b4  White tries to pre-emptively prevent our ...c5 break.  a5 !  A novelty and quite a strong one. We try to open up the a-file while white is under developed.  10.c5  axb4  11.axb4  Rxa1  12.Qxa1  Nbd7 =  The closed nature of the position is ideal for our knights.  9...Ne4  10.Qc2  dxc4  11.Bxc4  c5 =  Black has equalised comfortably thanks to the ...c5 break. Next comes the natural ...Nd7. }
7... dxc4
{ We take on c4 to get white's queen to c4, so that we can later develop with tempo after ...b6 and ...Ba6. }
8. Qxc4 b6 { Preparing to play ...Ba6, developing with tempo. } 9. Bg5
{ Pinning our knight is the main move and a very natural one.   9.Bf4  Targeting our c7 pawn.  Ba6 !  Sacrificing the c7 pawn. Typically in this variation, black has more than enough compensation whenever white tries to greedily grab the c7 pawn.  10.Qxc7  Qd5  Black needs to avoid the trade of queens to keep his initiative.  11.Qc2  is perhaps a better try for white.   11.Qd6 ?!  White persists with the queen trade offer.  Qf5  We continue to decline the trade.  12.g4 !?  Qe4  =+  Grabbing the pawn loses to 13. Rg1. Black's activity here gives him full compensation for the pawn.  11...Rc8  Developing with tempo.  12.Qb1  Qb3  Threatening ...Nd5 followed by ...Rc2.  13.Nd2  Qa4 =  Attacking d4 with full equality.   9.g3  Quite a logical decision. White realises our bishop is headed to a6, so in order to preserve his bishop pair, white switches his own bishop to the long diagonal. Unfortunately for white, it is a bit slow, meaning that black has more than enough time to carry out the ...c5 break.  Bb7  10.Bg2  Nbd7  Preparing ...c5.  11.O-O  Bd5  12.Qa4  c5 =  Black has fully equalised with this thematic break. }
9... Ba6 { Developing with tempo. } 10. Qa4
{ White's more popular choice puts pressure on a6 so that our knight can't develop for now.   10.Qc2  The queen aids the e4 advance and hinders ...c5 from here.  h6  11.Bh4  Nbd7  Preparing .. .c5. The immediate 11... c5 is also often played.  12.e4   12.e3  Bxf1  13.Kxf1  c5 =  Black has fully equalised.  12...Qc8 !  We bring our queen to the queenside, where it can potentially attack e4 from b7.  13.Be2  Bxe2  14.Qxe2  Qb7 =  with pressure on e4, black is at least equal. }
10... c5
{ Black doesn't waste time trying to support ...c5 with ...Nbd7, so instead we break immediately. }
11. dxc5
{ 11.Rd1  b5  11... cxd4 is also possible, but perhaps this is even better.  12.Qc2  c4  13.e3   13.Bxf6  Qxf6  14.a4  Nc6  15.axb5  Bxb5 =  White can equalise with accuracy.  13...Bb7  14.Be2  Nbd7  15.O-O  Qb6 =  Black's queenside pawn majority gives black at least equal chances here. }
11... bxc5 12. Rd1
{ 12.Rc1  Hitting our isolated pawn.  h6  13.Bh4  Qb6  Protecting c5 and counter attacking b2. Black doesn't have to worry about Bxf6, since our king is safer than he looks.  14.Bxf6  gxf6  15.Rc2  Rd8  Activating the rook.  16.e3  Bxf1  17.Rxf1  Rd5  Our rook is well-placed here, protecting c5.  18.Ke2  Nc6  Developing our knight.  19.Rd1  Rad8  20.Rxd5  Rxd5 =  Black's activity compensates for his pawn weaknesses. }
12... Qb6
{ Just like after 12. Rc1, black is willing to accept a slightly damaged pawn structure and exposed king in exchange for quick development, piece activity and play on the queenside. }
13. Bxf6 gxf6 14. Rd2
{ 14.e3  is white's only real winning try, which means that it is surprising that it has only been twice.  Bxf1  15.Kxf1  Qxb2  Black can safely grab this pawn.  16.g3  White gets his king to safety and activates his rooks.  Qb7  17.Kg2  Rc8  18.Rd2  Nc6  19.Qf4  Kg7 =  And here a perpetual is white's best bet. }
14... Nc6 15. Qg4+ Kh8

5. cxd5
{ This is White's main independent option which differentiates 4... d5 from 4...O-O. Black needs to decide if he'd rather allow 5. e4 after 4...O-O or 5. cxd5 after 4... d5. While both 4...O-O and 4... d5 are very playable, 5. cxd5 seems a bit more theoretically challenging after 4... d5, which is why we opted for 4...O-O.  After   5.a3  Bxc3+  6.Qxc3  O-O  play would just transpose into lines covered in this chapter. }

{ This move is often referred to as the Classical Variation. It is the most challenging and topical variation of the Nimzo-Indian together with 4. e3, the Rubinstein Variation. White wants to avoid getting doubled pawns and keep the bishop pair after a3 ...bxc3+ without incurring the irritating doubled c-pawn. Another important characteristic of 4. Qc2 is that White can now play 5. e4 without losing a pawn, since the Queen on c2 supports the e4-pawn push.   All is not doom and gloom for Black, however. The issue with 4. Qc2 is that it does nothing to contribute to White's development. As a result, it is typical to reach positions in this variation where Black has a lead in development, while White has won the Bishop pair. In this situation, Black needs to play actively in order to keep the initiative and not allow White's pair of bishops to wreak havoc. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most popular choice. He remains flexible in the centre. Black does have two other good options though:     4...c5  exploits another consequence of 4. Qc2: the queen left d4 unsupported. This is a decent line, however it doesn't fit in with our ...d5 theme in this repertoire.     4...d5  is the most logical move for this repertoire in terms of our d5-theme. In fact, it is quite likely to transpose to our choice line with 4... O-O.     The reason we didn't go for this d5-push on the fourth move here is that this can lead to some sharp and unconventional lines after  4...d5  5.cxd5  exd5  6.Bg5.  Black often has to play ...h6 and ...g5, which is something we have tried to avoid in this repertoire. }
5. e4

1. d4 Nf6
{ In this chapter we will be dealing with white's various early deviations after 1. d4 - in other words, all white's options that are not a Nimzo-Indian, Ragozin or a Catalan. This means that options such as the Trompowsky, London and Veresov will be covered here. Naturally, we can't cover all of white's deviations in a single chapter, as there are simply far too many - however, we will recommend lines against the most common and most critical ones. Against any deviations not covered yet, common sense development should suffice for equality. After analysing the d4 deviations white can throw at us, it became apparent that it's best to go for lines which are low-theory, safe and solid. There's already enough theory as it is in the Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin without learning more against rare white tries. One of the difficult things about learning to counter many of these d4 deviations is the fact that white can switch up the move order very easily and there are plenty of transpositions. This is why we recommend, for this chapter especially, to pay more attention to the plans and development schemes we use. }

As a result, it is typical to reach positions in this variation where black has a lead in development, while white has won the bishop pair.

Qh4 is the main choice of most elite players who reach this position from the black side. It is probably a bit better objectively-speaking, but it can fizzle out to a draw quite quickly unfortunately. This line is quite sharp but the line is relatively forcing, so just pay attention to the theory here. }

1. d4 Nf6
{ In this chapter we will be dealing with white's various early deviations after 1. d4 - in other words, all white's options that are not a Nimzo-Indian, Ragozin or a Catalan. This means that options such as the Trompowsky, London and Veresov will be covered here. Naturally, we can't cover all of white's deviations in a single chapter, as there are simply far too many - however, we will recommend lines against the most common and most critical ones. Against any deviations not covered yet, common sense development should suffice for equality. After analysing the d4 deviations white can throw at us, it became apparent that it's best to go for lines which are low-theory, safe and solid. There's already enough theory as it is in the Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin without learning more against rare white tries. One of the difficult things about learning to counter many of these d4 deviations is the fact that white can switch up the move order very easily and there are plenty of transpositions. This is why we recommend, for this chapter especially, to pay more attention to the plans and development schemes we use. }
2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ 4. Qc2, often known as the Classical Variation, is the most challenging and topical variation of the Nimzo-Indian, together with the Rubinstein Variation   4.e3  . White wants to get the best of the both worlds in this variation: the bishop pair  (after a3 ...bxc3+)  without incurring irritating doubled c-pawns after bxc3. Another important characteristic of 4. Qc2 is that white can now play 5. e4 without losing a pawn, if white chooses to. All is not doom and gloom for black, however. The issue with 4. Qc2 is that it does nothing to contribute to white's development. As a result, it is typical to reach positions in this variation where black has a lead in development, while white has won the bishop pair. In this situation, black needs to play actively in order to keep the initiative and not allow white's pair of bishops to wreak havoc. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most popular choice. He remains flexible in the centre. Black does have two other good options though: 1.4... c5 exploits another consequence of 4. Qc2: the queen left d4 unsupported. This is a decent line, however it doesn't fit in with our ...d5 theme in this repertoire. 2.4... d5 is the most logical move for this repertoire in terms of our ...d5 theme. In fact, it is quite likely to transpose to our choice, 4... O-O. The reason we didn't go for this option is that it can lead to some sharp and unconventional lines after 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bg5. Black often has to play ... h6 and ...g5, which is something we have tried to avoid in this repertoire. }
5. e4
{ Grabbing the whole centre is certainly ambitious. Formerly quite a rare line, with the help of computer analysis it has become quite a formidable weapon. }
5... d5
{ The main move here. Black immediately starts chipping away at white's centre before he has a chance to solidify. This line can get a bit sharp, but black fully equalises if he knows some theory here. }
6. e5 { White lunges forwards of course. } 6... Ne4 7. Bd3
{ White's most common move, attack our knight. } 7... c5
{ Black should continue to attack white's unsupported centre. } 8. Nf3 cxd4
{ We remove the pawn supporting e5. } 9. Nxd4 Nd7 { Attacking e5. } 10. Bf4
{ Defending e5 is white's most common move by far. } 10... Qh4
{ Our other recommendation here is 10... Ndc5, which has the advantage of leading to a complex and unbalanced game with chances for both sides, which is why it was recommended. However, 10... Qh4 is the main choice of most elite players who reach this position from the black side. It is probably a bit better objectively-speaking, but it can fizzle out to a draw quite quickly unfortunately. This line is quite sharp but the line is relatively forcing, so just pay attention to the theory here. }
11. g3 Qh5
{ 11... Qh3 is another try but it's a bit more risky. 11... Qh5 has the simple idea of playing ...g5 next to boot the defender of e5 away. }
12. O-O g5 13. cxd5 Bxc3
{ 13... gxf4 is rarer and also a decent way to play, but this is the tried and tested route to equality for Black. }
14. bxc3 exd5 15. Bxe4 dxe4 16. e6
{ Counterattacking our knight. This leads to a flurry of exchanges that whimper out to a draw. }
16... gxf4 17. exd7 Bxd7 18. Qxe4 fxg3 19. fxg3 b6
{ followed by . ..Rae8 with a completely equal position. Incredibly, this position has been reached 42 times at the time of writing, with all 42 games drawn ! }

{ This move is often referred to as the Classical Variation. It is the most challenging and topical variation of the Nimzo-Indian together with 4. e3, the Rubinstein Variation. White wants to avoid getting doubled pawns and keep the bishop pair after a3 ...bxc3+ without incurring the irritating doubled c-pawn. Another important characteristic of 4. Qc2 is that White can now play 5. e4 without losing a pawn, since the Queen on c2 supports the e4-pawn push.   All is not doom and gloom for Black, however. The issue with 4. Qc2 is that it does nothing to contribute to White's development. As a result, it is typical to reach positions in this variation where Black has a lead in development, while White has won the Bishop pair. In this situation, Black needs to play actively in order to keep the initiative and not allow White's pair of bishops to wreak havoc. }

Qc2 is that White can now play 5. e4 without losing a pawn, since the Queen on c2 supports the e4-pawn push.   All is not doom and gloom for Black, however. The issue with 4. Qc2 is that it does nothing to contribute to White's development. As a result, it is typical to reach positions in this variation where Black has a lead in development, while White has won the Bishop pair. In this situation, Black needs to play actively in order to keep the initiative and not allow White's pair of bishops to wreak havoc. }
4... O-O
{ Black's most popular choice. He remains flexible in the centre. Black does have two other good options though:     4...c5  exploits another consequence of 4. Qc2: the queen left d4 unsupported. This is a decent line, however it doesn't fit in with our ...d5 theme in this repertoire.     4...d5  is the most logical move for this repertoire in terms of our d5-theme. In fact, it is quite likely to transpose to our choice line with 4... O-O.     The reason we didn't go for this d5-push on the fourth move here is that this can lead to some sharp and unconventional lines after  4...d5  5.cxd5  exd5  6.Bg5.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Key Points@@HeaderEnd@@
 This chapter deals with one of white's sharpest tries against the Nimzo: 4.f3. We also cover 4.a3, which is closely related.   Our plan here is to challenge white's centre with 4...d5 and then 6...c5.    The other key thing to remember here is to recapture on d5 with the knight and then meet 8.dxc5 with the important 8...f5!.   One other important thing to remember is how to meet the move order trick 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 O-O 6.f3. Trying to transpose to 6...d5 backfires after 7.cxd5 Nxd5 because our knight can get trapped after 8.e4. So instead of 6...d5, remember to play 6...Nc6!. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ In this chapter we will be covering the 4. f3 and 4. a3, since they both can transpose fairly easily. They both are both known as the Saemisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. }
4. f3
{ 4. f3 is one of the sharpest and most interesting variations in the whole of the Nimzo-Indian. It can lead to fresh and interesting positions, which are often quite sharp, from both black's ...d5 and ...c5 variations. White's idea is quite simple: he intends to take over the centre with e4, possiby with a3 ...Bxc3+ bxc3 thrown in.   4.a3  This move, as we've seen in the previous chapters, can pretty much be thrown in at any point. In most cases we will be taking the knight on c3, which results in white getting the bishop pair but also doubled c-pawns. Often what black wants to do in these situations, if possible, is block and immobilise white's centre  (typically with something like ...d6, ...c5 and ... e5)  and then play on the flanks and try to exploit the doubled c-pawns  (especially the weak and relatively exposed c4-pawn)  . As mentioned before though, our idea general strategy in this repertoire  (due to transpositions and coherence)  is to go for ...d5 setups. Because of these transpositions, we will cover ...d5 when white can force that setup to arise via a different move order - two specific examples are 5. a3 in the Ragozin and 4. e3 in the Nimzo followed by a3 at some point. Due to all these move order tricks, it might be easiest to boil it down to 3 main white setups:   1. White plays f3 at some point instead of Nf3. This will be covered in this chapter, but after 4. f3.  2. White develops his knight to f3 and his bishop outside the pawn chain to g5 before he plays e3. This will also be covered in this chapter.   3. White plays e3. This transposes to the Rubinstein Variation - 4. e3 - which was already covered.  Bxc3+  5.bxc3  O-O  This is the best option for our purposes since it is very flexible. We can play for a ...d5 or a ...c5 strategy depending on what white does.  6.f3 !  White's most common choice here with the idea of supporting the e4 advance. This is actually a rather unpleasant move order, since we can't simply transpose to our line against 4. f3 with 6... d5 since it can be met by 7. cxd5 and now 7... Nxd5 doesn't work because our knight gets trapped after 8. e4 Nxc3 9. Qb3. However, in this position black has a large amount of decent options. The main move is 6... d5 followed by 7... exd5, however this takes us out of our repertoire. The 2 main independent options are 7... Ne8 and 7... Nh5.7... Nh5 is a good choice which scores quite well, however it leads to unusual positions which are tricky to play  (for both sides)  and it is unclear if black fully equalises in all lines. As a result, we've opted for something a little different.   6.Nf3  d5  It is important to note that this position can also come from the Ragozin in Chapter 4   with  5.a3  . White only has 2 independent options here: 7. Bg5 and 7. cxd5   7.e3  transposes to the next chapter  . Black doesn't have too many issues here as long as he just develops naturally and plays ...c5. Typically the light bishop will be developed on the queenside after ...b6.  7.Bg5   7.e3  c5  We have transposed into a line we will be covering next chapter, after 4. e3.   7.cxd5  exd5  8.Bg5  h6  9.Bh4  Nbd7  10.e3  c5 =  with good play.  7...Nbd7  8.e3  c5  9.cxd5  Taking on d5 before developing the light bishop.   9.Bd3  dxc4  The standard way to take advantage of the bishop's development before taking on d5.  10.Bxc4  Qa5  11.O-O  b5  12.Bd3  Bb7 =  All of black's pieces have good squares and he has equalised comfortably.  9...exd5 =  with the . ..c5 break in, black has good play.   6.e3  Nc6  transposes to the first chapter.   6.Bg5  This seems active but it isn't challenging at all.  h6  7.Bh4   7.Bxf6  White can't really claim to have any advantage without his bishop pair, but black can start pushing for an edge.  Qxf6  8.Nf3  d6  Keeping the pawns on the dark squares is better with the light bishop remaining.  9.e3  b6  10.Bd3  Bb7  =+  Black has no problems here at all.  7...d6 !  Black has not committed to ... d5 and this flexibility allows us to place our pawns on the dark squares, which is better with a light bishop of course.  8.Nf3  Nbd7  9.e3  Supporting d4.   9.e4 ?!  9. e4 is a bit inaccurate since white should also try to keep white's pawns on dark squares.  e5  We close the position to neutralise white's bishops.  10.Bd3  c5  =+  After d5, closing the centre, black is able to get good play on the flanks.  9...b6  10.Nd2  Bb7  11.f3  e5 =  Black has developed soundly and has equalised.  6...Nc6 !  This is only black's 7th most common move, but it has been played by some strong players, most notably Ivanchuk. In this line we switch to a dark-squared strategy based on ...d6, ... b6 and possibly ...e5 or ...c5 with the idea of putting pressure on c4 by playing ...Ba6 and ...Na5. This line is quite rare  (with only around 40 games)  so it hasn't developed any significant theory and might still come as a surprise to your opponent. It has the advantage of being relatively simple to play, as black's moves generally following basic positional ideas - put the pawns on dark squares, keep the position closed, attack c4 etc. Objectively it is also very strong and probably one of black's best ways to equalise after 6. f3.  7.e4   7.Bg5  This has been played a few times, but 7. e4 is much more critical.  h6  8.Bh4  e5 !  9.e4  d6 =  White's bishop is misplaced on h4. Black's play will develop quite similarly to the line with 9. Bg5 - ...b6, ... Na5 etc. In some cases we might want to clamp down on the dark squares on the kingside with ...g5 followed by ...Nh5-f4.  7...d6  Another interesting option here which hasn't been tried yet is the very provocative 7... Na5 !?, but in many cases it will just transpose to our mainline.  8.Bd3  b6  With the idea of ...Ba6. Note that black wants to stay as flexible as possible, which means that ...e5 shouldn't be rushed. Often we would rather play ...c5 instead of ...e5.  9.Ne2   9.Bg5  White's most common move.  h6  10.Bh4  e5  11.Ne2  Na5  12.O-O  g5 !  An important idea to keep in mind here. We clamp down on the kingside, preventing white's f4 idea. White isn't able to exploit the apparent weakening of our kingside.  13.Bf2  Nh5  14.Qc2  Ba6 =  Black's position is already slightly preferable most likely, with good play against the c4 pawn, while white's idea is not clear.  9...Nd7  Staying as flexible as possible.  10.O-O  Na5  Beginning to target c4.  11.Ng3  Ba6  Attacking c4.  12.Qe2   12.f4  White ignores the attack on the c4 pawn and launches an attack on our kingside. This has only been tried 3 times, but it seems to be the critical test of 6... Nc6.  f5 !  This novelty seems to be black's best practical choice. Grabbing the pawn with 12... Bxc4 is also fine theoretically and has been played 3 times, however it seems like black has to do some defending in those lines, whereas after 12... f5 our position is simpler to play.  13.exf5  exf5  14.Nxf5  Bxc4  15.Re1  Kh8  16.Bxc4  Nxc4 =  The position is quite unusual, but balanced. Given the chance black would like to play ...d5 and ... Nf6.  12...c5 !  This is why we stay flexible and avoid playing ...e5 too early. In this case, where we are attacking c4, we play ...c5 with the idea of opening the c-file to put more pressure on c4.  13.Be3  Rc8 =  The position is balanced, but black's position seems more straightforward to play. If white ever goes d5, our knight gets the fantastic e5 outpost. }
4... d5
{ 4... c5 is the other big move here. It is a bit less common, but it is played by many top players  (especially recently)  and it scores well. However, the positions that 4... c5 leads to are quite unconventional and sharp, which is not in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. Instead, we will opt for 4... d5. This has the simple idea of directly stopping white's e4 advance for now. }
5. a3
{ Forcing the bishop to either take on c3 or retreat, with the purpose of clarifying the situation with the pinned c3-knight. By doing this, white is trying to make the e4 advance easier to carry out.   5.Bg5 ?  White tries to develop his bishop actively before blocking it in with e3, but this is a bad idea since his centre is not well supported.  h6  6.Bh4  Taking on f6, surrendering the bishop pair, doesn't challenge black.  dxc4 !  Grabbing the pawn here exploits white's vulnerable centre.  7.a3  White spends time to secure the d4 pawn  (after ...Bxc3+ bxc3)  before regaining the c4 pawn.   7.e4  Prepares to regain the c4 pawn, but it leaves d4 exposed.  c5  Hitting d4 immediately.  8.dxc5  White can't support d4 in a comfortable way, so this is somewhat forced.  Qa5 ∓  Black is far more active and has a clear advantage.  7...Bxc3+  8.bxc3  c5  Playing actively, attacking d4.  9.e3  Qa5  ∓  We keep up the pressure on white, so he doesn't get a chance to take on c4.   5.cxd5 ?  Grabbing on d5 before eliminating the pin on the c3-knight is a bad idea and allows black to get too much play.  Nxd5 !  Recapturing with the knight is best here since black can make use of the pressure on c3.  6.Qd3  Probably the more natural way to protect c3.   6.Qd2  It does seem a bit strange to put the queen here, but white's point is that the bishop can be developed to b2 or a3 after ...Bxc3+ bxc3.  Ba5  A useful move - prophylaxis against ... Nxc3 bxc3.  7.e4  Nxc3  8.bxc3  e5  =+  Black has strong pressure against white's centre.  6...Ba5  Again useful, pre-empting bxc3, attacking the bishop.  7.e4  Nxc3  8.bxc3  c5  9.Bd2  O-O  ∓  Once again, black has very good play against white's centre.   5.e3  O-O  6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  This reaches a structure/position that can arise from a variety of different lines, such as the Rubinsein   4.e3  , the 4. a3 Samisch, and of course the 4. f3 Samisch as well.  c5  Putting some pressure on the centre and preparing to develop the rest of the queenside.  8.cxd5  Logically undoubling the c-pawns.   8.Bd3 ?!  This is inaccurate. White should take on d5 before developing his bishop.  Qc7  This is the simplest way to exploit white's move order inaccuracy. There are a number of tactical issues white now has to deal with along the c-file.  9.cxd5   9.Qc2  Indirectly protecting c4 after ...cxd4 cxd4.  Bd7  Natural development.  10.Bd2  dxc4  11.Bxc4  Nc6  =+  Black has great play against white's centre and on the light squares.  9...cxd4 !  Tactics related to ... Qc3+ make this intermezzo better than the standard 9... exd5.  10.Ne2  Recapturing d4 loses material to ...Qc3+.  dxc3  11.Qc2  exd5  =+  White doesn't have full compensation for his pawn deficit.  8...Nxd5  Taking with the pawn is perfectly playable too, but just like in the mainline, we opted for the more dynamic knight recapture. It might seem like nothing, but the hanging c3 pawn gives white quite a few headaches.  9.Bd2 ?!  The most natural way to cover the c3 pawn, but after this white already has problems.   9.Ne2  Protecting c3, but blocking the bishop.  f5 !  Black's second most common move and an idea we will see much more of later. Black is trying to prevent e4.  10.g3  White needs to fianchetto to develop his bishop.  Nc6  11.Bg2  b6  =+  Black has good squares for all his pieces while white is still having issues developing, giving us the edge.   9.c4  By dealing with the issue of the hanging c3 pawn in this way, white has left his centre  (d4 in particular)  even more vulnerable.  Ne7  The knight can possibly head to f5 from here to put more pressure on d4.  10.Bd3  cxd4  We are trying to put as much pressure on d4 as possible.  11.exd4  Nbc6  12.Ne2  b6 =  White's hanging pawns are more of a weakness than an asset here, but white should be able to equalise.   9.Qd2  Quite an awkward way to defend c3.  Nc6  We are looking at playing the ...e5 break.  10.Bd3  e5 !  d4 is under a lot of pressure, so white must advance.  11.c4  Nb6  12.d5  e4 !  The key move and a very nice intermezzo. We sacrifice a pawn for a huge amount of positional benefits, most notably a fantastic e5 outpost for our knight.  13.fxe4  Ne5  =+  The doubled e-pawns, very weak c4-pawn and black's fantastic knights are more than enough compensation for the pawn.  9...Nc6  The most common move, but the engine's choice of 9... Qh4+, a novelty, was also worth considering.  10.Bd3  This is by far white's most common choice, but black's initiative almost gives him a decisive advantage within a few moves.   10.f4  Preventing ...e5 with this Stonewall-like move is the engine's top choice, but it has only been played once. Clearly white is fighting to equalise if he plays like this.  f6  Playing for the ...e5 break, but other plans are also possible.  11.Bc4  Na5  Chasing the bishop away before playig ...e5, since the immediate 11... e5 would lose to 12. e4.  12.Bd3  e5 !  Breaking down the Stonewall before white can finish developing.  13.fxe5  fxe5  14.Nf3  Taking the e5 pawn gives black a decisive kingside attack, so white must try get his king to safety as soon as possible.  exd4  15.cxd4  cxd4  16.exd4  Qe8+  17.Be2  Ne3  18.Bxe3  Qxe3  =+  The weakness of the isolated d-pawn gives black a lasting and comfortable edge.  10...cxd4  11.cxd4  Taking with the e-pawn has never been tried, but perhaps it is the better choice.  e5 !  After this break, white has serious problems and is clearly worse. He is far behind in development, his centre is falling apart and the king is still in the centre, and therefore in danger.  12.e4   12.dxe5  Less popular than 12. e4 and not much better.  Nxe5  13.Be2  Qf6  14.e4  Nb6  White still has no straightforward way to develop his kingside. This, together with black's development lead and white's exposed king give black a decisive advantage.  12...Nf4  13.Bxf4  exf4  14.d5  Perhaps it is best to just sacrifice the pawn and get the king to safety with 14. Ne2, but white is obviously clearly worse there too.  Ne5 -+  Although it might not be immediately apparent, white is already losing, simply because he is positionally bust. His bad bishop, chronically weak dark squares and undeveloped kingside combined with his exposed king are decisive. Even if there might not be a direct threat black has, white will be unable to castle, while black activates his pieces and creates a winning attack. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Retreating with the bishop is also played, but it is less common. } 6. bxc3
{ A very important position in this chapter since it can arise via both 4. f3 and 4. a3, which is also the reason for both of these moves being grouped into a single chapter. Most of this chapter is dedicated to analysing this position in greater detail. }
6... c5
{ Black needs to attack white's centre before he has the chance to fully develop. }
7. cxd5 { 7.e3  O-O  transposes to 5. e3. } 7... Nxd5
{ Taking with the pawn is also an option, but it leads to a very different kind of game. White tends to score better there, since he has time to solidify and build up his centre, which allows him to make use of his bishop pair in the long run. That is why the knight recapture is more common and probably objectively better as well. Black relies on his lead in development to put white under as much pressure as possible so that he doesn't have a chance to unravel. }
8. dxc5
{ The most popular move by far and the only one that can challenge black. White indirectly defends c3, since ...Nxc3 can be met by exchanging queens followed by Bb2, winning the g7 pawn. White also hopes that black spends time trying to recoup the c5 pawn, which will give white a chance to complete development and take full advantage of his bishop pair.   8.Qd2  The queen protects c3, but blocks the dark bishop.  O-O  9.e4  Nb6  Retreating to b6 has the advantage of being able to meet white's Bb2 with ...Na4.  10.a4  White's best bet is to march his a-pawn down the board. Otherwise, it is difficult for white to develop - d4 is surprisingly difficult to defend after simply ...Nc6.  Bd7  We switch targets and start attacking a4.  11.Bb5  Protecting a4, but this just moves the weakness to b5. On the upside though, white does manage to untangle his kingside.   11.a5  White lunges forward with his pawn, although this just leaves a5 weakened.  Na4 !  Cutting off protection to a5 and preparing to grab the pawn with ...Qxa5.  12.Bd3  Qxa5  13.Ne2  cxd4  14.cxd4  Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  b5  =+  White has some compensation for the pawn in the form of the bishop pair and good central control/activity, but he isn't fully equal.  11...cxd4  12.cxd4  Bxb5  13.axb5  f5 !  A typical break in these Grunfeld-style positions.  14.exf5  Allowing black to open the f-file is risky, so this is probably white's best bet.  Rxf5 =  With the weakness of b5 and d4, black is definitely a bit more comfortable here.   8.Qd3  Protecting c3 just like 8. Qd2, but this time white blocks the other bishop.  O-O  9.e4  Nb6  From b6 the knight can sometimes hop to a4 an also it can help create a knight outpost after ...Nc6-a5.  10.Be3  Nc6  11.dxc5  Grabbing the pawn rarely challenges black too much in this Grunfeld-type structure. Black usually gets full compensation against the doubled isolated c-pawns and is able to regain the lost pawn.   11.Be2  Natural development.  Na5  Planning ...Nbc4.  12.Nh3  Completing development and preparing to castle.  Nbc4  13.Bf4  White needs to try hold onto the bishop pair.  Bd7 =+  Black has good play on the queenside and especially the light squares. He can look at playing ...Bb5/...Ba4 next and getting his rooks to the c- and d-files.  11...Na4  12.Qxd8  Rxd8 =  Black has no problems in this endgame - ...Na5, ...Bd7, ...Rac8 etc. Soon we will recoup the c5 pawn with complete equality. }
8... f5
{ A funny-looking move but a good one. Even though it seems quite anti-positional and risky to play like this, many of the world's top players  (past and present)  have opted for 8... f5, including Karpov, Kortschnoj and Kramnik. The other option, 8... Qa5, is more popular but this scores quite a bit better in practice. Black's idea here is purely prophylactic. We ignore the c5 pawn for now and rather direct our focus to hamstring white's planned e4 expansion. By dissuading white from e4, black makes white's kingside development significantly more difficult than it already was. This position is a bit of a tabiya as well as the most important position in this chapter. It has been reached in around 370 games at the time of writing, with black scoring a solid 47% or so. White is behind in development and needs to find a way to untangle his kingside. His 4 main options, which we will analyse, are 9. Qc2, 9. e4, 9. c4 and the most popular move, 9. Nh3. }
9. Nh3
{ Developing the knight is white's most common choice, but it doesn't seem like white's most critical try. Most top players have been opting for one of the other options, which is a good indication that white needs to search elsewhere for an edge.   9.Qc2  White plays simply, covering c3 and preparing to play e4.  Nd7 !  This line was actually one of the trickiest to analyse. The two most common moves, 9...O-O and 9... f4, were analysed deeply, but black's position didn't seem to be 100% comfortable in either case. With accurate play, it seems like white retains the bishop pair and some pressure after 9...O-O while after 9... f4 white unravels his kingside quite easily   10.Bxf4  and might have a slight edge. 9... Nd7 is a bit rarer  (it is only the 4th most common move)  , but it scores relatively well and it got the backing of Kramnik is 2008 World Championship match against Anand. The idea is quite simply to regain the c5 pawn with ...Nxc5, but beyond that there is another idea, which is to gain control over e4  (after white inevitably plays e4)  and install a knight there  (. ..Nd5-f6-e4)  . With a knight on e4 it is very difficult for white to keep the bishop pair.  10.e4  The only move which has been tried. White kicks the knight away and prepares to develop the rest of his minor pieces.  fxe4  11.fxe4  N5f6  The only good retreat. We need our knight on f6 to pressurise e4.  12.Nf3  Natural development.   12.c6  White sacrifices his pawn back  (before it is recaptured with ...Nxc5)  in order to damage black's pawns structure.  bxc6  13.Nf3  Natural development is the only move which white has played so far.  Ng4 !  The knight controls the dark squares and can also head to the e5 outpost.  14.Be2  O-O  15.h3  White wants to chase the knight away since castling allows ...Qb6+.  Rxf3 !  Another purpose of the knight on g4 becomes clear: the weakened dark squares gives black ideas such as ...Rxf3 followed by ...Qh4+.  16.hxg4  Rf7 =  White's wrecked pawn structure and exposed king offset his bishop pair.  12...Nxc5  13.e5  Nfe4  Our basic plan from 9... Nd7 has been achieved: we have planted a knight on e4.  14.Bc4  A natural square for the bishop, putting pressure on e6.   14.Be3  Bd7  15.Bxc5  Nxc5  16.Bc4  O-O =  Without the bishop pair, white has no way to claim an edge.  14...O-O  15.O-O  Both players have got their kings to safety.  b6  The fianchettoed bishop will support the knight on e4 even more.  16.Be3  Qc7  17.Kh1  Bb7 =  Black's strong knights grant us full equality. White can't really utilise his bishops, meaning that sooner or later he will have to trade one of them for a knight, after which black has absolutely nothing to worry about.   9.c4  Kicking the knight away, but on the flipside this exposes the h8-a1 diagonal, which is something black can exploit. This is probably the least dangerous  (theoretically)  of white's 4 options.  Qf6  Black's other idea is to grab the c4 pawn with ...Qh4xc3 but it seems like white gets good play here.  10.Bd2 ?!  This is the most common  (and most natural)  way to defend the rook on a1, but it's not white's best choice.   10.Bg5 !  This is white's best bet, but it is significantly rarer than 10. Bd2.  Qxg5  11.cxd5  O-O  12.Nh3  Qe3  13.Qc1  Qe5  14.e3  exd5 =  Black has no problems here.  10...Nc3  11.Qc1   11.Bxc3 ?!  is simply quite bad.  Qxc3+  12.Kf2  O-O  ∓  Black's activity and white's exposed king give us a clear advantage.  11...Na4  12.Nh3  e5  13.e3  Nxc5  =+  Black seems to gave a slight edge here, thanks to his central control and extra space.   9.e4  Our previous move is designed to dissuade this, but white can of course play it anyway.  fxe4  10.Qc2  Since the immediate recapture isn't possible, white prepares fxe4 first with 10. Qc2. In effect, white hopes to transpose into the 9. Qc2 line, but we would be move order tricked into playing a different line than 9... Nd7.   10.fxe4 ??  is obviously a blunder because of  Qh4+  11.Kd2  Qxe4  -+  and black is just much better.  10...Qh4+ !  A good way to take advantage of white's move order and avoid the transposition trick after something like 10...O-O.10... Qh4+ is actually an engine suggestion and hasn't been tried in a game yet, but it is a good equaliser.  11.g3  Qh5  Hitting f3 of course, but the other idea behind the queen on h5 is to recoup the c5 pawn after moving the knight from d5.  12.Be2   12.fxe4  is perfectly natural.  Nf6  13.Be2  Qxc5  14.Nf3  O-O =  Black has regained the pawn with comfortable equality. The queen on c5 is a thorn in white's side, preventing him from castling.   12.Qxe4  leaves the queen a bit too exposed.  O-O  13.Ne2  Bd7 =  White still is quite far from unraveling his kingside and his queen is a bit misplaced.  12...Nf6  13.fxe4  Qxc5  This transposes to 12. fxe4.  14.Rb1  a6 =  Covering b5, with easy equality. }
9... Qa5
{ The other big move here is 9...O-O, but it seems like black has troubles equalising after 10. Nf4  (since we are saddled with an isolated d-pawn which gives white good long-term pressure)  . Recently, most top players have opted for this move instead. We have the option of grabbing either the c3 or the c5 pawn on the next move. }
10. e4
{ White's second most common choice, behind 10. Nf4.10. e4 allows white to develop his bishop and kicks our bishop away.   10.Qd2  Defending c3 and planning c4 on the next move.  Nf6  Prophylaxis against c4.  11.e3  O-O  12.c4  Qc7 =  with the idea of recapturing on c5 with the knight  (e.g. ...Na6xc5)  . White still has his bishop pair, but black has a slight lead in development and the c4 weakness to play against.   10.Nf4  White develops with the idea of exchanging the strong knight on d5. If black takes on f4, white gets to develop his bishop for free, while if black ignores the knight he will be saddled with an isolated d-pawn. This is white's most common move here.  Nc6 !  Black develops quickly without worrying about the isolated d-pawn. Note that black doesn't lose a pawn here because of black's ...Qxc3+.  11.Nxd5  exd5  12.Qd3  White's most common move here by far.   12.Be3  Saving the c5 pawn, but blocking in white's kingside.  Qxc3+  13.Kf2  d4  14.Bf4  Qxc5 =  White gets enough compensation for the pawn, but nothing more than that.  12...Qxc5  13.Bf4  O-O  14.e3  Be6  15.Be2  Rac8 =  The weakness of c3 and e3 offsets black's weak d5 pawn and bad bishop. Black should target the c3 pawn quickly with ... Na5 and be careful not to fall into the trap of defending d5 passively. It is easy to become worse here if you don't play actively and force white to defend his own pawn weaknesses. }
10... fxe4 11. Nf2
{ This is another way for white to offer the pawn sacrifice.   11.fxe4  This is the most obvious, as well as the most common, option at white's disposal, but it doesn't seem to challenge black much.  Qxc3+  Black has time to recoup his pawn.  12.Bd2  Qe5  13.Bb5+  Bd7  14.Bxd7+  Nxd7  15.O-O  N5f6 =  Grabbing on e4 is disastrous after 16. Ng5, but after the simple 15... N5f6 black has no problems at all - next he can castle with a good positions.   11.Ng5  This has been tried once, with the idea of sacrificing a pawn to get some active play and open lines for white's pieces.  Nf6 !  Black should ignore the pawn and just complete development. Taking on f3 gives white far too much play.  12.Be2  O-O  13.O-O  Qxc5+  14.Kh1  e3 =  White will regain the e3 pawn sooner or later, but by then black's pieces will be in the game. Black has no problems here and has achieved full equality. }
11... Nf6
{ Once again, black should decline the pawn and get on with development instead. }
12. fxe4 O-O 13. Qd4 { Trying to hold onto both pawns. } 13... Nc6 14. Qe3 Nd7
{ Targeting c5. } 15. Rb1 Qxc5 16. Qxc5 Nxc5
{ Black has regained the pawn with equality. White's poor pawn structure offsets his bishop pair advantage. }

White is behind in development and needs to find a way to untangle his kingside. His 4 main options, which we will analyse, are 9. Qc2, 9. e4, 9. c4 and the most popular move, 9. Nh3. }
9. Qc2 { White plays simply, covering c3 and preparing to play e4. } 9... Nd7
{ This line was actually one of the trickiest to analyse. The two most common moves, 9...O-O and 9... f4, were analysed deeply, but black's position didn't seem to be 100% comfortable in either case. With accurate play, it seems like white retains the bishop pair and some pressure after 9...O-O while after 9... f4 white unravels his kingside quite easily   10.Bxf4  and might have a slight edge. 9... Nd7 is a bit rarer  (it is only the 4th most common move)  , but it scores relatively well and it got the backing of Kramnik is 2008 World Championship match against Anand. The idea is quite simply to regain the c5 pawn with ...Nxc5, but beyond that there is another idea, which is to gain control over e4  (after white inevitably plays e4)  and install a knight there  (. ..Nd5-f6-e4)  . With a knight on e4 it is very difficult for white to keep the bishop pair. }
10. e4
{ The only move which has been tried. White kicks the knight away and prepares to develop the rest of his minor pieces. }
10... fxe4 11. fxe4 N5f6
{ The only good retreat. We need our knight on f6 to pressurise e4. } 12. Nf3
{ Natural development. } 12... Nxc5 13. e5 Nfe4
{ Our basic plan from 9... Nd7 has been achieved: we have planted a knight on e4. }
14. Bc4 { A natural square for the bishop, putting pressure on e6. } 14... O-O
15. O-O { Both players have got their kings to safety. } 15... b6
{ The fianchettoed bishop will support the knight on e4 even more. } 16. Be3
Qc7 17. Kh1 Bb7
{ Black's strong knights grant us full equality. White can't really utilise his bishops, meaning that sooner or later he will have to trade one of them for a knight, after which black has absolutely nothing to worry about. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ In this chapter we will be covering the 4. f3 and 4. a3, since they both can transpose fairly easily. They both are both known as the Saemisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. }
4. f3
{ 4. f3 is one of the sharpest and most interesting variations in the whole of the Nimzo-Indian. It can lead to fresh and interesting positions, which are often quite sharp, from both black's ...d5 and ...c5 variations. White's idea is quite simple: he intends to take over the centre with e4, possiby with a3 ...Bxc3+ bxc3 thrown in. }
4... d5
{ 4... c5 is the other big move here. It is a bit less common, but it is played by many top players  (especially recently)  and it scores well. However, the positions that 4... c5 leads to are quite unconventional and sharp, which is not in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. Instead, we will opt for 4... d5. This has the simple idea of directly stopping white's e4 advance for now. }
5. a3
{ Forcing the bishop to either take on c3 or retreat, with the purpose of clarifying the situation with the pinned c3-knight. By doing this, white is trying to make the e4 advance easier to carry out. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Retreating with the bishop is also played, but it is less common. } 6. bxc3
{ A very important position in this chapter since it can arise via both 4. f3 and 4. a3, which is also the reason for both of these moves being grouped into a single chapter. Most of this chapter is dedicated to analysing this position in greater detail. }
6... c5
{ Black needs to attack white's centre before he has the chance to fully develop. }
7. cxd5 Nxd5
{ Taking with the pawn is also an option, but it leads to a very different kind of game. White tends to score better there, since he has time to solidify and build up his centre, which allows him to make use of his bishop pair in the long run. That is why the knight recapture is more common and probably objectively better as well. Black relies on his lead in development to put white under as much pressure as possible so that he doesn't have a chance to unravel. }
8. dxc5
{ The most popular move by far and the only one that can challenge black. White indirectly defends c3, since ...Nxc3 can be met by exchanging queens followed by Bb2, winning the g7 pawn. White also hopes that black spends time trying to recoup the c5 pawn, which will give white a chance to complete development and take full advantage of his bishop pair. }
8... f5
{ A funny-looking move but a good one. Even though it seems quite anti-positional and risky to play like this, many of the world's top players  (past and present)  have opted for 8... f5, including Karpov, Kortschnoj and Kramnik. The other option, 8... Qa5, is more popular but this scores quite a bit better in practice. Black's idea here is purely prophylactic. We ignore the c5 pawn for now and rather direct our focus to hamstring white's planned e4 expansion. By dissuading white from e4, black makes white's kingside development significantly more difficult than it already was. This position is a bit of a tabiya as well as the most important position in this chapter. It has been reached in around 370 games at the time of writing, with black scoring a solid 47% or so.

9. c4
{ Kicking the knight away, but on the flipside this exposes the h8-a1 diagonal, which is something black can exploit. This is probably the least dangerous  (theoretically)  of white's 4 options. }
9... Qf6
{ Black's other idea is to grab the c4 pawn with ...Qh4xc3 but it seems like white gets good play here. }
10. Bg5
{ This is white's best bet, but it is significantly rarer than 10. Bd2. } 10...
Qxg5 11. cxd5 O-O 12. Nh3 Qe3 13. Qc1 Qe5 14. e3 exd5

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ In this chapter we will be covering the 4. f3 and 4. a3, since they both can transpose fairly easily. They both are both known as the Saemisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. }
4. f3
{ 4. f3 is one of the sharpest and most interesting variations in the whole of the Nimzo-Indian. It can lead to fresh and interesting positions, which are often quite sharp, from both black's ...d5 and ...c5 variations. White's idea is quite simple: he intends to take over the centre with e4, possiby with a3 ...Bxc3+ bxc3 thrown in. }
4... d5
{ 4... c5 is the other big move here. It is a bit less common, but it is played by many top players  (especially recently)  and it scores well. However, the positions that 4... c5 leads to are quite unconventional and sharp, which is not in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. Instead, we will opt for 4... d5. This has the simple idea of directly stopping white's e4 advance for now. }
5. a3
{ Forcing the bishop to either take on c3 or retreat, with the purpose of clarifying the situation with the pinned c3-knight. By doing this, white is trying to make the e4 advance easier to carry out. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Retreating with the bishop is also played, but it is less common. } 6. bxc3
{ A very important position in this chapter since it can arise via both 4. f3 and 4. a3, which is also the reason for both of these moves being grouped into a single chapter. Most of this chapter is dedicated to analysing this position in greater detail. }
6... c5
{ Black needs to attack white's centre before he has the chance to fully develop. }
7. cxd5 Nxd5
{ Taking with the pawn is also an option, but it leads to a very different kind of game. White tends to score better there, since he has time to solidify and build up his centre, which allows him to make use of his bishop pair in the long run. That is why the knight recapture is more common and probably objectively better as well. Black relies on his lead in development to put white under as much pressure as possible so that he doesn't have a chance to unravel. }
8. dxc5
{ The most popular move by far and the only one that can challenge black. White indirectly defends c3, since ...Nxc3 can be met by exchanging queens followed by Bb2, winning the g7 pawn. White also hopes that black spends time trying to recoup the c5 pawn, which will give white a chance to complete development and take full advantage of his bishop pair. }
8... f5
{ A funny-looking move but a good one. Even though it seems quite anti-positional and risky to play like this, many of the world's top players  (past and present)  have opted for 8... f5, including Karpov, Kortschnoj and Kramnik. The other option, 8... Qa5, is more popular but this scores quite a bit better in practice. Black's idea here is purely prophylactic. We ignore the c5 pawn for now and rather direct our focus to hamstring white's planned e4 expansion. By dissuading white from e4, black makes white's kingside development significantly more difficult than it already was. This position is a bit of a tabiya as well as the most important position in this chapter. It has been reached in around 370 games at the time of writing, with black scoring a solid 47% or so. White is behind in development and needs to find a way to untangle his kingside. His 4 main options, which we will analyse, are 9. Qc2, 9. e4, 9. c4 and the most popular move, 9. Nh3. }
9. e4
{ Our previous move is designed to dissuade this, but white can of course play it anyway. }
9... fxe4 10. Qc2
{ Since the immediate recapture isn't possible, white prepares fxe4 first with 10. Qc2. In effect, white hopes to transpose into the 9. Qc2 line, but we would be move order tricked into playing a different line than 9... Nd7. }
10... Qh4+
{ A good way to take advantage of white's move order and avoid the transposition trick after something like 10...O-O.10... Qh4+ is actually an engine suggestion and hasn't been tried in a game yet, but it is a good equaliser. }
11. g3 Qh5
{ Hitting f3 of course, but the other idea behind the queen on h5 is to recoup the c5 pawn after moving the knight from d5. }
12. Be2 Nf6 13. fxe4 Qxc5 { This transposes to 12. fxe4. } 14. Rb1 a6
{ Covering b5, with easy equality. } *

{ White's second most common choice, behind 10. Nf4. 10. e4 allows white to develop his bishop and kicks our knight away. }
10... fxe4 11. Ng5
{ This has been tried once, with the idea of sacrificing a pawn to get some active play and open lines for white's pieces. }
11... Nf6

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ In this chapter we will be covering the 4. f3 and 4. a3, since they both can transpose fairly easily. They both are both known as the Saemisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. }
4. f3
{ 4. f3 is one of the sharpest and most interesting variations in the whole of the Nimzo-Indian. It can lead to fresh and interesting positions, which are often quite sharp, from both black's ...d5 and ...c5 variations. White's idea is quite simple: he intends to take over the centre with e4, possiby with a3 ...Bxc3+ bxc3 thrown in. }
4... d5
{ 4... c5 is the other big move here. It is a bit less common, but it is played by many top players  (especially recently)  and it scores well. However, the positions that 4... c5 leads to are quite unconventional and sharp, which is not in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. Instead, we will opt for 4... d5. This has the simple idea of directly stopping white's e4 advance for now. }
5. a3
{ Forcing the bishop to either take on c3 or retreat, with the purpose of clarifying the situation with the pinned c3-knight. By doing this, white is trying to make the e4 advance easier to carry out. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Retreating with the bishop is also played, but it is less common. } 6. bxc3
{ A very important position in this chapter since it can arise via both 4. f3 and 4. a3, which is also the reason for both of these moves being grouped into a single chapter. Most of this chapter is dedicated to analysing this position in greater detail. }
6... c5
{ Black needs to attack white's centre before he has the chance to fully develop. }
7. cxd5 Nxd5
{ Taking with the pawn is also an option, but it leads to a very different kind of game. White tends to score better there, since he has time to solidify and build up his centre, which allows him to make use of his bishop pair in the long run. That is why the knight recapture is more common and probably objectively better as well. Black relies on his lead in development to put white under as much pressure as possible so that he doesn't have a chance to unravel. }
8. dxc5
{ The most popular move by far and the only one that can challenge black. White indirectly defends c3, since ...Nxc3 can be met by exchanging queens followed by Bb2, winning the g7 pawn. White also hopes that black spends time trying to recoup the c5 pawn, which will give white a chance to complete development and take full advantage of his bishop pair. }
8... f5
{ A funny-looking move but a good one. Even though it seems quite anti-positional and risky to play like this, many of the world's top players  (past and present)  have opted for 8... f5, including Karpov, Kortschnoj and Kramnik. The other option, 8... Qa5, is more popular but this scores quite a bit better in practice. Black's idea here is purely prophylactic. We ignore the c5 pawn for now and rather direct our focus to hamstring white's planned e4 expansion. By dissuading white from e4, black makes white's kingside development significantly more difficult than it already was. This position is a bit of a tabiya as well as the most important position in this chapter. It has been reached in around 370 games at the time of writing, with black scoring a solid 47% or so. White is behind in development and needs to find a way to untangle his kingside. His 4 main options, which we will analyse, are 9. Qc2, 9. e4, 9. c4 and the most popular move, 9. Nh3. }
9. Nh3
{ Developing the knight is white's most common choice, but it doesn't seem like white's most critical try. Most top players have been opting for one of the other options, which is a good indication that white needs to search elsewhere for an edge. }
9... Qa5
{ The other big move here is 9... O-O, but it seems like black has troubles equalising after 10. Nf4  (since we are saddled with an isolated d-pawn which gives white good long-term pressure)  . Recently, most top players have opted for this move instead. We have the option of grabbing either the c3 or the c5 pawn on the next move. }
10. e4
{ White's second most common choice, behind 10. Nf4. 10. e4 allows white to develop his bishop and kicks our knight away. }
10... fxe4 11. Nf2
{ This is another way for white to offer the pawn sacrifice. } 11... Nf6
{ Once again, black should decline the pawn and get on with development instead. }
12. fxe4 O-O 13. Qd4 { Trying to hold onto both pawns. } 13... Nc6 14. Qe3 Nd7
{ Targeting c5. } 15. Rb1 Qxc5 16. Qxc5 Nxc5
{ Black has regained the pawn with equality. White's poor pawn structure offsets his bishop pair advantage. }

 This chapter deals with 4.Bg5, known as the Leningrad, and other sidelines.   The main thing to remember here is to hit out at the d4 pawn with ...c5 after 4.Bg5. White typically respons with d5.   Black typically gets a very good Benoni structure with his bishop on b4.   Our idea here will be to put pressure on d5, as this pawn is often with, with moves like ...Qa5. In many variations we actually win this pawn. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3
{ The reason 3. Nf3 is often seen as more theoretically challenging is because it doesn't allow black to pin the knight on c3 with ...Bb4 like 3. Nc3 does. 3. Nc3 is far more direct - white is clearly planning to grab the whole centre with 4. e4. Black can fight for the e4 square using the 'classical' approach with 3... d5 or the 'hypermodern' approach with 3...Bb4. }
3... Bb4
{ By pinning the knight, black indirectly fights for control over e4. This is the Nimzo-Indian, named after Aron Nimzowitsch, who promoted the hypermodern idea of controlling the centre with pieces as opposed to pawns. The Nimzo-Indian is seen as one of the strongest defences available against 1. d4 and it has caused many players to switch to 3. Nf3 since it is such a tough nut to crack. One of the most appealing things about the Nimzo-Indian is its flexibility. Since black hasn't committed his pawns anywhere, he is able to choose from a variety of pawn structures and strategies - for example, black can go for a dark-squared strategy based on ... d6 and ...e5  (or ...c5)  or a light squared strategy with ...b6 and ...Bb7, but our play will mostly revolve around staking out our share of the centre by playing ...d5. We have chosen this strategy since it synergises perfectly with the Ragozin, meaning that many of the ideas, plans and even variations are transferable. In some cases where this clearly isn't the best way to play we will opt for something else, but otherwise we will stick to the ...d5 strategy in most cases. This chapter deals with white's smaller options in the Nimzo-Indian, as well transpositions into other chapters. }
4. Bg5
{ 4. Bg5, known as the Leningrad, is one of the first serious systems we will be examining against the Nimzo-Indian. White develops naturally, pinning our knight. White at the very least would like to get an improved version of 4. e3, with the bishop outside the pawn chain.   4.Nf3  is, in fact, the third most popular move, behind 4. e3 and 4. Qc2.  d5  transposes straight into the Ragozin, which we've been looking at in the previous 4 chapters.   4.Bd2  A standard idea we have seen throughout the other chapters with the idea of recapturing on c3 without doubling his pawns.  O-O  5.Nf3   5.e3  This doesn't have too much independent value and should just transpose to the mainline after  d5  6.Nf3  b6  transposing to 5. Nf3.   5.a3  White hurries to pick up the bishop pair.  Bxc3  6.Bxc3  Ne4 !  This is a nice and simple way to regain the bishop pair which white has just gained.  7.Qc2  Nxc3  8.Qxc3  b6  Developing the bishop on the long diagonal.  9.Nf3  Bb7  10.g3  d6  Putting the pawns on the dark squares makes more sense with a light squared bishop instead of the usual strategy of ...d5.  11.Bg2  Nd7  12.O-O  Nf6 =  Black has a bit less space, but all his pieces have good squares available since 2 sets of minor pieces have already been exchanged, which means that we have equalised here.   5.Qc2  This leads to very similar play to the main line - our general idea here is to play ...d5, ...b6 and then put our light bishop either on b7 or a6.  d5  6.e3  b6  7.Nf3  Ba6  8.a3  Bxc3  9.Qxc3  Nbd7  followed by ...c5 with equality.  5...d5  Note that this position can also be reached from the Ragozin, as we saw in the previous chapter.  6.e3  b6  The simplest way to get our light bishop into the game.  7.cxd5   7.Bd3  Bb7  8.O-O  White has one little trick up his sleeve here: Nxd5 ! is the threat.  dxc4  Dealing with the threat in the easiest way possible. Taking on c4 is often a good idea once white has already moved his light bishop.  9.Bxc4  Nbd7  10.Qe2  c5 =  Black has developed soundly and carried out the ...c5 break, equalising.  7...exd5  8.Bd3  Natural development is the name of the gam here for both sides. We'll be looking to play ...Bb7, ...Nbd7, ...Be7 and then go for the ...c5 break.  Bb7  9.O-O  Nbd7  10.Rc1  Be7  11.Be1  c5 =  Black has developed harmoniously and the game is roughly level.   4.Qb3  The rarest 4th move in this chapter. White wants to gain the bishop pair as quickly as possible, but the downside is that d4 loses some of its support. We exploit this fact in the same way as the last chapter.  c5  Just like in the last chapter.  5.dxc5  The logical follow-up to white's previous move - everything else is too passive or slow.   5.Nf3  d5  transposing to the previous chapter.   5.a3 ?!  Gaining the bishop pair, but this is simply too slow.  Bxc3+  6.Qxc3  cxd4  7.Qxd4  Nc6  =+  Black gains time on white's queen and the lead in development give black a slight edge.   5.e3  Blocking in the bishop pair like this is rarely good, and this is no exception.  Nc6  6.Nf3  d5  transposing to the previous chapter.  5...Nc6  Protecting the bishop and developing. There's no need to recapture the c5 pawn immediately since it isn't going anywhere - it's also useful to maintain the pin on white's knight.  6.Nf3  White's most popular move by far.   6.Bg5  Active, but not critical.  h6  7.Bxf6  Qxf6  8.e3  Bxc3+  9.Qxc3  Qxc3+  10.bxc3  Nb8 !  =+  Black is pushing here. This clever rerouting of the knight to a6 to regain the c5 pawn leaves white having to defend his weak c-pawns.  6...Ne4 !  We take full advantage of the pressure on the knight on c3. Regaining the c5 pawn isn't our priority, and instead we aim to damage white's pawn structure or gain the bishop pair.  7.Bd2  Nxd2  Picking up the bishop pair is always nice.  8.Nxd2  Bxc5  Now is a good time to recoup the pawn.  9.e3  O-O =  With the bishop pair, black cannot possibly be worse here.   4.g3  d5  5.Bg2  O-O  transposes into the Catalan, which is covered in Chapter 10. }
4... c5
{ This is one of the few times where we deviate significantly from the usual strategy of playing the solid ...d5, but that is because 4... d5 in this position is simply not good. After 4... d5 white is able to transpose into a Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation where black's bishop is badly misplaced on b4. Instead, 4... c5 is very good and exploits the drawbacks behind 4. Bg5. Black hits out at white's centre which is currently unsupported, and moreover, the most natural way for white to support the d4 pawn, with 5. e3, just doesn't work because of 5... Qa5 !. This forces white to head for a poor Benoni-type structure with 5. d5, as we shall see. }
5. d5
{ The only critical choice white has. The game is taken into a Benoni structure.   5.e3 ?!  This seems very natural, but it is a mistake. It's interesting to note that this is white's second most common move, having been played over 180 times !  Qa5 !  Attacking c3.  6.Nge2   6.Bxf6  leaves white on the verge of losing.  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  Qxc3+  8.Ke2  gxf6  ∓  6...Ne4  Black exploits the fact that the bishop is hanging.  7.Qd3 !  is white's only way to avoid becoming far worse, or lose outright. White exploits the fact that a knight on g5 would be trapped after h4.  d5  8.Bf4  cxd4  9.exd4  Nc6  =+  Black is definitely on the offensive here.   5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  h6  7.Bxf6  Qxf6  =+  White's poor pawn structure gives black an edge.   5.Nf3  h6  6.Bxf6  Qxf6  7.e3  b6 =  Black has no issues here.   5.dxc5  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  h6  7.Bxf6  Qxf6  =+  Noone would envy white's tripled c-pawns. }
5... d6 6. e3
{ An unfortunate necessity.   6.e4 ?!  is what white would like to play, but unfortunately it allows a simple counter, thanks to our active dark bishop:  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  h6 !  Forcing the exchange since otherwise e4 is hanging.  8.Bxf6  Qxf6  =+  White will be struggling for the rest of the game from here on, due to his bad bishop and weak, immobile pawn structure. }
6... exd5 7. cxd5 Nbd7
{ We reach a Modern Benoni structure where our active bishop on b4 makes all the difference. White will never really be able to get his play in the centre going, since we are targeting the d5 pawn which is very weak. }
8. Bd3
{ White develops normally, but with a disregard for the d5-pawn.   8.Bb5  White pins the knight to prevent picking up d5 with ...Nd7-b6xd5.  h6  9.Bh4  Bxc3+  10.bxc3  Qa5  Eliminating white's bishop pair.  11.Bxd7+  Nxd7  12.Ne2  O-O !  The key move to remember here. Black doesn't have to worry about losing the d6 pawn since the play he will get for it are more than enough compensation.  13.O-O   13.Be7  Going for the d6 pawn is a bit greedy and black does get more than enough play in return.  Re8  14.Bxd6  Nf6  15.O-O  Bg4 !  Black has strong pressure against both d5 and c3.  16.Bg3  Bxe2  17.Qxe2  Nxd5  =+  Black's activity here does give him the edge.  13...Re8  The best square for this rook in most Benoni structures and it also nips the Be7 idea in the bud.  14.Bg3  Ne5  =+  Black has a very nice Benoni structure and can look to expand later on the queenside. }
8... Qa5 { Hitting c3 and getting out of the pin. } 9. Ne2 Nxd5
{ Black wins a pawn, but white is prioritising his development and hoping for compensation in the form of activity and the bishop pair. }
10. O-O Bxc3 11. bxc3 c4
{ An important move to insert before grabbing the c3 pawn. It opens up the 5th rank, which results in a number of tactical ideas on the dark bishop on g5. Taking on c4 just blunders a piece to ...N5b6, of course. }
12. Bc2
{ 12.Bf5 ?!  This has been tried a dozen or so times.  O-O !  Simple and best.  13.Qd2  Nxc3  ∓  Black was already clearly better in 0-1  (44)  Yuneev,A  (2345)  -Dautov,R  (2535)  Daugavpils 1989. }
12... O-O { We should get the king to safety first before grabbing on c3. } 13.
Bh4
{ Getting the bishop out of the way and rerouting it to g3 later on where it can attack d6.   13.Ng3 ?!  This has been played almost as much as 13. Bh4, but it is not good. White is hoping to stir up a strong kingside attack with Qh5 but this is doomed to fail.  Nxc3  Black should take this pawn without fear and make white show what compensation he has.  14.Qh5  f5  Blocking the mate threats.  15.Be7  Rf7  16.Bxd6   16.Nxf5  Ne5  Black's minor pieces come to the rescue on the kingside.  17.Bxd6  Bxf5  Black is able to completely neutralise white's attack by force.  18.Bxf5  Nf3+ !  Continuing the exchanges.  19.Qxf3  Qxf5  20.Qxf5  Ne2+  21.Kh1  Rxf5  -+  White has ended up in a losing endgame where black's queenside pawns, especially the far advanced c-pawn, should decide the game in his favour.  16...Ne5  ∓  Black has a clear advantage. Taking on f5 will run into the same exchanging tactic with ...Nf3+ we saw previously against 16. Nxf5. }
13... Nxc3 14. Nxc3 Qxc3 15. Rc1 { Threatening Bxh7+. } 15... Qe5 16. Bg3
{ White needs to recoup at least one of his pawns here. } 16... Qe6 17. Bxd6
{ This is a bit more ambitious than taking on d6 with the queen, but it is probably no better.   17.Qxd6  White goes for the endgame.  Qxd6  18.Bxd6  Re8  19.Rfd1  Nb6 =  White will be able to recoup the c4 pawn, but will have nothing more than equality.  It doesn't seem like white has enough for the pawn here and it is far from easy to capture c4 as well. Black can look to continue with ...b5 and ...Nb6 or ...Nf6. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3
{ The reason 3. Nf3 is often seen as more theoretically challenging is because it doesn't allow black to pin the knight on c3 with ...Bb4 like 3. Nc3 does. 3. Nc3 is far more direct - white is clearly planning to grab the whole centre with 4. e4. Black can fight for the e4 square using the 'classical' approach with 3... d5 or the 'hypermodern' approach with 3...Bb4. }
3... Bb4
{ By pinning the knight, black indirectly fights for control over e4. This is the Nimzo-Indian, named after Aron Nimzowitsch, who promoted the hypermodern idea of controlling the centre with pieces as opposed to pawns. The Nimzo-Indian is seen as one of the strongest defences available against 1. d4 and it has caused many players to switch to 3. Nf3 since it is such a tough nut to crack. One of the most appealing things about the Nimzo-Indian is its flexibility. Since black hasn't committed his pawns anywhere, he is able to choose from a variety of pawn structures and strategies - for example, black can go for a dark-squared strategy based on ... d6 and ...e5  (or ...c5)  or a light squared strategy with ...b6 and ...Bb7, but our play will mostly revolve around staking out our share of the centre by playing ...d5. We have chosen this strategy since it synergises perfectly with the Ragozin, meaning that many of the ideas, plans and even variations are transferable. In some cases where this clearly isn't the best way to play we will opt for something else, but otherwise we will stick to the ...d5 strategy in most cases. This chapter deals with white's smaller options in the Nimzo-Indian, as well transpositions into other chapters. }
4. Bg5
{ 4. Bg5, known as the Leningrad, is the most serious system we will be examining in this chapter. White develops naturally, pinning our knight. White at the very least would like to get an improved version of 4. e3, with the bishop outside the pawn chain. }
4... c5
{ This is one of the few times where we deviate significantly from the usual strategy of playing the solid ...d5, but that is because 4... d5 in this position is simply not good. After 4... d5 white is able to transpose into a Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation where black's bishop is badly misplaced on b4. Instead, 4... c5 is very good and exploits the drawbacks behind 4. Bg5. Black hits out at white's centre which is currently unsupported, and moreover, the most natural way for white to support the d4 pawn, with 5. e3, just doesn't work because of 5... Qa5 !. This forces white to head for a poor Benoni-type structure with 5. d5, as we shall see. }
5. d5
{ The only critical choice white has. The game is taken into a Benoni structure. }
5... d6 6. e3 { An unfortunate necessity. } 6... exd5 7. cxd5 Nbd7
{ We reach a Modern Benoni structure where our active bishop on b4 makes all the difference. White will never really be able to get his play in the centre going, since we are targeting the d5 pawn which is very weak. }
8. Bd3 { White develops normally, but with a disregard for the d5-pawn. } 8...
Qa5 { Hitting c3 and getting out of the pin. } 9. Ne2 Nxd5
{ Black wins a pawn, but white is prioritising his development and hoping for compensation in the form of activity and the bishop pair. }
10. O-O Bxc3 11. bxc3 c4
{ An important move to insert before grabbing the c3 pawn. It opens up the 5th rank, which results in a number of tactical ideas on the dark bishop on g5. Taking on c4 just blunders a piece to ...N5b6, of course. }
12. Bc2 O-O { We should get the king to safety first before grabbing on c3. }
13. Bh4
{ Getting the bishop out of the way and rerouting it to g3 later on where it can attack d6. }
13... Nxc3 14. Nxc3 Qxc3 15. Rc1 { Threatening Bxh7+. } 15... Qe5 16. Bg3
{ White needs to recoup at least one of his pawns here. } 16... Qe6 17. Qxd6
{ White goes for the endgame. } 17... Qxd6 18. Bxd6 Re8 19. Rfd1 Nb6
{ White will be able to recoup the c4 pawn, but will have nothing more than equality. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Key Points@@HeaderEnd@@
 This is white's most popular response to the Ragozin, so it is important to know well.   The first thing to remember is to immediately attack white's bishop with ...h6.   Note that retreating the bishop to h4 is inaccurate, so white has little choice but to take on f6.   Pay special attention to 7.Qb3. It is a sideline, but quite critical. Take note of the proposed plan in that endgame: ...Nd7-f6, ...Bd7 and ...Rfc8 to take on c5.   Our idea in the mainline is to take on c4 and follow up with ...c5. Keep this idea in mind and pay special attention to when it is played: after 8.Rc1. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bg5
{ This natural developing move which pins black's knight is one of white's most critical tries. }
5... h6
{ This is the pure way to play the Ragozin. The Vienna-style 5... dxc4 was recommended by GM Pert in 'Playing the Ragozin', but those positions are of a very different nature to what we usually reach in this repertoire. The general philosophy in this repertoire will be to avoid, or at the very least delay, taking on c4 until it is necessary or the best concrete move. }
6. Bxf6
{ This is somewhat forced, for reasons explained after 6. Bh4.   6.Bh4 ?!  I think this is an inaccuracy and now with accurate play from black, white might even be the one fighting for equality.  dxc4 !  An important move to remember, as this is one of the only times we will be taking on c4 so early. The reason for this is the insertion of 5... h6 6. Bh4. If we took on c4 a move earlier, we would have transposed into a normal Vienna where white regains the pawn and gets decent play after 6. e4. If white tries the same idea now and plays 7. e4, this is met by ...g5 !, winning a pawn. As a result, the remaining options white has are relatively insipid.  7.e3  The most common. White is aiming to simply regain the pawn.   7.e4 ??  doesn't work on account of  g5  8.Bg3  Nxe4  -+  and white is just down a pawn.   7.a3  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  c5  8... b5 and 8... Nbd7 are also possible.  9.Bxf6  Qxf6  10.e3  O-O  11.Bxc4  b6  A typical way to develop the light-squared 'problem bishop'. It can now be activated on the long diagonal or possibly trade itself for white's bishop with ...Ba6.  12.O-O  Bb7 =  Black is at least equal.   7.Qa4+  This is a move which we'll be seeing much more of in the future. White can pretty much throw this in at any point - at least until we castle, with the idea of forcing our knight to c6. White reasons that the knight is a bit misplaced on c6, seeing as we usually want to play the ...c5 pawn break and the knight gets in the way. However, the knight's placement also has it's advantages - namely it supports the ...e5 pawn break, which we will typically be striving for in these situations.  7...Nc6  Forced.  8.e3   8.a3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  Qd5 !  It looks a little awkward to protect the pawn like this, but white is too slow to take advantage. We have the idea of reinforcing the c4 pawn further by playing ...b5 on the next move.  10.Bxf6  gxf6  11.Nd2  b5  Kicking the queen away and solidifying the c4 pawn.  12.Qc2  a6  =+  White has very little for the pawn.  8...Bd7  Threatening ... Nxd4.  9.Qc2  b5 !  An important idea to remember and a big advantage of having the bishop on b4 instead of e7. We can play ...b5 without preparation due to the pin on the knight on c3.  10.Be2  a6  11.O-O  Bd6 !  =+  A minor novelty - 11... Be7 has been played a dozen or so times, but 11... Bd6 contains the added idea of playing ...g5 at some point to force exchanges of the dark bishops. For example,  12.Rfd1  O-O  13.Ne4  g5 !  14.Nxf6+  Qxf6  15.Bg3  Rfd8  =+  With his extra pawn and well-developed pieces, white is the one fighting to find some compensation.  7...b5  8.a4  Hitting b5 immediately is critical.   8.Be2 ?!  Inaccurate, since after  Bb7  9.a4  can be met by  (a6 =+)  White doesn't have much compensation for the pawn.  8...c6  9.Be2   9.Nd2  Breaking the pin.  Bb7  10.axb5  Bxc3  11.bxc3  cxb5  =+  White lacks full compensation.  9...Bb7  10.O-O  a6  11.Ne5  Nbd7  12.f4  O-O  13.Qe1  c5  ∓  White has nothing for the pawn and is clearly worse. }
6... Qxf6
{ Black has managed to gain the bishop pair, at least temporarily  (before we have to take on c3)  . On the other hand, we have fallen a bit behind in development and d5 is more vulnerable than it was previously. }
7. e3
{ The most common move by a large margin.   7.Qa4+  Again provoking ...Nc6.  Nc6  8.e3  Very natural.   8.a3  Rare, but this can transpose to 8. e3 O-O 9. a3.  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  O-O  10.e3  This position has been reached nearly 50 times at the time of writing, but most of these were from the 8. e3 move order.  Bd7  Simple development with the threat of ...Nxd4.  11.Qc2  Rfd8  This move has only been played once, and it does look a bit funny putting the rook on this square. However, the d8 square is ideal for the plan we have in mind: ...dxc4, ...Na5 followed by ...c5.  12.Bd3  dxc4  13.Bxc4  Na5  Gaining a tempo on the bishop while freeing up the c-pawn.  14.Bd3  c5 =  Black is fighting for the initiative. All our pieces have good squares available and the ...c5 break gives black good play down the c- and d-files.   8.Ne5 ?  This move is overambitious and in most cases it simply doesn't work.  Bd7  9.Nxc6   9.Nxd7  does look promising, until you realise that the knight is trapped and we simply are up a pawn after  (Qxd4 ! ∓)  9...Bxc3+  10.bxc3  Bxc6  11.Qb4  dxc4  12.Qxc4  O-O-O  ∓  White has fallen very far behind in development and is in serious danger here.   8.cxd5  exd5  transposes to the next chapter dealing with 5. cxd5.  8...O-O  9.Be2  A natural developing move. The advantage e2 has over d3 is that white is not forced to recapture on c4 immediately after ...dxc4.   9.cxd5  exd5  transposes to the next chapter.   9.Rc1  White's idea is a typical one in these situations. He makes an improving/waiting move before developing his light bishop, hoping that black takes on c4 anyway, so that white basically gains a tempo compared to the mainline.  Qg6  Black's most common choice and another useful idea to keep in mind. White's bishop is tied down to the defence of the g2 pawn, leaving him with limited options on how to continue. He usually ends up trading queens on the next move, so if you'd prefer to avoid this, take a look at 9... Rd8 instead.   9...Rd8 !?  is another option if you prefer to leave the queens on the board.  10.cxd5  exd5  11.Be2  Bf8 =  10.Qc2  Qxc2  11.Rxc2  Rd8  The analysis looks like it could end here, with a simple '=' sign, but it seems like black has run into a few problems in practical games so it makes sense to go a bit deeper.  12.a3  Bf8  Keeping the bishop pair.  13.Nb5  The only critical move.  Bd7 !  Almost all the games from here have, understandably, continued with the natural 13... Rd7, protecting the pawn. However, black has a better option - because of some tactics, black doesn't need to protect the pawn and can just develop his bishop.  14.cxd5   14.Nxc7 ?  Taking the pawn can land white in a worse position.  Rac8  15.Nb5  dxc4  16.Bxc4 ??  White should instead play something else, like 16. Nc3, but black is already doing better there.  Na5 ! -+  Black wins a clean piece.  14...exd5  15.Nxc7 ?!  Once again, inaccurate, however natural play causes black no problems either.  Rac8  16.Nb5  Na5 !  17.Rxc8  Rxc8  Even though white seems to just be a pawn up, all of a sudden black has become very active and has quite a number of threats - most notably, ... Bxb5 followed by ...Rc1+ winning the rook.  18.Kd1  a6  19.Nc3  Bxa3 !  =+  Black has regained the pawn with a more active position.   9.Bd3  A normal move, but the disadvantage of this is that the bishop is now forced to recapture on c4 immediately.  dxc4  10.Bxc4  e5 !  A thematic central break. Black takes full advantage of the knight on c6 and the queen on f6.  11.O-O  White is too far behind in development to try to counter the central break in another way, for example, 11. d5 is met by ...e4.  exd4  12.Nd5  This knight hop sharpens the game for a few moves, but it fizzles out to equality quickly:  Qd6  13.Nxb4   13.a3  Be6 !  It's important not to waste time retreating the bishop and instead counterattack white's vulnerable knight. The fact that the bishop on c4 is unprotected after Nxb4 makes this riposte possible.  14.axb4  Bxd5  15.Bxd5  Qxd5  16.b5  Ne7  17.Nxd4  Nf5  18.Nxf5  Qxf5 =  Black has comfortably equalised.  13...Qxb4  Taking with the knight is also possible.  14.Qxb4  Nxb4  15.Nxd4  c5  16.Nf3  Be6 =  with equality.  9...dxc4  10.O-O  White is not obliged to recapture yet and can instead attend the safety of his king first. Of course, 10. Bxc4 would transpose to the 9. Bd3 variation.  Qe7 !  A rather rare idea, but it seems to be quite a clever and clean way to equalise. Black covers his bishop on b4, which means that black is threatening to play ...Na5 protecting his pawn. This forces white to make a decision regarding how to deal with c4.  11.Bxc4  The more obvious way to deal with the threat of protecting c4 is to simply take it first, but now black's other idea can be executed.   11.a3  White forces the trade of minor pieces on c3, simultaneously eliminating the idea of ...Na5.  Bxc3  12.bxc3  Qd6  Protecting the knight so that black can fianchetto his bishop with ...b6.  13.Qxc4  b6  14.Rfd1  Bb7 =  Black has a bit less space, but all his pieces have good squares and he has no weaknesses. He has equalised and in the future he can look to play either the ...e5 or the ...c5  (after ...Na5)  breaks.  11...Na5 !  Gaining a tempo on the bishop.  12.Bd3  Bxc3  13.bxc3  b6 =  followed by ... Bb7 with comfortable equality. Black has unravelled nicely and can continue to play for the ...c5 break in the future.   7.Qb3  Based on the analysis, this seems like one of white's more challenging tries after 5. Bg5. White attacks the bishop, just like 7. Qa4, but with the extra benefit of putting pressure on black's d5 pawn.  c5  The main move, but if the lines given here aren't to your taste you can also take a look at the simple 7... Bxc3+.  8.cxd5   8.e3  This should transpose to 8. cxd5 in most cases.  O-O  8... cxd4 is maybe a way to try exploit white's move order, but it makes no major difference objectively.  9.cxd5   9.a3  spending a tempo to force ...Bxc3+ isn't too challenging here.  Bxc3+  10.bxc3   10.Qxc3  After this black can basically just liquidate the centre and equalise:  cxd4  11.Qxd4  Qxd4  12.Nxd4  dxc4  13.Bxc4  Bd7 =  with complete equality.  10...dxc4  11.Bxc4  b6 =  Black will complete develop soon and equalise fully, as he has no weaknesses and all his pieces have good squares.   9.dxc5  Bxc3+  10.Qxc3  Qxc3+  11.bxc3  dxc4  12.Bxc4  Nd7 =  regaining the pawn with full equality.  9...exd5  transposing to 8. cxd5.  8...exd5  9.e3  As mentioned previously, this is the improved way to play the 9. dxc5 structure.   9.dxc5  This is an inaccurate way to reach the same structure as after 9. e3. The difference is the inclusion of the moves 9. e3 for white and 9...O-O after 9. e3 followed by 10. dxc5. This benefits white substantially, because as we will see in this line, black has a simple route to equality with 11... Na6 - which isn't possible after 9. e3 because white could play Bxa6.  9...Bxc3+  10.Qxc3   10.bxc3  O-O  11.Nd4  Covering the c3-pawn.  Be6  As is quite often the case in the Ragozin, black is willing to sacrifice the b7 pawn in exchange for quick development and threats.  12.Qxb7  Nd7  Black finds himself 2 pawns down, but white's exposed queen and lack of development compensate for this.  13.g3  Rfb8  14.Qc7  Qg6 !  Planning ...Rb1+.  15.Bg2  Rb1+  16.Kd2  Rb2+ =  with a perpetual.  10...Qxc3+  11.bxc3  We reach a fairly standard structure - which will be discussed a bit more after 9. e3 - for this variation. As mentioned earlier, black equalises easily here due to the lack of the inclusion of 9. e3 and 9...O-O. Black can recapture the pawn on c5 with ...Na6 since the bishop can't take on a6.  11...Na6 !  Recapturing this way is better than via d7 since it doesn't block the bishop. This is important because after something like 12. Rd1, we need to play 12... Be6.  12.e3  Nxc5  13.Nd4  Bd7 =  With the material balance restored and both sides possessing their respective pawn weaknesses on d5 and c3, the position is dead equal.   9.Qxd5 ??  Grabbing this pawn is very ill-advised - white can't hold onto it indefinitely, and black becomes very active. The queen becomes a massive target for black's minor pieces and attack almost plays itself. White needs to take care here not to lose right out of the opening. For example,  Nc6  The pin on the d4 pawn   ...Bxc3+  makes dxc5 impossible.  10.e3  Be6  11.Qe4  O-O-O  Getting the king to safety and activating the rook simultaneously.  12.Bb5  Bf5  13.Qh4  g5  14.Qg3  cxd4  15.Nxd4  Nxd4  16.exd4  Bd6  17.Qf3  g4  18.Qe2  a6  19.Ba4  Qxd4  ∓  Black's bishop pair and activity give him a near-winning advantage.   9.a3  Bxc3+  10.Qxc3   10.bxc3  Not the most challenging way to play - 10. Qxc3 is critical.  Qb6 !  10... c4 has been played a few times, but this could be a slight improvement.  11.Qxb6  Taking the d5 pawn is met by ... Qb2 !.  axb6  12.e3  Bf5  =+  Black is to be preferred as the a3-pawn is weak and black is a bit more active.  10...c4  A rare but strong move chosen by Carlsen. As we will see, the key to justifying this   after  11.b3  is to continue to play actively even though the c4 pawn might be vulnerable. Tactics work in black's favour here.  11.b3  White wants to weaken the support for the c4-pawn while black is unable to take on b3  (the bishop on c8 would hang)  .  Be6  12.bxc4  The critical try.   12.e3  A non-threatening try which poses black no problems.  O-O  13.Be2  White 'waits' for black to develop his knight to c6 so he can grab the c4 pawn.   after  13.bxc4  dxc4  14.Bxc4  Rc8 !  white loses material.  13...Nc6 !  And we oblige ! It does seem like we are simply losing a pawn here, but tactics work in black's favour.  14.bxc4  dxc4  15.Bxc4  Nxd4 !  The key move to remember. The knight clears the c-file in preparation for ... Rac8, regaining the piece.  16.Qxd4  Qxd4  17.Nxd4  Bxc4 =  with comfortable equality.   12.Ne5  Dreev's choice against Carlsen, but an inaccuracy.  O-O  13.e3  Nc6  14.Be2  Nxe5  15.dxe5  Qg6  16.O-O  d4  17.exd4  cxb3  =+  Carlsen had a healthy advantage and went on to win in 0-1  (32)  Dreev,A  (2648)  -Carlsen,M  (2827)  Tbilisi 2017 CBM 181  12...dxc4  13.e4  It looks quite scary for black here - the c4 pawn appears weak and white has an ideal centre. However things aren't so simple for white unfortunately.  O-O  White can't take on c4 on account of ...Rc8.  14.Be2  Re8  15.O-O  Nc6 =  The weakness of c4 is cancelled out by black's pressure against white's centre. White's centre turns out to be quite immobile and a bit of a weakness, in fact.  9...O-O  10.dxc5   10.Be2  is not dangerous at all:  Nc6  11.O-O  c4  12.Qa4  Rd8  =+  Black's bishop pair and space give him the edge.  10...Bxc3+  11.Qxc3  Qxc3+  12.bxc3  Black has scored well in practice, but it can be a little tricky to fully equalise here in engine analysis. I spent a while analysing a few plans here and am happy with what I came up with. Black's problem is that he is down a pawn - it does seem like he can regain that pawn quite easily, but the issue is that this gives white time to counterattack against black's weak d5 pawn. The other problem black has is that his minor pieces are tripping over each other - ...Na6 is not possible - because of Bxa6, and ...Nd7 blocks the bishop from coming to the defence of the d5 pawn with ...Be6. The solution is to take a bit of time - black needs to realise that the c5 pawn isn't really going anywhere. We have time to play ...Nd7-f6, followed by ...Bd7 and ..Rfc8. If white tries to hold onto the pawn with a Nd4-b3 manoeuvre, we can exchange it with ...Bd7-a4xb3 and then regain c5.  12...Nd7  The other big move is 12... Be6.  13.Rd1  Nf6 !  At the time of writing, the last move has only been played 4 times, but I think it is black's best plan to equalise without too many hassles. 13... Nxc5 was recommended instead in 'The Complete Ragozin' with the idea of sacrificing a pawn for activity and it is also a decent option. Our idea is instead to protect d5 with the knight and regain the c5 pawn with the rook. If the knight comes to b3 to protect the pawn, we will exchange it by playing Ba4xb3.  14.Nd4  White anticipates the assault on the c5 pawn and prepares to defend it with Nb3.   14.Bd3  does nothing to interrupt our plan of regaining c5.  14...Bg4 !  A nice move to eliminate the only possible defender of the c5-pawn.  15.h3  Bxf3  16.gxf3  Rfc8  17.Rb1  Rxc5  18.Rxb7  Rxc3 =   14.c4 ?!  was played once, but it isn't challenging.  14...Be6  15.Nd4  Rfc8  16.Nxe6  fxe6  17.cxd5  Nxd5 =  followed by doubling rooks on the c-file and taking c5, with equality.  14...Bd7  15.Nb3   15.f3  was GM Anton Guijarro's choice against GM Inarkiev.  Rfc8  16.Nb3  Ba4 =  transposes to our mainline.  15...Rfc8  16.f3  Ba4  Removing the defender of c5.  17.Rd4  Bxb3  18.axb3  Rxc5  19.Kd2  Ra5  20.Ra4  Rxa4  21.bxa4  Nd7 =  with a roughly balanced endgame.   7.cxd5  exd5  This transposition is covered in the next chapter.   7.Rc1  Rare and not good.  dxc4 !  White's time-wasting previous move affords us the chance to grab this pawn.  8.Qa4+  Nc6  9.a3  Bxc3+  10.bxc3  Qe7  Hitting a3.  11.Ra1  Otherwise ...Bd7 is very unpleasant.  O-O = }
7... O-O 8. Rc1
{ White follows the standard waiting strategy before developing his light bishop, to avoid losing a tempo after ...dxc4.   8.Qb3  c5  transposing to 7. Qb3 c5 8. e3 O-O.   8.Be2  is simply losing a tempo. 8. Bd3 is met in the same way.  dxc4  9.Bxc4  b6  10.O-O  Bb7 =  We have activated our problem bishop and equalised. Soon we will play the ...c5 break with good play. }
8... dxc4
{ The mainline. Alternatives do exist though, such as 8... c6, which are worth taking a look at, especially if you are desperate to avoid the simplified  (and equal)  positions which 8... dxc4 leads to. }
9. Bxc4 c5
{ Immediately challenging white's centre. White is a bit better developed, with more space and central control, but black's bishop pair offset this. }
10. O-O
{ The main move, which has been played around 250 times.   10.dxc5  This is the main alternative to 10. O-O. White hopes to gain some time by forcing black's bishop to recapture and then use his lead in development to get an initiative.  10...Nd7  The other, more common move is 10... Bxc5. However, it seems like black has to do a bit more work to equalise there than after 11... Nd7 - this is confirmed by the choice of most top players being 10... Nd7, including Carlsen.  11.O-O   11.c6  White converts his advantage in development into an isolated c-pawn for black, with the hope of getting a long-lasting edge this way. Black's bishop pair compensate for this weakness though.  bxc6  12.O-O  Ne5  13.Nxe5  Qxe5 =  The bishop pair offsets the isolated c-pawn. Black drew easily in -  (37)  Giri,A  (2790)  -Carlsen,M  (2863)  Shamkir 2015  11...Bxc3  12.Rxc3  Nxc5  13.Be2  b6 =  With the material balance restored and black having caught up in development, the position is completely equal.   10.a3  Bxc3+  11.bxc3  b6 =  followed by developing the light bishop with equality. }
10... cxd4 11. Nxd4
{ 11.Ne4  This intermezzo has been one of white's more recent attempts to pose black some problems here. White rejects any ...Bxc3 exchanges in the future and hopes to exploit the bishop's misplaced position.  Qf5  This has been played far fewer times than 11... Qe7, but it contains a couple of clever ideas and it also received the backing of Carlsen. Black will be putting his queen on a5 and retreating his dark bishop to f8 or e7 later, as opposed to after ... Qe7 when the bishop is finds itself lacking good squares.  12.Ng3  Qa5  13.exd4   13.Nxd4 ?!  allows black to equalise easily.  Rd8  14.Qg4  Nc6  15.Nxc6  bxc6  16.Rcd1  Bf8  17.Rxd8  Qxd8  18.Rd1  Qc7 =  Black's bishop pair ensures equality.   13.a3  Be7  14.exd4  Nd7  Bringing the knight to f6 where it can defend the kingside and cover d5.  15.Qe2  Nf6  16.Ne5  Rd8  17.Nf5  Bd6  Forcing some exchanges.  18.Nxd6  Rxd6 =  White's brief initiative has fizzled out and he is left with an IQP, while black is well-placed to neutralise it.  13...Rd8  Putting some mild pressure on the IQP.  14.Qe2  Nc6  15.Rfd1  Bd7  A neat little manoeuvre. The bishop is headed to e8 where it can protect the f7 pawn  (which is often targetted in kingside IQP attacks)  and also get out of the way of the a8-rook.  16.Qe4  Be8  17.d5  exd5  18.Bxd5  Bf8 =  Black's setup seems a bit passive, but he is well-placed to meet any aggressive white ideas. White has no advantage here.   11.exd4  Rd8  12.Ne4  Qe7  13.Qe2  Nc6  14.Rfd1  Ba5  15.Nc3  Bb6  16.d5  exd5  17.Qxe7  Nxe7  18.Nxd5  Nxd5  19.Bxd5  Rb8 = }
11... Bd7 12. Qb3
{ 12.Ne4  This is similar to 11. Ne4, with the caveat that the f5 square isn't available to black's queen, but the e5 square is.  Qe5  Once again this idea is far rarer than the more natural e7-square, but it seems to equalise even more easily.  13.Be2 !  A clever little tactic. The knight is indirectly protected by the idea of Bf3xb7.   13.Ng3  A natural move, but here black is already equal.  Nc6  14.Nc2  Rfd8  15.Nxb4  Nxb4  16.Qb3  a5 =  Black has no problems.   13.Bd3  Nc6  Developing and attempting to exchange minor pieces.  14.f4  Qa5  15.Nf6+  White can head for a perpetual like this.  gxf6  16.Qg4+  Kh8  17.Qh4  Kg7  18.Qg3+  Kh8 =  with a draw.  13...Rd8  14.Qb3  a5  15.Nc3  Nc6  16.Nf3  Qf6  17.a3  Bxc3  18.Qxc3  Qxc3  19.Rxc3  Be8 =  Black has no problems at all here. }
12... Nc6 { Developing and exchanging pieces. } 13. Nxc6 Bxc3
{ We simply vacuum the pieces off the board now and equalise. } 14. Rxc3
{ 14.Qxb7  is another way to reach a slightly different equal position:  Bxc6  15.Qxc6  Bxb2 =  Opposite coloured bishops and a near symmetrical pawn structure. }
14... Bxc6 15. Bb5 Bd5
{ Dozens of games have ended quickly in a draw this way. It seems like black has no theoretical problems in the mainline presented here, so white needs to search for deviations earlier to find something which can pose some theoretical challenges to the Ragozin with 5. Bg5. }

Qxf6
{ Black has managed to gain the bishop pair, at least temporarily  (before we have to take on c3)  . On the other hand, we have fallen a bit behind in development and d5 is more vulnerable than it was previously. }
7. Qb3

7... c5
{ The main move, but if the lines given here aren't to your taste you can also take a look at the simple 7... Bxc3+. }
8. cxd5 exd5 9. dxc5
{ This is an inaccurate way to reach the same structure as after 9. e3. The difference is the inclusion of the moves 9. e3 for white and 9...O-O after 9. e3 followed by 10. dxc5. This benefits white substantially, because as we will see in this line, black has a simple route to equality with 11... Na6 - which isn't possible after 9. e3 because white could play Bxa6. }
9... Bxc3+ 10. Qxc3 Qxc3+ 11. bxc3
{ We reach a fairly standard structure for this variation, which will be discussed a bit more after 9. e3. As mentioned earlier, black equalises easily here due to the lack of the inclusion of 9. e3 and 9...O-O. Black can recapture the pawn on c5 with ...Na6 since the bishop can't take on a6. }
11... Na6
{ Recapturing this way is better than via d7 since it doesn't block the bishop. This is important because after something like 12. Rd1, we need to play 12... Be6. }
12. e3 Nxc5 13. Nd4 Bd7
{ With the material balance restored and both sides possessing their respective pawn weaknesses on d5 and c3, the position is dead equal. }

{ Black has scored well in practice, but it can be a little tricky to fully equalise here in engine analysis. We spent a while analysing a few plans here and am happy with what we came up with. Black's problem is that he is down a pawn - it does seem like he can regain that pawn quite easily, but the issue is that this gives white time to counterattack against black's weak d5 pawn. The other problem black has is that his minor pieces are tripping over each other - ...Na6 is not possible  (because of Bxa6)  , and ...Nd7 blocks the bishop from coming to the defence of the d5 pawn with ...Be6. The solution is to take a bit of time - black needs to realise that the c5 pawn isn't really going anywhere. We have time to play ...Nd7-f6, followed by ...Bd7 and ..Rfc8. If white tries to hold onto the pawn with a Nd4-b3 manoeuvre, we can exchange it with ...Bd7-a4xb3 and then regain c5. }
12... Nd7 { The other big move is 12... Be6. } 13. Rd1 Nf6
{ At the time of writing, the last move has only been played 4 times, but I think it is black's best plan to equalise without too many hassles. 13... Nxc5 was recommended instead in 'The Complete Ragozin' with the idea of sacrificing a pawn for activity and it is also a decent option. Our idea is instead to protect d5 with the knight and regain the c5 pawn with the rook. If the knight comes to b3 to protect the pawn, we will exchange it by playing Ba4xb3. }

 This chapter is white's second most common choice, but it might be even more critical than the previous chapter.    Once again, we need to remember to immediately attack white's bishop with ...h6.   6.Qa4+ followed by 7.Ne5 is a little sideline, but it is good to keep in mind the clever response 7...a5 which works because white will get his queen trapped on c6 if he takes the 'free material'.   Our general plan in the mainline here is simple: we castle and develop our bishop to f5.    The main thing to keep in mind for this chapter is that black can often sacrifice the b7 pawn. If white's queen captures on b7, black often gets a big initiative and strong play down the newly-opened b-file, or an endgame with full compensation.   The main branching point here is on move 10. White can recapture with the pawn on c3 and try to grab some material, or recapture with the queen and play more positionally. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. cxd5
{ This is white's second most common move behind 5. Bg5 and it bears similarity to the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. Taking on d5 has the advantage of removing the hanging c4 pawn, thus preventing any of black's plans involving ...dxc4, but on the other hand it also opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for our light bishop. In this chapter we will try to take full advantage of this fact by developing our light bishop to f5  (or in a few cases, to g4)  . }
5... exd5 6. Bg5
{ The obvious choice - pinning black's knight and putting a bit of pressure on d5 indirectly. Black has tried a wide variety of systems and moves in this tabiya, but we will be recommend something which has become very topical recently since it seems to equalise without too many hassles.   6.Qa4+  White's second most common move behind 6. Bg5. We will see more of this idea in the next chapter, where white will play it without exchanging on d5. The point is to lure black's knight to c6, where it is a bit misplaced since it blocks the pawn on c7 from carrying out our standard ...c5 break.  Nc6  7.Ne5  The only decent independent option white has. He spends time with his knight in the hope of gaining our bishop pair.   7.Bg5  The most common move here, but it basically should just transpose to 6. Bg5.  7...h6  8.Bh4 ?  8. Bxf6 would transpose to 6. Bg5.  8...g5  9.Bg3  Bd7  =+  White's queen is badly misplaced and white is underdeveloped. This results in a number of threats which white cannot deal with too comfortably, such as ...Nxd4 and ...g4 followed by ...Nxd4.  7...a5 !  A nice, but very rare move which allows us to keep our bishop pair. The natural 7... Bd7 is also playable, but there is no need to surrender the bishop pair so easily. Black makes use of the fact that taking twice on c6 ends up getting white's queen trapped, so black isn't really sacrificing a pawn.  8.Nxc6   8.Bg5  White now actually does threaten to take on c6 - Nxc6 ...bxc6 Qxc6+ - since he can insert Bxf6 which allows white's queen to escape being trapped by taking on d5, for example: 9. Nxc6 ...bxc6 10. Qxc6+ ...Bd7 11. Bxf6 ...gxf6 12. Qxd5.  8...Qd6  Covering c6 and threatening ...Ne4.  9.Bxf6  Qxf6  =+  Black's lead in development gives him the more comfortable side of equality here.  8...bxc6  9.e3  Once again, taking on c6 results in white's queen getting trapped.  O-O =+  White has spent a lot of time creating a small concession in black's position  (the doubled c-pawns)  , but this has resulted in him falling behind in development. Black has a slight edge here.   6.Bf4  This move is quite far behind white's 2 most common moves, but it has had quite a few very strong players play it over the last few years. Play in this line does tend to become quite unorthodox, so it is important to pay attention to some of these lines.  Ne4  By choosing f4 over g5, white hasn't pinned our knight, which we can use to our advantage by activating it on e4.  7.Rc1  Natural, protecting c3.   7.Qa4+  This has been played once by Svidler, but it seems to simply be a worse version of the mainline where we put the knight on c6 in any case.  Nc6  8.Rc1  This position has been more commonly reached by 7. Rc1 followed by 8. Qa4.  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  g5  A thematic idea in this variation.  10.Bg3  h5  Continuing to harass white's bishop.  11.Ne5  Bd7  Black is doing well here, with the idea of playing ...h4 next trapping white's bishop.  12.Qb3  Hitting d5 and b7.  Nxg3  13.hxg3  Nxe5  14.dxe5  Bc6  =+  White's pawn structure is in disarray and he is behind in development.  7...Nc6  It might seem quite strange to play ...Nc6 without provocation, but it serves a couple of important purposes in this variation. It puts pressure on d4, which can be quite important later on, and additionally it covers the e5 square which matters since we will be kicking white's dark bishop around with . ..g5 later, and it would otherwise want to go to e5 possibly.  8.Nd2  Unpinning the knight and hurrying to exchange on e4.   8.g3  This has been played a few times, but it's not great.  Bf5 !  A natural developing move, with a hidden idea.  9.Bg2 ?!  White walks into the trap, but alternatives leave black with a slight edge too.  Nxc3 !  10.bxc3  Ba3  White loses the exchange.  11.Rb1  Bxb1  12.Qxb1  Rb8  ∓  8...g5  Chasing the dark bishop is thematic in this line, as we've already seen. White has tried 2 different development schemes here: 9. Be3 with the kingside fianchetto and 9. Bg3 followed by e3.  9.Bg3  The bishop on g3 allows us to grab a pawn, which we should, although white does get a good amount of compensation.   9.Be3  With the bishop on e3 instead of g3, we will need to continue harassing it with the f-pawn instead of the h-pawn.  Nxc3  10.bxc3  Ba3  11.Rb1  f5 !  Threatening ...f4.  12.g3  Bd6 =  Once again threatening ...f4, which white needs to parry. Objectively the position is roughly equal, but black seems to have the initiative.  9...Nxg3  10.hxg3  Nxd4  Not taking this pawn would leave black worse.  11.e3  Bxc3  Black has gained a pawn at the cost of weakening his kingside with ...g5 which puts his king safety in jeopardy. Over the next few moves we will be looking to either put the king on the kingside   g7  or queenside to take care of king safety.  12.Rxc3   12.bxc3  Ne6  The knight is well-placed here to assist on the queenside and kingside.  13.Rh6  Preventing h6.  Qe7  Black stays flexible - he could castle long with ... Bd7 and ...O-O-O or bring his king over to the kingside with ...Ke8-f8-g7.  14.Nf3  The knight on f3 blocks Qh5, so it is now safe for black's king to head to g7.  Kf8  15.Qxd5  Kg7  =+  With king safety in order, black is doing well.  12...Ne6  13.Rh6  Preventing h6.  c6  14.Bd3  Qe7  15.Kf1  Bd7  =+  Black has developed and white doesn't seem to have full compensation for the pawn.   6.Bd2  Very passive and non-critical. Bd2 makes little sense unless e3 is played or white wants to prevent the doubling of c-pawns.  O-O  7.a3  Bd6  8.Nb5  Be7 =  Black has equalised effortlessly.   6.Qc2  An interesting idea, with the point of taking control of f5 before we can develop our bishop there. Unfortunately for white, the downside is that the queen on c2 leaves the d4 pawn a bit shaky.  c5 !  Taking full advantage of the queen's absence from d1. 7. dxc5 is now impossible due to ...d4.  7.Bg5   7.e3  This is harmless, and black is at least equal after  c4  8.Be2  O-O =  7...cxd4  8.Nxd4  Nc6  9.e3  Nxd4  10.exd4  O-O =  Black has fully equalised.   6.Qb3  This has the same downside as 6. Qc2: the d4 pawn is unsupported.  6...c5  Other options exist, but it is best to cover this since it can be reached via Chapter 4 - 5. Qb3 c5 6. cxd5 exd5.  7.dxc5  Most common and critical.   7.Bg5  Nc6  8.e3  This is passive and quite bad, but the alternative, 8. dxc5, transposes to 7. dxc5.  8...c4 !  Taking on d4 is also possible, but black can try to get an edge with ...c4.  9.Qc2  h6  10.Bh4  O-O  =+  We reach a very good version of a typical Ragozin structure. Black should consider following up with ...g5 and ...Ne4.  7...Nc6 !  Black shouldn't be too hasty to take the pawn back - it's not going anywhere. Instead he should first focus on exploiting ...d4 threats.  8.Bg5  Putting pressure on d5. White has the clever idea of meeting ...d4 with O-O-O, pinning the pawn.   8.e3  White deals with the threat of ...d4, but this is quite passive.  O-O  9.Be2  Bxc5  10.O-O  a6 =  Black has the nicer side of this IQP position, since a number of white's pieces are misplaced  (most notably his queen)  . Black can equalise fully whenever he wants by playing ... d4.  8...Be6  Protecting d5 and threatening ...d4 once again.  9.O-O-O  O-O  10.e4  White heads for exchanges.  dxe4  11.Rxd8  The game fizzles out quite quickly with some exchanges.   11.Bc4 ?!  This has been played a few times, but it is a mistake - white should have gone for the equal endgame.  Qe7  12.Nd2 ?  Another error which has been played a few times. Better is 12. Bxe6, but black is already better anyway.  Qxc5  13.Bxf6  Na5  14.Qa4  Nxc4  -+  Black is winning here.  11...Bxb3  12.Rxa8  Rxa8  13.Nd2  Be6 =  We reach an equal endgame.   6.e3  Blocking in the bishop voluntarily can never be critical.  O-O  7.Bd3  Re8  8.O-O  Bg4 =  Black has equalised easily.   6.a3  a3 isn't as effective when our remaining light squared bishop  (which is usually our bad bishop)  is free to develop to f5.  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  O-O  8.Bg5  c5 =  Black is at least equal. }
6... h6
{ Much like in the previous chapter, the first step is to force white to make a decision with his bishop: will he save time and grab our knight, thus giving us the bishop pair, or will he rather retreat to h4 and give us the ...h6 move for free ? 7. Bh4 is slightly more common, but both have been played very frequently. }
7. Bh4
{ The more popular choice and probably also the more challenging one. Black has tried a wide of variety of lines here. We have gone for one which become quite popular amongst the top players recently and which seems to equalise fairly easily.   7.Bxf6  This is probably a bit less critical than 7. Bh4, and as a result it is also a bit less popular. However, this is an important line to know since it can be reached easily via Chapter 1 - 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bxf6. By giving up the bishop pair white gets a small lead in development, which he needs to exploit in order to try to get an edge. Otherwise, if black consolidates and finishes development he should be at least equal.  7...Qxf6  8.Qb3   8.Qa4+  This has become quite popular with the top players recently and it is second in popularity, behind 8. Qb3. It is an important line to know since it is often reached via 6. Qa4+. 8. Qa4+ is very logical here, since the knight is a bit misplaced on c6. We usually will want to reroute it to e7 later on.  8...Nc6  9.e3  Natural and best.   9.Rc1  This is played with the idea of recapturing on c3 with the rook so white can put pressure on the c-file, but this isn't the best use of white's tempo.  9...Bxc3+  10.Rxc3  O-O  11.e3  Ne7 !  An important idea to remember. White's whole idea has been to pin black's knight to the c7 pawn, but now it becomes clear that taking on c7 gets white's rook trapped.  12.Bd3  c6  13.O-O  Bf5 =  Black has fully equalised.   9.Ne5 ?  White's idea is to trade off one of black's bishops, but it wastes too much time to achieve this.  9...O-O  10.Nxc6  Bxc3+  11.bxc3  bxc6  ∓  White's undeveloped kingside and misplaced queen put him in serious danger. It is very difficult to unravel on the kingside and get white's king to safety.  9...O-O  10.Be2  White wants to avoid the trade of light bishops after 10. Bd3 Bf5.  10...Be6  Many other moves have been played, which are also decent options. All in all, black shouldn't have too many issues here, as long as he plays with a plan - the positions here aren't too forcing.  11.O-O   11.a3  Bxc3+  12.bxc3  a6 =  This is just one of many black ideas - he intends to play ...Rfc8, ...Rab8 and then possibly ...b5 and ...Na5. Another idea is to play 12... Nb8 with the plan of .. .Nd7 and ...c6.  11...a6  A very useful multi-purpose move. It secures the bishops retreat to d6 and also prepares a future ...b5.  12.Rfc1  Bd6  There's no need to give up the bishop pair now, especially with the rook able to recapture on c3.  13.Qd1  Ne7  Rerouting the knight to e7 is useful since in many cases it can aid in kingside play, but also it gets out of the way of the c-pawn.  14.Na4  Heading for c5.   14.a3  c6 =  Black is at least equal here, thanks to his bishop pair.  14...b6  Preventing Nc5. White has difficulties making progress on the queenside since c7 is basically invulnerable.  15.b4  g5 =  with good play on the kingside.   8.e3  This is too slow to challenge black.  c6  9.Bd3  O-O  10.O-O  Bg4 =  Black has equalised easily.   8.Rc1  Intending to recapture on c3 with the rook.  O-O  9.e3   9.a3  Bxc3+  10.Rxc3  White has eliminated black's bishop pair, but he doesn't have any pressure anymore.  c6 =  9...c6  10.Bd3  Bf5 =  is an easy way to equalise. Black can also try to keep both bishops with 10... Bd6 if he is more ambitious.   8.a3  This just wastes precious time.  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  O-O  10.e3  c5 =  Black has already fully equalised.  8...Qb6 !  Transposing to chapter 1 - 5. Bg5 - with ...c5 is also possible, but this is better.  9.e3   9.a3  wastes too much time too challenge black.  Bxc3+  10.Qxc3  Bf5  11.e3  O-O =   9.Qxd5  Black regains the pawn very quickly.  Be6  10.Qe4  Bxc3+  11.bxc3  Qb2  12.Rd1  Qxc3+  =+  White has to fight for equality here.  9...c6  10.Bd3  O-O  11.O-O  Bd6 =  Black has kept the bishop pair and equalised as a result. }
7... O-O 8. e3
{ 8.Qc2  has the usual disadvantage of leaving d4 without much support.  c5  9.e3  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nc6  Black is completely fine, for example:  11.Rd1  Bg4  12.Be2  Nxd4  13.Rxd4  Bxc3+  14.bxc3  Bxe2  15.Qxe2  Rc8 =  The weakness of c3 and d5 cancel out. }
8... Bf5
{ Nothing could be more natural than developing the bishop to f5, but this move only caught on recently. Black players were clearly worried about the loose b7-pawn after Qb3, but as we will see later, black can sacrifice this pawn and get good play. }
9. Qb3
{ The only critical move. White must try to exploit the bishop's development by attacking b7, else black's opening is a success.   9.Bd3  is exactly what black wants. White has no advantage without his light bishop.  Bxd3  10.Qxd3  Nbd7  11.O-O  c6 =  Black can pull his bishop back to d6 with complete equality. White cannot fight for an advantage without his light bishop.   9.Be2  White keeps his bishop at least, but its passivity on e2 doesn't aid white's cause. Black equalises here just as easily.  Nbd7  10.O-O  c6 =  We have reached what is, in effect, a very bad Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation for white. Getting the bishop to f5 is a huge victory for black. }
9... Bxc3+
{ This is an important junction in this chapter. Recapturing with the pawn is more common and it is also the critical test of 8... Bf5. By taking with the pawn, the queen continues to attack b7. It seems like there is no comfortable way to deal with this simple threat, but in fact black can sacrifice the pawn and get good play. Once white began to realise this, some top players began to try the queen recapture with the idea of playing with the bishop pair, but it seems like black is fine there as well. Overall, black seems to be doing well in this whole variation theoretically and in practice. }
10. bxc3
{ At first, it seems like black is in a bit of trouble since there is no convenient way to cover the threat against b7. Fortunately, there is no need to ! Black can develop and ignore b7.   10.Qxc3  White foregoes the pressure against b7 and instead is satisfied to play more simply with the bishop pair.  Nbd7  Our general plan is quite simple: we are going to play ...c6, and then aim to exchange pieces with ...Ne4.  11.Be2  c6  12.Nd2   12.O-O  g5 !  Black doesn't have to worry about exposing his king here since white has no way to exploit it.  13.Bg3  Ne4  14.Qb3  Qb6 =  White will lose his bishop pair shortly, meaning that black has fully equalised.  12...Ne4  13.Bxd8   13.Nxe4  Qxh4  White doesn't have much without the bishop pair.  14.Ng3  Bg6 =  Black has no problems here at all.  13...Nxc3  14.bxc3  Raxd8  Up until now we have been follow Le - Vidit. I think ...Raxd8 is a small improvement over ...Rfxd8 since the rook is useful on the f-file to curb white's kingside expansion  (with g4, etc.)  . It looks like black has equalised easily, but this is only partly true. Black needs to play with a plan here to avoid carelessly falling into a worse position. We will be aiming to equalise with the ...c5 or ...f5 break here.   14...Rfxd8 !?  I included the Vidit game in case you are interested how it went.  15.f3  Perhaps not the most critical - maybe 15. g4 was better.  c5  16.Kf2  Rac8  17.Rhc1  Rc7 =  Vidit equalised and actually went on to win here.  15.g4   15.a4  The a-pawn lever is a typical idea here.  Rc8  Preparing ...c5.  16.Nb3  c5  17.Bb5  b6 =  Black has equalised quite comfortably here.  15...Be6  16.Rg1  f5  Opening the f-file for our rook.  17.gxf5  Bxf5 =  Black is fine here. }
10... Nbd7
{ A very important move to remember. Black rushes to complete development, while ignoring the b7 threat. }
11. Be2
{ White wisely decides to leave the pawn on b7 until after he has got his king to safety.   11.Qxb7  This has only been tried once, at the time of writing, which just shows that white doesn't have much faith in the greedy pawn grab. Black simply becomes too active and gains too much time on white's queen. It is important to take a look at this line though since it is useful to be aware of black's attacking ideas here.  Rb8 !  Sacrificing another pawn.  12.Qxa7   12.Qa6  Qe7 =  with the same idea as after 12. Qxa7.  12...Qe7 !  Another accurate move. It might not be immediately apparent where black's compensation is, but once you examine this position for a while you realise just how careful white must be. For example, one of black's ideas here is to invade the second rank with ... Qe4-c2 and ...Rb2.  13.Be2   13.Bxf6  Nxf6  14.Ne5  White's idea is to block black's queen from joining the attack.  Ng4 !  Exchanging the defender.  15.Nxg4  Qe4 !!  A very nice move - black has enough threats to not have to worry about the piece.  16.f3  The only move - otherwise ...Qc2 is decisive.  Qc2  17.Be2  Bxg4  18.O-O  Qxe2  19.Rfe1  Qd2  20.Rad1  Qc2 =  And white secures the draw by 'perpetualing our queen'. He has no choice, since otherwise ...Rb2 wins.  13...Rb2 !  Preventing white from castling.  14.Ne5 !  White needs to give one of the pawns back just to get his queen back into the game.   14.Qa6 ?  White tries to castle while holding onto his material advantage, but this is just too greedy.  g5  15.Bg3  Nb6 !  with the idea of ...Ra8, trapping white's queen.  16.Bd3  Ra8  17.Qxa8+  Nxa8  18.Bxf5  Ne4  ∓  Black will soon pick up the a2 pawn  (with ...Qa3 and ...Rxa2)  and retain a clear advantage.  14...Nxe5  15.dxe5  Qxe5  16.Qd4  Qe6 =  Exchanging queens is also possible, but black has full compensation for the pawn here. }
11... c5
{ While white is getting his king to safety, black should get his queenside play underway with the standard ...c5 break. }
12. dxc5
{ This has been the choice of most of the top players to face this variaton, including Aronian, So and Grischuk.   12.O-O  Probably the most natural move and the most critical choice, together with 12. dxc5. White gets his king to safety and prepares to take on b7.  c4 !  Black still has no fear for the b7 pawn !  13.Qxb7  This must be critical, of course.  Qb6 !  Instead of playing for an attack - as in 11. Qxb7 - black now is going for positional compensation in the form of endgame pressure.  14.Qxb6  axb6  Black's pressure down the a-file and white's weak c3 and a2 pawns provide full compensation for the sacrificed pawn.  15.a4  White hopes that the a-pawn is more easily defended on a4, thanks to the idea of Bd1.   15.Nd2  The idea here is f3 followed by e4, while the knight is also poised to go to b1 to protect c3 if need be.  Ra5  16.f3  Rfa8  =+  Black is pushing here despite his pawn deficit.  15...Ne4  Keeping up the pressure on white's other pawn weakness.  16.Rfc1  g5  17.Bg3  Ra6  =+  Black will soon regain a4 with ...Rfa8 followed by ...b5 and definitely has the preferable side of an equal endgame.   12.Bxf6  This has been played a couple of times, but it isn't too challenging.  Nxf6  13.dxc5  Qe7 =  Black will soon regain c5 with equality.   12.Qxb7 ?  is even worse than on the last move, since our queen now enters the game with decisive effect.  Qa5 !  Hitting c3.  13.O-O  Rab8  14.Qa6  Qxa6  15.Bxa6  c4 !  White's problem now becomes clear - the bishop is trapped.  16.a4  Rb6  17.Bb5  Nb8  ∓  followed by ...a6, winning the bishop. }
12... Nxc5
{ The other move , which is slightly more common , is  12...g5  followed by 13... Nxc5. While both seem to equalise, 12... g5 has some extra complications after  13.Nd4  and we'd rather not play ...g5 until really necessary. }
13. Qb4 Rc8 14. O-O Re8
{ Play can go in a number of ways from here. The position is quite unbalanced, but equal - white's advantages here are the bishop pair  (for now)  and the d5 weakness, while black's advantages are the c3 weakness, good squares for his knights and the possibility to eliminate the bishop pair by playing ...g5 and . ..Ne4. }
15. Rfd1
{ White puts pressure on d5.   15.Nd4  Bd7  16.Rac1  b6  Ensuring that b7 will never be hanging.  17.c4  dxc4  18.Bxc4  g5  19.Bg3  Nfe4 =  Black has equalised comfortably - next he can play ...Qf6 and go for exchanges with ...Ne6. }
15... g5 { White was threatening Bxf6. } 16. Bg3 Nfe4
{ with the idea of ...Nxg3, eliminating the bishop pair. } 17. Rac1 h5
{ Threatening ...h4 of course. The position is still quite complex with chances for sides, but it is equal. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. cxd5
{ This is white's second most common move behind 5. Bg5 and it bears similarity to the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. Taking on d5 has the advantage of removing the hanging c4 pawn, thus preventing any of black's plans involving ...dxc4, but on the other hand it also opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for our light bishop. In this chapter we will try to take full advantage of this fact by developing our light bishop to f5  (or in a few cases, to g4)  . }
5... exd5 6. Bf4
{ This move is quite far behind white's 2 most common moves, but it has had quite a few very strong players play it over the last few years. Play in this line does tend to become quite unorthodox, so it is important to pay attention to some of these lines. }
6... Ne4
{ By choosing f4 over g5, white hasn't pinned our knight, which we can use to our advantage by activating it on e4. }
7. Rc1 { Natural, protecting c3. } 7... Nc6
{ It might seem quite strange to play ...Nc6 without provocation, but it serves a couple of important purposes in this variation. It puts pressure on d4, which can be quite important later on, and additionally it covers the e5 square which matters since we will be kicking white's dark bishop around with . ..g5 later, and it would otherwise want to go to e5 possibly. }
8. Nd2 { Unpinning the knight and hurrying to exchange on e4. } 8... g5
{ Chasing the dark bishop is thematic in this line, as we've already seen. White has tried 2 different development schemes here: 9. Be3 with the kingside fianchetto and 9. Bg3 followed by e3. }
9. Bg3
{ The bishop on g3 allows us to grab a pawn, which we should, although white does get a good amount of compensation. }
9... Nxg3 10. hxg3 Nxd4 { Not taking this pawn would leave black worse. } 11.
e3 Bxc3
{ Black has gained a pawn at the cost of weakening his kingside with ...g5 which puts his king safety in jeopardy. Over the next few moves we will be looking to either put the king on the kingside   g7  or queenside to take care of king safety. }
12. Rxc3 Ne6
{ Black's knight performs a vital defensive role here by controlling multiple key squares. }
13. Rh6 { Preventing h6. } 13... c6 { Supporting d5. } 14. Bd3
{ Exerting pressure on black's kingside. } 14... Qe7
{ A useful multi-purpose move. One benefit is that black can prepare long castling now. }
15. Kf1 Bd7
{ Black has developed and white doesn't seem to have full compensation for the pawn. The position is complex and black has a number of ideas here. }

13. Qd1 Ne7

[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Key Points@@HeaderEnd@@
 This chapter deals with 5.Qa4+. We have seen it this idea already in previous chapters.   Black's general plan will be to try and make use of the "misplaced" knight on c6. To do this, we will often take on c4, play ...Bd6 and follow up with the important ...e5 break.   Take note of the rather rare idea of 7...b6 we use to meet 7.Qc2, with the idea of playing ...Ba6.   If after we make the ...e5 break, White reacts with d5, then it is thematic to continue breaking down white's pawn chain with ...c6. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Qa4+
{ We have already encountered this idea a few times in the previous chapters. As mentioned already, white's idea is to force black's knight to c6, where it blocks the advance of our c-pawn  (thus preventing the standard ...c5 break)  . On the other hand though, the queen is a bit misplaced on a4 and we do get to develop 'for free'. Our plan will generally revolve around trying to make full advantage of the knight on c6 by playing for the ...e5 break. Typically black will play something along the lines of ...dxc4, ...Bd6 and ... e5 }
5... Nc6 { Forced, of course. } 6. e3
{ The most natural and most common move by quite a wide margin. White protects c4 as well as d4, but this comes at the cost of locking his bishop inside the pawn chain. His dark bishop will typically be developed to d2 now, where it is well-placed to recapture on c3.   6.Bg5  A natural move, but it simply leads to transpositions into chapter 1, for example:  h6  7.Bxf6   7.Bh4  dxc4  also transposes to chapter 1.  7...Qxf6  transposes to chapter 1.   6.Ne5  looks harmless, but can be tricky.  Bd7  The most natural response, but there are other ideas as well, such as 6... a5.  7.Nxd7  The only logical follow-up really. White needs to justify moving his knight repeatedly and losing some time by at least winning the bishop pair.   7.Nxc6  This doesn't really make sense in conjunction with white's last move - there isn't much point in spending 2 tempi just to exchange black's knight on c6. The only benefit white get here is that black is forced to take on c3, but this seems relatively minor. 7. Nxc6 has been played quite a few times surprisingly.  Bxc3+  This is forced, otherwise the bishop hangs.  8.bxc3  Bxc6  Recapturing the knight with tempo. Black's lead in development compensates white's bishop pair.  9.Qb3  White keeps c4 protected.   9.Qa3  with the idea of preventing black from castling, but this has the downside of leaving c4 undefended.  dxc4 !  Exploiting the hanging c-pawn.  10.f3  Planning e4.  a6 =+  followed by ... b5, securing the extra c4-pawn. White lacks full compensation for the pawn.  9...dxc4  10.Qxc4  O-O  =+  Black has a significant lead in development and white will lose more time with his queen exposed on c4. Black should play forcefully to take full advantage of his initiative with something like ...e5, before white can mobilise his bishops.  7...Nxd7  This is a bit rarer than the more natural 7... Qxd7, but it seems to lead to an easier path to equality. 7... Nxd7 has the idea of rerouting the knight to b6 with tempo, where it stands better than on f6. Also, because of the threat of ...Nb6 combined with . ..dxc4, our choice is more forcing than 7.. .Qxd7.  8.cxd5  White realises the c4 pawn was in danger  (due to ...Nb6)  and trades it off.   8.e3 ?!  Leaving the c4-pawn hanging like this is an inaccuracy and now black can start fighting for an edge.  Nb6  Hitting the queen and the c4-pawn.  9.Qb3  Other moves haven't been tried - it's clear white has virtually no compensation for the c4-pawn if he sacrifices it.  dxc4  10.Bxc4  Nxc4  White loses his one trump card, the bishop pair. Now he is left with a single bad bishop on c1, which black take advantage of.  11.Qxc4  Qd5 !  Forcing the exchange of queens, since 12. Qf1 is hardly playable. By exchanging the queens, as well as by having a pawn on d5  (which keeps white's pawns on dark squares)  , black fully exploits white's bad bishop on c1.  12.Qxd5  Bxc3+ !  A good positional move. Black further simplifies the position into one where he has a clean good knight vs bad bishop advantage.  13.bxc3  exd5  =+  Black's advantage here is nothing decisive of course, but he is far more comfortable and black has scored well above 50% in practical play here. White's bad bishop and weak light squares give black plenty of things to target. Black should consider employing the ...f5-f4 lever later on to create some more weaknesses in white's camp.  8...Nb6  A nice intermezzo, attacking white's queen and protecting d5.  9.Qb5  As can be seen after 9. Qd1 ?, white needs to keep the pin on the knight on c6 so that the d4-pawn does not fall.   9.Qd1 ?  Looks quite natural, but this in fact loses a pawn.  Nxd5  White needs to protect c3 somehow.  10.Qd3  White seems to be holding everything together, but...  Nxd4 ! ∓  is a clever little tactic that just wins a pawn. After 11. Qxd4 ? black wins with 11... Nxc3.  9...a6  Kicking the queen back.  10.Qd3  Qxd5 !  Taking with the knight and the pawn is also possible, but this looks best. Our idea is to set up a piece blockade on the central light squares.  11.a3  Bxc3+  So far black has tried 11... Qa5 and 11... Qb3, which also seem like decent options.  12.bxc3  f5 !  We begin our light-square blockading strategy. White is prevented from freeing up his position and kicking our queen away by playing e4.  13.e3  White threatens c4 now.  Na5 ! =  Taking c4 under control and once again preventing white from activating his bishops. Although white has the bishop pair here, they have both been effectively neutralised. Black can continue with short-castling and then execute either the ...c5 or ... e5 break.   6.a3  Forcing black to make a decision regarding his bishop on b4.  Bxc3+  The critical test of 6. a3 - black shouldn't be forced to waste time retreating his bishop to e7.  7.bxc3  Ne4  8.Qc2   8.Bb2  White defends the c3 pawn, albeit in a very passive way.  Bd7  Threatening ...Nxd4.  9.Qc2  Nd6 !  We begin to target the white's weak light squares - the c4-square in particular. Our knights are going to close in on the c4 outpost with ...Nd6-c4 and ...Nc6-a5.  10.c5  Taking on d5 is also possible, but white has the same problems there, with the extra issue that black can develop his light bishop to f5.  Nc4  11.e3  N6a5  =+  Black has achieved a dream position out of the opening. Both of his knights are on good squares, while white's bishop pair is completely neutralised.  8...Na5 !  Black should follow the same strategy as after 8. Bb2: target the c4 outpost.  9.e3  O-O  10.Bd3  b6  With the idea of developing the light bishop. The bishop can either apply more pressure to c4 from a6, or it could protect the knight on e4 from b7.  11.cxd5  White exchanges on d5 before black has the change to play ...Ba6, after which white would be fighting to equalise since he'd be left with only his bad bishop after the light squared bishops get exchanged.  exd5  12.O-O  A natural move, which is the only move which has been played in this position so far.   12.Bxe4 ?  Grabbing the pawn on e4 is too greedy and just leads to problems for white on the light squares.  dxe4  13.Qxe4 ?!  Ba6  ∓  Black's dominance on the light squares gives him a clear advantage. The fact that white hasn't castled and that there are opposite coloured bishops on the board exacerbate the dangerous situation that white is in.  12...Re8  =+  Black is at least equal here, and probably has a slight edge on account of both his knights having good squares available and white's bad dark bishop. Black can possibly look to continue with ...Bf5, ...c5 and ...f6  (if white tries Ne5)  .   6.cxd5  exd5  transposes to chapter 2.   6.Bd2  White secures the knight and prevents the doubling of his c-pawns after ...Bxc3.  dxc4 !  White is playing rather slowly though and has neglected the c4 pawn. We can exploit this hanging c-pawn and, with some accurate play, make it difficult for white to recoup the pawn.  7.e3  Protecting d4 and preparing to regain the c4-pawn.  Bd7  Keeping up the pressure on white. ...Nxd4 is threatened.  8.Qc2  Na5  Covering the c4-pawn like this looks a bit awkward, but it is difficult for white to exploit, and moreover the c4-pawn is becoming a real thorn in white's side.  9.Ne5  White decides to recoup the pawn as quickly as possible.   9.Be2  White takes the approach of ignoring the c4-pawn for now and rather decides to complete development first.  O-O  10.O-O  c5  Carrying out one of black's standard equalising breaks.  11.dxc5  Bxc5  12.Rfd1  Bc6 =  Black has comfortably equalised.  9...O-O  10.Rd1  Prophylactic play against black's planned ...c5 break.  Be8 !  A prophylactic move, but a very mysterious one which you have to analyse in some depth in order to understand. One of white's ideas here is to play a3, kicking our dark bishop back to e7. After that if white plays Ne4, our knight on a5 is hanging. Ideally black would want to play ...c5 to defend the hanging knight with his queen, but this wouldn't be possible with the bishop on d7, because the queen on d8 would be overloaded. In a nutshell, ...Be8 is important just to remove the pressure white has on it from the knight on e5.  11.Nxc4  White wastes no time in regaining his pawn.   11.a3  Be7  Taking on c3 and surrendering the bishop pair unnecessarily is poor of course.  12.Ne4 ?  Hitting the knight on a5.  Nxe4  13.Qxe4  c5 !  ∓  Black is doing very well here, but 13... c5 wouldn't be possible with the bishop still on d7.  11...Nxc4  12.Bxc4  Rc8  Preparing the ...c5 equaliser.  13.Ne4  Bxd2+  14.Rxd2  Nxe4  15.Qxe4  c5 !  Black achieves his standard equalising break. b7 isn't really hanging because of ... Bc6.  16.O-O  cxd4  17.Qxd4  Bc6 =  Black has completely equalised. }
6... O-O 7. Bd2
{ White's most common move by a wide margin. He plays the typically waiting game and delays the development of his light bishop.   7.Qc2  This is white's second most common choice, behind 7. Bd2 and it is a logical one. White is trying to find useful, improving moves before developing his light bishop so he does not waste a tempo after ...dxc4.7. Qc2 is useful, since typically black plays ... Bd7 threatening ...Nxd4, after which the queen is forced to move anyway. White reasons that the queen has done its duty on a4 by luring the knight to the supposedly inferior c6 square, and now can return to the more natural c2 square.  b6  Black has tried a wide variety of moves here, all of which have been played by a number of top GMs. The most popular choices have been 7... dxc4 and 7... Re8, both of which are perfectly logical and lead to quite different games. However, our choice, 7... b6 tries to take full advantage of the consequences of white's queen retreat. Without the queen on a4 attacking our knight  (or a6)  , we intend to develop the bishop to a6 so that it can be exchanged with white's good bishop  (in some cases the bishop can also simply go to b7)  . The two most notable players to opt for 7... b6 have been Grischuk and Fressinet, but a number of other strong GMs have played it as well.  8.a3  White's most popular choice here.   8.cxd5  A logical choice to prevent black's plan of ...Ba6, exchanging the light bishops. On the other hand, taking on d5 is also a concession since it opens the c8-h3 diagonal and e-file for our bishop and rook respectively.  exd5  9.Bd3  If white does not occupy this diagonal, we will, by playing ...Ne7 and ...Bf5.  Bg4  Taking full advantage of the newly opened diagonal and threatening to double white's f-pawns.  10.Bd2  Re8  Taking on f3 now would be premature since white hasn't committed his king to the kingside.  11.O-O  White hopes that the doubled f-pawns will not be so bad and that he can make use of the open g-file.  Bxf3  12.gxf3  Ne7  Rerouting the knight to g6 is an important idea here to neutralise white's pressure on both the g-file as well the h7-b1 diagonal. Also, from g6 the knight typically goes to h4 to aid black's kingside attack.  13.Kh1  Ng6 =  Black has a fine position. He should look at playing the ... c5 break next.   8.Bd2  A typical developing move in this position. White plays the usual waiting game with regards to the development of his light squared bishop.  a5  Taking on c4 would be premature since white has not moved his light bishop yet, so we also play an improving move in the meanwhile. The idea behind ...a5 is quite clever - it secures the a6 square for our bishop, so that we can exchange light bishops even in the event of white exchanging on d5.  9.cxd5  exd5  10.Bd3  Ba6  Achieving our goal of exchanging light bishops, which leaves white only with his bad bishop.  11.Bxa6  Rxa6  12.O-O  Ra8  The downside of the exchange was that our rook became misplaced on a6, so it needs to be redeployed to c8 at some point.  13.a3  Bxc3  14.Bxc3  Qd7 =  White's bishop on c3 makes it difficult for him to generate any real play.   8.Be2 ?!  Ba6  9.cxd5  Bxe2  10.Qxe2  exd5  =+  8...Bxc3+  9.Qxc3  Ba6  10.b4  White decides to get his queenside play underway as quickly as possible at the cost of allowing us to trade light bishops.   10.b3  White supports c4 so that he can retain his light bishop for now.  Na5  Putting some pressure on c4, but more importantly clearing the path for the ...c5 break which is coming.  11.Qc2  With the idea of Bd2xa5.  Rc8  12.Bd2  c5  With the ...c5 break achieved, white's centre is under quite a bit of pressure and he needs to display some accuracy to equalise.  13.dxc5  dxc4  14.Bxa5  cxb3  15.Qxb3  Bxf1  16.Kxf1  bxa5 =  With the vulnerability of c5, black has the more comfortable side of equality here.  10...dxc4  11.Bxc4  Ne4 !  A nice little intermezzo.  12.Qc2  Bxc4  13.Qxc4  Qd5 !  The queen trade fully equalises for black.  14.Qxd5  exd5 =  White's bad bishop makes it impossible to fight for an advantage here.   7.Bd3  This can be met in the same way as 7. Be2.  dxc4  transposing to 7. Be2.   7.Be2  White develops normally, but this is hardly challenging.  dxc4  Since white has already expended a tempo moving his light bishop, it is the right time for us to take the c4 pawn.  8.Bxc4   8.a3  Bd6  There's no need for black to give up the bishop pair here. The bishop can rather be used to prepare the ...e5 break.  9.Bxc4  e5 !  Immediately challenging white's centre.  10.d5  Ne7  11.e4  Supporting d5 and allowing the dark bishop to develop.  Bd7  12.Qc2  Rc8 =  The rook is well-placed on c8 to support our long-term goal of carrying our the ...c6 break. Black's play here is quite straightforward with a simple plan, whereas finding a good idea for white is more difficult. Black is at least equal.  8...a6  Although it isn't a threat yet, ...b5 is a useful idea to have available at some point.  9.O-O  Bd6  Preparing the ...e5 break.  10.Qc2  e5  As usual, once black achieves this break under decent circumstances, you can be fairly certain that he has equalised.  11.dxe5  This seems a bit timid, but it is white's safest bet.   11.d5 ?!  This is the standard response to an ...e5 break, but in this case it doesn't concretely work out too well for white.  Nb4 !  exploiting the queen's placement on c2 by gaining some time.  12.Qb1  e4 !  12... c6 is another solid option where black equalises comfortably, but the 12... e4 pawn sacrifice seems to pose white more problems.  13.Nxe4  Nxe4  14.Qxe4  Re8  Developing with tempo and kicking white's queen back.  15.Qb1  Only move.  Bg4  It's quickly becoming evident that white's lack of development and black's pair of bishops pointing towards white's undefended kingside could spell trouble for white in the near future.  16.Bd2  White tries to remedy his lack of development as quickly as possible. Other moves like 16. Nd4 give black a strong kingside initiative after 16... Qh4.  Bxf3  17.gxf3  Bxh2+ !  Black of course can already secure a draw here with a perpetual, but his position is more than promising enough to play on. White will need to play more accurately than black to fully equalise. Another decent option here is 17... Qh4 immediately.  18.Kxh2  Qh4+  19.Kg2  Qxc4  =+  White's exposed king gives black a distinct edge.  11...Nxe5  12.Nxe5  Bxe5 =  Black has fully equalised.   7.a3  As before, spending a tempo to force the capture on c3 isn't white's most challenging try.  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  Re8  We once again are playing for the ... e5 break here.  9.Be2  Bd7  Threatening ...Nxd4.  10.cxd5  Taking on d5 is logical since it does not allow black the chance to make the ...e5 break. It also has the additional benefit of preventing the ...Nxd4 threat, since the queen can cover d4 now. However, exchanging on d5 has the downside of activating black's bishop and rook.   10.Qd1  Dealing with the ...Nxd4 threat, but falling even further behind in development.  Na5 !  Taking advantage of the fact that c4 is very difficult to protect without the queen on a4.  11.Ne5  c5  =+  Black has good play while white still needs to find a way to develop his problem piece, the dark bishop.  10...exd5  11.O-O  Ne4  =+  Black is at least equal here. }
7... dxc4
{ Black has some other options here, but it turns out that if black continues waiting then white's 8. a3 could be a little irritating now. Instead black resolves to carry out the ...e5 break as quickly as possible, and the first step in preparing it is to take on c4 in order to remove the central tension. }
8. Bxc4 Bd6
{ Black pulls back the bishop with the plan of ...e5 next. This is probably the most critical junction in this whole chapter, and white has half a dozen decent options at his disposal. }
9. Qc2
{ White pulls his queen back to a more natural square. White's idea is to meet .. .e5 by taking it, since he is better poised to do so with his queen on c2. This seems to be white's most topical choice at the moment, but black doesn't have too many problems here either.   9.O-O  The most common move, but it is not the most challenging and allows black to carry out his ...e5 break unhindered.  e5  10.d5  Taking on e5 is hardly challenging.  Ne7  11.e4  The most natural move, supporting d5.   11.Qc2  Bg4  12.Ng5  Bf5  13.e4  Bg6 =  Black seems to have achieved a slightly better version of the normal structure, since his minor pieces put pressure on e4. Soon ...c6 will be played and white has no advantage to speak of.  11...Bg4  Developing with tempo by threatening ...Bxf3.  12.Be2  c6 !  Black immediately follows up by exchanging white's restrictive d5 pawn before white can support it further.  13.dxc6  Nxc6  14.Be3  Qe7 =  Black has equalised. He can follow up later by bringing his rooks to the central files and playing ...a6  (to prevent any b5 intrusions and maybe also plan ...b5 at some point)  .   9.Nb5  In his book, GM Pert considers this to be white's critical choice and and an improved version of 9. O-O, but it seems like black can equalise here quite easily since Nxd6 is not a serious threat.  Bd7 !  GM Pert recommends 9... Be7 but this seems unnecessary, since 10. Nxd6 isn't dangerous at all. We transpose into a kind of Exchange Slav structure where too many minor pieces get exchanged for black to face any difficulties.  10.Nxd6  This should be critical, of course.   10.Qb3  This doesn't really offer any real advantage over taking on d6 immediately.  a6  11.Nxd6  cxd6  12.Qa3  d5  13.Bd3  Ne4 =  White is pretty much just a tempo down over the mainline.  10...cxd6  Black threatens ... Nxd4.  11.Qa3  d5  Black can keep his structure flexible and maybe play for ... e5, but if there is no need to if you are satisfied with a simple and equal position. By playing 11... d5 we take the game into an Exchange Slav structure where black has already exchanged his important dark bishop, but on the other hand ...Ne4 guarantees one of white's bishops will also get exchanged.  12.Bd3  Ne4  Taking on e4 is plain bad.  13.O-O  Nxd2  14.Nxd2  Qe7 =  White's good vs bad bishop advantage here is mostly symbolic, since he can't really make use of it. Black can maybe make use of ...f6 at some point, which is a nice multipurpose move with the idea of rerouting our dark bishop to the kingside by playing ...Bd7-e8-g6/h5.   9.h3  White continues his waiting strategy, althoughthis doesn't seem like the best use of the tempo. White tries to stay flexible and prevents our future ...Bg4, but this isn't a major problem.  e5  10.d5  Ne7  11.e4  Bd7  12.Qc2  Ng6  13.O-O  a6 =  Black can prepare the ...c6 break more slowly than usual, with ...b5, ...h6 and ...Rc8 first.   9.Rd1  Quite rare and not very threatening.  e5  10.dxe5  Nxe5  11.Nxe5  Bxe5 =   9.e4 ?!  This seems like quite a serious inaccuracy. White is overreaching with his centre.  e5  10.dxe5  If white doesn't take on e5 and plays 10. d5, 10... Nd4 ! is unpleasant.  Nxe5  11.Nxe5  Bxe5  =+  Black is well developed and the e4 pawn is not well-supported.   9.a3  Rather rare, but it has been tried by a couple of strong players recently. White takes b4 under control  (preventing . ..Nb4 in some cases)  but this doesn't seem like the most effective use of the tempo.  e5  10.d5  Ne7  11.e4  Bg4  12.Be2  c6  13.dxc6  Nxc6 =  Black basically has a better version of 9. O-O. }
9... e5 10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Bxe5
{ We have reached a rather open position where white hopes to use his f-pawn and extra central e-pawn to push us back and control the centre. }
12. f4
{ Critical. White pushes us back as quickly as possible.   12.O-O-O  White decides to get his king to safety first before expanding in the centre. As we will see, this has the advantage of not weakening the e3 pawn and allowing black to equalise by attacking it.  Qe7  On the other hand, by playing slowly white has given black time to complete development.  13.Kb1  White moves his king out of the way and now threatens 14. f4   13.f3  wouldn't work because of  ...Bxc3  14.Bxc3  Qxe3+  .  Rd8  Preparing to exchange rooks on the d-file.  14.f4  Bxc3  15.Bxc3  Bg4  16.Rxd8+  Rxd8 =  Black has equalised here comfortably. Next he can work on eliminating white's bishop pair by playing either ...Be6 or ...Ne4. }
12... Bxc3
{ Retreating to d6 is more dangerous since it loses time and it looks like black could get steamrolled in the centre. }
13. Bxc3
{ White has the bishop pair and potentially a nice position, but he hasn't castled yet. Black needs to act quickly to take advantage of this and equalise. }
13... Ng4
{ The alternative is 13... Qe7, which should also equalise, but it leads to a line where black grabs the e3 pawn and white gets enough compensation in the form of the bishop pair and a kingside initiative. For the sake of ease-of-play, this should be avoided. Instead, we follow Wesley So's choice against Giri which allowed him to equalise quite easily with a semi-forced line. }
14. Bd4 { The only natural way to defend e3. } 14... c5
{ An important move to remember ! The immediate 14... Re8 would have been met by 15. O-O-O, after which we can't take on e3. By playing ...c5 the d-file is opened, which prevents white from castling long. }
15. Bxc5 Re8
{ Hitting e3. As mentioned previously, O-O-O isn't possible anymore. } 16. O-O
{ White can't hold onto the pawn, so getting his king to safety is his best bet. }
16... b6
{ A nice little intermezzo before regaining the pawn, but the immediate 16... Nxe3 is also playable. }
17. Bd4 Nxe3 18. Bxe3 Rxe3
{ So equalised fully against Giri and after a few more exchanges they reached a draw by threefold repetition. 5. Qa4+ }

6... O-O 7. Qc2
{ This is white's second most common choice, behind 7. Bd2 and it is a logical one. White is trying to find useful, improving moves before developing his light bishop so he does not waste a tempo after ...dxc4.7. Qc2 is useful, since typically black plays ... Bd7 threatening ...Nxd4, after which the queen is forced to move anyway. White reasons that the queen has done its duty on a4 by luring the knight to the supposedly inferior c6 square, and now can return to the more natural c2 square. }
7... b6
{ Black has tried a wide variety of moves here, all of which have been played by a number of top GMs. The most popular choices have been 7... dxc4 and 7... Re8, both of which are perfectly logical and lead to quite different games. However, our choice, 7... b6 tries to take full advantage of the consequences of white's queen retreat. Without the queen on a4 attacking our knight  (or a6)  , we intend to develop the bishop to a6 so that it can be exchanged with white's good bishop  (in some cases the bishop can also simply go to b7)  . The two most notable players to opt for 7... b6 have been Grischuk and Fressinet, but a number of other strong GMs have played it as well. }

Our plan will generally revolve around trying to make full advantage of the knight on c6 by playing for the ...e5 break. Typically black will play something along the lines of ...dxc4, ...Bd6 and ... e5 }
5... Nc6 { Forced, of course. } 6. e3
{ The most natural and most common move by quite a wide margin. White protects c4 as well as d4, but this comes at the cost of locking his bishop inside the pawn chain. His dark bishop will typically be developed to d2 now, where it is well-placed to recapture on c3. }
6... O-O 7. Bd2
{ White's most common move by a wide margin. He plays the typically waiting game and delays the development of his light bishop. }

9. h3

 This chapter deals with 5.Qb3 as well as other, rarer sidelines.   The main thing to remember here is to immediately counterattack with 5...c5 after 5.Qb3, taking advantage of the loose d4 pawn.    If white takes on c5, it is then important to prepare to recapture on c5 with the knight after ...Na6.   The mainline heads into an endgame quite quickly, where black should be fine theoretically and in practice. Take a look at some of the analysis and one of the model games to get a feel for the endgame. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4
{ In this chapter, we will be dealing with a number of transpositions into the Nimzo-Indian, as well as all of white's other independent tries which haven't been looked at yet. }
5. Qb3
{ This is quite a bit less common than the 3 main moves we covered in the previous chapters, but it has picked up in popularity recently, including at the elite level, so black definitely needs to know what to do. Moreover, it is the only other independent move  (which doesn't transpose into the Nimzo-Indian)  which is theoretically-challenging. White attacks our bishop, while also intending to recapture on c3 with his queen. There are a few drawbacks to 5. Qb3, such as reduced protection for the d4 pawn and the fact that ...dxc4 can now be played with tempo  (thus forcing an immediate recapture)  .   5.e3  O-O  transposes to the Nimzo-Indian  (Chapter 8)  .   5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  O-O  transposes to the Nimzo-Indian  (Chapter 7)  .   5.Bd2  O-O  transposes to the Nimzo-Indian  (Chapter 6)  .   5.Qc2  c5  Hitting white's d4 pawn which has been left unsupported.  6.e3   6.cxd5  exd5  7.Bg5  cxd4  Taking on d4 before white has a chance to reinforce it with e3.  8.Nxd4  Nc6  9.Nxc6  bxc6 =  Black has no problems here thanks to his solid centre and active pieces.  6...O-O  just transposes to a poor version of the Rubinstein variation   4.e3  for white.   5.g3  O-O  transposes to the Catalan  (Chapter 10)  .   5.Bf4  This is one of white's last few independent options which we haven't covered yet. It is quite rare and not very good. It doesn't seem like there are any notable advantages of developing the bishop to f4 instead of g5, but there are some significant drawbacks - most importantly, our knight is not pinned and free to move. We are able to take full advantage of this with our next move.  dxc4 !  One of the few times we will be taking on c4 this early, but the reason for this is that it pretty much buries 5. Bf4. White's issue now is that he cannot play the usual 6. e4   like he would after  5.Bg5  because the knight isn't pinned and ...Nxe4 can be played.  6.a3   6.e3  b5 !  We have no reason not to hold onto the pawn here - white definitely doesn't have full compensation.  7.a4  Nd5 !  The other issue with 5. Bf4 becomes apparent - the bishop is vulnerable on f4.  8.Qc1  Nxf4  9.exf4  c6  ∓  The opening has gone miserably for white.  6...Bxc3+  7.bxc3  Nd5  Once again, we can exploit the fact that the knight isn't pinned and the bishop on f4 is vulnerable.  8.Bd2  Nc6  9.e4  Nb6 =  White doesn't have full compensation for the pawn. }
5... c5
{ A nice move, simultaneously protecting our bishop and putting pressure on white's centre. }
6. dxc5
{ The only critical way to play for white and the logical follow up.   6.cxd5  White's second most common choice, but we have already covered the position after  exd5  in Chapter 3.   6.e3  Quite natural, but not critical at all.  Nc6  6...O-O is also perfectly playable, but ...Nc6 has the extra idea of throwing in ...Na5 on the next move.  7.cxd5   7.dxc5  Bxc5  8.Be2  O-O =  Black has no problems here.   7.a3 ?!  This is natural move is actually a bit inaccurate since it allows black to carry out his ...Na5 idea.  Na5 !  An easy equaliser.  8.Qc2  Bxc3+  9.Qxc3  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nxc4  11.Bxc4  dxc4  12.Qxc4  O-O =  Black has the better side of a fairly equal position, thanks to ...e5 ideas.  7...exd5  8.dxc5  Bxc5  9.Be2  O-O =  Black has a nice IQP position here - white's pieces aren't ideally placed to play against the IQP.   6.a3  White ensures that he grabs the bishop pair, but this wastes crucial time.  Bxc3+  7.Qxc3   7.bxc3  doesn't make that much sense combined with 7. Qxc3 - the whole idea was to avoid doubled pawns by recapturing with the queen.  O-O  8.Bg5  dxc4  9.Qxc4  Nbd7  =+  followed by ... b6 with a good position.  7...cxd4  7... Ne4 is more common, but it is unclear what black gains by that.  8.Qxd4  The only way to not become worse.   8.Nxd4 ?!  This allows black to expand in the centre quickly.  e5 !  9.Nb5  O-O  10.cxd5  a6  The immediate ...Nxd5 is also possible.  11.Nc7  Nxd5  12.Nxd5  Qxd5  =+  Black's lead in development gives him a slight edge.  8...Nc6  9.Qd1  O-O  10.cxd5  exd5 =  Black's lead in development gives him an easy game.   6.Bg5  White plays actively, but neglects his centre which will soon be liquidated.  dxc4 !  One of the disadvantages of 5. Qb3 is that ...dxc4 comes with tempo  (i.e. white is forced to recapture)  .  7.Qxc4  h6  8.Bxf6   8.Bh4  Nbd7  9.dxc5  Qa5  10.Bxf6  Nxf6  11.a3  Bxc3+  12.Qxc3  Qxc3+  13.bxc3  Bd7  =+  Black can push a bit in this endgame - he has a lead in development, and after he recoups the c5 pawn, the c3 pawn will still be weak.  8...Qxf6  9.a3  Bxc3+  10.Qxc3  b6 =  Black can develop comfortably and has equalised. }
6... Na6
{ A good, multipurpose move. The knight protects the bishop, while also preparing to recoup the c5 pawn after ...Bxc3+. }
7. a3
{ The most common move by far. White's goal, pretty much from the start, has been to pick up the bishop pair. }
7... Bxc3+ 8. Qxc3 Nxc5
{ We reach a position where white has gained the bishop pair, but fallen behind in development. Black should play actively and look to exchange one of white's bishops if possible. }
9. cxd5
{ White's most common move by far.   9.Bg5  is not too strong here, since white cedes the bishop pair which he just worked so hard to gain.  Nce4  10.Bxf6  Qxf6  11.Qxf6  Nxf6 =  12.cxd5  Nxd5 =  with a fairly straightforward, equal endgame.   9.e3  is not challenging at all since it blocks white's bishop in.  O-O  10.b4  Nce4  11.Qd4  dxc4  12.Bxc4  Qc7 =  Black's lead in development and well-placed knights balance out the bishop pair. }
9... Qxd5 10. Be3 Nce4
{ From here, white heads for an endgame with either 11. Qd4 or 11. Qe5, where he hopes to be able to take full advantage of his bishop pair on the open board. Once again, black needs to play actively here to neutralise white's play before he can fully unravel. }
11. Qe5
{ The more accurate way of heading for an endgame.   11.Qd4  This is just a slightly worse version of 11. Qe5, since if black doesn't exchange queens, in this line white can't force the exchange by playing 12. Rd1.  O-O  There's no need for black to take on d4 yet.  12.g3  b6  13.Bg2  Bb7  14.O-O  Qb5 =  White has managed to keep the bishop pair, but in this position it won't amount to much thanks to blacks well-placed knights and general activity. }
11... Qxe5 { Other moves are possible, but this is most common. } 12. Nxe5 Nd5
13. Bc1
{ This position has been reached around 25 times at the time of writing. It does seem like white is able to unravel here and get some long-term pressure with his bishop pair, but practice and some deeper analysis shows otherwise. The centre/kingside typically ends up blocked  (with pawns on e4 and e5)  which limit the scope of white's bishops. Additionally, black's knights are usually able to find good squares quite easily on the queenside, which means that exchanging them for the bishops isn't too difficult. In practice, both sides have one win each, with the rest of the games being drawn, which indicates that black has had no problems in this endgame practically. We will go a little deeper into this endgame to show some typical play for both sides and prove that black has nothing to fear. }
13... Bd7
{ Other moves have been tried, but this is most common - black doesn't need to worry about Nxd7 since his knights won't have much difficulty exchanging themselves for the bishops. }
14. f3 Nc5 15. e4
{ White is able to kick black's knights away from good squares, but they have no difficulty in finding other good squares. }
15... Nb3 { An important intermezzo. } 16. Rb1 Nb6 17. Be3 Rc8
{ At the time of writing, this position has been reached 14 times, with black scoring slightly above 50%. Clearly, black has no problems in practice. At some point black usually plays ...Nc4 and begins to trade off his knights for white's bishops. }
18. Nxd7
{ Most games have gone like this.   18.Bxb6  White trades in his bishop pair to saddle us with doubled pawns. This weakness is more symbolic though, as it is difficult for white to exploit.  axb6  19.Nc4  Rc6  20.Rd1  Ke7  21.Kf2  f6 =  The weakness of the b-pawns isn't significant enough for white to have a pull. }
18... Kxd7 19. Be2 Ke7 20. O-O Rhd8
{ Black's rooks occupy the only open files on the board, which indicates that mass exchanges are on their way. }
21. Rfd1 Rxd1+ 22. Bxd1 Nc4 23. Bxb3
{ 23.Bg5+  has also been tried, but it doesn't change the evaluation.  f6  24.Bxb3  fxg5  25.Rc1  b5 =  White has no advantage thanks to black's great knight. }
23... Nxe3
{ White hasn't been able to take advantage of the bishop in the 5 games that reached this position, which shows that it is equal practically as well as in analysis. }

The centre/kingside typically ends up blocked  (with pawns on e4 and e5)  which limit the scope of white's bishops. Additionally, black's knights are usually able to find good squares quite easily on the queenside, which means that exchanging them for the bishops isn't too difficult.

 This chapter deals with the Catalan.   We have chosen a solid line with ...d5 and ...Bb4+. The idea is to provoke the bishop to d2 and then retreat our bishop back to e7, claiming that white's bishop gets in the way of his knight.   We have opted for an active setup involving ...b6 and ...Ba6 wherever possible.   An important line to look at is the mainline, which was Avrukh's recommendation. Pay special attention to the idea of 14...f6! followed by 15...Nxf4 and 16...f5!. This idea was found after Avrukh's book was published and has scored very well for black. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ In this chapter we are dealing with the Catalan. White fianchettos his bishop with the intention of putting black under lasting pressure on the queenside and in the centre. White aims for a small but long-term edge, which he hopes to milk for the rest of the game without taking much risk. The Catalan has always been a popular choice at the top level, but recently it has also picked up in popularity at the amateur and club level, largely thanks to the success of GM Avrukh's 1. d4 repertoire series.   3.Nc3  Before carrying on with the Catalan proper, let's look at a line which can transpose into pseudo-Catalan via a Nimzo-Indian move order.  Bb4  4.g3  We first encountered this move in Chapter 6, when we analysed white's rarer 4th moves in the Nimzo-Indian.  d5  There might be other ways to take advantage of white's line, but this is good enough.  5.Bg2  O-O  This transposes to a line we will cover after 4. Bg2. }
3... d5
{ Black can still avoid the Catalan at this point by heading for the Bogo-Indian with 3... Bb4+ or the Modern Benoni with 3... c5, but we will stay true to the spirit of this repertoire by playing 3... d5. }
4. Nf3
{ 4.Bg2  should just transpose to 4. Nf3 in most cases.  Bb4+  5.Bd2   5.Nc3  As mentioned before, we can reach this position easily from a Nimzo-Indian as well.  O-O  6.Nf3   6.cxd5  White fixes the pawn structure to avoid black's ...dxc4 ideas, but this also gifts black the e-file and the h3-c8 diagonal for his rook and bishop respectively.  exd5  7.Nf3  c6  8.O-O  Re8  9.a3  Bd6 =  Black has no issues in this line at all - natural play gets us a good position.  6...dxc4 !  The downside with developing the knight to c3 in the Catalan is this move - it becomes exceptionally difficult to recoup the c4 pawn with a knight on c3. Some common ways black will hold onto this pawn in this variation are: 1...Nc6-a5, covering the pawn with the knight. 2...Rb8 followed by ...b5 - this has the benefit of protecting the pawn with another pawn, while also getting the rook off the long diagonal. 3...a6 with ...b5 builds a nice long pawn chain, making it difficult for white to regain the pawn.  7.O-O  Nc6  Attacking white's d4 pawn to tie white's queen and knight down, while also preparing to defend c4 with ...Na5.  8.a3  White's most common move.   8.Bg5  White wants to get the bishop outside the pawn chain before playing e3.  h6  9.Bxf6  Qxf6  10.e3  Rb8  Getting off the long diagonal and preparing to defend c4 with ... b5.  11.Nd2  Na5  =+  Once again, white lacks full compensation here.   8.e3  White protects d4 and wants to regain the pawn with Qe2xc4, but this is just too slow.  Rb8 !  Preparing ...b5.  9.Qe2  b5  =+  White doesn't have full compensation for the pawn.  8...Be7  No need to give up the bishop, although it is playable of course.  9.e4  a6  Preparing ...b5.  10.Be3  b5  =+  White's centre looks impressive, but it can't advance too easily  (for example, e5 ... Nd5)  . White lacks full compensation here once again.   5.Nd2  is a rare way to block the check.  O-O  6.Qc2  6. Ngf3 will transpose to a line we will see more of after 4. Nf3.  c5  Challenging white in the centre while it lacks support.  7.dxc5  Bxc5  8.Ngf3  Qc7 !  Precise. Black introduces the idea of .. .Bxf2+ after cxd5.  9.e3  Prophylaxis against ...Bxf2+ ideas.  Be7 =+  Black retreats and pins the c4 pawn. Black has a comfortable edge here, and can consider ideas such as ...b5 on the next move.  5...Be7  6.Nf3  O-O  transposes straight into our mainline. }
4... Bb4+
{ Our chosen variation against the Catalan is quite possibly the most solid. Our strategy, as in the rest of the repertoire, is to hold and solidify the pawn on d5. The purpose of ...Bb4+ is to provoke white's bishop to d2, before we retreat our bishop back to its normal square on e7. As we shall see later, the bishop on d2 is actually a liability rather than a strength, since it gets in the way of white's usual plan in the Closed Catalan. }
5. Bd2
{ By far the most common way of blocking the check.   5.Nbd2  Significantly rarer than the main move, 5. Bd2, but it isn't as bad as its popularity suggests.  O-O  6.Bg2   6.Qc2  isn't good since it leaves white's centre unsupported.  c5 !  Hitting white's centre immediately.  7.dxc5  Bxc5  8.Bg2  transposing to a line we already looked at after 5. Bg2.  6...dxc4  Black can also play with the more solid 6.. .b6 here, however this seems like best way to challenge white's opening setup. With a knight on d2, it is difficult for white to win back the pawn after we support it later with ...b5, and it is often not too easy to find full compensation for white.  7.Qc2  White hurries to regain the c4 pawn with his queen.   7.a3  is what the engine prefers initially, but it is countered quite easily:  Bxd2+ !  This seems a bit strange, but it works for concrete reasons.  8.Bxd2  Nc6  Hitting d4.  9.e3  Rb8  10.O-O  b5  Protecting c4.  11.b3  cxb3  12.Qxb3  Bb7 ! =  White can't take on b5 because of ...Nxd4. This position was reached in a game between Grischuk and Nakamura, which ended in a draw 11 moves later - white has enough for the pawn, but not much more.   7.O-O  Unpinning the knight and now attacking c4.  b5  8.a4  White chips away at the pawn supporting c4.  c6  9.Qc2   9.axb5  cxb5  10.Ng5  White tries his luck with a kingside attack.  Nd5  11.e4  Kicking our knight back and opening up the diagonal for the queen.  Nc7  12.Nxh7  This sacrifice was white's idea since 10. Ng5, but it doesn't score very well for white and with some accurate defence  (or engine analysis !)  from black he should get an advantage.  Kxh7  13.Qh5+   13.e5  Attacking the rook on a8.  g6 !  Stopping white's attack in its tracks.  14.Bxa8  Nxa8  15.Qf3  Bd7 !  Leaving the knight hanging and rather getting the bishop into the game.  16.Ne4   16.Qxa8 ??  is a losing blunder in fact:  Bc6 !  17.Qxa7  c3  18.bxc3  Bxc3  -+  Black's monstrous bishops are decisive.  16...Be7  Covering the dark squares around our king.  17.Qf4  Kg8  18.h4  Nc6  19.Be3  f5 !  ∓  White's attack has mostly fizzled out, leaving us clearly better.  13...Kg8  14.e5  Attacking our rook on a8.  f5 !  A novelty, unsurprisingly. ...f5 secures our king. The engine line which follows is actually quite amazing:  15.Bxa8  Nxa8  16.Rxa7  Bd7 !!  A pretty amazing move - black sacrifices his knight on a8 just to end white's attacking hopes. The problem with 16... Nc7 is that white's attack becomes dangerous after 17. Nf3 followed by 18. Ng5. Note that 17. Nf3 can now be met by ...Qe8 !.  17.Rxa8  Bc6 !  Chasing the rook away.  18.Ra7  Be8  With the rook away from a8, we can kick white's queen away from h5 without leaving our own queen tied to the defence of the knight on b8.  19.Qd1  Qxd4  ∓  White's attack is over and the tables have turned. Despite black being an exchange down, his activity and attacking chances give him a near-winning advantage.   9.Ne1  White frees up the long diagonal.  Nd5  10.e4  Nb6  11.a5  N6d7  =+  Black is at least equal here.  9...a5  A fairly standard move in this position, covering the bishop.  10.b3  cxb3  11.Nxb3  bxa4  12.Rxa4  Ba6  =+  White doesn't have full compensation for the pawn.  7...a5 !  It's important to note that the natural 7... b5 runs into tactical problems after 8. a4.  8.Qxc4  White regains the pawn, but we can now exploit white's queen's position. The alternative, 8. O-O, allows us to play ...b5 which just transposes to the lines after 7. O-O.  b6 !  With the idea of ...Ba6 - white can't castle now because e2 would hang.  9.Qc2  Prophylactically retreating the queen.   9.a3  Be7  10.Ne5  Hitting our rook.  Ra7  11.Ndf3  Ba6  12.Qa4  c5  13.dxc5  Bxc5  =+  Black's strong bishops make his position slightly preferable.  9...Bb7  10.O-O  Nbd7 =  With all our pieces on good squares, black has absolutely no problems. Next we can play for the ...c5 break.   5.Nc3  O-O  6.Bg2  dxc4  transposes to the line after 4. Bg2. }
5... Be7
{ Now that the bishop's job of provoking white's dark bishop to d2 is done, we bring the bishop back to its normal square on e7. Recently, black has been playing the bishop to d6 as well, which has some pros and cons - however, 5... Be7 is the established mainline, so this is what we'll cover. }
6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O c6 { Solidifying the d5 pawn. } 8. Qc2 Nbd7
{ This is the critical 'starting position' of this variation, which can be reached via a variety of move orders. First thing to take note of is the bishop on d2. Usually in the Closed Catalan, white will play Nbd2 followed by e4 with a good position. Clearly, with the bishop on d2 this isn't possible. So by playing the ...Bb4-e7 manoeuvre and provoking Bd2, black might have just gained a tempo  (at best)  . White can try meet our variation with two different mindsets: he can either try to make use of the bishop on d2, or he will move it at some point to another square  (usually f4, sometimes c1)  . Over the next few moves, white will be playing some improving moves. He wants to see what black is doing with his light bishop  (whether it will go to b7 or a6)  before he commits his queenside knight. If the bishop puts pressure on c4 from a6, then Nc3 is not ideal - otherwise white can develop the knight actively to c3. In most cases we will be developing our light bishop to a6 so that it can pressurise c4, as this limits white's options. The main waiting/improving moves white can play are Bf4, Rd1 and b3. The order of these can be swapped around quite easily. }
9. Rd1
{ A useful move. The rook will be well placed when the centre eventually opens up.   9.Bf4  Activating the bishop and possibly freeing up d2 for the knight.  b6  Note that 10. Rd1 and 10. b3 transpose to lines covered later.  10.cxd5  White hopes to exploit the open c-file quickly, but this isn't very challenging.   10.Nbd2  Prepares e4, but blocks the f4-bishop's escape route.  Nh5  11.Be3  Bb7  12.Rfd1  Nhf6  transposing to a line covered after 9. Rd1.   10.Nc3  Developing the knight like this invites black to exploit the hanging c4 pawn.  dxc4 !  11.Nd2  The only good way white can try to regain the pawn.  Nd5  Protecting the hanging c6 pawn.  12.Nxc4  Ba6  Aiming for minor piece exchanges.  13.Qa4  Nxf4  14.gxf4  Bxc4  15.Qxc4  Rc8 =  Black has no real problems here. He can bring his knight to d5 via f6 to neutralise white's strong bishop or play for the ...c5 break  (maybe ...b5, ... a6 followed by ..c5)  .  10...cxd5  Almost irrespective of what white plays, all black really needs to do is play ...Bb7, ...Rc8 and then begin exchanging some pieces.  11.Rc1  Bb7  With only one open file on the board, there are bound to be mass exchanges soon.  12.Qb3  Rc8  13.Rxc8  Qxc8 =  Black has no problems here at all.  14.Nc3  Ba6  15.Qd1  Qb7  16.a4  Rc8  17.h4  Ne4  18.Nxe4  dxe4  19.Ng5  Bxg5  20.Bxg5   9.b3  Covering c4.  b6  10.Bc3  is one way white can try to make use of his bishop. Unfortunately for white, the bishop is a bit in the way on the c-file which means that we should try to open it.   10.Bf4  Ba6  White should probably transpose to our mainline here with 11. Rd1, but he has one independent option.  11.Nbd2  Blocking the bishop's escape.  Nh5  12.Be3  Rc8 =  White doesn't have anything much better than transposing to the mainline now with 13. Rfd1.  10...Bb7  11.Nbd2  Rc8  Preparing ...c5.  12.e4  c5 !  Black counters white's central break with a break of his own.  13.exd5  exd5 =  Black has equalised here fully - the centre will be liquidated within a couple moves, with the game fizzling out into equality. }
9... b6 { Activating our light-squared bishop, of course. } 10. Bf4
{ Activating white's bishop and clearing the d2 square.   10.b3  Supporting c4 is white's second most common move.  Ba6  11.a4  White's most common choice in this position. He tries to make use of the bishop on d2 without moving it by using an a4-a5 pawn lever.   11.Bc1  White spends a tempo to reroute his bishop to b2.  Rc8  12.Bb2  Qc7  Preparing the ...c5 break.  13.Nbd2  c5  A typical equalising break in this variation.  14.Rac1  Qb8 =  Black has developed soundly and the central tension is bound to liquidate into complete equality.   11.Bf4  Rc8  is covered in our mainline, after 10. Bf4.  11...Qc8  A small improving move. The d8 square is freed for our rook, the queen supports the ...c5 break and can possibly also go to b7 later. It also has the added benefit of allowing our bishop to retreat to b7 even when white plays a5, without having to worry about the further a6 advance.  12.Na3   12.a5  The direct test of black's setup.  dxc4  Black can open the long diagonal now that he can fight for it with ...Bb7.  13.bxc4  c5  Challenging white in the centre.  14.Bf4  cxd4  15.Nxd4  Bb7  Exchanging more pieces.  16.Bxb7  Qxb7  17.Nc3  bxa5  Black deals with the irritating idea of a6.  18.Nb3  a4 !  An improvement over Tomashevsky - Karjakin, where Karjakin did draw.  19.Nxa4  Rfc8 =  Black is well-placed to deal with white's passed c-pawn.  12...Bb7  13.Qb2  c5  14.Rac1  Bc6  was played by So against Nakamura. The idea is to tuck the queen away on b7.  15.dxc5  bxc5  16.cxd5  exd5 =  Black's hanging pawns are well supported and So went on to draw against Nakamura. }
10... Ba6
{ This active development of the bishop is preferred throughout most of this chapter. Attacking c4 limits white's options greatly. }
11. Ne5
{ Avrukh's recommendation against our setup and the main move. White attacks c6 and activates his light bishop.   11.b3  Supporting c4. This is white's second most popular move here.  Rc8  A natural developing move. If white plays too passively, black can start opening the centre up with ...c5.  12.Nc3  White is now ready to carry out his highly desirable e4 break.  h6  Black makes a small improving move while awaiting white's e4 break.  13.e4  This must be critical, of course.   13.h3  White can try make his own, similar improving move, but this is less effective.  dxc4  14.e4  b5  15.bxc4  bxc4 =  with similar play to our mainline.  13...dxc4  There is an interesting situation now with our c4 pawn: it is in a kind of limbo. White can't take on c4 right now, since our bishop just recaptures and we end up with an extra pawn. But we also can't take on b3 due to the fact that the a-file would open and white would grab the a7 pawn.  14.Nd2  b5  Supporting c4 and threatening ...b4.  15.bxc4  Pretty much forced.  bxc4  This is an important position for this variation, but one where black has scored very well  (over 65%!)  . Let's have a look at what white can try.  16.Na4  White's most common choice.   16.Qa4 ?!  simply doesn't work here tactically.  Bb5 !  17.Nxb5  Nb6  An important intermezzo.  18.Qxa7  cxb5  19.Qa6  Na4  -+  Indirectly defending b5 because of ...Nc3. Black's queenside pawns give him a winning advantage.   16.Bf1  White tries to recoup c4 as quickly as possible.  Bb4  This hasn't been played yet, but putting pressure on e4 by attacking the knight seems like black's easiest route to equality.  17.Nxc4  Bxc3  18.Qxc3  Nxe4  Black wins another pawn.  19.Qa3  Bxc4  20.Bxc4  Black is up a pawn, but white's bishop pair puts us under quite a bit of pressure. Fortunately, a long forcing sequence exists which equalises for black.  g5 !  Kicking white's bishop.  21.Be5  The bishop needs to stay on the f4-b8 diagonal for black to have any issues.  Nd2 !  A pretty nice move. Black's knight is tactically defended by ...Nxe5.  22.Be2  Nxe5  Most of white's advantage is gone without his bishop pair.  23.dxe5  Qd4  Black needs to act quickly to avoid losing his knight.  24.Rac1  White threatens Rc2, winning our knight.  Rb8 !  The only move to save the knight.  25.Rc2  Rb1  26.Rxb1  Nxb1 =  White will trade off the queens and win his pawn back, but this will leave us in an equal endgame.  16...g5 !  A strong move played by Vidit in 2017. The idea is to win the bishop pair with ...Ng4.  17.Be3  Ng4  18.Nf1  Preparing to recapture on e3 with the knight.  c5 =+  Black is definitely pushing here.   11.cxd5  Taking on d5 and removing the tension from the centre without a concrete reason for it should never really challenge black.  cxd5  12.Ne5  With the idea of Nc6, winning the bishop pair.   12.Nc3  is completely innocuous:  b5  13.a3  Qb6 =  Black has easy equality here.  12...Bb7  Covering c6, ensuring that black has his 'bad' bishop traded instead of the dark bishop.  13.Nc6  Bxc6  14.Qxc6  Qc8  15.Qb5  a6  16.Qd3  Qb7 =  Despite white's bishop pair, the closed nature of the position means that black has no real problems here.   11.Nbd2  White is playing for the idea of e4, but he blocks off his dark bishops escape.  Nh5 !  12.Be3   12.Ne5 ?!  is quite poor:  Nxf4  13.gxf4  Nxe5  14.dxe5  f6  =+  Black has the bishop pair and good play.  12...Nhf6 =  Assuming black is happy with a draw, this is probably the best response. There are other decent moves here if we want to play on, such as ...Rc8 and ...Bd6. }
11... Rc8 { Simply defending c6. } 12. cxd5
{ Avrukh's choice and the main move, with the idea of gaining the bishop pair by playing Nc6xe7.   12.Nc3  This is a bit less popular than Avrukh's 12. cxd5, which is understandable since black can use the hanging c4-pawn to equalise.  Bxc4 !  Grabbing the pawn.  13.Nxc4  dxc4  14.e4  With white's knight on c3 in the way, it is surprisingly difficult for white to recoup the c4 pawn. White decides to rather play around the pawn and try to get some compensation for it.  b5 !  Securing the c4 pawn.  15.a4  Undermining our extra pawn's support.   15.d5  Immediately cracking open the centre with the hope of using white's extra activity.  cxd5  16.exd5  e5  16... Qb6 is a novelty worth considering as well.  17.d6  Trapping our bishop.  exf4  17... Bxd6 should also be good enough for equality.  18.Nxb5  fxg3  19.hxg3  Rc5  20.dxe7  Qxe7  21.Nd6  Ne5 =  White has enough compensation for the pawn but nothing more.  15...a6  Reinforcing b5.  16.axb5  axb5  17.d5  White's only critical option is to exploit his activity and open up the position.  cxd5  18.exd5  e5  Kicking white's bishop away.  19.Bg5  Qb6  A good multipurpose move: prevents d6, Nxb5 and Ra6.  20.Ne4  Bc5 =  White has enough compensation for the pawn to equalise, but nothing more.   12.Qa4  is quite rare and it looks better than it is. White attacks both c6 and a6.  Nb8 !  Defending both. This might look awkward or passive, but black threatens ...b5.  13.Qb3 ?!  Nfd7  =+  exchanging minor pieces with good play for black. }
12... Nxd5
{ 12... cxd5 allows white to get the bishop pair that he wanted. The reason that 12... Nxd5 works is because tactics prevent 13. Nxc6 from being effective. Since Avrukh published his book, some new ideas have been found in this variation which have scored very well for black. }
13. Nc3
{ Developing is white's only critical move.   13.Nxc6 ?!  doesn't work tactically here for white:  Nb4  14.Qa4  Getting out of the pin.  Nxc6  15.Bxc6   15.Qxa6 ?  is just very bad for white.  Nc5 !  The queen comes under heavy fire.  16.Qc4  Na5  17.Qc3  Na4  18.Qf3  Nxb2  ∓  Black has a commanding initiative.  15...Bxe2  Black regains his pawn.  16.Rc1  Nb8 =  and black has no problems. }
13... Nxe5
{ Exchanging pieces usually benefits black due to our lack of space. } 14. Bxe5
f6
{ This new idea has been played 15 times since Avrukh's book was published, but not once before ! It is understandable that it didn't receive any coverage as a result, but it does seem like this equalises comfortably for black. This move forces the bishop back so we can trade our knight for it. }
15. Bf4 Nxf4 16. gxf4 f5
{ The point of black's last 2 moves. The whole position is highly unusual and looks very strange, but black has been scoring very highly here - almost 70%! 16... f5 is a strong multi-purpose move: it takes e4 away from white's pieces, fixes the f4 weakness and frees up the f6 square for our rook and bishop. The weakness of e6 is more visual than anything else since it is very difficult to attack. These factors, together with black's bishop pair, give him a good position. }
17. e3
{ 17.Qa4  Hitting our bishop. This is played with the idea of forcing a draw.  Bb7  18.Qxa7  Qc7  18... Rb8 is another idea if black needs to win.  19.Nb5 !  Qd7  20.Nc3  White attacks b6, forcing the queen back to c7.  Qc7 =  With a threefold repetition and a draw. }
17... Rf6
{ Black's standard idea in this position is this rook lift. The rook heads to g6 or h6 where it can put pressure on white's exposed king. }
18. Ne2 { White brings his knight back to defend. } 18... Bb7 19. Ng3 Rh6
{ Black has good play on the kingside. } *

Nc7 12. Nxh7

12... Kxh7 13. Qh5+ Kg8 14. e5 { Attacking our rook on a8. } 14... f5
{ A novelty, unsurprisingly. ...f5 secures our king. The engine line which follows is actually quite amazing: }
15. Bxa8 Nxa8 16. Rxa7 Bd7
{ A pretty amazing move - black sacrifices his knight on a8 just to end white's attacking hopes. The problem with 16... Nc7 is that white's attack becomes dangerous after 17. Nf3 followed by 18. Ng5. Note that 17. Nf3 can now be met by ...Qe8 !. }
17. Rxa8 Bc6 { Chasing the rook away. } 18. Ra7 Be8
{ With the Rook away from a8, we can kick White's Queen away from h5 without leaving our own Queen tied to the defence of the Knight on b8. }
19. Qd1 Qxd4

8... a5
{ 8... b6 followed by ...Ba6 is a solid alternative which is perfectly viable, and featured in the the 2018 Candidates tournament. The downside there is that white's idea is to play cxd5 and after ...cxd5, black has limited winning chances unfortunately. 8... a5 is a bit rarer, but is catching up in popularity for good reason. It has three main points to it: it prevents Bb4, ...a4 can be useful to kick white's queen away sometimes, and finally we don't commit to ... b6 meaning that we can meet cxd5 with ...exd5 without leaving c6 weak. }

{ This is the critical 'starting position' of this variation, which can be reached via a variety of move orders. First thing to take note of is the bishop on d2. Usually in the Closed Catalan, white will play Nbd2 followed by e4 with a good position. Clearly, with the bishop on d2 this isn't possible. So by playing the ...Bb4-e7 manoeuvre and provoking Bd2, black might have just gained a tempo  (at best)  . White can try meet our variation with two different mindsets: he can either try to make use of the bishop on d2, or he will move it at some point to another square  (usually f4, sometimes c1)  . Over the next few moves, white will be playing some improving moves. He wants to see what black is doing with his light bishop  (whether it will go to b7 or a6)  before he commits his queenside knight. If the bishop puts pressure on c4 from a6, then Nc3 is not ideal - otherwise white can develop the knight actively to c3. In most cases we will be developing our light bishop to a6 so that it can pressurise c4, as this limits white's options. The main waiting/improving moves white can play are Bf4, Rd1 and b3. The order of these can be swapped around quite easily. }

{ Now that the bishop's job of provoking white's dark bishop to d2 is done, we bring the bishop back to its normal square on e7. Recently, black has been playing the bishop to d6 as well, which has some pros and cons - however, 5... Be7 is the established mainline, so this is what we'll cover. }

Usually in the Closed Catalan, white will play Nbd2 followed by e4 with a good position. Clearly, with the bishop on d2 this isn't possible. So by playing the ...Bb4-e7 manoeuvre and provoking Bd2, black might have just gained a tempo  (at best)  . White can try meet our variation with two different mindsets: he can either try to make use of the bishop on d2, or he will move it at some point to another square  (usually f4, sometimes c1)  . Over the next few moves, white will be playing some improving moves. He wants to see what black is doing with his light bishop  (whether it will go to b7 or a6)  before he commits his queenside knight. If the bishop puts pressure on c4 from a6, then Nc3 is not ideal - otherwise white can develop the knight actively to c3. In most cases we will be developing our light bishop to a6 so that it can pressurise c4, as this limits white's options. The main waiting/improving moves white can play are Bf4, Rd1 and b3. The order of these can be swapped around quite easily. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ In this chapter we are dealing with the Catalan. White fianchettos his bishop with the intention of putting black under lasting pressure on the queenside and in the centre. White aims for a small but long-term edge, which he hopes to milk for the rest of the game without taking much risk. The Catalan has always been a popular choice at the top level, but recently it has also picked up in popularity at the amateur and club level, largely thanks to the success of GM Avrukh's 1. d4 repertoire series. }

{ Black can still avoid the Catalan at this point by heading for the Bogo-Indian with 3... Bb4+ or the Modern Benoni with 3... c5, but we will stay true to the spirit of this repertoire by playing 3... d5. }
4. Nf3 Bb4+
{ Our chosen variation against the Catalan is quite possibly the most solid. Our strategy, as in the rest of the repertoire, is to hold and solidify the pawn on d5. The purpose of ...Bb4+ is to provoke white's bishop to d2, before we retreat our bishop back to its normal square on e7.

5. Bd2 { By far the most common way of blocking the check. } 5... Be7
{ Now that the bishop's job of provoking white's dark bishop to d2 is done, we bring the bishop back to its normal square on e7. Recently, black has been playing the bishop to d6 as well, which has some pros and cons - however, 5... Be7 is the established mainline, so this is what we'll cover. }

{ This is the critical "starting position" of this variation, which can be reached via a variety of move orders. First thing to take note of is the bishop on d2. Usually in the Closed Catalan, white will play Nbd2 followed by e4 with a good position. Clearly, with the bishop on d2 this isn't possible. So by playing the ...Bb4-e7 manoeuvre and provoking Bd2, black might have just gained a tempo  (at best)  . White can try meet our variation with two different mindsets: he can either try to make use of the bishop on d2, or he will move it at some point to another square  (usually f4, sometimes c1)  . Over the next few moves, white will be playing some improving moves. He wants to see what black is doing with his light bishop  (whether it will go to b7 or a6)  before he commits his queenside knight. If the bishop puts pressure on c4 from a6, then Nc3 is not ideal - otherwise white can develop the knight actively to c3. In most cases we will be developing our light bishop to a6 so that it can pressurise c4, as this limits white's options. The main waiting/improving moves white can play are Bf4, Rd1 and b3. The order of these can be swapped around quite easily. }

So by playing the ...Bb4-e7 manoeuvre and provoking Bd2, black might have just gained a tempo  (at best)  . White can try meet our variation with two different mindsets: he can either try to make use of the bishop on d2, or he will move it at some point to another square  (usually f4, sometimes c1)  . Over the next few moves, white will be playing some improving moves. He wants to see what black is doing with his light bishop  (whether it will go to b7 or a6)  before he commits his queenside knight. If the bishop puts pressure on c4 from a6, then Nc3 is not ideal - otherwise white can develop the knight actively to c3. In most cases we will be developing our light bishop to a6 so that it can pressurise c4, as this limits white's options. The main waiting/improving moves white can play are Bf4, Rd1 and b3. The order of these can be swapped around quite easily. }

4. Nf3 Bb4+
{ Our chosen variation against the Catalan is quite possibly the most solid. Our strategy, as in the rest of the repertoire, is to hold and solidify the pawn on d5. The purpose of ...Bb4+ is to provoke white's bishop to d2, before we retreat our bishop back to its normal square on e7.

5. Bd2 { By far the most common way of blocking the check. } 5... Be7
{ Now that the bishop's job of provoking white's dark bishop to d2 is done, we bring the bishop back to its normal square on e7. Recently, black has been playing the bishop to d6 as well, which has some pros and cons - however, 5... Be7 is the established mainline, so this is what we'll cover. }
6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O c6 { Solidifying the d5 pawn. } 8. Qc2 Nbd7
{ This is the critical "starting position" of this variation, which can be reached via a variety of move orders. First thing to take note of is the bishop on d2. Usually in the Closed Catalan, white will play Nbd2 followed by e4 with a good position. Clearly, with the bishop on d2 this isn't possible. So by playing the ...Bb4-e7 manoeuvre and provoking Bd2, black might have just gained a tempo  (at best)  . White can try meet our variation with two different mindsets: he can either try to make use of the bishop on d2, or he will move it at some point to another square  (usually f4, sometimes c1)  . Over the next few moves, white will be playing some improving moves. He wants to see what black is doing with his light bishop  (whether it will go to b7 or a6)  before he commits his queenside knight. If the bishop puts pressure on c4 from a6, then Nc3 is not ideal - otherwise white can develop the knight actively to c3. In most cases we will be developing our light bishop to a6 so that it can pressurise c4, as this limits white's options. The main waiting/improving moves white can play are Bf4, Rd1 and b3. The order of these can be swapped around quite easily. }
9. Rd1
{ A useful move. The rook will be well placed when the centre eventually opens up. }
9... b6 { Activating our light-squared bishop, of course. } 10. Bf4

13. Nc3 { Developing is white's only critical move. } 13... Nxe5
{ Exchanging pieces usually benefits black due to our lack of space. } 14. Bxe5
f6
{ This new idea has been played 15 times since Avrukh's book was published, but not once before ! It is understandable that it didn't receive any coverage as a result, but it does seem like this equalises comfortably for black. This move forces the bishop back so we can trade our knight for it. }
15. Bf4 Nxf4 16. gxf4 f5
{ The point of black's last 2 moves. The whole position is highly unusual and looks very strange, but black has been scoring very highly here - almost 70%! 16... f5 is a strong multi-purpose move: it takes e4 away from white's pieces, fixes the f4 weakness and frees up the f6 square for our rook and bishop. The weakness of e6 is more visual than anything else since it is very difficult to attack. These factors, together with black's bishop pair, give him a good position. }

1. d4 Nf6
{ In this chapter we will be dealing with white's various early deviations after 1. d4 - in other words, all white's options that are not a Nimzo-Indian, Ragozin or a Catalan. This means that options such as the Trompowsky, London and Veresov will be covered here. Naturally, we can't cover all of white's deviations in a single chapter, as there are simply far too many - however, we will recommend lines against the most common and most critical ones. Against any deviations not covered yet, common sense development should suffice for equality. After analysing the d4 deviations white can throw at us, it became apparent that it's best to go for lines which are low-theory, safe and solid. There's already enough theory as it is in the Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin without learning more against rare white tries. One of the difficult things about learning to counter many of these d4 deviations is the fact that white can switch up the move order very easily and there are plenty of transpositions. This is why we recommend, for this chapter especially, to pay more attention to the plans and development schemes we use. }
2. Nf3
{ Natural development leaves white very flexible. White has a whole host of ways to deviate from the mainline Queen's Gambit lines.   2.Bf4  The London has become quite popular at all levels recently. It has a reputation for being solid and reliable. Top players often play it so they can just get a game without much theory, while club players like it since it cuts down on how much time they need to learn the opening.  d5  The obvious choice and the one most in line with the rest of our repertoire.  3.e3  Other move orders over the next few moves are also possible, but pretty much all white's moves lead to the same position at the end.  c5  The main way to challenge white's setup is to play actively and occupy the centre.  4.Nf3   4.dxc5  This move is quite challenging, as we don't get the pawn back quickly. We have good compensation, but if you don't want to allow this scenario, there is a good way to sidestep this - first playing 3... e6 and then 4... c5 is a good move order twist.  e6  Intending to simply regain the pawn on the next move.  5.b4  If white doesn't try to hold onto the pawn, black is more than OK.  a5 !  Immediately challenging white's centre.  6.c3  Nc6  Attacking b4 again.  7.Bb5  Pinning our knight, thus defending b4.  Bd7  8.Qb3  White defends b4 and prepares to complete his development. This is a critical junction in this variation, where black can try a few things: 1.8... Ne4 9. f3 e5 !? is extremely complex - a full chapter could be written on that position alone. 2.8... Ne4 9. f3 Nf6 !? with the idea of ...Nh5 next is a suggestion by LeelaChess, but this is untested - black claims that f3 is more of a weakness than a strength. 3. The immediate 8... Nh5. This is natural and relatively easy to play, so we'll go with this.  Nh5  We simply want to pick up the bishop pair.  9.Ne2  So that white can recapture and simultaneously bring his knight into the game.  Nxf4  10.Nxf4  Qf6 !  Black threatens ...axb4.  11.O-O  Black can't take the pawn on b4 and then the rook on a1 since his queen would get trapped now.  g6  Intending to develop our bishop on the long diagonal.  12.Nd2  axb4  13.cxb4  Bg7  14.Rac1  Qb2 !  An important idea to remember - trading off queens here pretty much solves black's problems.  15.Qxb2  Bxb2  16.Rc2  Bg7 =  The endgame remains quite complex, but black has enough compensation for the pawn thanks to the bishop pair and his activity.   4.Nd2  White delays the development of his knight to f3. The idea here is to reach an improved Stonewall structure if black plays on autopilot with ...e6 and ...Bd6, since white can just exchange bishops and play f4 with a pretty good position. Note that the similar idea starting with 4. c3 and then 5. Nd2 can be met in the same way as 4. Nd2, by developing our light bishop to f5, or in the same way as 5. c3 - using ...Qb6 ideas.  Nc6  5.c3  Bf5 !  An important point to remember. When white's knight isn't on f3, black can develop his bishop to f5 without any problems.  6.Qb3  Hitting b7.   6.Ngf3  is natural, but here black is totally fine.  e6  7.Be2  Qb6  8.Qb3  c4  9.Qxb6  axb6 =  A typical ending in this line where black is probably even a little bit better thanks to his easy queenside play.  6...Qd7  7.Ngf3  c4  8.Qd1  e6  9.Be2  b5 =  Black has easy queenside play with full equality.  4...Nc6  5.Nbd2   5.c3  is a much more popular move order for white than 5. Nbd2, however it is inaccurate.  Qb6 !  And this is why. White can't deal with the simple attack on the b2 pawn in a comfortable way.  6.Qb3   6.Qc2  g6  Preparing ...Bf5 and a kingside fianchetto.  7.Nbd2  Bg7  8.h3  O-O  9.Be2  Bf5 =   6.b3  With the bishop on f4 already, b3 is quite a concession.  cxd4  7.exd4  Bf5  8.Bd3  Bxd3  9.Qxd3  e6  10.O-O  Be7 =  The position is roughly equal, but black might be slightly for choice here due to the long term weakness of the c3 pawn caused by the b3 concession.  6...c4  7.Qxb6   7.Qc2  Bf5 !  A little tactical trick. White can't take on f5 since white loses his rook after ...Qxb2.  8.Qc1  Nh5  9.Bg3  Nxg3  10.hxg3  e6 =  Only black can be better here with the bishop pair.  7...axb6  Black is the only one who could be better in this endgame, for example:  8.Na3  Bf5  9.Nh4  Bd7  10.Nb5  Ra5  11.a4  Na7  12.Nc7+  White's knight is in no man's land.  Kd8  13.Na8  Ra6  ∓  Black has a clear advantage here.  5...e6  6.c3  Bd6  A good square for the bishop, where it can neutralise its counterpart.  7.Bg3  White would prefer to trade dark bishops on g3, where he can recapture with the h-pawn.   7.Ne5  White's second most common choice. The knight is difficult to maintain on e5, which means that we target and exchange it.  Qc7  Hitting e5.  8.Ndf3  Nd7  Forcing simplifications.  9.Nxd7  Bxd7  10.Bxd6  Qxd6 =  Black has no problems here. He can look at playing on the queenside or for the ...e5 break.   7.Bxd6  isn't critical at all.  Qxd6  Our queen is well-placed to support the freeing . ..e5 break later.  8.Bd3  O-O  9.O-O  e5 !  Freeing our light bishop and gaining control of the centre. Black has absolutely no problems now.  10.dxe5  Nxe5  11.Nxe5  Qxe5 =  with full equality.   7.Bg5  White goes the extra mile to preserve his dark bishop. Unfortunately, spending an extra tempo just for this is too slow, which means black should have no problems here since he can carry out the ...e5 break.  h6  8.Bh4  O-O  9.Bd3  e5 !  There are other ways to play as well, but this seems like an easy equaliser.  10.dxe5  Nxe5  11.Nxe5  Bxe5 =  All black's pieces have good squares available. Black has secured full equality.   7.dxc5  This does make our bishop move twice, but on the other hand it is difficult to pose us any problems now with our solid centre.  Bxc5  8.Bd3  O-O  9.O-O  Re8 =  Black's solid centre means we have comfortable equality.  7...O-O  Black shouldn't be in any rush to exchange dark bishops.  8.Bd3  White prepares the e4 break.   8.Bb5  This is quite a long way in popularity behind 8. Bd3, but it was favoured by Carlsen when he played the London. With 8. Bb5 white fights for control of the e5 square.  Bxg3  Black scores quite badly here, but I don't see anything wrong with black's position if he is prepared.  9.hxg3  Qb6 !  The point of exchanging dark bishops - we immediately attack white's bishop.  10.a4  Carlsen's choice here against Caruana. White doesn't budge with his bishop.   10.Bxc6  bxc6 !  It is important to not recapture with the queen here as white will then get full control over e5 and his kingside attack will play itself. Taking with the b-pawn opens up the b-file, black's avenue for counterplay in this line.  11.Qc2  Rb8  Hitting b2.  12.Rb1  cxd4  Christof reached this position with black and opted for 12... Ba6, and ended up winning a very interesting game. 12... cxd4 is a slight improvement though with a similar idea.  13.cxd4  Ba6  The light squares around white's king suddenly become a bit vulnerable.  14.Ne5  Attacking c6.  Qb5  Threatening mate.  15.Nb3  Ne4  The knight helps fight for the c5 square from here.  16.f3  f6 !  Counterattacking white's knight.  17.Nxc6  Rfc8  18.fxe4  Qxc6  19.Qxc6  Rxc6 =  Black has no problems here thanks to his activity. If white doesn't give the pawn back, black's rook will be very strong on the second rank.  10...h6  11.O-O  Bd7  Preparing ... Nd7 soon, exchanging off white's bishop.  12.Qc2  Rfc8 =  Black is fine here, as his position has no real weaknesses.  8...b6  Getting our other bishop into the game.  9.Ne5   9.e4  Carrying out white's thematic pawn break.  Be7 !  An important retreat to remember. Taking on e4 just activates white's pieces, which we are trying to avoid. Instead, after ...Be7 it turns out that white's centre is under a bit of fire.  10.dxc5  White's best objective choice. 11. e5 looks promising, but after 11... Nh5 black can play a well-timed . ..f5 which stops white's kingside play in its tracks. Take a look at the model games chapter for an example of how play can proceed here.  bxc5  11.O-O  Re8 =  We reach a pretty balanced position with chances for both sides. Next black can play ...Qb6 and ...Bb7.   9.Qe2  White's plan is a gradual build-up in preparation for the e4 break.  Bb7  10.Rd1  Ne7 !  This is an interesting albeit rare idea with the point of . ..Ne7-f5-d6.  11.e4  The critical test and white's most common response. 11. O-O was used by Kramnik but black is fine there if he just continues with the plan of ...Ne7-f5-d6 to control the e4 square.  c4  12.Bc2  Nxe4  13.Nxe4  dxe4  14.Ng5  Bd5  Protecting c4.  15.Nxe4  Bc7  16.O-O  h6 =  Covering the g5 square. Next black can play . ..f5 and ...b5 with interesting play for both sides.  9...Bb7  10.f4  White's Stonewall setup has ambitions of starting a kingside attack. However, the light squares are weakened, in particular e4, which our knights will try to exploit.  Ne7 !  Bringing the knight to the kingside, where it is more useful. The knight is heading to f5.  11.Qf3  A natural and good square for white's queen.  Nf5  12.Bf2  The bishop gets out of the way of the g-pawn, preparing the g4-g5 pawn storm.  Be7 !  An important idea to remember. Our f5 knight will soon be kicked by g4, which means that it can now go to d6. With a knight on d6, our knights can make full use of our e4 outpost.  13.g4  Nd6  14.g5  Nfe4 =  Our knight on e4 is an absolute monster. White has extreme difficulties whipping up a kingside attack with his light bishop blocked by our knight on e4. Black is at least equal here, and the holes created on the light squares by white advancing his pawns so eagerly could be a serious problem for white in the future.   2.Nc3  2. Nc3 is known as the Veresov. White is making a not-so-subtle attempt to play e4, however blocking the c2 pawn is rarely a good idea.  d5  Of course, there's no need to allow white e4.  3.Bg5   3.Bf4  This is sometimes tried against Grunfeld players who fianchetto without thinking. White hopes to play Bh6 and whip up a strong kingside attack.  e6  Completely natural since we play the Nimzo.  4.e3  Bb4  The most active square for the bishop.  5.Bd3  c5  White's passive play allows us to carry out this break without much difficulty.  6.dxc5  Nbd7  We plan on regaining the c5 pawn with the knight so that we can grab the bishop pair later.  7.Nge2  a6 !  An important idea to remember in this variation. Black takes the b5 square away from white's knight and bishop.  8.Bg3  A prophylactic move directed against ...e5 recommended by GM Williams in his course on the Jobava Attack.  Nh5  Chasing the bishop pair.  9.e4  Nxc5 !  GM Williams only covers 9... Nxg3, after which I think I'd probably prefer black regardless, but this seems a bit stronger and has the advantage of not being analysed.  10.exd5  is another try, but white is struggling here too.   10.a3  A logical idea, forcing the capture on c3.  Bxc3+  11.Nxc3  At this point, black has an important strategic sequence we should keep in mind - we leave white with only his light bishop and put our pawns on dark squares, making white's bishop on d3 bad.  Nxg3  12.hxg3  d4 !  13.Nb1  A rather sad retreat, but white's best try. White doesn't want to block his queen's path to h5 and he can reactivate the knight via d2-f3.  e5  Closing the position, cementing the bad bishop on d3.  14.Qh5  Attacking e5.  Qc7  Of course, avoid castling here ! Only castle short when white does so since white has strong pressure down the h-file.  15.Nd2  Be6  16.Nf3  Nd7  Covering e5.  17.Ng5  Qb6  18.Nxe6  Qxe6  =+  Black's good knight vs bad bishop and extra space give him a comfortable edge here.  10...Nxg3  11.hxg3  Qxd5  12.O-O  Qd8  13.a3  Bxc3  Black has a number of promising continuations here, but this seems to lead to the simplest, most stable edge. 13... Ba5 to retain the bishop pair is good too.  14.Nxc3  Nxd3  15.cxd3  Bd7  =+  Black has a small but stable edge here thanks to his bishop and white's IQP.   3.e4 ?  This is an attempt to transpose to the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, but white is simply worse here.  Nxe4 !  The more accurate way to grab the pawn.  4.Nxe4  dxe4  5.f3  White sacrifices his pawn "permanently" now to try accelerate his development, but there simply isn't enough compensation here.   5.Bc4  Prioritising development.  Nc6  6.c3  e5 !  A typical central lever we will see in this variation.  7.d5  Ne7  Our knight is heading for g6.  8.f3  exf3  9.Nxf3  Ng6  ∓  Black is just a clean pawn up.  5...e5 !  Once again we employ these central break. White can't take the pawn and allow the exchange of queens.  6.Be3  exd4  7.Bxd4  Nc6 !  Playing forcefully and not giving white a chance to get any sort of initiative.  8.Bb5  Bd7  9.Bc3  Qh4+ !  Provoking kingside weaknesses.  10.g3  Qg5  -+  White's position is simply falling apart here and black is winning easily.  3...h6  A recommendation by Kaufman which is simple and strong. Just like in the Trompowsky, there's no need to fear the Bxf6 exchange. It opens up a diagonal for our bishop and surrenders the bishop pair.  4.Bxf6   4.Bh4  Retreating to h4 retains hopes of e4, but it never really works because black always has ... g5 at his disposal.  c5 !  A rare move but a strong one. We hit white's centre before he can solidify.  5.e3  cxd4  6.exd4  Nc6  7.Nf3  Bg4 =  Black has developed soundly and is at least equal.  4...exf6  5.e3  Bb4  The most active square for the bishop.  6.Bd3  c5  7.dxc5  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  O-O =  With white's ruined pawn structure, black is already doing well.   2.Bg5  The Trompowsky was popularised by a handful of English GMs. It was is one of white's most popular d4 deviations and also one of his best choices objectively.  d5 !  This is a simple reply recommended by GM Kaufman in his repertoire book. Black ignores the 'threat' of Bxf6 and stakes out his claim in the centre. Just like against the Veresov, the Bxf6 exchange is to black's advantage.  3.Bxf6  This should be critical, as this was surely white's idea behind his previous move. However, it is unclear if it is worth giving up the bishop pair to damage black's pawn structure.   3.e3  c5  4.Bxf6   4.c3  This is solid, but quite passive and not challenging at all.  Nc6  5.Nf3  Qb6 !  A thematic idea in such structures - b2 is surprisingly difficult to defend comfortably.  6.Qb3  c4  7.Qxb6  axb6 =  We reach a pretty standard endgame with a pawn structure that is known to be perfectly OK for black. Black can put his doubled b-pawns to use with ...b5-b4.   4.Nc3  White wants to put some pressure on d5, but this is questionable.  e6  Protecting d5.  5.Be2  Be7  6.Nf3  O-O  =+  White's knight on c3 is horribly misplaced and black has developed soundly.  4...gxf6  We can try use the same idea as in one of the previous lines and recapture with the e-pawn, but here it isn't quite as good since ...c5 is already played and we will most likely be left with an IQP. As a result, the g-pawn recapture is the choice of most top players.  5.dxc5   5.Nf3  Natural development.  Nc6  6.c4  White tries to challenge our centre before we get our pieces out.  cxd4  7.exd4  e5 !  An important idea to remember here. The f6 pawn plays the important role of supporting this central break. Our dark bishop enters the game and black takes over the initiative.  8.Nc3  Bb4  9.cxd5  exd4  10.Nxd4  Qxd5  11.Ndb5  Qe5+  12.Qe2  O-O  =+  Only black can be better in the upcoming endgame thanks to his bishop pair.  5...e6  Intending to simply regain the pawn.  6.Nf3  Bxc5  7.Be2  Nc6  8.O-O  O-O  9.c4  White attacks our centre.  d4 !  Allowing white to take on d5 would be disastrous since black's pawn structure would be ruined. So far, black has only taken on c4 and this is also OK, but .. .d4 should be a bit better even.  10.exd4  Nxd4  11.Nc3  f5  Taking e4 away from white's knight.  12.Nxd4  Qxd4  13.Qxd4  Bxd4 =  Black is completely fine.   3.Nd2  Developing the knight without blocking the c-pawn.  c5  4.dxc5  e6  5.e4  Bxc5 =  Black has no problems here at all. Note that e5 doesn't work because of .. .Qb6.  3...exf6  4.e3  Bd6  Black can just develop naturally here.  5.c4   5.Bd3  O-O  6.Nd2  c6 =  Black is rock solid, with the bishop pair to boot.  5...dxc4  6.Bxc4  O-O  7.Nc3  c6  8.Nf3  Nd7 =  Black has no problems at all thanks to his bishop pair. Next he can look at something like ...f5 followed by ...Nf6.   2.c3  This is not a critical line or anything, but it was commonly requested that we add a variation dealing with the Stonewall for white. The Stonewall can arise in many forms and move orders though, so it makes sense to show a single variation here with a focus on black's plans.  d5  3.e3  e6  4.f4  The "Stonewall" has been built - the f4, e3, d4 and e3 pawns. This gives white an unshakeable grip over the e5 square, typically used as an outpost for his knight. However, this comes at the expense of many things - most notably, white's poor bishop on c1 and the e4 outpost. White often needs to find a way to activate or exchange it - one common idea is the lengthy maneouvre Bc1-e2-e1-h4. Our first step in dealing with the Stonewall is to exchange white's good bishop, the light squared one.  c5  5.Nf3  Be7  6.Bd3  O-O  7.O-O  All natural moves so far from both sides.  b6 !  Preparing the aforementioned idea of exchanging light bishops with ...Ba6.  8.Qe2 !  Preventing ...Ba6.  a5 !  Once again planning ...Ba6, and this time white can't stop it.  9.Bd2  Ba6  10.Bxa6  Nxa6  =+  With white's good bishop exchanged, black already stands better here. Next we want to get our knights to control the e4 outpost - one way to do this is the manoeuvre ... Na6-c7-e8-d6. We will generally try to expand on the queenside by rolling the pawns forward, but sometimes opening up the centre with ...f6 and ...e5 is also a good idea. }
2... d5
{ Because of our choice against 1. Nf3   1...d5  , we have to play 2... d5 here in order to not get move-ordered. 2... e6 is otherwise, of course, a perfectly decent option. }
3. c4
{ 3.Bf4  is not an independent option, as it just transposes to the London System which we covered after 2. Bf4.  c5  4.e3  Nc6  transposing to 2. Bf4.   3.Bg5  The Torre attack, but it is not that effective against a ...Nf6 + ...d5 setup from black - usually it is a bit better against ...Nf6 and ...e6.  c5  A very rare move, but it has been played by a few top players recently and it scores very well. Just like in the Trompowsky and the Veresov, we see no reason for black to worry about the Bxf6 'threat'.  4.e3   4.Bxf6  exf6  5.e3  Nc6  6.c3  Be6  7.dxc5  Bxc5  8.Nbd2  a6 =  Black's bishop pair compensates for the weak, isolated d5 pawn.   4.dxc5  e6  5.e3  Bxc5  6.c4  O-O  7.Nc3  dxc4  8.Bxc4  h6  9.Bh4  Qxd1+  10.Rxd1  Nbd7 =  Black has no problems here at all.  4...Nc6  5.c3  Qb6 !  transposing to a line we looked at in the Trompowsky.   3.e3  While this can still tranpose into some other white lines, we will be looking at the Colle and the Colle-Zukertort in this variation. White focuses on his kingside development - he will get his bishop to d3 and then castle. After that, he needs to decide what to do with the dark bishop: if he leaves it on the c1-h6 diagonal, then it is a Colle, but if he fianchettos it on b2 then we are looking at a Colle-Zukertort. As a result, the Colle is defined by a pawn on c3 while the Colle-Zukertort is with a pawn on b3.  e6  4.Bd3  c5  5.b3  The Colle-Zukertort is a bit more active and challenging than the normal Colle. White fianchettos the dark bishop - this means that white has more control over e5 and better supported centre in general. White typically delays the planned e4 break until later, or foregoes it entirely and plays for c4 instead. A typical plan of white's here is to make of the active dark bishop by playing Ne5 followed by f4, entering a king of Stonewall structure.   5.c3  The Colle isn't too challenging to black. White generally plays for the idea of e4, but this is quite easy to counter.  b6  First black develops his queenside naturally - in both the Colle and the Colle-Zukertort, we will usually be playing ...b6, ... Bb7, ...Bd6, ...Nbd7 and ...O-O in one order or another. In this specific variation we prioritise ...b6 and ...Bb7 since we want to fight for the e4 square.  6.O-O  Bb7  7.Nbd2  Nbd7  8.Qe2  Again white prepares e4.   8.Re1  White is now ready to play the e4 break.  Ne4 !  An idea we will be seeing much more of later. The easiest way to prevent the e4 break is to put the knight there.  9.Qc2  f5  =+  Solidifying the knight on e4, with a good version of the Stonewall for black.  8...Ne4 !  Stopping e4.  9.Ne5  Nxe5  10.dxe5  Qc7  =+  Black's position is preferable, thanks to the weakness of the e5 pawn.  5...Nc6  In this case, since the fight for the e4 square is delayed until later, black can develop the knight to c6 without any issues - if white was planning a quick e4, the knight might have been in the way of our bishop on b7.  6.O-O  Bd6  7.Bb2  O-O  8.Nbd2  A natural developing move and white's main choice.   8.Ne5 ?!  is a bit inaccurate here, because black has a strong concrete response:  Qc7 !  Hitting the knight on e5.  9.f4  cxd4  10.exd4  Nb4 !  An important idea to keep in mind. ...Nb4 gains the bishop pair here.  11.Nc3  Nxd3  12.Qxd3  a6  =+  Black's bishop pair gives him a slight edge here.   8.c4  Challenging black in the centre here only leads to some exchanges.  cxd4  9.exd4  b6  10.Nbd2  Bb7 =  Black is super solid. It is difficult for white to make real progress here, since taking on d5 leaves him with a well-blockaded IQP.  8...b6  Developing our bishop.  9.Ne5  Bb7  10.a3  If white doesn't play for f4, his plan is a bit less clear.   10.f4  Rc8  A good square for the rook.  11.a3  Ne7 =  As we've seen before, bringing the knight to the kingside   f5  is usually a good maneovre for black, possible followed by ...Be7 and ...Nf5-d6 to exploit the e4 square.  10...Rc8  11.Qe2  Ne7 =  Black has no problems here.   3.g3  White heads for a Catalan setup with a delayed c4. This has the advantage of avoiding our chosen line against the Catalan with ....Bb4+, however it allows us to develop our light bishop actively outside the pawn chain, since black hasn't committed to ...e6 yet.  c6  Supporting d5 while allowing our light bishop to develop outside the pawn chain.  4.Bg2  Bg4  ...Bf5 is another good option.  5.O-O   5.c4  e6  6.h3  Bxf3 !  With white's king still uncastled, we have a nice way to simplify the position.  7.Bxf3  Bb4+ !  An idea which wouldn't be possible if white castled first.  8.Bd2  Bxd2+  9.Nxd2  Qb6  Attacking b2 and d4.  10.Qb3  Qxb3  11.axb3  Ke7 =  The closed nature of the position lends itself to black's knights. The position is roughly equal, but there's still plenty of play for both sides. Next black can consider developing his knight with ... Na6-c7. The closed nature of the position lends itself to black's knights. The position is roughly equal, but there's still plenty of play for both sides. Next black can consider developing his knight with ...Na6-c7.   5.Ne5  Attacking our bishop, but it is unclear if the knight is better placed on e5 than f3.  Bf5  6.O-O  Nbd7  7.c4  e6  Black can't take on e5 too early of course since d5 was not properly supported.  8.Nc3  Be7  9.Qb3  Qb6  10.Nxd7  Nxd7  11.e4  dxe4  12.Nxe4  O-O =  We reach a structure very typical for the Catalan but with our bishop outisde the pawn chain. Black is fine here, but of course there's plenty of play for both sides.  5...Nbd7  6.c4  e6  Note that this position can also be reached from 1. Nf3 move orders.  7.Qb3  White's most common move, attacking b7.   7.h3  Bf5  ...Bh5 is also possible, but from f5 the bishop controls the important e4 square.  8.Nc3  h6  Securing the bishop's retreat to h7 in the event of Nh4.  9.Nd2  Be7  10.e4  The typical break in Closed Catalan positions.  dxe4  11.Ndxe4  Nxe4  12.Nxe4  Nf6  13.Nc3  Qb6 =  An important finesse before castling. Black ties white's bishop down to the defence of b2. In general, white would have had a slight edge here if our bishop was on c8 or d7, but with the bishop actively placed outside the pawn chain black has no problems.   7.b3  Planning a queenside fianchetto.  Be7  8.Bb2  O-O  9.Nbd2  a5 !  A typical way for black to gain space on the queenside and harrass the fianchetto. The idea is of course to play ...a4-a3 if allowed.  10.a3  Prophylaxis against ...a4 - white would meet ...a4 now with b4.  h6  11.Re1  Bf5  Covering e4.  12.Ne5  Nxe5  13.dxe5  Nd7  14.e4  White's most popular move, but maybe not the best. Black is equal regardless.  dxe4  15.Nxe4  Nc5  =+  White seems to have overreached a bit in the last couple moves and now black's position is slightly preferable.  7...Qb6  8.Nc3  Be7  9.c5  Qxb3  10.axb3  Bxf3  Black exchanges his 'bad' bishop.  11.Bxf3  e5 ! =  White's bishop pair can't be fully utilised in this closed position. }
3... e6 { Necessary, in order to stay within our repertoire. } 4. Bg5
{ By developing his bishop to g5 first, before committing his knight, white keeps the option of putting his knight on d2 open. Otherwise, this typically transposes into other lines.   4.e3  White solidifies d4 but blocks his bishop in.  b6  Preparing to develop our light bishop.  5.b3  This pretty much leads to a kind of Colle-Zukertort with white having played c4.   5.Nc3  Delaying the development of the dark bishop for now.  Bb7  6.cxd5   6.Bd3  Bd6  Natural development.  7.O-O  O-O  8.b3  Nbd7  9.Bb2  a6  A useful multi-purpose move, taking b5 away from white's knight.  10.Rc1  Qe7  A good square for the queen and possibly preparing ... Ba3 in the future.  11.Na4  White's most popular move, with the idea of Ne5.  dxc4  12.bxc4  c5 =  Hitting back in the centre. Black has no problems here at all.  6...exd5  7.Bb5+  With the idea of provoking black's pawn to c6 before returning with the bishop to d3. The immediate 7. Bd3 doesn't seem to have much of an advantage over 7. Bb5+.  c6  8.Bd3  With the pawn on c6 blocking black's bishop, white wants to play e4.  Nbd7  9.O-O  Bd6  Natural development.  10.e4  Carrying out white's idea, but this isn't even dangerous.  dxe4  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  O-O =  Black has a few ways to play here, depending on what white does - ...Qc7 with the plan of ... c5 or ...Nf6 with pressure on d4.  5...Bb7  6.Bb2  Bd6  7.Bd3  O-O  8.O-O  Nbd7  9.Nbd2  Both sides have developed naturally and reached a fairly normal position.  Ne4 !  A typical idea, as we've seen before.  10.Qc2   10.Qe2  hardly seems challenging.  f5 =  with a good Stonewall for black.  10...f5  Once again, we head for a Stonewall structure in order to support our e4 knight.  11.cxd5  exd5  12.Ne5  c5 =  Black has good play, but there are plenty of chances for both sides. The position is roughly balanced. }
4... Bb4+ { The most in line with our repertoire. } 5. Nbd2
{ White's main independent try. White will try to prove that the bishop is a bit misplaced on b4, but on the other hand white's play has left the c4 pawn vulnerable.   5.Nc3  transposes straight into Chapter 2 after  h6   5.Bd2  is white's only other independent option, but this is not too challenging.  Be7  Black has basically been granted ...Be7 almost for free, as the bishop on d2 is not much better than it was on c1. Taking on d2 is also possible and it should also equalise without any hassles.  6.Nc3  c5 !  Black can take advantage of his 'extra tempo' by playing actively.  7.e3  Nc6  8.cxd5  exd5  9.dxc5  Bxc5  10.Bd3  O-O =  Black has a good IQP position where he can equalise fully at will by just playing ...d4. }
5... dxc4
{ As we saw in the Catalan, it is surprisingly difficult to recoup the c4 pawn in such situations where white's knight on d2 is pinned. }
6. Qc2
{ Trying to recoup the pawn with the queen has been white's main try.   6.Qa4+  Forcing our knight to c6.  Nc6  7.e3  Threatening Bxc4.  Qd5 !  The only way to hold onto the pawn.  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Qc2  b5  =+  Black secures the pawn with a good position.   6.e3  White plays simply and wants to recapture the pawn with his bishop.  b5  Protecting c4. Note that white doesn't have his usual pressure down the long diagonal here, like in the Catalan.  7.Be2  Bb7  8.O-O  O-O  9.b3  c3 !  There are other options, but black can give the pawn back now and get good play.  10.a3  Be7  11.Nb1  c5  Playing actively in the centre.  12.Nxc3  a6  =+  Black has good, active play and his positionally is definitely slightly preferable.   6.a3  White tries to take advantage of black's bishop's position immediately by winning the bishop pair. However, this does make regaining the c4 pawn even more difficult.  Bxd2+  7.Qxd2  O-O  8.e3  b5  9.a4  c6  =+  White lacks full compensation for the pawn. }
6... b5 { Simply protecting c4. } 7. a4 c6 8. Bxf6 gxf6 9. g3

1. d4 Nf6
{ In this chapter we will be dealing with white's various early deviations after 1. d4 - in other words, all white's options that are not a Nimzo-Indian, Ragozin or a Catalan. This means that options such as the Trompowsky, London and Veresov will be covered here. Naturally, we can't cover all of white's deviations in a single chapter, as there are simply far too many - however, we will recommend lines against the most common and most critical ones. Against any deviations not covered yet, common sense development should suffice for equality. After analysing the d4 deviations white can throw at us, it became apparent that it's best to go for lines which are low-theory, safe and solid. There's already enough theory as it is in the Nimzo-Indian and Ragozin without learning more against rare white tries. One of the difficult things about learning to counter many of these d4 deviations is the fact that white can switch up the move order very easily and there are plenty of transpositions. This is why we recommend, for this chapter especially, to pay more attention to the plans and development schemes we use. }
2. Bf4
{ The London has become quite popular at all levels recently. It has a reputation for being solid and reliable. Top players often play it so they can just get a game without much theory, while club players like it since it cuts down on how much time they need to learn the opening. }
2... d5
{ The obvious choice and the one most in line with the rest of our repertoire. }
3. e3
{ Other move orders over the next few moves are also possible, but pretty much all white's moves lead to the same position at the end. }
3... c5
{ The main way to challenge white's setup is to play actively and occupy the centre. }
4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Nbd2 e6 6. c3 Bd6
{ A good square for the bishop, where it can neutralise its counterpart. } 7.
Bg3
{ White would prefer to trade dark bishops on g3, where he can recapture with the h-pawn. }
7... O-O { Black shouldn't be in any rush to exchange dark bishops. } 8. Bb5
{ This is quite a long way in popularity behind 8. Bd3, but it was favoured by Carlsen when he played the London. With 8. Bb5 white fights for control of the e5 square. }
8... Bxg3
{ Black scores quite badly here, but I don't see anything wrong with black's position if he is prepared. }
9. hxg3 Qb6
{ The point of exchanging dark bishops - we immediately attack white's bishop. }
10. a4
{ Carlsen's choice here against Caruana. White doesn't budge with his bishop. }
10... h6 11. O-O Bd7 { Preparing ... Nd7 soon, exchanging off white's bishop. }
12. Qc2 Rfc8 { Black is fine here, as his position has no real weaknesses. } *

{ An important retreat to remember. Taking on e4 just activates white's pieces, which we are trying to avoid. Instead, after ...Be7 it turns out that white's centre is under a bit of fire. }
10. dxc5
{ White's best objective choice. 11. e5 looks promising, but after 11... Nh5 black can play a well-timed . ..f5 which stops white's kingside play in its tracks. Take a look at the model games chapter for an example of how play can proceed here. }

This means that options such as the Trompowsky, London and Veresov will be covered here. Naturally, we can't cover all of white's deviations in a single chapter, as there are simply far too many - however, we will recommend lines against the most common and most critical ones.

{ This is not a critical line or anything, but it was commonly requested that we add a variation dealing with the Stonewall for white. The Stonewall can arise in many forms and move orders though, so it makes sense to show a single variation here with a focus on black's plans. }
2... d5 3. e3 e6 4. f4
{ The 'Stonewall' has been built - the f4, e3, d4 and e3 pawns. This gives white an unshakeable grip over the e5 square, typically used as an outpost for his knight. However, this comes at the expense of many things - most notably, white's poor bishop on c1 and the e4 outpost. White often needs to find a way to activate or exchange it - one common idea is the lengthy maneouvre Bc1-e2-e1-h4. Our first step in dealing with the Stonewall is to exchange white's good bishop, the light squared one. }

10. Bxa6 Nxa6
{ With white's good bishop exchanged, black already stands better here. Next we want to get our knights to control the e4 outpost - one way to do this is the manoeuvre ... Na6-c7-e8-d6. We will generally try to expand on the queenside by rolling the pawns forward, but sometimes opening up the centre with ...f6 and ...e5 is also a good idea. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Key Points@@HeaderEnd@@
 This chapter deals with the 1.Nf3.   Our choice here is 1...d5. This takes full advantage of white's move order, while also giving us the opportunity to transpose back into the Ragozin if white transposes by playing d4 at some point.   We meet the critical try 2.c4 by playing 2...d4! followed by 3...f6!. Black is doing well here, but it is important to know some theory as the positions are quite unconventional, especially if you do not play 1.d4 as white.   The kingside fianchetto 2.g3 is handled solidly, with moves such as ...c6, ...Bg4, ...Nf6, ...e6 and ...Bd6. }
1. Nf3
{ 1. Nf3 is probably white's most flexible first move. He has yet to commit a pawn, which means that the game can transpose into an 1. e4, 1. d4 or 1. c4 opening - or else it can stay in independent waters with a b3 or g3 setup. White's flexibility means that black must be very careful when deciding on a line against 1. Nf3. If we are careless, it is very easy for white to move order us into a position where we are tricked out of our repertoire against 1. d4. This is why it is very useful to have repertoires against 1. d4 include suggestions against 1. Nf3 - due to the possible transpositions. }
1... d5
{ Two of the openings specifically targeted by 1. Nf3 players are the Nimzo/ Queen's Indian and the Grunfeld. Fortunately, the fact that this repertoire is based on the Ragozin means that we are very well-placed to meet 1. Nf3, since our setup involves ...d5 at some point. 1... d5 is often seen as the 'strongest' option black has against 1. Nf3, due to the fact that white's options are more limited than after 1... Nf6, for example. }
2. c4
{ Hitting our d5 pawn is probably white's most critical try.   2.d4  transposes straight back to 1. d4 line after  Nf6  We are bound to reach the Ragozin, Catalan or a d4 deviation from here.   2.b3  Via a clever move order, white cuts out the most challenging line against the Nimzo-Larsen Attack with 1. b3, which is 1... e5. However, the queenside fianchetto should give black no real problems regardless.  Nf6  3.Bb2  Bf5  Getting the bishop outside the pawn chain.  4.e3  e6  5.Be2  h6  Securing the h7 retreat square for our light bishop.  6.O-O  Bd6  The better square for the bishop, where it can fight for the e5 square.  7.c4  c6  8.Nc3  O-O =  Black is rock solid with no problems at all.   2.g3  Another very flexible second move, which is actually white's most common try. This is often played with the idea of heading into a Reti, however black needs to be careful here. If he plays normal, standard developing moves, he can easily end up in a Catalan, where white has cut out our chosen variation with ... Bb4-e7 - for example, 2... Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. d4 Be7 5. c4, and all of a sudden we reach a Catalan position that is outside this repertoire.  c6 !  One way to take advantage of white's move order. We have not yet blocked in our light bishop with ...e6 and we intend to take advantage of this.  3.c4  White will try to exploit our bishop missing from the queenside by attacking the light squares which were left unprotected - b7 in particular.   3.Bg2  White doesn't have to go for the c4 break - instead he can also play in the style of the King's Indian by planning an e4 break.  Bg4  Developing the bishop actively.  4.O-O  e6  5.d3  Bd6  6.Nbd2  Ne7 !  It is important to remember to develop the knight to this square instead of f6, because otherwise e4-e5 could become a problem.  7.e4  Nd7  Covering e5.  8.h3  Bh5  9.Re1  O-O =  Black is solid in the centre and can look to grab space on the queenside perhaps with .. .a5-a4.  3...Bg4  Developing the bishop actively outside the pawn chain.  4.Bg2   4.Ne5  tries to take advantage of the bishop's position on g4, but the knight is misplaced on e5.  Be6  5.Bg2  Nd7  Trading off the knight.  6.cxd5  Bxd5 =  Black clearly has no issues here.   4.Qb3  White tries to take advantage of the unprotected b7 pawn immediately.  Bxf3  5.exf3   5.Qxf3  e6  6.Bg2  Nf6 =  Black has a rock solid position, with his bad bishop having been exchanged off and all his remaining central pawns on light squares.  5...Qc7  6.d4  e6  7.Nc3  dxc4  8.Bxc4  Nd7 =  Black has a rock solid setup again, with his bad bishop exchanged off.  4...e6  Solid, defending d5.  5.O-O  White's most common move.   5.cxd5  Bxf3  Taking on d5 with the e-pawn is also possible.  6.Bxf3  cxd5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.Nc3  Nf6 =  In this closed position white's bishop pair is not very effective.   5.Qb3  Qb6  The standard response to an attack on b7.  6.d3  Nd7  7.Be3  Qxb3  8.axb3  a6 =  Black has equalised comfortably in this endgame.  5...Nf6  6.d4  We reach a Catalan-like structure, except with our light bishop outside the pawn chain. Naturally, this is in our favour.   6.b3  White plays more subtly with the idea of fianchettoing his dark bishop.  Nbd7  7.Bb2  Bd6  The better square for the bishop, where it can fight for e5.  8.d3  O-O  9.Nbd2  Re8  Preparing ...e5.  10.Qc2  e5 =  Black's centre is well-supported and he has no problems here.  6...Nbd7  transposes to a line we cover in the d4 Deviations chapter.   2.e3  A tricky move order idea advocated by GM Axel Smith in 'e3 Poison.' The point is to follow up with 3. c4 without allowing black the option of ...d4, which is strong against 2. c4. However, the drawback of e3 is that it rules out any kingside fianchetto ideas commits white's bishop to the f1-a6 diagonal.  Nf6  Black has many other setups at his disposal, such as Slav ideas based on . ..c6, however the Queen's Gambit Declined style scheme we opted for is most in-line with this repertoire.  3.c4  e6  4.b3  c5  The second most common move behind 4. ..Be7.4... c5 exploits the fact that white has delayed d4 and we threaten to play ...d4 ourselves.  5.Bb2  Nc6  Threatening ...d4.  6.cxd5  The alternative 6. Be2 leads to problems for white after 6... d4 !. White is almost forced to take on d5 as a result.  exd5  7.Be2  The recommendation for white in 'e3 Poison.'   7.Bb5  White's most popular move.  Bd6  The near inevitability of an IQP position after d4 means that our bishop is best placed actively on d6 where it can pressurise white's kingside.  8.O-O  O-O  9.d4  cxd4  10.Nxd4  We reach an IQP position where it seems like white has managed to achieve a nice blockade on d4, however he has fallen a bit behind in development and black can use his activity to create threats on the kingside.  Bc7 !  Other moves like 10... Bd7 are possible, but this seems stronger. Black indirectly defends c6 by threatening ...Qd6.  11.Be2  Qd6  12.g3  After 12. Nf3 black can simply play ... Bg4 with a good position.  Bb6  Putting pressure on d4, effectively preventing white from developing his other knight.  13.Ba3  Qe5 !  ...Bc5 is also possible, but black gets very good compensation for the exchange in this line.  14.Bxf8  Kxf8  15.Nd2  Nxd4  16.exd4  Qxd4 =  Black's pawn, bishop pair and activity offer full compensation for the pawn. Wei Yi went on to win a good game as black against Matlakov from here.   7.d4  is not accurate. White shouldn't play d4 before black has moved his dark bishop since black can take on d4 followed by ...Bb4+.  cxd4  8.Nxd4  Bb4+ !  Exploiting white's inaccuracy and forcing white's bishop to c3 where it is misplaced.  9.Bc3  a5 ! =  Another good option is just to pull the bishop back to d6 as white's bishop is misplaced on c3. Either way, black is fully equal.  7...d4 !  Claiming more space and threatening ...d3, this must be one of the critical tests of white's opening. At first sight however, it seems like black's d4 pawn is unsupported and bound to be captured.  8.Bb5  The move given for white in 'e3 Poison'.   8.exd4  Less common than 8. Bb5.  cxd4  9.Bb5  Bc5  10.Qe2+  Be6 =  Black is fine here. The d4 pawn is well-supported and Ng5 can simply be met by ...O-O.  8...Bd6 !  It is mentioned in 'e3 Poison' that black cannot hold onto d4 and this is true, but this doesn't mean that black has any issues at all ! In fact, black can ignore the d4 pawn and complete development quickly, after which his active pieces more than compensate for the pawn deficit.  9.exd4   9.O-O  O-O  10.Bxc6  bxc6  11.exd4  cxd4  12.Bxd4  Bg4 =  Black's bishop pair and activity fully compensate for the pawn.  9...O-O !  Black ignores the d4 pawn. Development is the priority here.  10.dxc5  Re8+  11.Be2  Bxc5  12.O-O  Bg4  13.Nc3  Qd6 =  With the idea of ...Qf4 followed by . ..Rad8. All of black's pieces are very active and the d-pawn is weak, meaning that black is at least equal here. }
2... d4
{ Only black's third most common move, but one which is rapidly gaining in popularity. The other moves, 2... e6 and 2.. .c6 often give white exactly what he wants - a positional game where white can put pressure on black's centre. Instead, 2... d4 radically alters the nature of a position, into one which resembles a reversed Benoni. The extra tempo white has in this Benoni has been shown to be not as useful as white would hope, meaning that black should not have any problems here - as long as he learns the theory. }
3. b4
{ White's second most common move. Typically in a normal Benoni with reversed colours, black's pawn would already be on c5, which dissuades white from playing the immediate b4, although it still is played as a sacrifice - the Benko Gambit. White takes advantage of his extra tempo by playing b4 immediately, without having to sacrifice a pawn. He wants to develop his bishop to b2 and prevent black from supporting his d4 pawn with ... c5. However, on the other hand, the b4 pawn will probably need to be defended once our e-pawn moves, since ...Bxb4 will be a threat.   3.g3  This is white's most common move, but it is completely non-critical. Black has a free hand to solidify his extra space in reverse Benoni structure.  Nc6  Black's most common choice. 3... c5 is also common, but this has the perk of leaving c5 free for another piece.  4.Bg2  e5  5.d3   5.O-O  This move order tries to avoid the ...Bb4+ idea we use against the 5. d3 move order, but it allows another idea.  e4 !  Kicking the knight away. Black's centre seems over extended, but fortunately we have no intention of defending it - instead, we are conjuring up a kingside attack.  6.Ne1  h5 !  The kingside attack gets under way.  7.Bxe4  Surely the critical option.   7.d3  This is white's other idea which has been played a few times.  e3 !  8.fxe3  h4  =+  With good play for the pawn.  7...h4  Keeping up the kingside attack.  8.d3  Bh3  9.Ng2  hxg3  10.fxg3  Qd7  =+  Black has full compensation for the pawn.  5...Bb4+  A clever idea which features in this position with reversed colours as well. By checking before white castles, he lures a minor piece to d2 which will block white's other minor piece from developing.  6.Bd2   6.Nbd2  a5  Pre-emptively preventing a3 and b4.  7.a3  Be7  8.O-O  Nf6  =+  Black has a slight edge here. Long-term he should look at carrying out either the ...e4 or the ...b5 break.  6...a5  Taking on d2 is also playable.  7.O-O  Nf6  8.Na3  O-O  =+  Once again, black's position is slightly preferable here.   3.e3  Possibly white's sharpest option against 2... d4. White immediately challenges our centre before we get enough time to solidify our extra space.  Nc6  Black's most common choice and the preference of most top players recently. 3.. .c5 is also playable of course, but 3... Nc6 is solid and equalises.  4.exd4   4.b4 ?!  A pawn sacrifice of dubious objective strength.  dxe3  5.fxe3  Nxb4  Black has no reason to grab the pawn.  6.d4  e5 !  7.a3  Grabbing the pawn with the knight leads to problems after 7... Qh4+.  Nc6  8.d5  White's most popular move.  e4 !  An important counter attack.  9.Nfd2  Ne5  10.Nxe4  Black has given the pawn back, but his activity gives him a huge amount of play.  Qh4+  11.Nf2  Bd6  ∓  Our development advantage and threats give us a clear advantage.   4.d3  e5  5.exd4  exd4  We reach a symmetrical Benoni structure where it seems like only black can be for choice.  6.Be2  Nf6  7.O-O  Be7  8.Na3  O-O  9.Nc2  Both sides have developed quite naturally. White wants to target the d4 pawn, while black should be planning the ...b5 break at some point.  a5  10.b3  Rb8  Preparing ...b5.  11.Bb2  Bc5  12.a3  b5 =  Black has equalised, but there are chances for both sides here.  4...Nxd4  5.Nxd4  Qxd4  White hopes that he will be able to exploit our queen on d4.  6.Nc3  c6  Very natural, limiting white's knight by taking away the b5 square.  7.d3  Nh6  Black's knight is heading to f5 where it can fight for the d4 square and hit a bishop if it lands on e3. Note that taking on h6 doubles black's h-pawns, but this is nothing compared to the activity we get from our bishop pair.  8.Be3  Qd8  9.d4  Nf5  Hitting d4 and the bishop on e3.  10.Qd2  g6  Fianchettoing the bishop to attack d4.  11.Be2  Bg7  12.Rd1  O-O =  Black has easy play against d4. }
3... f6
{ Black's most common move. Parallels can be drawn between this ...f6 with .. .e5 idea and the 5. f3 variation in the Benko Gambit. By playing for ...e5, black is going to develop his dark bishop actively on the f8-a3 diagonal, but on the other hand the most natural square for our kingside knight, f6, is now occupied. Another interesting option for black is 3... Bg4 which is worth taking a look at. }
4. e3
{ Attacking black's centre quickly is a logical way to challenge our play.   4.d3  Very natural and white's second most common choice.  e5  5.a3  c5  An idea we will be seeing much more of. The c5 pawn supports d4 and attacks b4, and if white takes then our bishop gets to develop to a good square for free.  6.bxc5  Allowing black's bishop to c5 isn't challenging either.   6.g3 ?!  Sacricing b4, but it is doubtful that white gets enough compensation.  cxb4  Grabbing the pawn.  7.Bg2  Nc6  8.O-O  a5  =+  White definitely doesn't have enough compensation for the pawn here.  6...Bxc5  7.g3  Ne7  8.Bg2  O-O  9.O-O  Nbc6  =+  Black is very comfortable.   4.Bb2  Developing and hitting d4.  e5  5.a3  Protecting b4.   5.e3  A common idea we will be seeing in this chapter. White attacs d4 before black has a chance to support and reinforce his centre.  dxe3  Holding the pawn on d4 is impossible.  6.fxe3  Bxb4  Black has no reason not to grab the pawn.  7.a3  Be7  =+  White doesn't have full compensation for the pawn. Black can continue with ...Nh6 and ...O-O.  5...c5 !  A common idea we will be seeing. White is faced with the unpleasant choice of taking on c5, thus allowing our bishop to develop to a good square, or leaving black's pawn on c5 which does a great job of supporting d4.  6.bxc5  Bxc5  =+  Black has a good position here. Natural development and castling can follow.   4.Na3  White's 4th most common move. The knight is headed to c2 where it can put pressure on d4.  e5  5.Nc2  c5  6.bxc5  Bxc5  7.d3  Nc6 =  Once again, black has no issues at all. }
4... e5 5. c5
{ A clever idea. White protects b4 and simultaneously cuts off support to d4 by blocking black from playing ...c5.   5.exd4 ?  This is very natural, but it is a mistake. Black doesn't have to recapture.  e4 !  Kicking white's knight back.  6.Qe2  Qe7  7.Ng1  Nc6  8.Bb2  Nxb4  ∓  Black regains his pawn with a clear advantage. }
5... a5 { We strike at the pawn supporting c5. } 6. Qa4+
{ This seems strange, but white has a concrete idea in mind. } 6... Bd7
{ White has lured our bishop to d7, where it is actually quite misplaced since it cuts off our queen's access to d4. }
7. b5 Bxc5 8. Bc4
{ The bishop is quite irritating here as it prevents us from castling. } 8...
Ne7 9. exd4 exd4 10. Ba3 Na6 { Quite a clever way to defend c5. } 11. O-O Nb4
{ The knight is strong on b4. Black has equalised - he can follow up with ...c6. }

1. --
{ In this course we decided to cover 1.Nf3 in addition to 1.d4 due to the similarities between these moves. Usually, what you play against 1.Nf3 depends heavily on what your defence against 1.d4 is. Your lines against 1.c4 similarly depend on what you play against 1.d4, however against 1.c4 black has 2 additional, independent options in the form of 1...e5 and 1...c5. Playing in Nimzo-Indian style with 1...Nf6, 2...e6 and 3...Bb4 is possible against the English, but it does allow white some tricky additional options such as the Mikenas Attack. As a result, we recommend meeting 1.c4 with either 1...e5 or 1...c5 to avoid any transposition tricks white might try. }

1. Nf3
{ 1. Nf3 is probably white's most flexible first move. He has yet to commit a pawn, which means that the game can transpose into an 1. e4, 1. d4 or 1. c4 opening - or else it can stay in independent waters with a b3 or g3 setup.

1. Nf3
{ 1. Nf3 is probably white's most flexible first move. He has yet to commit a pawn, which means that the game can transpose into an 1. e4, 1. d4 or 1. c4 opening - or else it can stay in independent waters with a b3 or g3 setup. White's flexibility means that black must be very careful when deciding on a line against 1. Nf3. If we are careless, it is very easy for white to move order us into a position where we are tricked out of our repertoire against 1. d4. This is why it is very useful to have repertoires against 1. d4 include suggestions against 1. Nf3 - due to the possible transpositions. }
1... d5
{ Two of the openings specifically targeted by 1. Nf3 players are the Nimzo/ Queen's Indian and the Grunfeld. Fortunately, the fact that this repertoire is based on the Ragozin means that we are very well-placed to meet 1. Nf3, since our setup involves ...d5 at some point. 1... d5 is often seen as the 'strongest' option black has against 1. Nf3, due to the fact that white's options are more limited than after 1... Nf6, for example. }
2. c4 { Hitting our d5 pawn is probably white's most critical try. } 2... d4
{ Only black's third most common move, but one which is rapidly gaining in popularity. The other moves, 2... e6 and 2.. .c6 often give white exactly what he wants - a positional game where white can put pressure on black's centre. Instead, 2... d4 radically alters the nature of a position, into one which resembles a reversed Benoni. The extra tempo white has in this Benoni has been shown to be not as useful as white would hope, meaning that black should not have any problems here - as long as he learns the theory. }
3. b4
{ White's second most common move. Typically in a normal Benoni  (with reversed colours)  , black's pawn would already be on c5, which dissuades white from playing the immediate b4  (although it still is played as a sacrifice - the Benko Gambit)  . White takes advantage of his extra tempo by playing b4 immediately, without having to sacrifice a pawn. He wants to develop his bishop to b2 and prevent black from supporting his d4 pawn with ... c5. However, on the other hand, the b4 pawn will probably need to be defended once our e-pawn moves, since ...Bxb4 will be a threat. }
3... f6
{ Black's most common move. Parallels can be drawn between this ...f6 with .. .e5 idea and the 5. f3 variation in the Benko Gambit. By playing for ...e5, black is going to develop his dark bishop actively on the f8-a3 diagonal, but on the other hand the most natural square for our kingside knight, f6, is now occupied. Another interesting option for black is 3... Bg4 which is worth taking a look at. }
4. Bb2 { Developing and hitting d4. } 4... e5 5. a3 { Protecting b4. } 5... c5
{ A common idea we will be seeing. White is faced with the unpleasant choice of taking on c5, thus allowing our bishop to develop to a good square, or leaving black's pawn on c5 which does a great job of supporting d4. }
6. bxc5 Bxc5
{ Black has a good position here. Natural development and castling can follow. }

This had the idea of preventing c5, but this comes at the cost of weakening the light squares   a6  , which in turn makes it very difficult for black to fight for control of the c-file.   15...c5 !  seemed like the most logical response at the time and an easy equaliser, but then I spotted that after  16.cxd5  cxd4  white can play  17.e4  and here I thought black was simply worse after  Bg6  However I missed the very strong intermezzo   17...d3 !  18.Bxd3  Nc5  19.Bc2   19.Ke2  Nxd3  20.Kxd3  Rxd5+ =  19...Bxe4  20.Nxe4  Nxe4  21.Bxe4  Rfe8  22.f3  f5 ! =  and black regains his piece.  18.g4 !  ±  Black's pawn on d4 will drop soon.   15...dxc4  was also playable, but white might have some slight pressure after  16.Nxc4  Be6  17.Na5  Rb8  18.Bf3 =  although it is also close to equal.  16.O-O  The immediate   16.cxd5  was even better.  16...Be6  17.cxd5  cxd5   17...Bxd5  +=  would have been better in hindsight.  18.Rfc1  Nb8 ?!  Trying to prevent ...Ba6, but this was just too passive. After  19.Rc7  ±  my position continued to deteriorate and I ended up getting outplayed, costing me my 2nd IM norm by 1 performance rating point. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 d5 7. Nf3 dxc4 8.
Qxc4 b6 9. Bg5 Ba6 10. Qa4 h6
{ We opted for the immediate 10... c5 in this position, but both moves are very similar. }
11. Bh4 c5 12. dxc5 bxc5 13. Rc1
{ 13.Rd1  is another option.  Qb6  14.Bxf6  gxf6 = } 13... Qd7
{ This has been played a few times, but the most common choice is   13...Qb6 }
14. Qxd7 Nbxd7
{ This endgame is approximately equal, but of course plenty of play remains. The apparent weakness of c5 is not so bad since it can be easily defended and not so easily attacked, while white's b2-pawn is also weak. }
15. Bxf6
{ 15.e3  c4 !?   15...Bxf1  is also fine.  16.Bxf6  gxf6  17.Bxc4   17.b3  Rfc8 =   17.b4  Nb6 =  17...Rfc8  18.b3  Rab8 =  Black has plenty of play and will regain his pawn shortly. }
15... Nxf6
{ 15...gxf6  is more natural to keep the knight covering c5, but Aronian doesn't want his pawn structure damaged. }
16. e3
{ 16.Rxc5 ??  is incredibly a losing mistake:  Rfc8  17.Rxc8+  Rxc8  18.Kd2  Ne4+  19.Ke3  Nd6  -+  Black's activity is decisive. }
16... Bb7 17. Ne5 { 17.Rxc5 ?  is poor once again.  Rac8 ∓ } 17... Rfd8 18. f3
Nd7 { 18...Rac8  is better. } 19. Nxd7 Rxd7 20. Bb5 Rc7 21. Rf1
{ 21.Kf2  should leave white with a slight edge due to the weak c5-pawn.  a5 !  22.Rhd1  Ba6  23.Bxa6  Rxa6  24.Rd8+  Kh7 }
21... Rb8 22. Bc4 Bc6 23. Rf2 Rcb7 { Targeting the weak b2 pawn. } 24. Rcc2 Ba4
25. Rcd2 Kf8 26. e4 Ke7
{ White has missed his chance to take advantage of the slightly better endgame he had and put Aronian under pressure. From here one, we will see Aronian take the initiative and begin squeezing Wojtaszek. }
27. Rfe2 g5 { A good positional move, fixing white's pawns on light squares. }
28. Kf2 Rb6 29. e5
{ Perhaps not a mistake, but this is a concession - the pawn on e5 is a bit weak and it gives Aronian something to play against. As we shall see, black manages to convert this tiny detail into the full point. }
29... Bb3 30. Bxb3 Rxb3 31. Rc2 R8b5 32. Red2
{ The rook endgame seems very equal, objectively, however Aronian manages to find ways to pose white problems nonetheless. }
32... Kf8
{ The aforementioned weak e5 pawn comes under scrutiny. Black is reactivating his king on the kingside in order to attack the e5 pawn from f5. }
33. Kg3 Kg7 34. h4 Kg6 35. hxg5 hxg5 36. Kg4
{ White has prevented the king incursion into f5, but now black can activate his rooks. }
36... Re3 37. Re2 Rd3 { Preparing to check white's king away from g4. } 38. Rc4
{ 38.Red2  can be met by  (c4 ! =+) } 38... Rd4+ 39. Rxd4 cxd4
{ Black's advantage is still very minimal, but white needs to be a bit accurate now. }
40. b4
{ 40.f4 !  is necessary here.  f5+  41.exf6  Kxf6  42.b4  gxf4  43.Kxf4 =  and white should hold. }
40... f5+ { 40...Rd5  would have been better first. } 41. Kg3
{ Wojtaszek blunders after reaching the time control.   41.exf6  Kxf6  42.f4  gxf4  43.Kxf4 =  with a draw still the expected result. }
41... f4+ 42. Kg4
{ 42.Kf2  allows black's king to f5 next with a winning advantage.  d3  43.Rd2  Rd5  -+ }
42... d3 43. Rd2 Rxe5 44. Rxd3 Re1
{ It becomes clear that white can't deal with the weakness of the g2 pawn as well as the mate threat of ...Rh1-h4. }
45. Rd8 Rg1 46. Rg8+ { 46.Kh3  just leads to mate after  Rh1+  47.Kg4  Rh4# }
46... Kf6
{ 46...Kf6  White resigned on account of  47.Rf8+  Ke7  48.Rg8   48.Ra8  Rxg2+  49.Kh5  Kf6  -+  48...Rxg2+  49.Kh5  Kf6  -+ }

15. Bf4 Nxf4 16. gxf4 f5 17. e3 Bb7
{ We have examined everything up until here previously, and at this point we recommended 17... Rf6 immediately, but the text move is equally good. }
18. Qe2
{ 18.Rac1  was tried previously as well, but this also ended badly for white as black's seemingly innocuous attack prevailed:  Rf6  19.Qa4  Rg6  20.Ne2  a5 ?!  Unnecessary.  21.Ng3  h5 !  Getting black's attack going, with a very nice tactical idea behind it.  22.Nxh5 ??  Falling for the tactic.  Rxg2+  23.Kxg2  Qe8  -+  Threatening ...c5+ and ...Qxh5 simultaneously - white's losing 2 pieces for a rook and pawn, but black's already winning with his bishop pair and attack to boot. }
18... Rf6
{ An important idea to remember - our rook is heading to h6 so we can whip up an attack. }
19. Rd2
{ White's plan is certainly the wrong one. The doubling of the rooks on the d-file is too slow and ineffective while black's attack develops at an alarming pace. }
19... Rh6 20. Rad1 { Continuing down the wrong plan. } 20... Bd6
{ Improving the position of his bishop slightly - black is preparing the ...g5 break, after which the bishop will be ideally placed. }
21. h3
{ Trying to close the h-file, but white's position is already critical. } 21...
Kh8
{ Preparing the ...g5 break by getting the king out of the way. White is verging on being lost already. }
22. Nb5 { Trying to exchange off black's dark bishop. } 22... Bb8
{ Of course, black should not oblige. } 23. Na3 g5
{ And black's attack gets under way. } 24. fxg5 Qxg5 25. f4 Qg7 26. Kh2 Rg8 27.
Qf2 c5 { The last of black's piece joins the attack with decisive effect. } 28.
dxc5
{ 28.Bxb7 ??  loses to a simple tactic:  Rxh3+ !  29.Kxh3  Qg4+  30.Kh2  Qh5+  with mate next. }
28... e5 { Black's dark bishop rejoins the attack. } 29. Rd8 exf4 30. Rxb8
{ A desperate sacrifice but the game is lost already. } 30... Rxb8 31. Bxb7
Rxh3+ { A nice little tactic to finish white off. } 32. Kxh3 Qg4+ 33. Kh2 Qh5+
34. Kg1 Qxd1+ 35. Kh2 Qh5+ 36. Kg1 Rg8+

9. e4 Be7 { Black's best option, covered in the theoretical section. } 10. e5
{ We mentioned that this might be a bit premature, but it is still very popular and scores reasonably well for white. }
10... Nh5 11. a3
{ A prophylactic move, preparing for black's queenside expansion.   11.Ng5  is white's most popular move.  Bxg5  12.Qxh5  g6  13.Qe2  cxd4  14.h4  Bh6  15.h5  dxc3  16.bxc3  Bg7 =  Black is fine here objectively and has scored well in practice.   16...g5 !?  is also possible. }
11... a5
{ A nice idea to remember, preparing to exchange off the light bishop which is crucial to white's attack with ...Ba6. }
12. Qe2 { Preventing ...Ba6. } 12... Ra7
{ The rook could possibly aid in the defence of black's king along the seventh rank. }
13. O-O c4 14. Bc2 b5 { Black gets his queenside pawns rolling. } 15. h4
{ An interesting idea. White prepares to drop his bishop back to h2.   15.Nh4 ?!  g6  leaves white with nothing better than  16.Nhf3 }
15... g6
{ 15...Nxg3 !  was necessary. The newly-opened f-file is not ideal, but it was better than the text move.  16.fxg3  f5 !  Closing the kingside and securing black's king.   16...b4  is another, more double-edged option.  17.Qe3   17.exf6 ?!  simply doesn't work due to  (gxf6 ∓)  17...h6 = }
16. Bh2 { Sacrificing the h4-pawn to keep his bishop alive. } 16... Bxh4 17. g4
{ 17.Nxh4  was stronger.  Qxh4  18.Nf3  Qd8  19.g4  Ng7  20.Kg2  ±  and black is in trouble with the open h-file posing him some serious problems. }
17... Ng7 18. Nxh4
{ 18.Qe3 !?  was maybe a better follow-up.  Be7  19.Kg2  f5  20.exf6  Bxf6  +=  The position is still very complicated, although white's position seems simpler to play. }
18... Qxh4 19. Kg2 f5
{ A vital break on the kingside so black can activate his second rook and get some counterplay. }
20. exf6 Qxf6 21. Bd6 Rff7 22. f4 { Allowing black a nice tactical shot... }
22... e5 { Suddenly, the tables have turned and black is on the attack. } 23.
dxe5 { 23.fxe5 ?  Qg5  -+  and g4 falls. } 23... Qh4 24. f5 gxf5
{ In a very complex position, Nakamura misses his chance.   24...Nxf5 !  25.Bxf5   25.gxf5 ??  Opening the g-file is a disaster for white.  gxf5 -+  25...gxf5  26.e6  Rg7  ∓ }
25. Rh1 Qd8 26. Qe3 d4
{ Sacrificing a pawn to try get the light bishop into the game.   26...h5 !  ∞  is the engine's choice and a very difficult move to find. }
27. cxd4 Ne8 { Trying to exchange white's bishop off.   27...Bb7  28.Kf2 !  ± }
28. Rh6
{ The complications are wild, but white should have dropped his bishop back here.   28.Bc5  +- }
28... Rg7 29. Rg1 Rad7

Ne7 31. Bxe7 Rdxe7 32. Qd4 Bb7
{ Once again, black should have grabbed the g4 pawn.   32...Rxg4+  doesn't win a queen because after  33.Kf1  the rook is pinned.  Reg7  34.Rxg4  Rxg4  ∓ }
33. Kf2 Qxd5 34. Qxd5+ Bxd5 35. Bxf5 Rxe5 36. Re1 Rxe1 37. Kxe1
