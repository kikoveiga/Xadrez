{ Hello everyone! My name is Leon Livaic and I am a 19 years old International Master from Croatia. This is my first chessable course and I hope you will enjoy it! The course is a cutting-edge opening repertoire for White, which means that we will go for the critical lines in every position, trying to play for a big advantage out of the opening, and believe me, in most cases you will achieve it! I will teach you how to deal with the King's indian Defense when playing White. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ Whenever you see 2... g6, it's a sign that your opponent wants to win the game at all costs. Whether he plays the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian, he will get a sharp, theoretical and double-edged positions. }
3. Nc3 Bg7
{ After 3... Bg7 the KID arises! Unlike in every other possible opening, Black is giving up center control and will willingly have less space, but in return he will try to play actively and in most cases close the center so that he can attack on the kingside. The King's Indian Defence has been used for many decades by the strongest players in the world. Only some of them are Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Tal, Svetozar Gligoric and Viktor Korchnoi. However, the opening has stopped being popular on superGM level in the last decade, as engines became stronger and concluded that the opening is not too sound @@StartBracket@@White's space advantage seems to be a crucial factor@@EndBracket@@. Still, for club level players and even stronger players  @@StartBracket@@I think up to 2500+ FIDE rating@@EndBracket@@ it is often a nuisance. We are humans, not engines, and people willingly play a worse position to get winning chances with Black. }
4. e4 d6 5. h3
{ I am going to teach you how to crush the King's Indian Defence with White with an ambitious and very straightforward line, starting with 5. h3. This move was and still is Anatoly Karpov's choice, and also the choice of world's current #2 Fabiano Caruana. The point of White's strategy is to delay the development of the knight from g1 and play Be3 first  @@StartBracket@@with Ng4 being impossible now@@EndBracket@@, and when Black plays his normal plan with e5, we will close the position with d5 and play the move g4, making sure that Black's f5 break backfires because his king will be too open when the g-file open, and with White we will almost never play 0-0. Because of that Black players have been trying to play some other strategy against this line lately, and not to play their normal e5 stuff. So here is the list of chapters we are going to cover in this course and a few words about them.    In the popular sideline with 5... Nbd7 we will play 8. f3N, surprising our opponents instead of complying to play 8. Qc2 with a worse version of the main line.    In the rare sidelines 5... e5 and 5... c5 we will exchange the pawns and queens and try to play a better endgame with the Black king in the center.   After 6... c5 we will play 7. Nf3, aiming for the Maroczy structures with more space instead of going 7. d5 transposing to a Benoni.    To 6... Na6 and 6... Nbd7 we will respond with 7. g4, not transposing to the very theoretical Makogonov line with 7. Nf3    The more and more popular 6... Nc6 will be met by 7. d5, seizing space, and we will also play f4 and g4 in some lines!    After 6... c6 and 6... a6 we will play 7. Nf3 as Black has made a  not too useful move, and also g4 could be met by b5 in some lines, opening the position on the other side of the board and claiming that White has a lot of weaknesses.   In the Main Line with 6... e5 we will play 7. d5 and 8. g4, as mentioned before, trying to restrict all counterplay from Black.    After we finish the theoretical part we will come to the Model Games chapter, in which I am going to analyze some of my own games in classical chess in this line, as well as some other games played by strong players. I think it's very important for the author to have experience in what he is teaching. The games will not be analyzed in such a great detail, they are more examples of which kind of positions and structures you can expect.  I hope you will not be discouraged with the number of the lines and complexity of the positions and that the 5. h3 6. Be3 line will bring you many nice victories, as it brought them to me in the past two years! }

Another plan would be to play Rd1, f3, Nd1-f2-g4, but it's less clear how to continue from there. }

{ Honestly, I think you will never have to face any other move than this one in actual games. }
6. Be3
{ The difference between this line and the line with 6. Nf3 is that after 6... e5 7. d5 here the g1-Knight is usually going to g3 via e2, where it will be better placed than on f3 and later d2 in the main lines with 6... e5. Why am I such a big fan of this plan? First of all, the knight on g3 is going to make it impossible for black to play f5, so he will have to try to find an active plan on the queenside. Secondly, this setup is perfect for launching a kingside attack, the d2 square is free for the queen so the ideas with Qd2 and Bh6 are always in the air, as well as h4-h5 opening the file. For all these reasons I am always very happy when I see 6... e5 on the board. As mentioned in the Introduction, the sidelines will also be analyzed in great detail. }

7... Qa5
{ This is a tricky line, but objectively not a great one. Black is hoping for   8.Qd2  Nc6  9.d5  Nd4!  which actually works, as there is no  10.Nxd4  cxd4  11.Bxd4  because of  11...Nxe4!  12.Nxe4  Qxd2+  13.Kxd2  Bxd4  and black is much better. }

Nfd7 { The point of this move is to again try to play Nc6 and Nd4. } 9. Be2

10. Nxd4 Nc6 { Putting pressure on d4 and developing a piece. } 11. O-O
{ Even though this position is probably the best thing Black has in this line, again White is better due to more space and better development. }
11... Nxd4
{ Black has less space, and usually the side with less space wants to exchange as many pieces as possible, otherwise they get cramped. }
12. Bxd4 Bxd4 13. Qxd4 Qc5
{ The queen trade would be perfect for Black, so we don't want to allow it. }
14. Qd2
{ Trying to play Nd5, provoking e5 so that the d6-pawn will be very weak in the future. }
14... Nf6 { Otherwise Nd5 is even stronger. } 15. Nd5
{ As e7 is hanging, this still makes perfect sense. White is forcing Black to take on d5 and change the structure. After that happens, the e-file opens and the backward e7-pawn becomes extremely weak. It's important to notice that Black can't take on e4 because if   15...Nxe4  16.Qd3  White is attacking the knight and also creating a very very nice threat of playing b4, after which the black queen will be trapped as after Qc6 or Qc8 there will be Ne7+, so White is just winning after 15... Nxe4. }
15... Nxd5 16. exd5 e5
{ As we said, in this structure the e7-pawn is a big problem, White can triple on the e file and siege it. So with his last move Black is trying to get rid of it, but that will cause other problems. }
17. dxe6
{ Of course we need to take as otherwise Black's pawns will not be able to be attacked anymore. }
17... Bxe6
{ If   17...fxe6  it's even worse as the d6 pawn is weak and the bishop is still undeveloped on c8. }
18. Rac1
{ This is a fairly quiet position for this line, but the d6 pawn secures White a permanant advantage. Black can't really push d5 himself as b4 and c5 will come. Also White has a clear plan of going Rfd1 Bf3 and ideally b3, Rc3 Rd3 later. }

{ This is a solid move but also the one which you are not going to see very often in my opinion. Why? Well, the KID players don't really want to play c5, because after that move the Benoni structures usually arise, and KID players are not really familiar with Benoni structures. The KID players will play 6... e5 here in 90% of the cases. The stronger player you are facing, the bigger the chances are that he/she is going to play 6... c5. }
7. Nf3
{ I will be recommending this line, inviting the Maroczy structure, but I want to mention that 7. d5 is a very good move too. After   7.d5  Black is going to play  7...e6  8.Bd3  exd5  and here you can choose with which pawn to take, both options will transpose to a Benoni and give white a small advantage. So check out 7. d5 in case you don't like my recommendation in this course or you don't feel comfortable playing Maroczy structures with White. }
7... Qa5
{ This is a tricky line, but objectively not a great one. Black is hoping for   8.Qd2  Nc6  9.d5  Nd4!  which actually works, as there is no  10.Nxd4  cxd4  11.Bxd4  because of  11...Nxe4!  12.Nxe4  Qxd2+  13.Kxd2  Bxd4  and black is much better. }

cxd4 { Leading to a Maroczy structure again. } 9. Nxd4 Nc6 10. O-O
{ These are the most normal moves. } 10... Be6

11. Be2

11... Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Nd7
{ This is a typical Maroczy again, slightly better for White. } 13. b3

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. h3 O-O 6. Be3 Na6
{ The move which I always had the most problems facing. The point is again not to define the structure right away, but wait so that you can have options of going c5, e5 or c6 Nc7 as Black. }
7. g4
{ 7.Nf3  is something I don't want to suggest because it would lead to the 6. Nf3 line, even though it's very possible to play like that.   7.Bd3  is also a decent move. }
7... c6
{ In my opinion the best move for Black, which gave me a lot of headache in the past. The point is to keep the structure mobile as White has overextended himself on the kingside. By playing this line Black has the options of going either e5, b5 or c5 in store, defining the structure the way he wants and when he wants. }
8. Nge2
{ It's important to start with   8.Nge2  because after  8...e5  9.d5  the bishop is not going to go to g2 in most cases. }
8... Nc7 9. Ng3 b5
{ Seizing space on the queenside and also threatening b4 to kick the knight from c3. }
10. cxb5

The plan is to play Rfd1 and take on e5, trying to take advantage of the open files. It is not smart to play d5 here as White because it will be very hard to get rid of the knight on c5 and exploit the c-file in the future. }

I know that it looks weird to play like that as we are opening Black's dark-squared bishop and giving up the e5 square for his knight, but what we gained is more important. }

The problem is,   7.Nf3  doesn't really solve the problem, Black can still go  7...e5  8.d5  Nd4!  and after  9.Nxd4  exd4  10.Bxd4  there is a cute trick  10...Nxe4  11.Bxg7  Re8!  or   11.Nxe4  Qh4!  , equalizing. That's why you need to be careful in this line and know how to react. }
7. d5
{ This move gives White a space advantage with a tempo, and Black will try to break the center and get some piece activity. However with precise play, White will have an advantage. }
7... Ne5 { A provocative move, but also the most dangerous line. } 8. f4
{ I think White should seize space here. } 8... Ned7 9. g4

12. Bg2 Nc5 { Attacking e4. } 13. Qc2

13... Bb7 14. O-O Rc8 { Again going after the poor e4-pawn. } 15. Nd4 e6
{ Black has to try to open the center, the sooner the better. } 16. Rad1
{ This move is deep, the idea is that after Nc6 the rook will be active in the future. }
16... exd5 17. exd5
{ Now a very messy position arises, but White is again better as he can play Nc6 whenever he wants and close the c-file. After that, Black will have no real target. However, it's important not to allow a good version of Nxd5 after Nc6 for Black. }
17... Re8 { Developing with a tempo. } 18. Bf2 Nfe4
{ Black is trying to cause damage, exploiting the fact that White is pinned. }
19. Nc6 { Closing the c-file is imperative. } 19... Bxc6 20. dxc6 Nxf2
{ Black needs to eliminate this bishop to get some quick counterplay. } 21.
Rxf2 Bxc3 22. bxc3 Qh4
{ Giving up the poor d6-pawn, but getting quite a lot of activity in return. }
23. Rxd6 Qg3 { Now Ne4 is a real threat. } 24. Rf1 Re3 { Attacking c3. } 25.
Qf2
{ This is probably the most critical line, after which White is slightly better. }
25... Ne4
{ Taking on c3 would allow Qxg3 Rxg3 f5 and the f7-pawn will be quite weak, and also there would be f6 ideas, followed by Rfd1 or c7. With this move Black is closing the bishop and also attacking the rook. }
26. Qxg3 Rxg3 27. Rd4 { The only move. } 27... f5 28. Rf3
{ The only way to protect c3 again. } 28... Rxf3 29. Bxf3 Rxc6 30. Bxe4 fxe4
31. c4
{ White will be a pawn up in the rook endgame because e4 will fall after Kf2 and Ke3. }

{ As was said,   7...c6  is a much bigger headache. Here we are transposing to 6... e5. }
8. d5 Nc5 9. f3 a5 10. Qd2
{ In this exact line it probably doesn't matter if White starts with Qd2 or Nge2. }
10... a4
{ Everything up to this point was covered in the theoretical part of the course, but this move doesn't change much. }
11. Nge2 c6 12. Ng3 cxd5 13. cxd5 Qa5
{ After   13...Bd7   we would transpose to  the main line, but this move order allows an even stronger reply: }
14. Nb5
{ Now it's a problem for Black, he can't trade the queens because the d6-pawn is hanging, for example   14...Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  Rd8  16.Nxd6  .  He should try to play   14...Rd8  immediately, as after   15.Qxa5  Rxa5  16.Nxd6  the rook from a5 defends the knight. So after Rd8 White should play for a better endgame, as we have seen in the previous game, we are always happy to play these endgames. }
14... Qb6 { A big mistake, not seeing my idea. } 15. Rc1
{ Now again Nxd6 is a huge threat and the only way to defend it is } 15... Nfd7
16. h4
{ Now my opponent thought for 30 minutes or so and played 16...h5 out of desperation. Why? Well, he is zugzwanged. He can't move the knights, moving the queen drops d6, moving the rooks is pointless as there is nothing he can do with them and White can play h5 and Bh6, with massive threats. So again we have a winning position with White after 15 moves by playing more or less the same moves as always in this line. }

{ As I said in the theoretical part, this is one of the critical positions arising, and here my opponent tries something very interesting, objectively bad but practically, well, not that bad. }
15... Bxg4
{ In the course, I considered other alternatives. The text move is objectively losing, although I did experience some discomfort during the game. }
16. fxg4 Nxg4
{ Somehow here I panicked, I saw the best continuation  17.Bg5!  f6  18.Bh3  fxg5  Bxg4  , but somehow I misevaluated the arising position because of the opened f-flie so I played a safer but worse move. }
17. Nd1 Nxe3 18. Nxe3 Qd8 19. Ng4
{ This was my point and I still have a big advantage, but with my king and dark-squares weak and f5 in the air, black has some nice practical play. }
19... Rc8 20. Kd1 Qb6 21. h6 Nb3
{ The beginning of big compications, which favor my opponent who had a solid time advantage. }
22. Qd3

{ After this forced sequence, I am 2 pieces up, but my opponent has 4 pawns and my king is exposed so it was very hard for me to play this position in time trouble. }
25... Nc2 { A big blunder. Black had to stop   26.Rxh7  with h5. } 26. Qd2
{ Returning the favour, I somehow missed that there was no good move for Black after   26.Rxh7  Qb1+  27.Nc1  . }
26... h5 27. Nc1
{ The point of my play, making the king safer and counting on   27...hxg4  28.Rh8+  . }
27... a3 { The best chance, making my a2 pawn weak. } 28. Bd3 Nb4 29. Ne3
{ Again a mistake. Somehow the winning   29.Ke2  escaped me. } 29... Rxc1+
{ Again returning the favour,   29...Nxd3  30.Nxd3  Qb1+  31.Nc1  Qxe4  was grabbing the fifth pawn. }
30. Qxc1 Qd4 31. Qc4
{ The final blunder. Again I simply didn't play the same fatal move with the King. }
31... Qxe3 32. Qxb4 Qxd3+ 33. Kc1 Qe3+
{ Unfortunately, I can't play for a win here and have to repeat.   34.Qd2  is met with   34...Qxe4  and if I go with my king to a1 I could even be in danger after Qd4+ because my king is as far as it can be from his kingside passers. }

{ The queen exchange would favor black, because white would lose his attacking potetnial and initiative, and the d6 pawn could actually be a weakness in any rook endgame. }
25. Qe5 a4 26. a3 Qb6 27. Re1
{ White is in a no hurry, because the structure is fixed. He can simply improve his pieces, threatening Qf6 and maybe Re7 in the future. Black can't activate his pieces because he has to babysit the d6-pawn. }
27... Rad8 28. Red1 Qc6 29. Kh2 Qc4 30. R1d4 Qc2 31. Rd2 Qb3
{ Again, Cheparinov simply imroves his pieces little by little, and only then will he go for an attack. }
32. Qd4 h6
{ A blunder, but black's position was already quite hopeless. He can't move the queen or either rook, for example   32. ..Re8  33.Rd3  Qc2  34.Rc5!  and after Re3 and/or Rc7 the blockade will be broken. Maybe   32...b5  was the best try to have Qc4 after Rd3, but it is still lost for Black. }
33. Re2
{ I am not sure why not simply   33.Rd3  followed by Rh3. Probably Cheparinov wanted to keep improving his pieces, as Black's queen is out of play. }
