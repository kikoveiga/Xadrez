{ Foreword to the First Edition  In an age in which books about even minor chess openings abound, Hannes Langrock has a knack for finding interesting and neglected variations to write about.  I first noticed Langrock's analysis in his lively column From the Sidelines on the ChessCafe website. Among other things, he extensively analyzed the rare but respectable English Defense, adding numerous new ideas in the process.  His The Modern Morra Gambit was, remarkably, the first thorough work about an opening that has been played in thousands of master games. Still more surprisingly, the book you have in your hands deals with an opening which, in spite of its popularity   over 15,  000  games in MegaBase  , has never been the subject of a detailed study. This, in spite of its use by various world champions  (among them Lasker, Petrosian, Karpov, Anand, and Kramnik)  , and numerous elite grandmasters.  The Rubinstein Variation surrenders the center by ...dxe4, so it has often been thought of as a passive opening. The charm of this book is that, without making any extravagant claims, Langrock convinces the reader that Black need not be content with a disadvantage in space, but can make an early pawn break  (usually ...c5)  to fully equalize the central situation.  There is a huge practical difference between a sound but cramped position, in which you are under nagging pressure, and one in which you have room in which to freely maneuver your pieces. Although I've written about the French Defense for many years, I never realized that Black could take such active measures in the Rubinstein Variation without significant drawbacks.  This book is an eye-opener, and even top grandmasters might find that they have underestimated Black's resources in important positions.  As is the case with the best books, the author himself has played the opening, and he includes numerous excerpts from his own games. French players will be delighted that Langrock supplements his Rubinstein analysis with extensive coverage of White's second and third move alternatives to 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 and 3. Nd2.  Thus, the book provides a complete repertoire for Black versus 1. e4.  It includes a fascinating solution to the Advance Variation 3. e5, namely, 3... c5 4. c3 Bd7 5. Nf3 a6 !?, with which the author has again had considerable experience on the black side. He also advocates an unusual Hedgehog-like structure versus the King's Indian Attack, and provides original analysis of some underrated lines of the Exchange Variation.  Throughout, Langrock draws upon his own games to illustrate key variations. The average tournament and online player will appreciate Langrock's straightforward, no-nonsense style. He keeps the complexity of the analysis within bounds, and highlights relevant details without drifting into obscure page-long analytical byways.  General themes are clearly presented within the context of illustrative games. Langrock is the type of chess writer who enjoys the richness of the chess itself, and does not pad his work with stories or opinions.  The result is a book that covers a broad swath of material in a modest number of pages. I'm sure that you will be well-rewarded for its study, and come out with a useful new weapon in your chess arsenal.  Enjoy !  John Watson, San Diego, May 2014 }

{ Author's Preface to the Second Edition  The French Rubinstein is while regularly played by grandmasters and well respected amongst them as a tough nut to crack far from being a mainstream opening.  I was somewhat surprised about the success and rather quick selling-out of the first edition of this book. It looks like there is great interest in a solid reply to 1. e4, one which is easy to learn and not that theoretical !  The project updating the material and analyzing what has happened in the last four years turned out to be an exciting one. Germany's Georg Meier  (currently rated 2648)  continues to be the main hero of this opening, testing it regularly against even the very best players in the world and generally representing the black side very well.  I was especially fascinated by the new concept he introduced last year in one of the absolute main lines of the Rubinstein in his game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, reaching a very comfortable draw against the 2800-player from France  (see chapter 6 for details)  .  Naturally, four years of tournament praxis in over-the-board and correspondence play and the analysis of all the material with the latest engines have led to several different evaluations and new directions.  Without a doubt, there are dangerous lines for Black to face, but the French Rubinstein remains solid as a rock, and is certainly an opening which is here to stay.  As in the first edition, the second part of the book provides a repertoire against Whites alternatives to the main moves 3. Nc3 and 3. Nd2. In that part, one of the major changes of direction took place in my recommended set-up against the French Advance 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Bd7 5. Nf3 a6.  This set-up had temporarily been put under a cloud by a correspondence game in the main line 6. Bd3 cxd4 ?! 7. cxd4 Bb5 8. Bc2 !. However, I have realized that players with Black, like Russian GM Vyacheslav Ikonnikov, have recently gone a different direction by choosing the move 6... Nc6 !, which puts early pressure on d4 often combined with ...Qb6 and is a very viable option.  You can find all the details about this exciting line in chapter 10. This chapter should be of special interest for Sicilian O'Kelly players as well, as the move order 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 a6 3. c3 e6 4. d4 d5 5. e5 Bd7 not only transposes to our French line, but also is one of the main tabiyas of the O'Kelly System !  The new edition of this book is also an extended one, with 17 new main games and overall significantly more material, while still trying to keep the necessary theoretical knowledge to play the repertoire within reasonable bounds.  Last, but not least, I wish to thank my wife Liudmyla for taking care of our children so many times, and thus patiently giving me all those hours to finish the project.  Dear chess friend, I wish you much fun and success playing the Rubinstein Defense !  Hannes Langrock, Leipzig, March 2018 }

{ This is the starting position of the Rubinstein Variation in the French Defense. It is named after Akiba Rubinstein  (1882-1961)  , who played it in several games between 1907 and 1912 a time, in which the Polish chess master was one of the strongest players in the world and a serious candidate to take the world championship title away from Emanuel Lasker. The Rubinstein Variation is a very solid opening, and I would like to introduce a few key ideas to the reader by showing Rubinstein's first two games with it, both played at the Karlsbad tournament in 1907. Rubinstein won this tournament ahead of Maroczy, Nimzowitsch, Marshall, Spielmann, Tartakower, Chigorin and others. }

{ We want to equalize completely in a straightforward manner.  I believe that these two sample games have been a good demonstration of the nature of the Rubinstein Variation. It is very solid, but at the same time it is ambitious in a certain way: Blacks goal is to completely equalize without accepting any structural weaknesses.  A minor exception is that in several lines Black accepts his f-pawn to be doubled after Bxf6/...gxf6, but in these cases this is compensated by the exchange of Whites dark-square bishop for a knight.  We do not accept a position which is objectively better for White, albeit complicated. No, by playing the Rubinstein, we want to have a fully equal position by the end of the opening or early in the middlegame. In this sense, the Rubinstein is similar to the Petroff, which is also mainly played in order to equalize in a clean way. The Rubinstein sometimes has the reputation of being a passive defense against 1. e4. However, I believe that Black only ends up in a long-term, passive position if he plays the opening inaccurately. }

{ The Rubinstein is a solid second weapon against 1. e4.  Sometimes, in the Rubinstein, you can win smooth games, like the one just seen, without ever facing the risk of being worse, let alone losing. In 2005, while visiting the German individual championship in Altenkirchen, I had a quick chat about the Rubinstein Variation with Georg Meier. I raised some concerns about the drawish tendencies of the opening, and the difficulties defeating lower-rated players with it. He just smiled and replied: Oh, I have already won so many kinds of different endgames in my Rubinstein games ! What Meiers statement implies is that you can squeeze out a lot of wins with the Rubinstein if you are a good endgame player. However, it has to be admitted that it is not the opening with the greatest winning potential. Black mainly tries to neutralize the early initiative that White naturally has as a result of having the right of moving first, and in many cases, Black does that by exchanging pieces and simplifying the position. If you have to win a game by all means, the Rubinstein may not be the right choice. It is a solid second weapon, but my advice is not to make it your first choice against 1. e4. Still, this aspect is certainly debatable and depends on personal taste of any player after the first edition of this book was published, several readers have told me that they are currently quite happy using the Rubinstein as a primary defense against 1. e4. Personally, I always have a comfortable feeling when opting for the Rubinstein with 3... dxe4 and 4... Nd7. One reason is that I am not very good at calculating complicated variations in messy positions, and I know that in the Rubinstein I usually do not have to do that. The positions that arise from the Rubinstein tend to be relatively clearcut without wild craziness going on, like, for example, in the Kings Gambit or in some lines of the Kings Indian Defense. Of course, it still helps if you are good at calculation ! But it is a different kind of calculation: What you need in the Rubinstein is the ability to calculate comparatively simple positions in a clean way. The Rubinstein Variation is well respected. It is worth mentioning that, while not being particularly popular, the Rubinstein is well-respected among grandmasters. There are many games by 2550+ players, and the variation has been used by top players such as Anand, Ivanchuk and Mamedyarov. In my opinion, the top expert is German grandmaster Georg Meier. Meier is a strong grandmaster; his peak Elo rating so far has been 2671 in 2012. He has played the Rubinstein over 150 times in official games  (performing even slightly better than his rating with Black !)  and contributed to the development of its theory by introducing new ideas in several lines. You will come across his name many more times in this book; nine of the main games in Part I of the book are played by him with black. If you decide to take up the Rubinstein Variation, playing through his games would be a good idea. A complete repertoire against 1. e4 This book is not only about the French Rubinstein, it also presents a complete repertoire against 1. e4 and therefore consists of two main parts. Part I, with nine chapters, is about the Rubinstein and deals with Whites different replies after 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3/Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7. Part II, with five chapters, presents lines against other ways White may choose to meet the French Defense. Basically, I am recommending lines that I have played myself for years. A few of these variations are not so common, for example, 4... Bd7 5. Nf3 a6 against the French Advance  (Chapter 10)  or the set-up I am recommending against the Kings Indian Attack  (Chapter 12)  . However, I trust those lines and I believe that the analysis presented in this book confirms this opinion. The content is presented in form of 71 annotated games. Each of the 14 chapters starts with a short introduction. Before we move on to the theoretical part of the book, I should point out that, for the sake of clarity, I have sometimes changed the original move order of the main games. For example, if one of the main games started with 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Nbd7 6. Nf3 h6, I still give our repertoire move-order 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bg5 h6. Chapters 1-3 The first three chapters of this book deal with lines which can arise after the moves 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6. }

{ To conclude about the critical endgame line 11. Bb5: It looks like both 13... Bb5 and 13... f6 hold for Black, and it is difficult to decide between these two moves. In the endgame positions after 13... f6, White can still press and they are less clear-cut than the ones after 13... Bb5. In the latter the best White can get, appear to be some bishop endings, which are clearly drawn with some care by Black. So, currently my preference would be for Meiers 13... Bb5. }

Bc6  14.Re5  h6  15.Bh4  White has serious attacking chances in compensation for the isolated pawn on d4. The rook on e5 is actively placed and prevents ...Qd5 by Black. Objectively, Black is fine, but the position is not that easy to play.For this exact reason I was advising against this line in the first edition of this book. In 2015, however, Georg Meier went for this option, and even if it was only a blitz game, this certainly means something as it gives a clue to his repertoire. So I decided to look at this option a little deeper this time you can decide, which approach suits you better !  Qe7  Preparing ...Rfd8 followed by doubling rooks on the d-file to put pressure on the d4-pawn. I like this set-up better than 15... Re8 16. Qd2 Kf8, which I played in 2008 against GM Lopez Martinez.  In the position after 15... Qe7 three moves have been tried by White:  16.Bc2   16.Qd2  The following game illustrates my practical worries about entering this line, there is not much margin for error:  Rfd8  17.Rae1  Kf8 ?  Understandable, but wrong.   17...Rd5 ! =  was better. Possibly Black was afraid of the reply  18.Bc4  but there is a concrete way to solve all problems quickly with  Rxe5  19.dxe5  Qc5 !  when  20.exf6  Qxc4  21.Bg3  Qd5  22.Qxd5  Bxd5  23.fxg7  Kxg7 =  leads to an equal endgame.  18.Bc4 !  A strong move, protecting d4 and preventing ...Rd5 by Black.  Qd6 ?

But even stronger was the concrete   21...Ng4 !  forcing favorable exchanges and leading to a comfortable ending for Black after e.g.  22.Bxe7   22.Qg3 ??  Rxe5 !  -+  23.Bxe7  Re1#  22...Nxe3  23.Rxe3  Rxe7  16...Rfd8  17.Qd3  Rac8  18.Rae1   18.Bxf6 ?  Qxf6  19.Qh7+  Kf8  (Finkel)  leads nowhere and White is in trouble with his weak d-pawn.  18...Rc7  19.h3  g5 !?  20.Rxg5+ !  White correctly goes for the rook sacrifice as   20.Bg3  Rcd7  with pressure against d4 would be nice for Black.  20...hxg5  21.Bxg5  Kf8  22.Qg3 !  Rxd4 !  It is not about taking a pawn, but about meeting deadly threats like Qh4 or Qf4 !  23.Qe5  Rd5  24.Bxf6  Rxe5  25.Bxe7+  Kxe7  26.Rxe5  Bxg2  The dust has cleared and a draw was agreed in Arencibia-Nogueiras, Cuba 1997. Indeed, the endgame after  27.Kxg2  Rxc2  28.Rb5  is equal. A very well played game by both players ! }

{ Black has solved all his problems and the players decided to agree to a draw. Summary The move 7. c3 after 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 was popularized by Garry Kasparov, and so it should not surprise us that this seemingly harmless move is in fact one of the critical tests of the Rubinstein Defense ! White clears the way to a4 for his queen, possibly followed by queenside castling and other aggressive moves such as Ne5 or Bb5. In the critical line 7c5 ! 8. Ne5 a6 9. Be3 Qc7 10. Qa4+ Nd7 11. Bb5 cxd4 12. Bxd7+ Bxd7 13. Qxd4, Black has a difficult choice to make. Georg Meier has favored the structurally compromising 13Bb5 14. a4 Bd6 15. Nxf7 Kxf7 16. axb5 axb5 and kind of worked it out to a draw. After analyzing this line another time, I have changed my mind and would slightly prefer Meiers relatively clear-cut solution over 13f6 14. Nxd7 Qxd7 15. Qxd7 Kxd7, which keeps the pawn structure intact, but is not necessarily that easy in all lines. But ultimately both moves should be playable and hold for Black. Whites alternatives to the mentioned line also have been covered in detail, but they are generally less dangerous, e.g., 11. O-O-O cxd4 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Qxd4 Bc6 ! as discussed in NavaraMeier  (game 6)  . }

{ Black has solved all his problems and the players decided to agree to a draw. Summary The move 7. c3 after 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 was popularized by Garry Kasparov, and so it should not surprise us that this seemingly harmless move is in fact one of the critical tests of the Rubinstein Defense ! White clears the way to a4 for his queen, possibly followed by queenside castling and other aggressive moves such as Ne5 or Bb5. In the critical line 7c5 ! 8. Ne5 a6 9. Be3 Qc7 10. Qa4+ Nd7 11. Bb5 cxd4 12. Bxd7+ Bxd7 13. Qxd4, Black has a difficult choice to make. Georg Meier has favored the structurally compromising 13Bb5 14. a4 Bd6 15. Nxf7 Kxf7 16. axb5 axb5 and kind of worked it out to a draw. After analyzing this line another time, I have changed my mind and would slightly prefer Meiers relatively clear-cut solution over 13f6 14. Nxd7 Qxd7 15. Qxd7 Kxd7, which keeps the pawn structure intact, but is not necessarily that easy in all lines. But ultimately both moves should be playable and hold for Black. Whites alternatives to the mentioned line also have been covered in detail, but they are generally less dangerous, e.g., 11. O-O-O cxd4 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Qxd4 Bc6 ! as discussed in NavaraMeier  (game 6)  . }

{ Given that on   7.Bg5  the bishop would just be kicked with  h6   the position after  7.Bg5  h6  more often arises via the move-order  6.Bg5  h6  7.Nxf6+  Nxf6  , which therefore is also the move-order chosen in this book. For this variation see Chapters 4 and 5  ,White decides to develop his dark-square bishop to another decent square.  The move   7.Bc4  looks a little odd at first sight, as the bishop just seems to bite on granite. However, the move has been played by several grandmasters and it has some merit.

In fact, in Baden-Baden in 2013, Georg Meier suffered a defeat against Fabiano Caruana in this line.

If White simply protects the d4-pawn, he has no chances of an advantage either:   12.Qe4  Qxe4+  13.Bxe4  Ba6  with the idea ...c7-c5, is fine for Black.   12.c3  Bb7  13.Qg3  Qxg3  14.hxg3  h6 =  Black can collect no fewer than four pawns for a piece:  12...Qxd4   12...Nb4  is even more complicated.

In the first edition we stopped here, while in the meantime a correspondence game has been published which confirms that Black is doing well:  17.Rd1  d4  Black could not keep this pawn anyway and decides to give it up immediately to make Whites king feel somewhat uncomfortable.  18.Bxd4  Bxd3  19.Rxd3  Qb1+  20.Rd1  Qb5  Here the game score of Tarmak-Kudr, corr 2013, ends with the result 0-1, which is a bit odd. Black is fine with three connected pawns for the piece and the more comfortable king position. However, there is a full fight ahead, and the engines still give equality after  21.Kd2 !  connecting rooks. White is still fine as the knight on c6 is doing a good job, controlling d8, and in general White has enough pieces to protect his king to keep the balance.  White has tried:  12.c4   12.O-O-O  Qh4 ?!  Bad timing for this move, because after  Instead   12...c5 !  is critical.  13.Rhe1 !  Black cannot take on d4 anyway, and so White was better in Shabalov-Sanchez, Medellin 2017.  Qxd4 ?  14.Re4  Qc5  15.Nd7  picks up the exchange  12...Bxe5  13.dxe5  Ne7  14.Qg3  Ng6  15.O-O-O  Qd4  16.Rhe1  Qh4  17.f3  Qxg3  18.hxg3  Rfd8  19.Bg5  Now White looks slightly better, but Tiviakov goes on to reach a drawn ending relatively easily:  Re8  20.Bxg6  fxg6  21.Rd7  The rook will not stay here for long.  Rac8  22.Red1  Bc6  23.Rd8  b5  24.Rxc8  Rxc8  25.Rd8+  Rxd8  26.Bxd8  bxc4  27.Kd2  Kf7  28.Bxc7  g5  29.Kc3  g4 =  (Hou-Tiviakov, Hoogeveen 2012) }

16. f4 { 16.h3  f4 = } 16... Qxh2

9... b6 10. O-O-O Bb7 11. c4
{ This move has some long-term weakening effects and is not the most testing try for an advantage.  Currently the center of the discussion is   11.Kb1 !?  White makes a useful move and keeps his options open, e.g., if he wants to play the move Bg5 or not. Two replies have been tried:  c5   11...Nd5  and now:  12.Bd2  More challenging is:   12.Bg5 !?  Be7  Perhaps   12...Qe8  should be analyzed, keeping the bishop on d6   xf4  , although the queen is not optimally placed on e8.  13.h4 !  Now Black no longer had ...Nf4 and White had the initiative in Ivanchuk-Drozdovsky, Odessa rapid 2006, among others. The line with 11. Kb1 is still in development, and the future will show if Black can improve his previous play. At the moment, I would recommend to just return to 8... b6, which sees Black in good theoretical shape.  12...Nf4  13.Bxf4  Bxf4  14.Be4  Bxe4  15.Qxe4  Qf6  16.Rd3  Rad8  17.Rhd1  a5  18.g3  and a draw was agreed in Shankland-Cordova, Matanzas 2017, as Black is very solid after 18... Bd6. So it appears Black is holding his own if he can play ...Nf4 easily.  12.Bg5 !  saw Rubinstein expert Georg Meier lose twice within a few months:  h6  13.h4   13.Bh4  Rc8  14.c3  Be7  15.Bg3  cxd4  16.Nxd4  Rc5  17.Rhe1  Qc8  18.Be5  Nd7  19.Bf4  Nf6  20.h4  Rd8  21.Be5  h5  Stopping g2-g4 for the moment, but making such a pawn move in front of the own king is not a good sign.  22.f3 !  Renewing the g2-g4 idea.  Bd6  23.Bxf6  gxf6  24.Qe3  ±  with great attacking chances for White in Caruana-Meier, Grenke Chess Classic, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden 2017.  13...cxd4  14.Nxd4  Be7 ?  This runs into a tactical refutation.  15.Bxf6 !  Usually this exchange makes Blacks task easier, so perhaps the German grandmaster did not consider it seriously enough at this moment.  Bxf6  16.Nxe6 !  +-  fxe6  17.Qxe6+  Kh8  18.Qf5  g6  19.Qxg6  Qc7  20.Qxh6+  Kg8  21.Qg6+  Kh8  After   21...Qg7  22.Bc4+  Kh8  23.Qh5+  Qh7  24.Qxh7+  Kxh7  25.Rd7+  +-  the Bb7 drops, which leaves White several pawns ahead.  22.Bf5  Introducing the threat Rd7.  Bc8  23.Qh5+  Kg8  24.Rd7  1-0 Kulaots-Meier, Sweden 2017.  In the Cap dAdge rapid tournament in 2013, Vassily Ivanchuk twice played the move   11.Bg5  against Yannick Pelletier.  h6  12.Bh4  and now:  With the pinned knight,  c5  might be asking for too much, and  Pelletier played the more circumspect   12...Be7  13.Kb1  Shortly before this second edition went to press, Georg Meier could not solve his problems after the very direct   13.Rhg1  preparing g2-g4:  Nd7  14.Bg3  a6  15.Kb1  b5  16.Bf4 !  Renewing the threat.  Bd5  17.g4  g5  Having to play such a move on ones own kingside is a bad sign.  18.Bc1  Kg7  19.h4  with a crushing attack and a soon white victory in Lomasov-Meier, Batumi 2018. This game looks like one more reason to currently prefer 8... b6 over 8...O-O.  13...Nd5  14.Bg3  Nb4  15.Bc4  Bd5  16.Rhe1  In the other game, Ivanchuk tried   16.Ne5  when again  (b5 ⇆)  would have been the correct reply  16...b5 !  and now:  17.Bxb5 ?  White cannot afford to give up his a-pawn.  More resistant is   17.Bb3  as was shown in a correspondence game:  a5  18.Qxb5  a4  19.Bxd5  Nxd5  20.Rd3  a3  21.b3  Bb4  22.Red1  Nc3+  23.Rxc3  Bxc3  24.Qc5  Ba5  25.Qxa3  Bb6  26.Qb2  Qd5  White had to give up the exchange to survive Blacks attack, but has also picked up two pawns in the process. Blacks king still looks safer, but objectively it seems that White has roughly equalized and the game Bubnov-Stolz, corr 2014, later ended in a draw.  17...Bxa2+  18.Kc1  c6  19.Bc4  Qa5  20.Ne5  20Bg5+ to provoke 21. f4, but it would have been stronger to directly increase the pressure on Whites king with  (Rfb8 ! ↑)  Black threatens to take on c4 followed by Na2+, and there is no satisfying continuation for White. Here is one sample line:  21.c3  freeing the c2square for the king  Bxc4  22.Nxc4  Na2+  23.Kc2  Qa4+  24.Kd2  Rb3  25.Ra1  c5 !  White will not have the time to win Blacks a2-knight at least not without giving up his own knight in return:  26.Red1   26.dxc5  Rd8+  27.Bd6  Bg5+  28.f4  □  Bxf4+  29.Kd3  Bxd6  30.cxd6  Nb4+  31.Ke3  Nc2+  32.Qxc2  Qxc4  ∓  Whites king is still a problem and his d6-pawn is weak as well.  26...cxd4  27.Ke1  dxc3  28.bxc3  Rxc3  29.Rxa2   29.Ne3  Ra3  -+  29...Qxc4  -+  13.dxc5  bxc5  14.Ne5  Qc7  15.Bxf6  gxf6  16.Nc4  looks somewhat better for White. When White has castled short, Blacks weakened kingside structure is usually not a big problem in this type of position, but with his own king at the queenside White has more chances to initiate an attack against the black king later in the game. }
11... c5
{ Meier is not afraid of the opposition of Rd1 and ...Qd8 in the d-file. He does not waste time with a preparatory move like . ..Qe7 and plays the thematic ...c7-c5 immediately. }
12. dxc5 bxc5

13. Ng5
{ Anand decides to take two pairs of minor pieces off the board. Even after that slight simplification, the position still remains rather complicated.   13.Bxc5 ?  Bxc5  14.Bxh7+  wins the queen, but a rook and two bishops are simply too much material after  Nxh7  15.Rxd8  Rfxd8  even if White still picked up two pawns.

Black secures against Lxg7 before taking on g2.  15.Bf4  Bxg2  But Black can improve his play in several ways, the easiest by playing   15...g5 !  first and only after  16.Bd2  taking the pawn  Bxg2  17.Rhg1  Bc6  There is no h2-h4 now blocking Blacks kingside, and White is just worse.  16.Rhg1  Bc6  17.h4 !  Now Whites pressure on the g-file and the weakness of h5 gave decent compensation for the pawn in Timofeev-Ding, Sochi Blitz 2009. }
10... Bc6 11. O-O-O Qd7 12. Be2 O-O-O
{ This seems to be the most exact continuation.  Also playable is   12...Bxg2  13.Rhg1  Be4  After  14.Bxg7 ?!  Instead, with   14.Bd3 !  White can win back the pawn under better circumstances:  Bxd3  15.Rxd3  O-O-O  16.Bxg7  Rg8 !  17.Qxh7  Bxg7  18.Rxg7  Rh8  19.Qe4  Rxh2  20.Qf3  Rf8  and White is more active. However, I do not think he has anything substantial; this endgame looks very drawish.  14...Bxg7  15.Rxg7  Bg6  16.Qe5  O-O-O  White had to worry about his rook on g7 in Barle-Tratar, Ljubljana 2008. }

{ Critical is   15.Bc3  Be4 !   15...Bxc4 ??  16.Rxd8+  Kxd8  17.Qh4+  +-   15...Bxg2 ?  is also bad, as after  16.Rxd8+  Kxd8  17.Rd1+  Kc8  18.f3  the bishop is cut off from the defense.  16.Rxd8+  Kxd8  17.Qxf7  Kc8  White can go for the e6-pawn with  18.Bg4   18.Rd1  Bd6  ∞  This is quite an interesting position. White can win a pawn on g7 or e6, but Black always gets sufficient chances based on his strong bishop on e4 and counterplay against the white king. ...Qa4 can be an idea and, in some positions, the bishop check on f4 is unpleasant. Here are a few possible lines:  19.Qxg7   19.Qxe6+  Kb8  (intending ...Bf4±+)  20.Qg4  Re8  21.f3  Bg6  22.Bd3  to exchange Blacks strong bishop.

Qh1+   The idea of Whites last move was to meet  22...Qe4  with  23.Bd3  without Black having  ...Bf4+  followed by  ...Rxd3.  23.Rd1 ??   23.Bd1  and the game ends in a draw after  Qe4  24.Bc2  Qe1+  25.Rd1  Qe2  26.Rd2 =   26.Bxf5 ??

{ - Summary In this chapter we have looked at three alternatives to the main moves 7. Bd3, 7. Bg5 and 7. c3. 7. Be3 has been played by several top grandmasters. Instead of 7... Nd5, trying to exchange the bishop, I recommend to simply continue development with 7... Bd6. The light-square bishop will usually be developed to b7 and after 8. Bd3, both the immediate 8... b6 and 8... O-O have been seriously tested in grandmaster praxis. After 8...O-O, Black has experienced some problems in the line 9. Qe2 b6 10. O-O-O Bb7 and now 11. Kb1 or 11. Bg5. So 8... b6 is the safe bet at the moment; it holds up well for Black. Another bishop move, 7. Bc4, was well met with 7... a6 !? in Poetz-Novkovic, playing with the idea of ...b7-b5. After 8. a4, Black did not go for the immediate ...c7-c5, but instead decided to develop first with 8... b6 9. O-O Bb7 10. Qe2 Be7 11. Bg5 Nd5 12. Bd2 O-O 13. Ne5 and only now 13... c5 with equality. Finally, a simple response to 7. Ne5 has been shown to be 7... Nd7, challenging Whites active knight. }

Black does not have to fear the exchange on f6 and, with good development and no weaknesses, he is absolutely fine. Here are two examples from grandmaster practice:  15.Ne5   15.Bxf6  gxf6  16.Rd3  Rfd8  17.Rad1  Rxd3  18.Rxd3  Rd8  19.Ne1  Rxd3  20.Nxd3  Bd6  21.g3  Qc4  22.Nc1  Qc6  23.c3  f5  24.Qe3  Qe4  25.Qxh6  Qc2  (White has to take the perpetual in order not to lose his queenside.)  26.Qg5+  Kh7  27.Qh5+  Kg7  28.Qg5+  Kh7  - Gashimov-Ivanchuk, Dagomys 2008.  15...Rfd8  16.c4  Rxd1+  17.Rxd1  Rd8  18.Rxd8+  Qxd8  19.Ng4  Be7  20.Bxf6  Bxf6  21.Nxf6+  Qxf6  22.g3  Qd4  - Becerra Rivero-Kaidanov, Lubbock 2008. }
12... O-O 13. dxc5
{ 13.g4  is aggressive, but not very dangerous. In the following grandmaster game, things quickly backfired for White:  cxd4  14.Bxf6 ?!  Whites intention is to lead his attack with tempo; however, giving up this bishop looks wrong.  Bxf6  15.h4  d3  opening the bishops diagonal.  16.cxd3  Rfc8+  17.Kb1  Rc5  18.g5 ?  This runs into a decisive blow.  It was better to block the bishop with   18.d4  but then Black is also better after  Qb5 !  e.g.,  19.Qe4   19.Qxb5  Rxb5  =+  19...Rac8 !  20.Rd2  R5c7  The possession of the c-file and the superior pawn-structure give Black a positional advantage. And the pawn sacrifice  21.g5  hxg5  22.hxg5  Bxg5  ∓  does not bring White much, as he cannot make use of the open h-file.  18...Bxb2 !  19.Kxb2   19.Qxb2  Rb5  -+  19...Rac8  Calm and decisive.  20.Ka1  The desirable   20.Rc1  simply loses to  Qb5+  the best White could do is to enter a hopeless ending with 20. d4   20.d4  Rc2+  21.Qxc2  Rxc2+  22.Kxc2  Qc6+  -+  The knight on f3 falls, and Whites pawns are weak, while Black has a super-mobile queen and a dangerous 2-1 queenside majority.  20...Rc2  21.Qe4  Qb5  22.Qd4  Rxa2+ !  23.Kxa2  Rc2+  24.Ka3  Qa5+  25.Qa4  Qc5+  0-1 Negi-Potkin, Germany 2011.  26.Qb4  Rc3+  27.Ka4  b5+  28.Ka5  Qb6# }

It gives White a lot of complicated options and the chance to go wrong as the game shows !   22...Qa4  as played in the earlier grandmaster game Apicella-Vaisser, Caen 2011, is easier, Black immediately attacks the d7-knight, forcing White to place the queen in front of the rook. This leads to a draw after an exact sequence of moves.  23.Qd3  Of course, the knight cannot move away:   23.Ne5 ??

23. Qd3
{ Now this move is a mistake. Instead, White had several interesting options, two of them being:   23.Rd3  The idea is to place the rook in front of the queen. Thus, unpinning the knight with Ne5 becomes a much more real idea.  Qxa2  Black already has two pawns for the knight with White facing coordination problems. Two illustrative lines are:  24.c3   24.h4  (with the idea Rh3)  Kh8  A necessary precaution. Black wants to move his c-rook, but not run into Nf6+±.  25.c3  Qb1+  26.Qd1  Qb5  27.Rhh3  Rc7  28.Nc5  Rxd3  29.Nxd3  Rxc3 =  24...Qa5  25.Qd2  Rxd7 !!  26.Rxd7  Rxc3  Whites position looks winning, but only if you forget that he cannot castle anymore ! Now he has to be careful not to lose a rook or his queen.  27.Ke2  Qc5  28.Kd1  Qa3  29.Ke2  Qc5 =   23.f3 !?  and now:  Qa4   23...Qe7 !?  24.Ne5  Qh4+  25.Kf1 !  Qa4  =∞  24.Qe4  shows the point of 23. f3. Still after  Qxa2  25.Rf1  Kh8  26.Rf2  Rc4  27.Qe5   27.Qxb7 ?  Qa5+  looses material; Black has . ..Rc7 in a lot of lines.  27...Rxc2  Black has picked up a third pawn for the piece and should be fine. But at least White has managed to coordinate himself. }
23... Qa4
{ But even stronger was the greedier   23...Qxa2 !  with the idea to follow up with ...Kh8 and similar ideas as in the game.

21. Kd2
{ White decides to avoid the immediate draw and plays on with an extra knight but serious coordination problems. The computer knows that it is still a draw, but both sides have to play exactly now. }
21... Rfd8 22. Ke1 Qa4
{ as played in the earlier grandmaster game Apicella-Vaisser, Caen 2011, is easier, Black immediately attacks the d7-knight, forcing White to place the queen in front of the rook. This leads to a draw after an exact sequence of moves. }

8. Bh4 c5 9. Bc4
{ This is the second most popular move after 9. Bb5+. White often continues with the moves O-O, Qe2, Rad1 and then the bishop does not block the d-file  (which it would on d3)  . }
9... a6
{ This is not the main move, but it has been chosen by a lot of 2600+ players in this position. It is also a very logical answer to the move Bc4, as Black now has the option to play ... b7-b5, ...Bb7 with tempo.  More popular is   9...cxd4  10.O-O   Here  10...a6  would still transpose to  9...a6  10.O-O  cxd4.  Be7  11.Qe2 !  O-O  12.Rad1  Qb6  13.Nxd4 !  and now:  In the main line  Qxb2   13...Nd5  comes into consideration. Georg Meier managed to gradually equalize against a fellow grandmaster with this move:  14.Bg3   14.Bxe7  Nxe7  15.c3  Bd7  16.Rd2  Rfd8  17.Rfd1  Ba4  18.b3  Be8  19.Qe5  Nc6  20.Qe4  Nxd4  21.cxd4  Bb5  22.d5  Bxc4  23.bxc4  exd5  24.Rxd5  Re8  25.Qf4  Re7 =  Gochelashvili-Iskusnyh, Vladivostok 2014  14...Bf6  15.c3  Bd7  16.Nf3  Ba4  17.Rd2  Rfd8  18.Bd3  Bc6  19.Ne5  Bg5  20.Rdd1  Nf4  21.Bxf4  Bxf4  22.Nxc6  Qxc6  23.Be4  Qc7  24.g3  Be5  25.h4  Rac8 !  After playing b7-b6 Black never has to worry about a pawn on b7 hanging following an exchange of all rooks.  26.h5  b6  27.Kg2  Bf6  28.Qb5  Kf8  29.Bf3  a5  30.a3  Bg5  31.Qa6  Ke7  32.Rfe1  Rxd1  33.Rxd1  Rd8  34.Rxd8  Kxd8 =  and soon a draw was agreed in Duda-Meier, Warsaw 2013.  14.Nf5  things are currently not easy for Black:  exf5   14...Bd8 ?  15.Rb1  Qa3  16.Nxg7 !  Kxg7  17.Qe5  ↑  and Black is in trouble, Finkel  15.Qxe7  Be6  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Qxe6+  Kh8  18.Qxf5  Objectively this might not be anything too real, but I think this position is at least more pleasant for White, who retains the more active position after Black wins back the pawn. Here are two examples:  Qxa2   18...Rac8  19.Rb1  Qxc2  20.Qxc2  Rxc2  21.Rxb7  Rxa2  22.h3  White still has the more pleasant position with an active rook and the stronger minor piece with pawns on both wings. It is also worth noting that Whites bishop can potentially control the a1-square when it gets to the long diagonal.

10... cxd4
{ In this position,   10...b5 ?!  is risky as White can quickly open the queenside with  11.Be2  Bb7  12.c4  even if after  bxc4  Black might still keep things together with exact play:  13.Rc1   13.Ne5  I do not like the look of this at all for Black, but the computer does not see too many problems after  Bd6  14.Qa4+  and now:  Ke7 ?  (Adhiban-Kostenko, Tashkent 2016)   14...Kf8  Some analysis I did while preparing the first edition of this book indicates that Black can hold himself with precise play, for example  15.Rfd1  cxd4  16.Rxd4  g5  17.Bg3  Bd5  18.Nxc4  Bxg3  19.Qa3+  Bd6  20.Nxd6  Kg7  21.Rad1  Qb6  22.Nc4  Bxc4  23.Bxc4  a5  with the idea ...Rhd8=. However, I do not have a good feeling about this line   and  10...cxd4  is much easier  .  15.Nxc4 !  is quite embarrassing for Black. Just a sample line to illustrate the tactical problems:  cxd4  16.Nxd6  Qxd6  17.Bg3 !  e5   If the queen moves lets say to  d7  ,  18.Qa3+  keeps the black king in the center.  18.Bxe5 !  Qxe5  19.Qb4+  Qd6  20.Qxb7+  and Black is in trouble.  13...cxd4  14.Rxc4  (Asis Gargatagli-Gonzalez Garcia, Sitges 2011)  Bd5  15.Rxd4  Bc5  16.Qa4+  Qd7  17.Ne5  Qxa4  18.Rxa4  Ke7 =  and the game is equal, as taking on a6 only brings White trouble:  19.Bxa6 ?!  Rhb8  and now, for example,  20.b3  Rb6  21.Bc4  Rxa4  22.bxa4  Bxc4  23.Nxc4  Rb4  24.Rc1  Rxa4  and Black is more active. }
11. Qe2
{ White wants to keep queens on the board and intends to continue with Rad1, winning back the d4-pawn with attacking chances.  The endgame after   11.Nxd4  Bc5  12.Nf3  Qxd1  13.Raxd1  is no problem for Black as GM Dragan Kosic has shown in two of his games:  b5  14.Bb3  Bb7   14...O-O  15.Ne5  Ra7  16.c4  g5  17.Bg3  Ne4  18.Rfe1  Nxg3  19.hxg3  Rc7  20.a4  f6  21.Nd3  bxa4  22.Bxa4  Be7  23.Bb3  e5  =+  Krgovic-Kosic, Obrenovac 2005  15.Ne5  g5  16.Bg3  O-O  Instead of 16...O-O, GM Sumets played the more ambitious   16...Ke7 !  in a later game, preventing the simplifying Nd7.  After  17.Rd2  Rhd8  18.Rfd1  Rxd2  19.Rxd2  Rc8  20.Kf1  Ba7  21.f3  a5  22.a4  b4  =+  Black was pressing for the full point with no risk in Favaloro-Sumets, Amantea 2014.  17.Nd7  - Stojanovic-Kosic, Sarajevo 2008  Nxd7  18.Rxd7  Bc6 =  The interesting move   11.Qd3 !?  was played in some high-level correspondence games, with the same strong correspondence player defending Blacks case in all those games.  Qb6  Instead, I was looking for something more solid along the way and suggest:   11...Be7  12.Nxd4   12.Rad1  O-O  13.Nxd4  see 12. Nxd4  12...O-O  13.Rad1  Qb6  Compared with the main line 9... cxd4 10. O-O Be7 11. Qe2 O-O 12. Rad1 etc. Black has played the generally useful move ...a7-a6, while the white queen is on d3 instead of e2. With the queen on d3 the tactical idea Nf5 is not working in some lines especially with a Black rook on d8. Overall Black looks fine here, for instance,  14.Bb3  securing the b-pawn  After   14.Rfe1  Qxb2  15.Nf5  exf5  16.Rxe7  Be6  17.Bxe6  fxe6  White has nothing.  14...Bd7  with a solid position for Black who can follow up with moves like ...Rfd8, ...Rac8.  12.Nxd4  Be7   12...Qxb2 ??  13.Nb5 !  and White wins immediately, one point being  axb5  14.Bxf6 !  gxf6  15.Bxb5+  Ke7  16.Rad1  with mate.  13.Rfe1  Qxb2  and now:  Going for immediate complications with  14.Nf5  does not seem to promise an advantage:   14.a3 !?  The threat is Reb1, so the queen needs to move back.  Qb6  15.Rad1  O-O  16.Nf5  Qc5  17.Nxe7+  Qxe7  18.Qf3  Ra7  (Black wants to play ...b5.)  19.Qe3  Ra8  20.Qe5  b5  21.Bf1  Bb7  22.Rd3  Rfd8  23.Rg3  Kf8  24.Rxg7  Kxg7  25.Re3  with a dangerous attack for White in GlazmanGalanov, corr 2010. Black went on to hold himself, but going for such a line in over-the-board-play seems a bit crazy.  14...exf5  15.Rab1  Qxb1  16.Rxb1  g5  17.Bg3  f4  18.Bxf4  gxf4  19.Re1  Kf8  20.Qd4  Be6  21.Bxe6  Rd8  22.Qxf4  fxe6  Whites activity means that he is fine despite playing with a queen against rook + two pieces, but not more than that.

{ The idea to bring the bishop to e5 is logical, but too slow. After this mistake, White is left without sufficient compensation for the pawn.

{ One of the points of the queen check is that it takes away the b5-square from Whites bishop. Also it is more forcing than the alternative option, 9... a6.  The idea of this move is a very aggressive one: White offers a pawn and indeed would get nice play for it after   9...Qxd4  10.Bb5+  Here is an example in which Black suffered a crushing defeat:  Nd7  11.Qe2  Qxh4  12.g3  Qb4+  13.c3  Qa5  14.O-O-O  Be7  15.Rxd7  Bxd7  16.Bxd7+  Kf8  17.Qf3  Bf6  18.Qxb7  Qd8  19.Nc6  Rb8  20.Nxd8  Rxb7  21.Nxb7  +-  Boersma-Span, Amsterdam 2002. }

Black as so often happens in the Rubinstein has no weaknesses and will neutralize Whites mini-initiative with ease.

14... Nd5
{ Twelve years after introducing this strong move against Igor Nataf in 2005, Huzman gets to play it against an even stronger grandmaster. It is worth remembering the concept connected with this move.  Previously, the main continuation had been   14...Nd7  leading to an endgame after  15.Nc4  Bxf4  16.Nxa5  Bxg3  17.hxg3  The position is close to equal, but White is more active and has the easier game. He often castles long, puts his bishop on f3 and activates his kings rook via the h-file. Black still has to be precise and he has not been very successful in praxis  (+0 -4 =7)  . In contrast to the similar 14. Nc4 line, Black cannot simply chase away the knight with  b6 ?  because of the reply  18.Bf3  winning the exchange. However, there is no reason to play this ending in the first place, as the game continuation 14... Nd5 is a very simple equalizer. }

{ White cannot prevent Blacks intended set-up anyway, but by recapturing with the queen he at least gets his queen to h5.

After  Kf7  22.f4  the risk-free solution is  exf4  Instead, the ambitious   22...Qb6+ !?  might well be stronger, one point being that after  23.Kh1  Qxb2  24.fxe5 ?  the blocker  f5  works effectively against Whites attack and Whites queen.  23.Bxf4  Bf5  24.Bxf5  Qc5+  25.Rf2  Qxf5  26.Qxf5  Nxf5 =  20...Rf7  21.Rad1  Rfd7  22.Bb1  Qc5  23.h3  Ne7 =  Nataf-Huzman, Montreal 2005. }

{ Declining the offer is the simplest way for Black.  Instead, after   10...Bc5  which tries to keep the d4-pawn, the position tends to be more complicated. I decided to cover this second more risky option in some detail as well, as the lines can become quite interesting.  11.Qe2   11.Ne5 !?  White wastes no time with semi-slow moves and arranges his pieces in the most aggressive way:  O-O  12.f4  Be7  13.Qf3  Nd7  14.Bxe7  Qxe7  with a position that was tried in two games:  15.Qe4   15.Rae1  Rd8  16.g4  Nc5  17.g5  Nxd3  18.cxd3  Bd7  19.gxh6  looked good for White in Hall-Szczepanski, corr 2012, although Black later managed to hold a worse endgame to a draw. To conclude: Holding on to the d4pawn  (at least for a while)  with 10... Bc5 appears to be the preferred choice in correspondence play, but in my opinion the lines can be become too dangerous and concrete for over the board chess. Therefore I prefer the more solid 10... Be7, which we will continue to look at now.  15...Nf6  16.Qxd4  b6  Black will develop the bishop to b7 and seems solid enough.  17.Rae1  Rd8  18.Qf2  Qc7  19.Re2  Bb7  20.Rfe1  Nd5  21.a3  Ne7  22.Qg3  Rac8  23.Nxf7  This sacrifice only leads to a perpetual.

After   12.Ne5  Be7  two moves have been tried:  13.Rad1   13.Bxf6 !?  Giving up the bishop to get to the king immediately.  Bxf6  14.Qe4  Re8  This allows the queen to enter without further sacrifices.  A beautiful attack by White, but the question is whether White has more than a draw in case of   14...g6  15.Nxg6  fxg6  16.Qxg6+  Bg7  17.Qh7+  Kf7  18.Qg6+   18.Bg6+  Kf6  could be analyzed further.

Based on his lead in development and space advantage, White does not necessarily hope to prove an objective advantage, but seeks to apply long-term pressure in a more comfortable position.  The move   8.Be3  is similar to 7. Be3, investigated in Chapter 3. The only difference is that Blacks pawn is on h6 instead of h7. It is difficult to say if this is good or bad for Black, but it makes a difference in a lot of lines. On the one hand, Black has the g5-square under control now and does not have to worry about lines where White plays Bg5 or even Ng5 later. On the other hand, the bishop sacrifice on h6 can be a theme, after White has played Qd2 and Black has castled short.

{ Meier continued to try to get something going in this drawn ending, but the position is too simple and 19 moves later a draw was agreed. In this context the following questions arises: How much lower rated should the opponent be so that it still makes sense to play the Rubinstein ? When White wants to make a draw against the Rubinstein, it is really not that difficult if he prepares a drawish line and then plays solidly. Generally, I would not advise to play the Rubinstein if you are rated more than 150 Elo points higher than your opponent. }

{ Black is not interested in exchanging Whites bishop with   8...Nd5  and instead just continues his development. A good way to develop the light-square bishop is to soon play ...b6, ...Bb7. }
9. Bd3
{ Very flexible: d3 is the best square for the bishop and White keeps all options open where to put his queen. Other moves are played much less often.   9.Qd2  With the queen on d2, the bishop sacrifice on h6 may later be a possibility if Black castles short. Since the first edition of this book both logical options for Black have been played and they both look fine:  O-O   9...b6  and now:  10.O-O-O   10.Ne5 !?  was tried in a recent game by French grandmaster Jean Marc Degraeve.  O-O  11.Bd3  Bb7   11...Nd5 !  safeguards against the bishop sacrifice in typical fashion.  12.Bxh6   12.O-O-O  c5  ⇆  13.Bxh6 ?!  cxd4 !  is nice for Black.  12...gxh6  13.Qxh6  f5 =  and with the Bd3 blocked away and ...Qf6 on the cards White has to take the perpetual check.  12.O-O-O  c5  13.Bxh6  gxh6 ?  Instead, the engine believes that Black is fine after   13...Nd5  but I was looking for a way to avoid giving up the important h-pawn like that:  14.Qxh6  is a very dangerous version of the bishop sacrifice and White quickly won in DegraeveHaldorsen, Helsingor 2016.  10...O-O  On   10...Bb7  White can block Blacks bishop with  11.Bb5+ !?  c6  12.Bd3  This should not be a big problem as Black can try to play ...c6-c5 later. But 10... O-O is just simpler  11.Bd3  Bb7  ⇆  10.Bd3  transposes to 9. Bd3 O-O 10. Qd2.  After   9.Ne5  Black should not play 9... b6 ? because of 10. Bb5+, but  O-O  is absolutely fine. One practical example saw a nice attacking win for Black:  10.f4  Nd5  11.Qf3  c5  12.dxc5  Bxe5  13.fxe5  Qh4+  14.g3  Qb4+  15.Kf2  f6  16.Bd3  fxe5  17.Bh7+  Kxh7  18.Qxf8  Nxe3  19.Kxe3  Qd4+  20.Ke2  b6  21.Qf3  Ba6+  22.Ke1  Rf8  23.c3  Qc4  24.Qe3  Qd5  25.Rg1  Rf3  26.Qd2  Qe4+  27.Kd1  Rd3  28.cxb6  Qf3+  0-1 Belyakov-Laznicka, Pardubice 2011. }
9... b6
{ Black wants to develop his bishop first and keeps the option open to castle in both directions. }
10. Ne5
{ The most interesting and critical continuation; White wants to put his queen on the active f3-square.   10.Qe2  Bb7  11.O-O-O   11.Ne5  O-O  12.O-O-O  Nd5  transposes to 11. O-O-O Nd5 12. Ne5 O-O.  11...Nd5 =  Black is fine and still has the option of castling in both directions. Here are a few examples:  12.Bd2   12.Ne5  O-O  13.Bd2   13.f4  Nxe3  14.Qxe3  c5  15.dxc5  Bxc5  16.Qh3  Qe7  17.Rhe1  Rad8  18.g4  Bf2  19.Re2  Qh4  20.Qxh4  Bxh4  21.Be4  Rxd1+  22.Kxd1  Rd8+  23.Kc1  Ba6  24.Rd2  Rxd2  25.Kxd2  Bf6 =  Yu-Yu Shaoteng, Beijing 2012  13...Qh4  14.Nf3  Less critical is   14.Qe4  Qxe4  15.Bxe4  c5  16.Nc4  Be7  17.dxc5  Bxc5  18.f3  Rac8  19.Kb1  Rfd8  20.Bc1  f6  21.a3  Kf7  with a very comfortable ending for Black in Lopez Martinez-Laznicka, Rijeka 2010  14...Qf6  15.Qe4  and now: Georg Meier played the human move  Qf5  against Eric Hansen  (Dubai rapid, 2014)  .  I even more like the fascinating computer suggestion   15...Qg6 !?  16.Qxg6  fxg6  This just looks ugly at first sight, but looking deeper it quickly becomes clear that Blacks activity easily compensates the structural deficits.  17.Be4   17.Bxg6  Nf4  18.Bxf4  Rxf4  and White cannot keep the extra pawn.  17...Rab8  Protecting the bishop and making ...Nc3 a threat.  18.Rhe1   18.c4 ?  Nc3 !  18...g5  19.h3  Now White is finally ready for c2-c4, but  b5 =  prevents this and left Black with a fine position in LuckiVolovici, corr 2016.  This pawn sacrifice should be good enough for a draw after:  16.Qxf5  exf5  17.Bxf5  Nf4  18.Bxf4  Bxf4+   12.Kb1  Qf6  13.Nd2  O-O  14.Ne4  Qe7  15.c3  Bf4  16.g3  Bxe3  17.fxe3  e5  18.Rhe1  Rad8  was also comfortable for Black in Duda-Ivanchuk, Tromso 2013.  12...Nf4  Also good is   12...Qf6  when the latest example continued  13.Kb1  Nf4  14.Bxf4  Qxf4  15.Bb5+  Kf8  Black will have no worries, castling artificially.  16.Rd3  g6  17.Rhd1  Kg7  18.g3  Qg4  19.Rc3  a5  20.Bc6  Bxc6  21.Rxc6  a4  22.Rc3  Ra5 =  Black was already starting to put up slight pressure and went on to win the game Polzin-Hoffmann, Bilbao 2014.  13.Bxf4  Bxf4+  14.Kb1  O-O  15.Be4  Bxe4  16.Qxe4  Qf6  17.Rd3  Rad8 =  Gruenfeld-Speelman, Hersonissos 2017   10.O-O  is harmless. Georg Meier took over the initiative quickly when faced with this move:  Bb7  11.c4  O-O  12.h3  c5  13.dxc5  bxc5  Blacks isolated queenside pawns are usually not a problem in this type of position. In return, Black has gained the semi-open b-file and control over the d4-square.  14.Nd2  Qc7  15.Be2  Bh2+  16.Kh1  Bf4  17.Bxf4  Qxf4  →  Blacks pieces are much more active and White soon finds nothing better than giving up a pawn.  18.Nb3  Qe5  19.Bf3  Bxf3  20.Qxf3  Qxb2  21.Qe3  Qa3  22.Rfd1  Rac8  23.Rd3  Rfd8  24.Rxd8+  Rxd8  25.Kg1  Rc8  ∓  Pikula-Meier, Zurich 2010. }

12... Bb7
{ As the analysis of the main line   17.Qg4 !  shows, Black might want to look for improvements. The immediate   12...c5  is an idea, which so far has been played only in one correspondence game.  13.Nc4  Be7   The point is that compared with the line  12...Bb7  13.Bd2  c5  14.Nc4  Black does not give up the pair of bishops.  14.dxc5  Bxc5  15.g4  Qc7  16.Qe4  Nf6  17.Qe5   17.Qxa8  Nd5  is fine for Black  17...Qxe5  18.Nxe5  Bb7  and a draw was agreed in Cremasco-Schneider, corr 2012. If you want to play 9... b6 instead of 9...O-O, this might be a direction to look at. }

This is a better endgame version than line  (a)  , but probably still slightly in Whites favor due to the bishop pair.

This move serves to defend the kingside and create counterplay against b2 at the same time.  18.Rhe1  On   18.Qe4  Qxe4  19.Bxe4  c4 =  Blacks strong centralized knight secures equal chances.  White cannot afford   18.Bxh6  e.g.,  Bc6  19.b3  f5  20.Qg6  Be8  and the h6-bishop is lost.  18...Qf6  and now:  19.Qe4  is the move I focused on in the first edition.  But   19.c3 !?  looks like an improvement. The pawn move blocks Blacks queen away from the attack against b2. I have analyzed this position a bit and did not find a clear route to equality for Black. One problem is that Black is often worse when queens are exchanged.  19...Rfd8  20.Ba5  Rdc8  21.Qh7+  Kf8  22.Be4  White threatens  a6  but after   22...Ba6 !  Blacks counterplay against b2 is sufficient for equality:  23.Rxd5   23.Bxd5  Qxb2+  24.Kd2  Qd4+  25.Kc1  Qa1+  +=  23...exd5  24.Bd3  Qxb2+ ?   24...g5 !  25.Bxa6  Rc6  26.Bd3  c4  27.Bf5  Ra6  28.Bc7  Qxb2+  29.Kd2  Qd4+  30.Ke2  Re8+  31.Kf1  Rxe1+  32.Kxe1  ∞  25.Kd2  With Whites bishop on d3 there is no perpetual and White is on top after  f6  26.Bc3  Bxd3   26...Qb6  27.Bg6  +-  27.Qh8+  Kf7  28.Re7+  Kxe7  29.Qxg7+  Ke8  30.Bxb2  Rxb2  31.Qg8+  etc.  23.Bxd5  Bxd5  24.Rxd5  exd5  25.Qh8#  18.Qg3  Qxg3  19.hxg3  with a solid endgame advantage, which White eventually converted in Popov-Baklan, Turkey 2013. }

{ - Summary This chapter has discussed two alternatives to keeping up the pin with 8. Bh4. By playing 8. Lxf6 Qxf6 9. Bb5+ c6 10. Bd3 White hopes to leave Black in a somewhat cramped position and thus put up long-term pressure on his opponent. However, White cannot fight for an edge by giving up the bishop-pair so early without gaining any structural advantage in return. The most precise answer is 10... Bd7 !, which leaves the other bishop on f8 for the moment, considering to break with . ..c6-c5 quickly. After 8. Be3 I am recommending to play 8... Bd6   just as in the line  7.Be3  , and after 9. Bd3 it looks like 9...O-O ! is a reliable equalizer, while the theoretical status of the line 9... b6 10. Ne5 O-O 11. Qf3 Nd5 12. O-O-O is not yet entirely clear. }

{ - Summary This chapter has discussed two alternatives to keeping up the pin with 8. Bh4. By playing 8. Lxf6 Qxf6 9. Bb5+ c6 10. Bd3 White hopes to leave Black in a somewhat cramped position and thus put up long-term pressure on his opponent. However, White cannot fight for an edge by giving up the bishop-pair so early without gaining any structural advantage in return. The most precise answer is 10... Bd7 !, which leaves the other bishop on f8 for the moment, considering to break with . .. c6-c5 quickly. After 8. Be3 I am recommending to play 8... Bd6   just as in the line  7.Be3  , and after 9. Bd3 it looks like 9...O-O ! is a reliable equalizer, while the theoretical status of the line 9... b6 10. Ne5 O-O 11. Qf3 Nd5 12. O-O-O is not yet entirely clear. }

A strong multi-purpose move. It prevents the sometimes unpleasant Bf4 and protects b7, thus preparing to develop the bishop to d7. Also, Whites pawn on c4 is now attacked.  13.Qc1  Bd7  14.Re1  Rfe8  15.b3   15.Bf4  Bd6 =  15...Qb6  16.Rd1  (Ivanchuk-Nogeiras, Yucatan 2004)  e5  17.Nc2  Rad8  18.Ne3  e4  19.Be2   19.Bxf6  Bxf6  20.Nd5  Qc6  21.Nxf6+  Qxf6  22.Be2  e3 !?  23.fxe3  Bc6  =∞  19...Be6 =  Finkel.  The queenside advance   12.a4  is quite rare, but has already been tried by four 2600+ players including Vladimir Kramnik.  After  a6  White has tested different moves:  I am not sure if White can prove a slight edge after 12... a6 13.

Instead, he should have grabbed on b2:   15...Bxf5 !  16.Qxf5  Qxb2  for example,  17.Rdb1  Qc3  18.Bxb7  Rab8   with the idea of  19...Rxb7∓  19.Qf3  Bc5  with a good position.  16.Nxe7+  Kf8  17.Bxb6  Rxd1+  18.Rxd1  axb6  19.Nxc8  Rxc8  20.c3  +=  in Ivanchuk-Pelletier, Cap dAgde 2010.   13.Be3  Bd7  has been seen in two games. Vitiugov   who analyses this position via the move-order  12...Qa5  13.Bd2  Qb6  14.Be3  Bd7  gives the following lines:  14.Rfd1   14.Rad1  Bc5  15.b4  Qxb4  16.Rb1  Qa4  17.Nxe6  Bxe6  18.Bxc5  Rfd8  19.Qa3  Qxa3  20.Bxa3  Bxa2  21.Rxb7  Bd5 =   14.Qb3  Qa5 !  15.Qxb7  Rab8  16.Nb3  Rxb7  17.Nxa5  Rxb2 =  14...Qc7  15.Qb3  Rac8  16.Qxb7  e5  17.Nc6  Bxc6  18.Bxc6  Qxb7  19.Bxb7  Rxc2  20.b3  Ng4  21.Bxa7  Rc7  22.Bf3  Nxh2  23.Kxh2  Rxa7  24.a4  After the forcing line a complicated endgame has been reached. Whites position looks preferable, but his pawns are not likely to promote any time soon. Blacks counter-chances seem to be sufficient for equality.  Vitiugov  The very rare   13.a4 !?  caught my attention while working on the second edition of this book. In fact it is quite a logical answer to ... Qb6 as it indirectly protects b2 and prepares a possible later a4-a5.  Rd8   13...Qxb2 ??  14.Rfb1  +-  14.c3  and now:  e5 ?  does not win a piece after   14...Qc5  saw Black gradually equalizing in a high-level correspondence game:  15.Bf4  Nd5  16.Bg3  Bf6  17.Rfd1  Bd7  18.a5  Rac8  19.Qe2  b5  20.axb6  axb6  21.h3  Be8  22.Qe1  b5  23.Nb3  Qe7  24.Qe2  Bg5  25.Nd4  Qc5  26.Bg4  Bd7  27.Nb3  Qb6  28.Bf3  Bc6  Black is now fully developed and very solid.  29.Be5  b4  30.c4  Nf4  31.Bxf4  Bxf4  32.c5  Qc7  33.Bxc6  Qxc6  34.Rxd8+  Rxd8  35.Rd1  Rxd1+  36.Qxd1  Bc7  37.Qd4  - Wunderlich-Novikovas, corr 2008. But still this might be a line to look into for White. It is also not clear if 14... Qc5 is the best move for Black.  15.Rfe1  (xe7, e5)  and only helps White. }
13... Rd8 14. Be3
{ Belarus grandmaster Andrei Kovalev tried   14.Qb5 !?  here, immediately heading for the endgame.  Bd7 ?!  Letting White take on b6 looks suspicious.  The safest answer is   14...Qxb5  15.Nxb5  Bd7  when Black is very solid after  16.Nd6  or   16.Nd4  Rac8  or   16...h6  17.Bf4  Nd5  16...Bc6   14...Qc7   as in the similar line  14.Be3  Qa5  15.Qb5  also deserves attention, although with the white bishop on g5  15.Nb3 !?  turns out to be tricky:  Bd7 ?   15...Qxc2 ??  16.Rxd8+  Bxd8  17.Bxf6  +-  with Qe8 coming.   15...Rxd1  16.Rxd1  a6  17.Qa4  b5  18.Qa5  Ra7  +=  The engine suggests the curious move   15...Rf8  Black has a concrete idea of playing ...a6 to chase away Whites queen from the protection of g5 in combination with the well-known idea ...Ng4   xh2  to gain the two bishops. Also, c2 could be hanging in some lines.  Finally, the only practical example with 14... Qc7 went:   15...a6  16.Rxd8+  Bxd8  17.Qc5  h6  18.Bh4  Qxc5  19.Nxc5  This looks unpleasant, but Black appears to have adequate defensive resources.  Bc7  20.Rd1  (Mchedlishvili-Magalashvili, Tbilisi 2017)  Kf8 !  should hold; Black brings the king to the center making use of the fact that b7 is indirectly defended in view of ...Rb8   xb2  .  Instead, the game continuation,   20...Ra7 ?!  allows  21.Bxf6  gxf6  22.Ne4  Kg7  (The king would much prefer to go to e7 !)  23.Nd6  Bxd6  24.Rxd6  +=  16.Qxb7  Qxb7  17.Bxb7  Rab8  18.Bf3  ±  and thanks to 15. Nb3 Black cannot take on b2.  15.Qxb6  axb6  16.a3  e5  Black does not just want to be positionally worse and takes the concrete approach.  17.Rfe1 !   17.Nb3  Bc6 =  17...Bxa3 !   17...exd4 ?  18.Rxe7  ±  18.Bxb7  Rab8  19.bxa3  exd4  +=  Whites bishop pair gave him the edge, although Black managed to draw the game Kovalev-Sakalauskas, Vilnius 2014.   14.Qb3  is a recent try by a strong Indian grandmaster.  e5  15.Rfe1  (Sasikiran-Rydl, Czechia 2018)  , but  Rxd4 !  16.Qxb6  axb6  17.Rxd4  exd4  18.Rxe7  Rxa2  liquidates into a fine endgame for Black. }
14... Qa5
{ Somewhat surprisingly Black can also fight for equality by giving up the bishop pair with   14...e5 !?  15.Nf5  Bxf5  16.Qxf5  Qc7  This was tested in three correspondence games, and White did not get anywhere. After chasing away Whites queen with ...g6 Black often gets ...Bc5 in to neutralize Whites Be3.   16...Qxb2  17.Rb1  Qxa2  18.Bxb7  Rab8  19.Qxe5  +=  17.c4  weakens the dark squares.   17.c3  looks more natural, but still:  g6  18.Qc2  Rxd1  19.Rxd1  e4  20.Bxe4  or   20.Be2  Bc5  21.Bg5  Qb6  22.Bh4  Rd8  and Black is close to full equality.  20...Ng4  21.g3  Nxe3  22.fxe3  Bc5  and Whites extra pawn was not worth much in Edwards-Andrus, corr 2013. A highly interesting concept !

{ Moving the queen off the d-file is a very human decision in view of the idea ...e6-e5.  An important alternative is the engine's suggestion   15.a3 !?  Now there is no longer a pawn on a2 hanging and White can play b2-b4 in some lines.  e5   15...Bd7 !  looks a bit more exact and now:  The complications after  16.Bxb7   16.Bf4  Qb6  17.Rfe1  Bc6  18.Nxc6  bxc6  Not   18...Rxd3 ?  19.Nxe7+  Kf8  20.Rxd3  Kxe7  21.Rb3  Qa5  22.Rxb7+  ±  and White is doing great with R+B+P against the queen, as he has the bishop-pair and a dangerous 3-1 majority on the queenside.  19.Qb3  Qxb3  20.cxb3  Nd5  21.Be5  White is still pressing a bit in this ending, but as a result of his strong centralized knight, Black should not have much to fear. Blacks c-pawn is weak, but Whites queenside pawns can also become targets, especially after a possible exchange of minor pieces.  g6  It makes sense for Black to put his pawns on light-squares for general reasons to limit the prospects of Whites light-square bishop. Also, there is no g7-pawn hanging now if Black decides to move his king to the center.  22.b4   22.Rc1  c5  23.Red1  Rd7  24.Be2  Rad8  and Black is very solid.  22...a5  23.bxa5  Rxa5  24.Rc1  Bd6  25.Bxd6  Rxd6  26.Re2  c5  27.Rec2  Rb6 =  The weaknesses on c5 and b2 neutralize each other.  16...Rab8  17.b4  Qc7  are not bad for Black, for example,  18.Ba6   18.Bf3  e5  19.Nf5  Bf8  Black threatens 20... Bb5 as well as 20... e4 21. Bxe4 Bxf5, and White has nothing better than giving up the exchange with  20.Ng3  Bb5  18...Ng4  19.g3  e5  20.Nf5  Bb5  and now one possibility is  21.Nxe7+  Qxe7  22.Bc5 !  Bxd3  23.Bxe7  Bxf1  24.Rxf1  Rd2  25.c4  e4  with a complicated, unbalanced endgame.  16.b4  is very tactical and seems to be better for White in all lines.  Qa4   16...Qb6  17.Nf5  Rxd3  18.Nxe7+  Kf8  19.Bxb6  Rxd1  20.Ng6+ !  If Black takes on g6, White keeps a bishop-pair advantage after 21. Bc5+ followed by 22. Rxd1.  And  Ke8  21.Rxd1  axb6  22.Nxe5  Rxa3  23.Nc4  Rc3  24.Nxb6  leaves White a pawn up in the ending.  17.Qb5  Qxa3  18.Nc6 !!  This requires very deep calculation no problem for the computer of course.  bxc6  19.Rxd8+  Bxd8  20.Rd1  Be7  21.Qxc6  Rb8  22.Qc7  Qxb4  23.c3  Ne8  24.Qxa7  White wins back the material and remains with the advantage of the bishop-pair, which might, however, not be enough for anything real after the exact  Be6  25.h3  h6 }
15... Qc7 16. Qb3 Bd7 17. c4
{ Black can finish development like this as   17.Qxb7  Qxb7  18.Bxb7  Rab8   xb2  is fine for him.   17.Nb5 !?  which was played some years later in correspondence chess, looks more dangerous.  Qb8   17...Qe5  attacking the knight on b5, looks critical.  18.a4 !  and now:   18.c4  Bc6 =  18...a6  After some thinking time the engine prefers the stunning pawn sacrifice   18...Bc6  19.Rxd8+  Rxd8  20.Bxa7  and now the super-cool  h6  The escape square is useful in some concrete lines. Now it proves difficult for White to consolidate his extra pawn as Black has a lot of active ideas depending on what White does: ...Rd2; taking on f3 and b2; ...Ra8 to get to the a4-pawn, sometimes ...Ne4. It is hard to say if Black has full compensation for the pawn against best play; here are some sample lines:  21.g3   21.Qc3  Qxc3  22.Nxc3  Bxf3  23.gxf3  Rc8  24.Bd4  Bb4  25.Rc1  Nh5  26.Nb5  Nf4  27.Kf1  Bd2  28.Rd1  Rxc2  29.Na3  Rc8  30.Be3   30.Rxd2 ??  Rc1+  and mate  30...Bxe3  31.fxe3  Nd5  also looks drawish.   21.Bb6  Rd7  22.Qc3 !   22.Rb1  Bxf3  23.Qxf3  Rd2  =∞   22.Bxc6  bxc6  23.Na3  Ng4  =∞  22...Qxc3  23.Nxc3  Bxf3  24.gxf3  Bb4  25.Nb5  could be tried, although Black is quite active after  Rd2  26.c3  Nd5  27.Bd4  Be7  28.Rb1  Rd3  29.c4  Nb4  etc.   21.h3 !?  Ra8  22.Rd1  Qf4 !  Threatening to take on b5.  But not   22...Bxb5 ??  23.Bd4  +-  23.Be3  Qxa4  24.Qxa4  Rxa4  25.Bxc6  bxc6  26.Na7  Ra6  27.Nc8  Kf8  28.Nxe7  Kxe7  29.Bc5+  Ke8  I would rather be White with the bishop, although the computer gives almost full equality. Now let us get back to the game continuation 17. c4:  21...Ne4  22.Re1  Nd2  23.Rxe5  Nxf3+  24.Qxf3  Bxf3  25.Nd4  Bd5  is drawish as White cannot really keep the extra pawn.  19.Na3  with the idea Nc4, so it seems best for Black to take on a3, but after having analyzed this a bit, I am not sure if Black can fully equalize.  18.g3  h6  A bit mysterious.  But also in case of   18...a6  19.Nc3  Bc6  20.Bxc6  bxc6  21.Rxd8+  Qxd8  22.Rd1  White is slightly better.  19.c4  a6  20.Nc3  Bc6  21.Bxc6  bxc6  22.Rxd8+  Qxd8  23.Bf4  Qd7  24.Rd1  Qa7  25.Na4  Rd8  26.Rxd8+  Bxd8  27.Qf3  Qb7  28.b3  +=  White had a solid plus and later won the game Ros Padilla-Ilken, corr 2013. }

{ The main continuation, which also looks most testing. Other moves have been tried as well:   13.Rfd1  actually sets a devilish trap:  Rd8 ?  was Najer-Lysyj, Ulan Ude 2009, when both 2600+ grandmasters missed the beautiful tactic  Better is the prophylactic   13...a6  as played in a correspondence game, which took a wild course:  14.Ne2  h6  15.Bh4  Qb6  16.Qd4  Bc5  17.Qe5  Nd7  18.Qc3  g5  19.Bg3  f5  20.b4  Qxb4  21.Qd3  Qa3  22.c3  Rf7  with a complicated position. In the remainder of the game Makeev-Borisovs, ICCF email 2010, White had problems to prove full compensation for the pawn and eventually lost;  14.Nb5 !  Qb6  I came across the position after 13... Rd8 ? in Jacob Aagaards book Calculation, where it is used as an exercise. When you know that there is something, finding the solution is not so difficult, but the hard part is considering the queen sacrifice   14...Rxd3  15.Nxc7  Rxd1+  16.Rxd1  Rb8  17.Bf4  +-   14...Qa5  is as well met with  15.Qxd8+ !  Bxd8  16.b4  and so on.  15.Qxd8+ !  seriously enough in the actual game situation. The rest is not so difficult to calculate, the queen cannot stay in contact with the Bd8, which has decisive consequences, for instance:  Bxd8  16.Be3  Qa5   16...Qxb5  17.Rxd8+  Qe8   17...Ne8  18.a4  Qd7  19.Rd1  +-  18.Rxe8+  Nxe8  19.Rd1  +-  17.b4  Qxb5  18.Rxd8+  Ne8  19.a4  Qd7  20.Rxd7  Bxd7  21.b5  +-   13.Bh4  allows  Ng4 !

Black starts making too many moves with his queen.   13...Rd8  14.Rad1  Nd5  15.Bxd5  Bxg5  16.Qxg5  Rxd5  17.Nb5 !  Black is getting punished for neglecting his development.

15. Bh4
{ This move was first played by GM Csaba Balogh against Rubinstein expert Yannick Pelletier and later recommended by Negi in his 1. e4 repertoire book. The main idea is to play Bg3 and bring the bishop to a better diagonal.  Less challenging is   15.c3  Bd7  16.Qe3   16.Qe2  as played in Najer-Relange, Ohrid 2009, allows the motif that we just saw:  Ng4 !  17.Bxg4  Bxg5  and Black is absolutely fine.  16...Be8  17.Bf4  Qb6  18.Nb3  Qb5  19.Nd4  Qxb2 !  Meier correctly judges that this is better than repeating moves.  20.Rb1  Qxa2  21.Rxb7  Bf8  and White did not have sufficient play for the pawn in Kurnosov-Meier, Lublin 2010  But   15.Qe3  is a serious alternative. In the main line White is trying to press in the endgame:  h6  16.Bf4  Bd6  17.Nb3   17.Bxd6  Rxd6  18.Rd3  Bd7  19.Qe5  Ne8  20.Red1  Rd8  21.h4  Bc8  22.Be2  R6d7  23.Qxc7  Nxc7  24.c4  e5 =  Hillarp Persson-Pelletier, Reykjavik 2011  17...Bxf4  18.Rxd8+  Qxd8  19.Qxf4  Qb6  20.Qe3  Qc7  21.Qc5  Qxc5  22.Nxc5  Optically this endgame looks quite unpleasant for Black, although Meier and Pelletier have held this position against strong opponents:  In the first game there followed  Rb8  A few months later Pelletier came up with   22...Kf8 !?  which takes the sting out of Rd1  But allows White to take on b7:  23.Nxb7   23.Rd1  Ke7  23...Bxb7  24.Bxb7  Rb8  25.Bxa6  Rxb2  26.Ra1  Rxc2  27.a4  This still looks unpleasant on first sight, but I assume that Pelletier has worked out at home that it is a draw.  Rc7  In the recent high level correspondence game Straka-Belka, 2017, Black started by bringing up his king:   27...Ke7  28.a5  Rc7  29.Be2  Kd7  30.a6  Ra7  31.f4  Kc7  and went on to hold the draw as well.  28.a5  Ra7  29.Be2  Ke7  30.g3  Nd7  31.f4  Nc5  32.Ra3  Nb7  33.a6  Nc5  34.Kf2  Kd6  35.Ke3  Kc6  36.Kd4  Kb6  37.Bc4  Rd7+  38.Kc3  Ne4+  39.Kb4  Nf6  40.a7  Rxa7  41.Rxa7  Kxa7  42.Kc5  Ng4  43.Kd6  Nxh2  44.Ke7  g5  45.Be2  g4  46.Kxf7  h5  47.Bd3  Nf3  48.Kxe6  h4  49.gxh4  Nxh4  50.Be4  g3  1/2-1/2 Akopian-Pelletier, Aix-les-Bains 2011. If you want to play the line 12... Qc7, I would suggest that you take a close look at the endgames that can arise after 15. Qe3  23.Re3  But   23.Rd1 !?  looks unpleasant.

Ra1 Qb2 20. Rfb1, trapping the queen. However, in fact he even has different playable options in this position, the safest being  a6  But bringing the queen out of the danger zone with   18...Qa5  looks even stronger, for example  19.f5  a6  20.Be1  Qb6  21.Nd4  Qc7  22.Nxe6  Bxe6  23.fxe6   23.Qxe6+  Rf7  ∓  23...Qe5  By giving back one of his extra pawns Black has freed himself and is clearly better.  19.Ra1  Qb2  20.Rab1   20.Rdb1 ??  axb5  21.Rxb2  Rxa1+  -+  20...Qa2  21.Ra1  Qb2  with a repetition of moves.  17...Re8  18.f5  Bxe6  19.fxe6  Qe5  20.Qxb7  Qxe6  21.Rd7  Bf8  =+  Black has the better pawn structure, while Whites heavy pieces on the seventh rank do not have much effect.  17.Qxd4  Qc6  18.Qd6  Qxd6  19.Rxd6  in Vocaturo-Bellini, Arvier 2010.  Karjakins recent novelty   11.Rad1  turned out to be a good surprise weapon for a blitz game, though it is hardly more than that.  Nxe4  12.Qxe4  f6  13.Bc1   This is a more reasonable version than in the line  11.Rfd1 ?!  above where White had a rook on  a1  instead of  f1.  Bc5  14.Nxd4  e5  15.Nb3  Be7  16.Be3  Qc6  Instead after   16...Qc7 !

11... gxf6 12. Rad1
{ White should choose this rook to move to d1.   12.Rfd1  Bg7  13.Nxd4  O-O  14.c3  In his game against Viktor Erdos  (Hungary 2007)  , Vasilios Kotronias turned his attention to the queenside with   14.Nb5  f5  15.Bf3  a6  16.Nd6  Qxb2  17.Nc4  Qb4  18.Rab1  Qc5  19.Nb6  Rb8  20.Rd3  =∞  White has enough pressure for the pawn, but no more. A good way for Black to play is  Bf6  intending ...Rd8.  21.Qd2  Qc7  White can prevent Blacks exchanging idea with  22.Qh6  Bg7  23.Qh4  but this does not give an advantage, for example,  e5 !?  24.Nd5  Qxc2  25.Rbd1  e4  26.Nf6+  Bxf6  27.Qxf6  exd3  28.Qg5+  with a draw by perpetual check.  14...f5 =  In contrast to the 12 Rad1-line, White cannot smoothly retreat the bishop to b1  (well, he can, but that would make the Ra1 look silly)  and 15 Bc2 leaves the b2-pawn hanging. Therefore, IM van Delft played  15.Bd3  against me:  Bd7  16.Bb5  Rfd8  17.Bxd7  Rxd7  18.Nb3  Rad8  with equality, van Delft-Langrock, Hamburg 2007. }
12... Bg7

13. Nxd4 O-O 14. c3
{ Now Black has two options, which both currently are in decent shape from an objective point of view. }
14... Bd7
{ This feels like the most circumspect move.  Instead, the other main option   14...f5  allows White to build up an attacking position by bringing his rook to g3:  15.Bb1  Rd8  Necessary preparation for ...Bd7, as the immediate   15...Bd7 ??  is met by  16.Nxf5  +-  16.Rd3 !  Bd7  17.Rg3  Still, even here Black seems to have good defensive resources, if he plays precisely:  Kf8   17...Kh8  appears logical, going out of the pin and freeing the g8-square for the rook, but after  18.Qh5  Rf8 !!  White has the stunning returning motif  19.Rd3  19. Rd3 is the type of move, which is only played in correspondence chess, because over the board we are simply not going to consider it ! The direct threat is 20. Nxf5 exf5 21. Rxd7, and Black does not really have a good reply.  Be8   19...Rad8  20.Nxf5 !  exf5  21.Rxd7  Rxd7  22.Qxf5  +-   19...Bb5  20.Rh3  h6  21.Nxf5 !  is also crushing.  20.Rh3  h6  21.Qg5  Kh7  22.g4  Kg8  23.Qe3  Bd7   23...fxg4  24.Rxh6 !  24.gxf5  exf5  25.Qf4  ±  Black had survived the first onslaught, but only for the price of his kingside pawn structure, Chamaev-Wilczek, corr 2011.  But the cool   17...Qc7 !  improves Blacks play and currently is the last word in the 14... f5-line. This move prevents Qe5 and also prepares the active ...Qf4.  18.Re1   18.Qh5  is also met by  Qf4  18...Qf4  19.Bc2  Be8  20.Rd1  Kh8  21.Rgd3  Rd6  22.h3  Bf8  23.a4  Rad8  Black was fine and drew without any troubles in Florian- Just, corr 2013.  18.Re1  Bxd4 ?  Blacks darksquare bishop is a monster defender, and it usually needs very concrete reasons to justify exchanging it for Whites knight.  19.cxd4  f4   19...Qxd4  20.Bxf5  Bc6  21.Bxh7  Ke7  ±  20.Rh3  Qxd4  21.Rxh7  ±  While the material was equal, Black had a serious problem with his king in Huschenbeth-Rogozenco, Hamburg 2011. }
15. Bb1
{ This is usually played.  Instead, Niclas Huschenbeth recommends the rare   15.Bc2 !?  which is interesting. Later the bishop could be well placed on b3.  Rad8  16.Rd2  f5  17.Rfd1  (Huschenbeth)  .  Now Nxf5 is a threat, which I would suggest to meet with  Be8 !?  Yes, disconnecting rooks looks odd, but like this Black does not constantly have to worry about the capture Nxc6   which he would have to in case of  17...Bc6  , Black can follow up with ...Kh8 and ...Rg8 and looks pretty solid. Later the bishop can move to a square like c6 or b5, according to what White does. }
15... Rad8 16. Rfe1
{ Other options are:   16.Rd3  In contrast to the 14... f5-line, Black can now make a sensible piece exchange with  Bb5  17.Nxb5  Qxb5  18.Rfd1  f5 =   16.Rd2  f5  17.Rfd1  Ba4 !  Provoking a weakening of Whites pawn structure.  18.b3  Bc6  19.Qh5  and now in Huschenbeth-Levin, Rosenheim 2010, the standard  h6 =  would have been about equal. It is not easy for White to make progress on the kingside after, for example,  20.Rd3  Rd5  21.Rg3  Kh8  The impatient   16.Qc2  f5  17.g4  does not lead to much as was shown by Georg Meier:  Bxd4  18.Rxd4  Bc6  19.Qd2  Rxd4  20.Qg5+  Kh8  21.Qf6+  Kg8  22.Qg5+  Kh8  23.Qf6+  Kg8  24.Qg5+  - Brkic-Meier, Brno 2006.   16.g4  was tried in another Karjakin-Meier Blitz encounter. This is quite a principled positional move, trying to punish Black for not having played ... f6-f5 yet. However, it also has its downsides.  Rfe8  17.Rd3  Now in Karjakin-Meier, chess.com Blitz 2017, the German grandmaster adopted a waiting strategy starting with  h6  He held his own quite well against the 2016 Blitz World Champion, until a late blunder cost him the game.  Instead, he could have gone for more concrete options:   17...e5  18.Nf5  Bb5  leaves Black weak on the light squares, but threatens to win the exchange. White can avoid the latter with  19.Rxd8  Bxe2  20.Rxe8+  Bf8  but according to the engine has nothing better than a draw after, for instance,  21.Re1  Qxb2  22.Nh6+  Kg7  23.Nf5+  Kg8  and so on.   17...f5 !?  18.Rfd1  Bxd4  19.Rxd4  Bc6  also looks fine. Actually, Meier himself had played this kind of idea previously compare line  (c)  . }
16... f5 17. Rd3 h6
{ Maybe one of the ideas behind 16. Rfe1 was that the Qe2 is now protected, so that   17...Bb5 ??  does not work,  18.Nxb5  Qxb5  19.Rxd8  Qxe2  20.Rxf8+  +-   17...Bxd4  It does not feel very natural to give up this bishop, but the computer sees that it is not a problem in this particular case. The main reason is that White gets a weakness on d4.  18.cxd4   18.Rxd4  Bb5  19.Qe3  Rxd4  20.cxd4  Rd8  and White has nothing stronger than the perpetual  21.Qg5+  Kf8  22.Qh6+  Kg8  etc.  18...Bb5  19.Rg3+  Kh8  20.Bd3  a6  21.Bxb5   21.Qe5+  f6  22.Qxe6 ??  Rde8  -+  21...Qxb5  22.Qe3  Qd5  23.Rd1  Rg8 }
18. Rg3 Qc7
{ Even with the rook on g3, it is difficult to see how White can develop a really strong attack. The bishop on g7 is a strong defending piece and Black can always move his king to the h-file  (also enabling ...Rg8)  if necessary. }
19. Qd2 Rfe8 20. Qc1 a6 21. Ne2 Kh7 22. Rh3 Rg8 23. Nd4 Bf8 24. Nf3 Bc6
{ Blacks pieces are more harmoniously placed. One idea is to continue with ...Rg6, protecting h6 and intending ...Bd6 followed by ...Bf4 or ...Rdg8. So White decided to go for... }

Rxh6+ Bxh6 28. Qxh6+ Qh7 29. Qf6+ Qg7 30. Qh4+
{ the players agreed to a draw. - Summary Khalifmans Opening for White according to Anand series had been quite influential as have been Negis 1. e4 repertoire books. And so it is no surprise that 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 is still one of the hot lines in the Rubinstein. After 6... c5 7. O-O Nxe4 8. Bxe4 Nf6 9. Bg5 cxd4, White has the choice between two different approaches. 10. Qe2 intends to increase the pressure with Rd1, but after 10... Qb6 ! White is more or less forced to give up the pair of bishops. He can slightly weaken his opponents structure in return, but after 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Rad1 Bg7 13. Nxd4 O-O Black is solid enough as our game Edouard-Pelletier showed. The main continuation is 10. Nxd4 and after 10... Be7 11. Bf3 O-O the move 12. Qd3 ! has given Black quite a headache for a few years. However, I believe that Black can solve his problems and even has several playable options to choose from. }

The only practical example was in Blacks favor:  Qxb2  12.O-O  Qb6  13.Rab1   13.Bxf6  gxf6  14.Bb5+  Bd7  15.Bxd7+  Kxd7  16.Rab1  Qc7  17.Rfd1+  Ke7  =+  Gershon  13...Qc7  14.Ne5  a6  15.c4  Be7  16.Rb3  O-O  17.Bb1  Rd8  18.Rg3  Kf8  19.f4  Bd7  20.Kh1  Ba4  21.f5  exf5  22.Bxf5  Rd1  Even stronger was   22...Rd4 !  -+  when it is not clear what White wants to do with the attacked bishop on h4.  23.Rh3   23.Ng4  g5  is hopeless  as is   23.Bxf6  Bxf6  23...Re8  White is already a pawn down and in danger to lose additional material.  23.Nd7+ ??   23.Rxd1  Bxd1  24.Qxd1  Qxe5  ∓  Gershon  23...Rxd7  24.Bxd7  Qxd7  -+  Lastin-Yagupov, Kstovo 1997.  10...O-O  11.Nf3   11.O-O-O  Qd5  similar to the game   9.Bd2  , etc.  is possible, but with the extra move ...h7-h6 played, this might be a slightly worse version for Black. The difference is that after   11...Qb6  12.f4   12.Nf3  is well met by  Ng4  12...Rd8  13.h3  Bd7  14.Kb1  Nd5  15.Ka1  Bd4  16.c3  Be3  and Black was doing very well in Okkes-Belotti,Arco 2002.  12.Kb1   12.Bc3  Qxa2  13.Bxf6  gxf6  14.Qg4+  Kh8  15.Qh4  Kg7  16.Qg4+ =  is a draw.  12...e5  White can take that pawn  13.Bxh6  and after  e4   13...gxh6 ??  14.Bh7+  +-  14.Bc4  I have looked at two moves:  Qc6  And after   14...Qf5  I did not like the following line:  15.Be3  b5  16.Bb3  Bxe3  17.Qxe3  Ng4  18.Qd4  Qxf2  19.Bd5  Rb8  20.Nh3  Qxd4  21.Rxd4  Nf6  22.Bxe4  and White keeps a slight edge in the endgame. It is possible that Blacks play can be improved after 11... Qd5.  15.Bg5  Bf5  optically looks like good compensation for the pawn, but the computer gives White a slight advantage after  16.Bxf6 !  To develop the knight; the immediate   16.Nh3 ?  Bg4  drops an exchange  16...Qxf6  17.Nh3  11...e5 !  12.O-O-O  Re8  ⇆  There is also nothing wrong with the typical   12...e4  13.Bxe4  Qe7  14.Bd3  Qxe2  15.Bxe2  Ne4  16.Be1  Nxf2  17.Bxf2  Bxf2 =  Ambartsumova-Mkrtchian, Sochi 2016  13.Nxe5 ?!  and now in Landenbergue-Gerber, Geneva 1999,  Bd4 !  would have been in Blacks favor:  14.Bc3   14.f4  Bg4  ∓  14...Rxe5  15.Qxe5  Bxe5  16.Bh7+  Kxh7  17.Rxd8  Bc7  Blacks two pieces are stronger than Whites rook+pawn, especially as Black still has two bishops.  18.Bxf6   18.Rf8  Bd6  19.Rd8  Be7  20.Bxf6  Bxf6  21.Rf8  b6  ∓  18...gxf6  19.Re8  b5  ∓  with the idea of Bb7. }

{ 11.Bc3 !?  is an important option.  Qxa2 ?!  Correct is the other capture   11...Qxg2 !  12.Bxf6  Compared with the line 11. Kb1 Qxg2, here   12.Nf3 ?!  Qxf2  13.Qe5 ?  is not possible in view of  Qe3+  forcing the trade of queens.  12...gxf6  Whites rook is hanging, but he has enough resources for a draw/equality.  13.Nf3 ?  and 13. Be4 are well met by   13.Qh5 ?  runs into  (Qg5+ ∓)   13.Kb1 !?  threatens Qh5 and after  Qxh1  White can force a perpetual check with  14.Bxh7+  Kxh7  15.Qh5+  Kg7  16.Qg4+   13.Bxh7+  Kxh7  14.Qh5+  Kg7  15.Nh3  Improving on   15.Qxc5 ?

White must play aggressive to prove sufficient compensation for the pawn.  e5 !?   18...gxh4  is unclear.  19.hxg5  Bf5 =  13...Qxf2  12.Bxf6  gxf6  13.Qh5  f5   13...Qa1+  14.Kd2  Qa5+  15.Ke2 !  is also dangerous.  14.Qg5+  Kh8  15.Qf6+  Here the players agreed to a draw in Verleur-Etmans, corr 2002. But instead of taking the perpetual White can play on with  Kg8  16.c3 !  →  Now  Qa1+ ?  is simply met with  and   16...Bxf2  intending ...Be3+ can be answered by  17.Qh6 !  17.Bb1 }
11... e5
{ In 2002, this was an important improvement over the previously played 11... Qg2.   11...Qxg2 ?!  12.Nf3  Qxf2  13.Qe5  ↑  is extremely dangerous and has brought Black many losses in practice. As the computer evaluates this position as 0.00 after long calculation, I have put quite a lot of time into analyzing it, because I thought it might just be a forced draw somehow. However, it turned out that in this case the positions the computer judges as 0.00, are still pretty dangerous for Black. I will not go into details, but instead just show two examples from grandmaster praxis:  Be7  14.Rdf1  Qc5  15.Qg3  Nh5  16.Qh3  g6  17.Rhg1  Ng7   17...Nf4 ?  18.Bxf4  e5  19.Qh6  exf4  20.Rg5 !  1-0 Khalifman-Bareev, Wijk aan Zee 2002  18.Ng5 !  Bxg5  19.Rxg5  e5  20.Qh6  Be6  21.Bc3  Rfe8  22.Re1  f5  23.h4  Bf7  24.h5  Re6  25.a3  Rc8  26.Rh1  a5  27.hxg6  Bxg6  28.Bxf5 !  Black cannot recapture on f5:  Bxf5   28...Nxf5  29.Qxh7+  Kf8  30.Rxg6  +-  29.Qxg7#  which means that he was totally busted in Kazhgaleyev-Pushkov, Cappelle la Grande 2002. }
12. Bg5
{ The complications after   12.Bc3 ?  Qxg2  are not favorable for White:  13.Qxe5  was played in Sebag-Khukhashvili, Heraklio 2002, when Black strangely did not go for the straightforward   13.Nf3  Bg4  14.Qxe5  Bxf2  15.Ng5  Bxd1  16.Bxh7+  After   16.Rxd1  White threatens the spectacular  Rad8  17.b3  White threatens the spectacular  a6  but Black can just give back the exchange, keeping an extra pawn and the much better chances with   17...Rxd3 !  18.Rxd3  h6  19.Nf3  Re8  20.Qf5  Qf1+  21.Kb2  Be3  ∓  18.Bxh7+  Kh8  19.Rxd8  Rxd8  20.Qxf6  +-  16...Kh8  17.Be4  Bd4 !!  A tremendous shot !  18.Bxd4   18.Bxg2  Bxe5  19.Bxe5  Rad8  20.Bxb7  Bh5  and with the exchange for a pawn, Black is better. There are also two nice open central files for his rooks.  18...Bxc2+  is the point of Blacks previous move. Now White cannot recapture on c2 with the king, which means that he is instantly lost.  19.Ka1   19.Bxc2  Qxh1+  -+  19...Bxe4  -+  13...Qxh1  14.Qxc5  Ne4  15.Bxe4  Qxe4  It is quite obvious that White does not have enough for the exchange. Possibly she saw some baseline ghosts in her calculations, perhaps overlooking that after  16.Qxf8+ ??  Kxf8  17.Rd8+  the king can just go to e7 instead of getting mated after  Qe8 ??  18.Bb4+   12.f3  Be6  13.c4  Qc6  was nice for Black in Mastrovasilis-Maric, Kavala 2008. White still has to think about how to develop his knight, while  14.Qxe5 ?  would be suicidal:  Rad8  15.Qc3  b5  e.g.,  16.Ne2   16.cxb5 ?  Qd5  -+  16...Rxd3  17.Qxd3  Bxc4  18.Qc2  Bxe2  19.b4  Qd7  20.Qxc5  h6  ∓  and Black wins back the exchange, while White remains with a terrible kings position.  Whites best is to go for an equal position with   12.Bb4 !  Qc6  13.Bxc5  Qxc5  14.Nf3  Bg4  15.h3  Bxf3  16.Qxf3  Rfe8  17.Rhe1  Rad8  18.Qe3  Qxe3  19.fxe3  Kf8 =  Zambor-Abegg, corr 2002.  or   12.Be3 !  Qc6  13.Bxc5 }
12... e4 13. Bxf6 exd3 14. Rxd3 Qc6 15. Bc3
{ Black has nice compensation here with the bishop pair in an open position. }
15... Re8
{ Of course not   15...Qxg2 ??  16.Rg3  +-  but   15...Bf5  16.Rg3  f6  =∞  looks reasonable, too. }
16. Qf3 Qxf3 17. Nxf3
{ 17.Rxf3 ?!  g6  18.Nh3  Bf5  19.Ng5  Re2  20.Nxf7  Kxf7  Now it fizzles out to a draw.  Black could have gone for more with   20...Bxc2+ !  21.Ka1  with the idea of 22. Nh6#  (Bf8 →)  The bishop-pair in an open position and the strong rook on e2 provide excellent compensation for the pawn. There is also the real threat of ...Be4.  21.g4  Rxf2  22.Rxf2  Bxf2  23.Rf1  Bxg4  24.Rxf2+  - Lupulescu-Jeremic, Kavala 2004. }

{ This is the main continuation. As we will see in the game, it has the disadvantage that on h4, Whites bishop may be out of play later.

Of course not   11...hxg5 ?  12.hxg5  when White will at least win back the piece and has great attacking chances.  12.Bd2  After   12.c3  Ng4 !  strong Russian grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi got crushed quickly with White by Rubinstein expert Yuri Drozdovsky:  13.Nd4  e5  14.Qe4  g6  15.h5  Bxd4  16.hxg6  f5  17.Bc4+  Kg7  18.Bxh6+  Kxg6  19.Qf3  Bxf2+  20.Ke2  Rh8  21.Bd2  Be6  0-1 NepomniachtchiDrozdovsky, Moscow 2007  12...Qb6  and it is White, who has problems keeping the balance here.  13.O-O-O   13.O-O  Castling short does not combine well with the move h2-h4, and after  Qxb2  14.Rab1  Qxa2  15.c4  Rd8  16.Ra1  Qb3  17.Ne5  Qb2  18.Rad1  Bd7  ∓  White did not have compensation for the sacrificed material in Brendel-Gerber, Crans Montana 1999.   13.Ne5  ended in an opening disaster for White in a 2600+ encounter:  Qxb2  14.O-O  Qd4  15.Rae1  Bd6  16.Nc4  Bc7  17.g3  e5  18.c3  Qc5  -+  Savchenko-Meier, Havana 2009.  13...e5 !?  With this typical move, Black tries to seize the initiative himself without risking ending up worse.  There is a good chance that   13...Ng4  is objectively the strongest way to play and grants Black an advantage. But things can get quite messy in lines such as  14.Rdf1  Nxf2  15.Rxf2  Bxf2  16.g4  Sermek-Golubovic, Medulin 1997, and 13... e5 is just very easy to play for Black.  14.Nxe5  Re8  Playing White against the Rubinstein, Rubinstein expert Pelletier acted overoptimistically by giving up his a2-pawn:  15.Nc4 ?   15.Bc3  Bxf2  16.Nc4  Qc5  17.b4 ?   17.Bb4 !  Qxb4  18.Qxf2  would have kept things roughly equal.  17...Rxe2  18.bxc5  Re7  19.Nd6  Nd5  ∓  Soloviov-Maslak, Peterhof 2006.  15...Qa6  16.Qf3  Bg4  17.Qg3  Qxa2  18.Bc3  and now in Pelletier-Morozevich, Biel 2004,  (Rad8 ! -+)  would have won on the spot. The direct threat is 19... Qa1+ 20. Kd2 Re2# and White has no good defense, e.g.,  19.Rde1  Rxe1+  20.Rxe1  Qa1+  21.Kd2  Ne4+  22.Rxe4  Qd1# }

13. O-O
{ White parts with his bishop pair, hoping to make his development advantage tell. But this proves to be a dubious decision.  White can keep things equal with the main move   13.Qd2  A solid option is  Bd7  Black develops his last piece, and he can now think about the option ...Bb5.   13...f5 !?  is an interesting idea, which has been played in some correspondence games, and actually the engines favorite. The pawn move weakens the e5-square, but on the other hand Whites Bh4 starts to feel uncomfortable as ...g7-g5 always has to be considered.  14.Bc4   14.h3  Bd6  also good is   14...b5  15.O-O  b4  16.c4  Nf6  17.a3  Qb6  18.axb4  Bxb4  19.Qe2  Bb7  20.Ne5  Rfd8  21.Bg3  Rd4 =  with enough activity to compensate for the slightly worse pawn structure, Ilonen-Van Daatselaar, corr 2016  15.Bc4  Qc5  16.Bb3  a5  17.O-O  a4  18.Bxd5  Qxd5  and a draw was agreed in Horvat-Borisovs, corr 2010  14...Qc7  15.Bxd5  exd5  16.Qxd5+  Kh7  17.O-O-O  g5  There it is ! But White gets compensation.  18.Bxg5  hxg5  19.Nxg5+  Kg6  ∞  White has three pawns for the piece and Blacks king is open. On the other hand, Black should have good defensive resources with the two bishops. The a8-rook can potentially be activated via a6. I think, in over the board play anything can happen here, while in a correspondence game the game quickly ended in a perpetual check:  20.Nf3  Bxf2  21.Qd2  Qb6  22.Qg5+  Kh7  23.Rhe1  Bxe1  24.Rxe1  Be6  25.Qh4+  - Lau-Just, corr 2012.  14.O-O  Bd6  Meeting the threat b2-b4.  15.Bg3   15.Rfe1  Rac8  16.a4  Qc7  17.Bc2  Bc6  18.Rad1  Rfe8  19.Qd3  g6  20.Bg3  Bxg3  21.hxg3  Rcd8  22.Qd4  Qb6  23.Ne5  Qxd4  24.Rxd4  Ne7  25.Red1  Rxd4  26.Rxd4  Kg7  27.Rd6  Kf6  28.f4  Rc8  29.Ng4+  White has no way to make serious progress and decides to repeat moves  Kg7  30.Ne5  Kf6  31.Ng4+  - Oren-Ginderskov, corr 2014  15...Bxg3  16.hxg3  Bb5  or   16...Rfd8  17.Ne5  Nf6 =  Arnaudov-David, St. Affrique 2006  17.Rfe1   17.c4  Qxd2  18.Nxd2  Nb4  19.Be4  Bc6  is comfortable for Black.  17...Bxd3  18.Qxd3  Rfd8 =  Bes-Astengo, Cannes 2007.  After   13.Qe4 ?  f5  14.Qc4  g5  15.Bxg5  hxg5  16.Nxg5  Be7  Black was a healthy piece up in Pettinger-Myalikglijev, Bratislava 1993.  17.Qh4  -+  is met with  Rf7  when the rook cannot be taken as the white knight is pinned.   13.b4 ?  does not win a piece, but loses material after  Qa3  14.Qc2   14.O-O  Nxc3  -+  Sebastian-Langrock, Hamburg blitz 2004   14.bxc5  Qxc3+  -+  14...Bd6  15.O-O   15.Rc1  Nxc3  16.Qxc3 ?

{ Judging from praxis, it seems to be only Black who has chances of an advantage in this endgame. His light-square bishop will soon be a strong piece and the plan ...f6-e5, to shut out the h4-bishop, is quite unpleasant for White. }
17. b4 Bb6 18. c4
{ White decides to push this pawn to c5 now.   18.Be7  Re8  19.Bd6  as in Gallagher-Gerber, Switzerland 1996, brings the bishop into play, but after  a5 !  Black looks better.  20.b5 ?!   20.c4  is stronger, but still no fun for White as after  axb4  his c-pawn will be isolated.  20...Rd8  Whites c-pawn can easily become a weakness in lines such as  21.Rfd1  Bb7  22.c4  Rac8  23.Rac1  a4 !  The immediate   23...a6  allows  24.a4  24.Ne5  a6  25.bxa6  Bxa6  ∓ }

19. c5 Bc7 20. Nd4
{ According to the engines, White is only slightly worse in this ending.  However, it is quite difficult to defend Whites position over-the-board, as the following example shows:   20.Nd2  Rb8  21.Rab1  Rd8  22.Nf3  White acts in an astonishingly helpless way. The maneuver Nf3-d2-f3 has lost important time and done nothing to free the dark-square bishop.  e5  23.Bg3  Bb7  24.Rfd1  Be4  25.Rxd8+  Rxd8  26.Re1  Bc6  27.h4  a5  -+  and White was totally dominated in Jansa-Maslak, Pardubice 2009. }

Rd2 29. Nd6+ Ke6 30. a3 Ra2 31. Nc4 Bb5 32. Na5 Rxa3
{ Time to reap the harvest. With his extra-pawn Black now has excellent winning chances and his opponent does not manage to put up any resistance: }
33. c6 Ra4 34. Bxa7 Rxb4 35. Bc5 Ra4 36. Nb7 Rc4 { White resigned, as after }
37. Rxc4 Bxc4 { he will lose a second pawn, e.g., } 38. Bb4 Kd5 39. Na5 Bb6+
40. Kh1 Bb5
{ followed by ... Bxc6 and an easy win for Black. Summary In this chapter we have seen that Black cannot be run over in the Rubinstein. If White goes for a quick queenside castling, intending to attack the black king, Black should not be afraid of opposite castling, but he must be ready to take active measures himself ! A typical counter-attacking idea is the pawn sacrifice ...e6-e5, as in the line 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Sxf6+ Nxf6 7. Bd3 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Qe2 O-O 10. Bd2 e5 !. In our game Ganguly-Vaganian, Black could play ...e6-e5 without sacrifice: 5. Bd3 Ngf6 6. Qe2 c5 7. Nxf6+ Nxf6 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bd2 O-O ! 10. O-O-O Qd5 11. Kb1 e5 !, but still he sacrificed the e-pawn only one move later: 12. Bg5 e4 13. Bxf6 exd3 14. Rxd3 Qc6 with nice compensation. }

{ White just continues developing; a very solid, but not very testing reaction.  Against the similar   8.Ne2  Black can also take on d4, but a good extra option is to start with  c6 !?  9.O-O   9.dxe5  Qxd1+  10.Kxd1  Ng4  is good for Black.  9...exd4  10.Nxd4  Be7  11.b3  O-O  with equality in Tartakower-Mueller, Kecskemet 1927.   8.dxe5 ?!  is a strange choice, as after  Qxd1+  9.Kxd1  Ng4  it is clear that Black at least wins back the pawn, while his initiative might even promise more. The game Hracek-Laznicka, Ostrava 2007 continued  10.Ke2  Bc5  11.Nf3  Bd7  12.b3  O-O-O  13.Be3  Bxe3  14.fxe3  Rhe8  15.Rad1  Nxe5  16.Nxe5  Rxe5  with a structural edge for Black.   8.Qe2 !  is the sharpest move, and also the critical test.  Qxd4  After 8. Qe2 there is another move, which should be mentioned:   8...e4 !?  This pawn sacrifice has never been played, but it was mentioned by German IM Jonas Lampert in an opening video in ChessBase Magazine 180. He said it is the move that would throw him off playing 8. Qe2. Lets take a look what can happen:  Taking the pawn with  9.Bxe4  is the strongest move according to Stockfish, claiming +=, but I agree with Lampert that giving up that bishop for a knight after having played g2-g3 is not something you want to do. I would not even expect that an unprepared opponent seriously considers this.   9.Nf3  Bg4 !?  10.Qe3  Bxf3  11.Bxf3  Qd7  intending ...O-O-O looks balanced.   9.Bg5  Qxd4  is fine for Black.  Defending d4 with   9.c3 !?  followed by f2-f3 looks like a very human choice.  Be7  10.f3  exf3  11.Nxf3  O-O  12.O-O  Re8  White has one more pawn in the center, but Black is very solid and a timely ...c5 break can solve his problems in several lines.  Still the position after  9...Nxe4  10.Qxe4+  should be analyzed deeper, if you want to play 8... e4.  Instinctively I would be inclined to keep queens and the bishop-pair on with  Be7  11.Bg5  f6  9.Nf3  Qd5  After   9...Qe4  10.Qxe4  Nxe4  11.Nxe5  White has chances to develop some pressure in the endgame.  10.O-O  Given his backward development, Black is playing with fire a bit. From a theoretical point of view the assessment of this position is not clear yet:   10.Qxe5+  Qxe5+  11.Nxe5  Be7  12.Bf4  O-O  13.O-O-O  c6 =  di Berardino-Toth, Rio de Janeiro 2010  After  10...e4  White has tried two different moves:   10...Bd6  11.Re1  Bg4  12.c4 !  looks dangerous for Black:  Qc6  After   12...Qa5  13.Bd2  Qa6  as played in Brandenburg-van Ketel, Netherlands 2006,  14.c5 !  would have been very strong, for example  Qxe2  15.Rxe2  Bxc5  Also good for White is   15...O-O-O  16.cxd6  e4  17.Nd4  Bxe2  18.Nxe2  Rxd6  19.Bf4  →  16.Rxe5+  Be7  17.Rae1  Be6  18.Nd4  O-O-O  19.Bc3  White wins back the pawn and will retain the strong bishop pair and a nice advantage  13.Qd3 !  Moving the queen out of the pin.   13.Qe3  is weaker, because then Black could exchange many pieces with  Bxf3  14.Bxf3  e4  15.Bxe4  Nxe4  16.Qxe4+  Qxe4  17.Rxe4+  Kd7 =  13...e4  Now   13...Bxf3  14.Bxf3  e4 ?  is pointless as after  15.Bxe4  Nxe4  White can take on e4 with the rook.  14.Ng5  White wins back the pawn and keeps an initiative.  O-O-O   14...O-O  15.Nxe4  +=  15.Qb3  Rhe8  16.Nxf7  Rd7  17.Nxd6+  Rxd6  18.Bf4  →  Silin-Fedukin, corr 2012.  11.Ng5   11.Rd1  is less dangerous.  Qc5  12.h3  Bd6  13.Ng5  O-O  14.Nxe4  Nxe4  15.Qxe4  Bf5  was equal in Marquardt-Andersen, corr 2011.  Alternatively Black can start with   15...c6  when he does not have to worry about b7 hanging.  16.Be3  Qe5  17.Qxe5  Bxe5  18.Bc5  and a draw was agreed in Bartsch-Bergmann, corr 2012, as  Re8  is just equal  On  16.Qxb7  Black has good play for the pawn with c2 and g3 hanging.  11...Bg4  12.f3   12.Qe3  Bf5  13.Re1  Bc5  14.Nxe4  Bxe4  15.Bxe4  Bxe3  16.Bxd5  Nxd5  17.Bxe3  O-O-O =  The analysis of the first edition has now been supported by a correspondence game:  18.Bd2  Rhe8  19.c4  Ne7  20.Bc3  f6  21.f3  Nc6  and the balanced endgame led to a draw in Voveris-Avchinnikov, corr 2014.  12...Be6  and now:  13.fxe4  The untried   13.b3 !?  could give Black some headaches. This is a typical computer suggestion, one point being that Blacks queen does not have access to the c4-square anymore. The main line of my analysis goes  O-O-O  14.fxe4  Qd4+  15.Be3  Qc3  (with the idea ...Bc5)  16.Kh1 !  h5 !?  A strange-looking move, but ...h4 and ...Ng4 are serious ideas.   16...Bc5 ?  17.Bxc5  Qxc5  18.e5  ±  17.Nxe6  fxe6  18.Bg5  and now 18... Rd7 and 18... Qe5 19. Bf4 Qc3 come into consideration. Black has a certain grip on the dark squares, but I am not sure if it is enough for full equality.  13...Bc5+  14.Kh1  Qc4  with a further split:  15.Bf3  An important alternative is   15.Qf3  Bd7  (Preparing to meet e4-e5 with ...Bc6.)  16.e5   16.Qf4  h6  17.Nxf7  Qxf7  18.e5  Bb5  is also fine for Black.  16...Bc6  17.Qd3  The line   17.Qf5  Bxg2+  18.Kxg2  Qe2+  19.Kh1  might look scary in over the board calculation, but Black has  h6  and if  20.Nh3  Qe4+  exchanges queens.  17...Qxd3  18.Bxc6+  bxc6  19.cxd3  Nd5  20.Bd2   20.Nxf7  O-O =  20...O-O  21.Rac1  Bd4  Both sides weaknesses roughly balance each other out in this endgame.  15...Qxe2  Going into the ending looks like the easiest solution.   15...O-O  16.Nxe6  Qxe6  17.e5  Rfe8  18.Bf4  c6  19.Rae1  Nd5  20.Bg4  Qe7  21.e6  f6  22.Bd2  It is not clear if the e6-pawn is, in the long run, strong or weak, but Blacks position was somewhat unpleasant in Carroll-Van Gysel, corr 2011.  16.Bxe2  Bd7  17.e5  Ng4  18.e6   18.Nxf7 ??  O-O  19.Ng5  Bc6+  is obviously terrible for White.  18...Bc6+  19.Bf3  Bxf3+ = }
8... exd4 9. Qxd4
{ This is usually played, but White can also keep queens on the board:   9.Nxd4  Be7   9...c5  is the reason why Lampert prefers the move-order 9. O-O Be7 10. Nxd4 for White, though 9... Be7 is fine whatsoever and there is no need for us to learn two lines for Black.  10.O-O  O-O  11.c3  and now I like Fridmans  Bc5 !?  putting some pressure on d4.  12.Nb3   12.Be3  can be met with  Nd5  12...Bb6  13.Qf3  h6  14.Bf4  c6  15.Rad1 ??  Overlooking a cute little tactic.  Bg4 !  16.Rxd8  Rfxd8  -+  Whites queen has no square, which means that Black remained an exchange up in the endgame in Berndt-Fridman, Germany 2008. Sidenote: Believe it or not, this game reached our Rubinstein line starting with the Philidor   1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Be7  !   9.O-O  Be7 !   9...c5 ?!  10.b4  Lampert  10.Nxd4  transposes to 9. Nxd4 Be7 10. O-O. }
9... Be7
{ In this position, White is a little bit more active, but with exact play Black will equalize in the next stage of the game. Usually, Black soon plays ...c7-c6 to neutralize Whites light-square bishop. }

{ Black should try to neutralize Whites light-square bishop by putting his own bishop on the same diagonal.  After   7...c5  8.Bg2  White has good chances to get a long-term initiative as praxis has shown.  Interestingly, Meier played the very rare move   7...Bd7  twice at faster time controls; first at the Blitz World Championship in 2015 and recently in an online rapid game in 2018. The first of these games continued:  8.Ne5  Bc6  9.Nxc6  Qd5  The tactical point.  10.Rg1  Qxc6  11.Bg2  Qb6  12.c3  c6  (Vallejo Pons-Meier, Berlin Blitz 2015)  . White has lost the right to castle kingside, but he has the two bishops and is probably a bit better, although it will be hard to make something real out of it. We will see if the move 7... Bd7 will develop further; at the moment Black looks fine enough in the main line 7... b6. }
8. Bb5+
{ This has been played by a number of strong grandmasters in the last few years. White abandons the fianchetto plan and tries to lure Blacks bishop to d7  (instead of b7)  . However, Meier & Co. have found an immediate and good antidote.   8.Ne5  Bb7  9.Bb5+  is ineffective, as after  c6  White cannot win the c6-pawn.  10.Qf3 ?   10.Nxc6 ??  Qd5  11.Nxa7+  Nd7  -+  White should be less aggressive and play   10.Be2 =  as in Chiburdanidze-Burgess, England 1985  10...Rc8  I was surprised to find two newer games played by two relatively strong players by White  (2300+ and 2400+)  . Objectively Black is already better at this point:  11.Bxc6+ ??  (Balogh-Borgo, Pula 2003)  After   11.Nxc6  Qd7  12.d5 ?  with the idea Nxa7±, loses to  So White has nothing better than going into an endgame with the worse pawn structure after   12.Ne5  Bxf3  13.Bxd7+  Nxd7  14.Nxf3  Rxc2  12...a6  13.Ba4  b5  14.Bb3  Rxc6  15.dxc6  Bxc6  -+  After   11.O-O  (Winterberg-Haasler, Germany 2016)  Black should have taken the pawn:  Qxd4 !  12.Nxc6  I assume this is the move he was afraid of.  In case of continuations like   12.Bf4  or 12. Re1  Qd5  forces the trade of queens.  12...Qd7  13.Rd1   13.Ne5  Bxf3  14.Bxd7+  Nxd7  15.Nxf3  Rxc2  ∓  13...Bxc6  14.Rxd7  Bxf3  15.Rxa7+  Kd8  ∓  White does not have enough for the piece.

Bb7  9.O-O  Be7  and now:  10.Qe2   10.c4  O-O  11.b3  a5 !?  Anand is getting a little creative.  There was nothing wrong with the standard   11...c5 =  either, e.g.,  12.Bb2  Qc7  13.Qe2  - Ebert-Farago, Hungary 2005  12.Bb2  a4  13.Qe2  Ra6  14.Rfd1  Re8  Preparing Qa8, Finkel  the immediate   14...Qa8  would run into  15.d5  15.Bc3  Ne4  16.Be1  axb3  17.axb3  Rxa1  18.Rxa1  Bf6 =  Finkel, Shirov-Anand, Mainz 2004.  10...O-O  11.Rd1  The best attempt: White does not make it so easy for Black to push ...c7-c5.   11.c4  c5  12.Rd1  cxd4  13.Nxd4  Qc8  14.Bxb7  Qxb7  15.b3  Rfd8 =  Guseinov-Meier, Internet 2007  11...Qc8  12.c4  Re8  Protecting e7, which means that Black is now again ready to play ...c7-c5. In praxis, White has not achieved much from this position.   12...c5 ?  13.d5  13.b3  After   13.Bh3  c5 ?  would be strongly met with  Better is   13...Nd7  blocking the h3-c8 diagonal and thus taking the sting out of d4-d5.  14.Be3  Bd6  15.d5   15.Rac1  c5  16.dxc5  Bxc5  17.Bxc5  Nxc5  18.b4  Nd7  19.Bg2  Qc7 =  15...exd5  16.cxd5  Qd8  17.Qb5  Nf6  18.Rac1  Qe7  The exchange sacrifice   18...Rxe3 !?  19.fxe3  Qe7  looks inviting, as e3 and d5 are quite weak.  19.Bg2  Rad8  - Stellwagen-Meier, Yerevan 2006.  14.d5  13...c5  14.Bb2  cxd4  15.Rxd4  Qc6 !

Therefore a draw was agreed in Morozevich-Pelletier, Biel 2011.  The exchange   9.Bxd7+  has been tried by some strong grandmasters. White is hoping to prove that the weakening of the light squares with ...b7-b6 is more significant than the one caused by g2-g3 in his own camp.  Qxd7 ?!   9...Nxd7 !

With the knight instead of the queen on d7 Black does not have to worry about the move Ne5.  10.O-O  Bd6  Further increasing the control over e5.  11.Bg5  Qc8  12.Qe2  O-O =  13.Rad1  Re8  14.Rfe1  h6  15.Bc1  Qb7  16.Rd3  Rad8  17.Red1  Qa6  and Black was very comfortable in Bruzon Batista-Meier, Tromsoe 2014.  10.O-O  has not been easy for Black in praxis:  c5   10...Bd6  11.Qe2  O-O  12.Bg5  Be7  13.c4  Rfe8  14.Rad1  +=  with the idea Ne5, Jones-Wang, Cape Town 2009.  11.Qe2  Rc8 ?!  12.Bg5   12.Ne5  also comes into consideration.  c4  13.Ne5  Qxd4  14.Rfe1  Qc5  15.Rad1  Be7  Now in Vallejo Pons-Ivanchuk, Havana 2014,  16.Bxf6 ?  but much stronger is the immediate   16.Nxf7 !

{ - Summary There are two versions of the Fianchetto System: 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. g3 and the immediate 5. g3.

Bg2 e5 !, although after 5. g3 also 5... b6 6. Bg2 Rb8 is a serious and sound option as shown in the game Mamedyarov-Polgar. But also with a knight on f3, after 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. g3 b6 ! 8. Bg2 Bb7 Black is very solid as he has neutralized Whites bishop on the long diagonal. White has tried to revive this line with the surprising 8. Bb5+ !? in several grandmaster games. This move has some points, but against the correct reply White cannot reach more than an endgame, where he has the bishop-pair, but no real prospects to play for a win, e.g., 8... Bd7 9. Be2 Bc6 10. O-O Bd6 ! 11. Ne5 Bxe5 12. dxe5 Qxd1 13. Rxd1 Nd7 14. f4 O-O-O as in our game Vachier-Lagrave-Meier. }

{ A rare choice, but Meiers young grandmaster opponent he turned 16 at the day the game was played came to the board well prepared ! The line that we are going to discuss can also arise via other move-orders: 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 c5 7. c3 !? is actually the most frequent one, while 5. Bd3 Ngf6 6. c3 transposes to 5. c3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 as played in the game. }
5... Ngf6 6. Bd3 c5 7. Nf3
{ Whites early c2-c3 has some points, one being that the bishop can slide back to c2 in case Black exchanges on e4 followed by ...Nf6. So far there are only a small number of grandmaster games in this line  (one of the first being the 2700+ clash Kramnik-Bareev though !)  , but I expect it to become more popular in the future. }
7... Nxe4
{ Meier allows the mentioned idea, but his chosen sequence still looks most principled.  Another long-time Rubinstein expert, Swiss grandmaster Yannick Pelletier, played   7...cxd4  8.Nxd4  Be7  against GM A.Zhigalko  (Bilbao 2014)  . }
8. Bxe4 Nf6 9. Bc2 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bc5 11. O-O

White is ready to play with an isolated pawn and hopes to create attacking chances.   11.Ba4+  Bd7  12.Bg5  Bxa4  13.Qxa4+  Qd7  14.Qxd7+  Nxd7  was equal in the aforementioned game Kramnik-Bareev, Monte Carlo rapid 2004. It is worth playing though that game in your database. Bareev managed to take over the initiative in the ending and to outplay his world-class opponent.   11.Be3  O-O  12.Nxe6  This tactical shot does not lead to an advantage for White.  Qxd1+  13.Bxd1   13.Rxd1  Bxe3  14.Nxf8  Bb6 !   xd8  15.Nxh7  Nxh7  is similar  13...Bxe3  14.Nxf8  Bc5  15.Nxh7  Kxh7  and Blacks two pieces were not worse than Whites rook and two pawns, Moisa-Merrell, corr 2013. }
11... Bxd4 12. cxd4

Despite being deep in the endgame, this still looks relevant from an opening point of view because of the forced character of the moves following 16... Nd5.  Rd4  Black decides to exchange one rook, and with the other one getting to d2 this looks like a technical draw.  24.Rxd4  Rxd4  25.Rb1  b5  26.Kf1  Rd2  27.a3  a5  28.b4  axb4  29.Rxb4  Rd3  30.Rxb5  Rxa3  and Black had no trouble defending the remaining 2-3 on one wing in Macieja-Nyzhnyk, Chicago 2016. }
12... Bd7
{ We have seen this type of position before in this book. Usually Whites bishop pair and attacking potential compensate for the isolated pawn, but not more than that if Black is careful. }
13. a4
{ A strong novelty and most likely a result of home preparation. The idea is to bring the rook into the attack via a3. Previously played more standard approaches pose less problems:   13.Bf4  Rc8  14.Re1  O-O  15.Be5  Bc6  16.Qd3   16.Re3  g6  17.Rh3  (Martin Del Campo-Hadjiyiannis, Manila 1992)  and again I like the annoying  Qd5 !  White has to make some move which he does not really like   18. f3;  18.Rg3  and Black can continue with 18... Nd7 and a fine position.  16...g6  17.Rac1  and now the immediate  Nd7  as played in Helmreich-Borisovs, corr 2011, looks fine  while I have also looked at first activating the queen with   17...Qd5 !?   xg2  . There is one tactical option for White:  18.Qh3  Nd7  19.Bb3  Qb5  20.Bxe6  which however seems to peter out in equality.  Nxe5  21.Bxc8   21.Rxe5  Qxb2  22.Bxf7+  Kg7  23.Rf1  Rc7  24.Bb3  Qxd4 =  21...Nd3  22.a4  Qd5  23.Rxc6  Qxd4  24.Qe3  Qxe3  25.Rxe3  bxc6  26.Rxd3  Rxc8  with a drawn rook endgame.   13.Re1  Bc6  14.Bf4  O-O  15.Qd3  Qd5 !  16.f3  This move kills all of Whites attacking ideas on the third rank. In Stephenson-Dorn, corr 2013, Black now could have played  Qb5  offering a favorable exchange of queens. White can avoid this with  17.Qd2  but  Nd5  is equal.   17...Qxb2 ??  18.Bxh7+   13.Bg5  Bc6  14.Ba4  Bxa4  15.Qxa4+  Qd7  16.Qa3  was tried twice by the same correspondence player with White. But the problem is that after  Nd5  Black has the easy plan of finishing development with ...f6 and ...Kf7. Black already had a positional advantage in Popov-Rangel Garcia, corr 2015. }
13... Bc6 14. Ra3 Nd5
{ Not the computers choice, but centralizing the knight avoids a potentially nasty Bg5-pin and looks logical.  Certainly Black should avoid   14...O-O ?  15.Bg5  when the typical reply  Qd5  is strongly met with  16.Rg3 }

{ - A tense game with a correct result, which incidentally brought Georg Meier a victory of a strong closed GM tournament in St. Louis. At some points in the game the engine evaluates the position as r, although it is hard to say if it overestimates Whites activity or if there really is something. Future games and analysis will show, how this new line is to be evaluated. It seems likely that there are potential improvements for both sides after 13. a4. Summary In the last chapter of the Rubinstein section we have looked at less commonly played lines, which I thought are relevant enough to be covered in the book. In the variation 5. Bd3 Ngf6 6. Qe2 c5 7. Nf3 cxd4 8. O-O Nxe4 9. Bxe4 Nc5 10. Rd1, White relies on his activity and a small lead in development. However, by giving up the bishop pair, he pays a price for that. After 10... Be7 11. Nxd4 Nxe4 12. Qxe4 O-O Black is solid enough as the game Balogh-Laznicka showed. The line 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 c5 7. Nxf6+ Nxf6 8. Be3 has been played by a number of grandmasters and is actually not a sideline with more than 400 games according to my database. I do like Pelletiers treatment, 8... Qc7 9. Qe2 a6 10. O-O b6 !?, which gave him a fairly comfortable draw against the significantly higher-rated Fabiano Caruana. The game Korneev-Morozevich analyzed the position after 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. Bd3 c5 8. O-O cxd4 9. Nxd4 Bc5 and in particular other moves than 10. Nf3  (which would transpose to Chapter 1)  . These moves are not dangerous for Black at all. For example, Morozevich quickly equalized following 10. Be3 Bb6 11. c3 e5. Finally, the game Li-Meier takes a look at the variation 5. c3 !? Ngf6 6. Bd3 c5 7. Nf3. The early c2-c3 frees the c2square for the bishop. Meier played the principled 7... Nxe4 8. Bxe4 Nf6 9. Bc2 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bc5 and as usual held his own. But this line is still quite fresh and unexplored, and there will surely be more developments in the coming years. }

{ Chapter 10 French Advance 4. c3 } 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3
{ The advance variation is the most important alternative to the main moves 3. Nc3 and 3. Nd2. Many grandmasters play it regularly, among them worldclass player Alexander Grischuk. White immediately gains space in the center and based on that space advantage, White has won a lot of nice attacking games. Of course, there are also downsides, the most obvious positional drawback being that after a future ...c5xd4/c3xd4, White has a backward pawn on d4 and there are many instances of White eventually losing that pawn and the game. The system I am recommending for Black is quite rare, but I believe it is sound and it has brought me good results since 2003. }
4... Bd7 5. Nf3 a6
{ It also is a pragmatic choice, avoiding a lot of theory compared with the main lines against the French Advance, which is especially significant for those, who plan to pick up the Rubinstein as a second or third weapon against 1. e4 and otherwise do not play the French. If you instead go for one of the main set-ups against the Advance like 4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 or 4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7, you can easily have more theory to study than in the whole Rubinstein complex, which is our weapon against 3. Nc3 and 3. Nd2 ! I first came across this variation in an opening seminar given by Matthias Wahls, a well-known grandmaster from Hamburg, who later switched from chess to poker. Interestingly, that seminar was not about the French, it was about the OKelly Sicilian: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 a6. Wahls recommended meeting the move 3. c3 !? with 3...e6 ! 4. d4 d5 5. e5 Bd7, reaching the exact position as on the above diagram ! In fact, this position arises more often via the OKelly than via the French Advance move order. While it definitely is a sideline, it is also true that a good number of masters and grandmasters have already played this variation with the black pieces. A grandmaster who uses it regularly is Serbia's Sinisa Drazic. With 5... a6, Black has played a seemingly slow move. However, in combination with ...Bd7, there is a simple and sound strategic idea, well-demonstrated in the line }
6. Be2
{ So, if Blacks idea is to take on d4 and after c3xd4 play Bb5 to exchange bishops, what should White do against this ? The way this question was asked, the reply   6.a4 ?!  suggests itself.  With this move, White takes the b5-square under control and thus prevents Blacks idea. However, it does not contribute to the development of Whites forces and leads to a weakening of the b4-square. The drawbacks predominate here and, starting with  6...Nc6  Black gets a good game by playing natural moves. 6. a4 ?! is investigated in the game IvekovicSulava  (game 42)  , which also takes a look at 6.a3, 6.Na3 and 6.h4.  Of these moves,   6.a3  deserves some special attention, as after this Black should refrain from the ...cxd4/...Bb5 idea for concrete reasons. Instead, Sulavas  6...c4 !  a standard answer to a2-a3 in this sort of structure is the correct way to proceed. This is a good moment to mention one thing which I learned in the process of deeply studying Blacks set-up for several times: While the idea to exchange on d4 followed by ...Bb5 after c3xd4 is an important and recurring motif, it is not always the right way to play.

In our game Schlosser-Braun  (game 44)  , Black not only equalizes, he even manages to grab the initiative with an ambitious pawn sacrifice and then score a nice victory.   6.Be3  is the third most popular move after 5... a6. It has the disadvantage of leaving b2 unprotected though, which Black can make use of by playing  cxd4  7.cxd4  Qb6 !  Instead, in Popilsky-Soffer  (game 45)  , the grandmaster from Israel did chose the standard   7...Bb5  and also did well, although this might be less accurate.  The most frequent move is   6.Bd3  and this is also one of the critical tests of Blacks set-up.  Here we have a case, in which the standard recipe does not work well, as in the line  cxd4 ?!  Instead, the move   6...Nc6  is critical, which starts to put pressure on d4 and has been played by several grandmasters in the last years.  7.O-O  is mostly played, but after  An important alternative is   7.a3  covering the b4-square and potentially preparing b2-b4, which is analyzed in the game PonkratovAkselrod  (game 47)  , which saw Black create counterplay in typical French fashion after  Qb6  8.Bc2  Rc8  9.O-O  cxd4  10.cxd4  g5 !  7...cxd4  8.cxd4  Qb6  White already has some issues to protect d4 in a convenient way as  9.Bc2  Nb4 !  leads to a favorable piece exchange for Black after, for instance,  10.Bb3  Bb5  11.Re1  Nd3  White has tried several moves after 8...

O-O  14.Nc5  Bxc5  15.Rxc5  Rc8  16.Rfc1  Whites position looks more active, but in fact he has nothing. As the game demonstrates, Black can just exchange pieces on the c-file and equalize:  Qd7  17.a3  Nxe3  18.Qxe3  Ne7  19.Qd3  h6  20.Nd2  b6  21.R5c3  Rxc3  22.Rxc3  Qb7  23.f4  Rc8 =  Turzo-Kerek, Paks 1998.  13...Na5 !

A little more subtle than 8. O-O is   8.Nc3  sending the knight to the kingside after  Bxe2  9.Nxe2  Then, I recommend  Ne7  with the idea of placing the knights on c6 and d7 and the bishop on e7. There is a similar variation in a more common system against the French Advance: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Bd7 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Be2 cxd4 7. cxd4 Bb5 8. Nc3 Bxe2 9. Nxe2 Ne7.

There Black cannot take en passant as a3-a4 has been played by White instead of a2-a4.  13.Nxa3  Bxa3 =  and Black will just finish his development with a good position.  10...Ne7   More flexible than  10...Nc6  , because Black now maintains the option going for the development scheme  ...Nec6  ,  ...Nd7  ,  ...Be7  11.Ng3   11.Qd3  Nec6  12.O-O  Be7  13.Nf4  Nd7  14.Be3  Nb6  ⇆  Karpatchev-Langrock, Metz 2008  11...Nd7  In a recent game Black did well with the standard knight development:   11...Qb6  12.b3  Nbc6  13.O-O  h5  Playing with the idea ...h5-h4, but also preventing a potential Nh5 by White.  14.h4  Ng6  15.Bg5  Be7  16.Bxe7  Ngxe7  17.Qd2  Now the unnecessary weakening move  g6 ?!  in Skoberne-Mestek, Slovenia 2016.

The move   6.h4  is actually quite reasonable. Anticipating Blacks idea, White does not waste a tempo with his f1-bishop and makes a useful move instead.  cxd4  Consistent as Black goes for one of the main ideas of the chosen system.   6...Nc6  would lead to a main line against the French Advance 4...

Grandmaster Rainer Knaak is the chief editor of ChessBase Magazine and he took up this line with Black after I wrote an article about it for his magazine in 2006. Of course, I was very happy when I saw him winning such a nice counterattacking game with my line !   6.Na3  Like 6 a4, this is directed against the ...Bb5-idea and usually the knight will soon go to c2  (if Black does not decide to exchange it)  . However, after  6...cxd4  7.cxd4  Black has a pleasant choice:  7...Qb6  is solid and good.  The more concrete   7...Bxa3 !?  8.bxa3  Qa5+  worked out well for Black in one game:  9.Bd2  Qxa3  10.Qb1  Bb5  11.Bxb5+  axb5  12.Qxb5+  Nc6  13.Ke2  After   13.Qxb7  Nge7  14.O-O  O-O  Black has nice compensation for the pawn, as d4 and a2 are weak.  13...Nge7  14.Rhb1  O-O  15.Rb3  Nf5  16.Bc3  Qa4  17.Kd3  Qxb5+  18.Rxb5  Ra3  19.Rxb7  Rfa8  20.Rb6  Nfe7  21.Rb2  h6  =∞  Stellwagen-Kroeze, Netherlands 2010.

6... c4
{ This is an extremely rare move in this position; however, it is a standard answer to Whites a2-a3 in this sort of structure. Black gains space on the queenside and fixes b3 as a weak square.   6...cxd4 ?!  7.cxd4  Bb5  is not recommended, here. After  8.Bxb5+  axb5  9.O-O  But the untried   9.Nc3  b4  10.Nb5 !  +=  is a problem. In other lines like, for example, 6. Be2, this idea is not dangerous for Black, but here the fact that White has played the little move a2-a3 makes a big difference: Black cannot easily chase away that knight from b5, as a move like 10... Qd7 can be met with 11. a4, and Black is not able to take en passant on a3 as he could after a2-a4. So, Black should play  bxa3  when  11.Bd2  is a clever reply, preventing ...Ra5. The b5-knight seriously hinders Blacks kingside development, since ...Ne7 always runs into Nd6+.  9...b4 !  as in Delchev-Drazic, Italy 2003 and several other games, Black is fine. }
7. b3
{ 7.Nbd2  ∞  White is not interested in a strategic maneuvering game in a rather closed position and tries to open the queenside immediately. This resembles a very popular line of the French advance which arises after the moves 4...Nc6 5 Nf3 Qb6 6 a3 c4 7 Nbd2. In the database you can find more than 4,000 games of this variation , including many grandmaster games. The main difference is that in our version Black has played ...a7-a6 and his queen is still on d8. One could argue that ...a7-a6 is not the most useful move; however Black usually castles queenside and a7 can be an escape square for Blacks king, when the position opens up later. The fact that Blacks queen is still on d8 can save him a tempo, as in the previously mentioned line Black often plays ...Qc7 soon, while we can move the queen to c7 in one move  (...Qd8-c7 instead of ... Qd8-b6-c7)  . So, overall, I do not think that our version of this structure is worse than in that popular line. Depending on what White does, Black has a wide variety of plans. Typical are the maneuvers ...Nc6-a5-b3 and ...Bd7-a4; the other knight often takes the route ...Ne7-c8-b6. Sometimes the pawn move ...f6 or ...f5, intending to play on the kingside or in the center, can be appropriate as well. My advice is to play through some games of strong players, who play/have played this set-up with Black  (like Andreikin, Bareev, Vaganian and others)  . In this way, you will get a feel for what to do in this complex structure. After recommending it in the first edition of this book, I got a chance to test this line against a FIDE Master in a tournament game albeit with a fast time control. The game continued:  Nc6  8.Be2  In a more recent game of mine, White immediately went for the dubious b2-b3 plan:   8.Rb1  Na5  9.b3  cxb3  10.c4 ?!  Leaving the b3-pawn alive is too optimistic.   10.Nxb3  Ba4  11.Nfd2  was the lesser evil  10...Ba4  and Black was clearly better in Enxing-Langrock, Leipzig rapid 2018.  8...Na5  9.O-O  Ne7  10.Rb1  Nc8  11.b3  Opening the queenside rather helps Black.  cxb3  12.Nxb3  Ba4  13.Nfd2  Now I played  Nb6 =  in Liedtke-Langrock, Krostitz 10 min Blitz 2015  but   13...Na7 !  looks stronger. With ...Tc8 and ...Nb5  (in some lines ...Bb5)  in the cards, Black has the better game. Also moving the knight to a7 would have shown, that 5... a6 was indeed a useful move ! }
7... cxb3
{ Black should defend his space with   7...b5 !  with an interesting and roughly equal position.  8.Be2   8.a4  Nc6 =   8.b4 ?!  a5  8...Nc6  9.O-O  Nge7  10.a4  Nf5  11.Bg5  Qb8 = }
8. Qxb3 Qc7 9. c4
{ A strange decision; White goes for an isolated pawn position, but exchanges queens at the same time. Usually, if you play an IQP-position, you want attacking chances against the opponents king, viz., with queens on the board.  With   9.Bd3  Nc6  10.O-O  Nge7  11.a4 !  White could fight for an advantage:  Na5  12.Qc2  Rc8  This hinders the development of Whites knight and also is a useful developing move.  The immediate   12...Ng6  runs into  13.h4 !   12...Nf5  +=  13.Ba3  Ng6  14.Bxf8  Nxf8  15.g3 !?

13. Bg5 Nd7
{ It is difficult to see why Black refrained from   13...Bxf3  14.gxf3  Nbc6  In fact, this wins a pawn and Whites best reply seems to be  15.Ne2  White cannot hold on to the pawn with   15.Be3  Nf5  16.Ne2  Rd8  17.Rd1  because of  Bxa3  15...Nf5  16.Bd3 !  Nfxd4  17.Nxd4  Nxd4  18.Be4  Rb8  ∓  with some activity, but certainly not sufficient compensation for the pawn. }

Black has a strong knight and Whites pawns on e5 and especially a3 are a little weak. Black is slightly better, although the endgame is of course a draw with exact play.  16...Rxc6  Black wins back the piece with an advantage, e.g.,  17.Bxe6  fxe6  18.Ne4  Nc5  19.Nxc5  Rxc5  =+ }

Indeed, Black would have a nice position after   11.Nbd2  Or   11.O-O  b4  11...b4  11...Bb6  12.O-O  h5  This position is difficult to assess and much depends on what happens in the next six or seven moves. Both sides have their trumps. White still has chances to create a blockade on the dark squares, but his bishop is a problem at the moment. Both sides have pawn weaknesses. Black has several objectives: pressuring Whites weak pawns, installing a knight on c4  (maybe a4)  , and reaching a good knight versus bad bishop scenario... The engines believe that Black is somewhat better and the only practical example went well for Black, too:  13.h4  Qd7  14.Nbd2  Ne7  15.Nb3  Nf5  16.Bf4  Qc6  17.Nfd4  Bxd4  18.cxd4  Qb6  19.g3  Nc6  ∓  Nun-Spiridonov, Decin 1975.  8...Ng6  White does not have Bf4.  9.Qe2  Nc6  10.Be3  Be7 !  A strong retreat.   10...Bxe3  11.Qxe3  would only ease Whites task of gaining control over the dark squares.  11.Bd2  Qc7  12.Re1  O-O  13.h4  f6  and Black was taking over the initiative in Stern-Ekebjaerg, Sweden 1988. }

Much more common is   8...Nge7  when after  9.Bf4  Ng6   9...O-O ?  loses in standard fashion:  10.Bxh7+  Kxh7  11.Ng5+  Kg6  12.Qg4  f5  13.Qg3  +-  But   9...h6 !?  deserves deeper investigation. The idea is to meet  10.Nbd2 ?!  with  g5 !  11.Bg3  Nf5  with good chances for Black in the old game Habermann-Hahn, Bad Elster 1940.  10.Bg3  O-O  11.Nbd2  f5  12.exf6  Qxf6  13.Nb3  Ba7  White decided to give up his bishop pair to gain control over the dark squares in Klovans-Jakobsen, Italy 2005:  14.Bxg6 !  Qxg6  15.Nbd4  I am not sure that White is significantly better here, but I did not find a clear way for Black to equalize and neither did Jakobsen:  Bxd4  16.cxd4  Qh5  17.Re1  Rac8  18.Rc1  +=  (1-0/48) }

If you are looking for a detailed study of the Milner-Barry complex from Blacks perspective, I can recommend the excellent coverage in Emanuel Bergs The French Defence 3.   9.Bc2  has been the most frequent move in praxis, but Black can force a favorable piece exchange with  Nb4  10.Ba4   10.Nc3  Nxc2  11.Qxc2  Ne7  12.Be3  Nf5  and Black was of course fine after exchanging Whites light-square bishop for a knight and went on to win convincingly in Mariette-Ikonnikov, Rochefort 2018.   10.Bb3  Bb5  11.Re1  Nd3  12.Re3  Nxc1  13.Qxc1  g6 !

{ Summary In this chapter we got to know a highly interesting, even if rare system against the French Advance: 3... c5 4. c3 Bd7 5. Nf3 a6. One of Blacks main ideas was nicely demonstrated against uninspired white standard moves: 6. Be2 cxd4 7. cxd4 Bb5 ! with good chances for Black after the exchange of lightsquare bishops  (game 41)  . Two rather simple ways to prevent Blacks bishop from getting to b5 6. a4 ?! and 6. Na3 have not proven to be very effective as shown in the notes of game 42. The disadvantages tend to outbalance the advantages here, especially in case of the move 6. a4 ?!, which weakens the b4-square. A more critical try is the little pawn move 6. a3, which also was discussed in game 42. The tricky thing is that here the standard 6... cxd4 ?! 7. cxd4 Bb5 runs into trouble for concrete reasons. Instead Black should head for a closed position with 6... c4 ! as done by GM Nenad Sulava. A very reasonable approach for White is trying to control the d4-outpost with a piece, starting with 6. Nbd2 cxd4 7. Nxd4. However, Black can challenge Whites centralized knight and has equal chances in this line, and in our illustrative game Schlosser-Braun, he even scored an impressive win after a thematic pawn sacrifice. 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3  (game 43)  and 6. Be3  (game 45)  have also been discussed, but the real test of our system turned out to be 6. Bd3. Here we have a major deviation from the first edition as the previously recommended 6... cxd4 7. cxd4 Bb5 has run into trouble after 8. Bc2 !,when a powerful new concept for White was shown in a correspondence game. Instead, 6.. .Nc6 should be played, which leads to totally different types of positions. Here, putting pressure on d4 is the key, as lines like 7. O-O cxd4 8. cxd4 Qb6  (game 46)  or 7. a3 Qb6 8. Bc2 Rc8 9. O-O cxd4 10. cxd4 g5 !  (game 47)  show. Overall, the ...Bd7, ...a6 line remains a unique and absolutely playable set-up against the French Advance, which continues developing with new grandmaster games being played every year. }

{ Of course ! We are not giving White a second chance to strengthen his center with c2-c3. }
5. Bd3
{ White sacrifices the d4-pawn - at least temporarily - and goes for quick development.  The obvious move,   5.Nxd4  is played a lot on lower levels, but it is harmless.   It is worth noting that this position can also arise from a Caro-Kann after  1.e4  c6  2.d4  d5  3.e5  c5  4.Nf3  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e6  , but then it is White's move  ! Black is a full tempo up compared with that line, which makes his life much easier.  Here is an example from master level:  5...Nc6  6.Nxc6  bxc6 =  7.Bd3  Ne7  8.Nd2  Ng6  9.Nf3  Be7  10.Qe2  c5  11.c4  Bb7  12.O-O  O-O  13.Bd2  dxc4  14.Bxc4 ?  Now Whites kingside structure gets ruined.   14.Be4  was the lesser evil.  14...Bxf3  15.gxf3  Bg5  16.Be3  Bf4 !  Clearing the way for the queen and thus initiating the final attack.  17.Rfc1  Qh4  18.Bxf4  Nxf4  19.Qe3  Qg5+  20.Kf1  Rad8  21.Rd1  Qg2+  0-1 Bastian-Khenkin, Bad Liebenzell 2010. }
5... Nc6 6. O-O Nge7 7. Bf4
{ This is the main continuation and, as John Watson points out, White wants to get Bf4 - g3 in before ...Ng6 prevents him. However, as we will see White's bishop can easily turn out to be misplaced on g3.   After  7.Re1  Ng6  we will look at two moves:  8.Nbd2   The little move  8.a3  is quite popular. It prepares  b2  -  b4  and at the same time it resembles a useful waiting move, intending to meet  8...Qc7  with  9.Qe2  without running into  9...Nf4  as would be the case in the analogous line after:   8.Nbd2.  However, in my opinion, it is too slow and, in combination with a quick  ...f7-f6  , Black has good chances to gain the advantage:  8.a3  Qc7  9.Qe2  Be7  10.b4  Similarly   10.g3  O-O  11.h4  f6 !  12.Bxg6  hxg6  13.Bf4  g5 !  etc.  10...a6  11.g3  O-O  12.h4  f6 !  13.Bxg6  hxg6  14.Bf4  was Frnka-Geffert, Czechia 2011, when the tactical:  g5 !  would have been very good for Black.  15.hxg5   15.exf6  gxf4  16.fxe7  Qxe7  ∓  15...fxg5  However he chooses to recapture, White will not be satisfied:  16.Bxg5   16.Nxg5  d3 !  17.Qe3   17.cxd3 ?  Bxg5  18.Bxg5  Nd4  -+  17...Rf5  There are too many tactical threats, for example  18.cxd3  Qd8  19.Nf3  g5  -+  and Black wins a piece.  16...d3 !  The key idea, freeing the d4-square for the knight.  The immediate   16...Rxf3 ?  allows  17.Bxe7  17.cxd3   17.Qxd3  Rxf3  18.Qxf3  Bxg5  -+  and Black has a positionally won game with two bishops vs rook and pawn.  17...Rxf3  18.Bxe7   18.Qxf3  Bxg5  -+  18...Nd4  -+  8...Qc7  White would like to protect the e5-pawn another time with  9.Qe2 ?  but this runs into   9.Nb3 ?  White should be very sure about his attacking chances before giving up that center pawn on e5 !  Ngxe5  10.Nxe5  Nxe5  when White has tried:  11.Bf4   11.Bb5+  Nc6 !   11...Bd7  12.Bf4 !  is much more tricky, e.g.  Bxb5  13.Nxd4  as in Novello-Marcotulli, corr 1999  12.Qxd4   12.Nxd4  Bd6  ∓  12...a6  13.Bxc6+  Qxc6  and White does not have enough for the sacrificed pawn.  11...Bd6  12.Bxe5   12.Nxd4  Nxd3  13.Nb5  Nxf4  14.Nxc7+  Bxc7  15.g3  Nh3+ !  16.Kg2  e5  17.Qxd5  O-O  ∓  and Black's three pieces were much stronger than Whites queen in Lam-Geerken, corr 2014.  12...Bxe5  13.Bb5+ ?   13.Qh5  Bf6  14.Qxd5  O-O  15.Qe4  g6  16.Nxd4  Qb6  with a double attack against d4 and b2 is also bad for White.  13...Kf8  14.Qh5  Bf6  15.Qxd5  a6  16.Ba4  g6  -+  Schmidt- D.Meier, Kiel 2003.   9.Bxg6 !  The only way to keep a balanced game. Now both recaptures make sense.  fxg6   9...hxg6  10.Nb3  White will regain his pawn with roughly equal chances. One example on master level went  Bd7  11.Nbxd4  Nxd4  12.Nxd4  Be7  13.Bf4  f5  14.Qd2  Rh5 !  Black has to push ...g6-g5 in order not to get dominated on the dark squares.  15.Nf3  Qd8  16.Be3  g5  17.h3  Kf7  18.c4  g4  →  and Black had taken over the initiative in Crosa Coll-Cubas, Sao Jose de Rio Preto 2003.  10.Nb3  Be7  11.Bf4   11.Nbxd4  Nxd4  12.Nxd4  O-O  13.Qg4  Bd7 =  Freeman-Hague, West Bromwich 2003  11...O-O  12.Bg3  Bd7  13.Nfxd4  Nxd4  14.Nxd4  Qb6  15.Re3  Rac8  16.Rb3  Qa6  17.Rd3  g5  18.Rd2  Be8  19.f3  g4 !?  A beautiful idea by Uhlmann. After White accepts the pawn sacrifice, Blacks bishop will get a nice outpost on e4.  20.fxg4  Bg5  21.Re2  Bg6  22.h4  Be7  =∞  23.Qd2  Bc5  24.Rf2  Bxd4  25.Qxd4  Rxf2  26.Bxf2  b6  27.c3  Qe2  28.b3  Rf8  29.Re1  Qxa2  ∓  Skrobek-Uhlmann, Warsaw 1983.  9...Nf4  For   7.a3  Ng6  8.Re1  see 7. Re1 Ng6 8. a3. }
7... Ng6 8. Bg3 f5
{ A relatively rare move, but a good one, which had been played three times by GM Edmar Mednis. White now has a difficult choice to make: either give up his center  (exf6 e.p.)  or accept that his dark-square bishop will be locked out at least temporarily. }
9. exf6
{ 9.h4  h5  This looks a little odd, but it stops h4-h5, thus keeping theg3-bishop in the cage and also fixing Whites h-pawn as a weakness.  Stronger is the untried 9... Be7 !   9...Be7  10.Nbd2   10.h5  Nh4  is significantly better for Black as well. With Whites pawn on h5, the move ...g7-g5 is a strong option for Black in many lines.  10...O-O !?  Ignoring the hanging pawn on h4.  Of course not   10...Nxh4 ??  11.Nxh4  Bxh4  12.Qh5+  +-   10...Bxh4  is possible, but gives up the precious dark-square bishop for a knight.  11.h5  Nh8  It is unclear how White can get a playable position. By transposition, we have reached two games from the 90s, both in fact quite instructive:  12.Bf4   12.Nb3  Qe8  13.Nfxd4  f4  14.Nxc6  bxc6  15.Bh2  f3  16.Nd4  fxg2  17.Kxg2  c5  18.Bb5  Bd7  19.Bxd7  Qxd7  -+  12...g5 !  13.hxg6  hxg6  14.Nb3  Rf7  Bringing the rook to the open h-file.  15.Qc1  Rh7  Moves like ...Nf7 and ...g5 are coming next and White was in big trouble in Tehrani-Sobhani, Iran 1995.  10.Ng5 !  The knight jumps to g5, before Black plays ...Be7.   10.Be2  Be7  11.Nxd4  Bxh4  12.Bh2  Ngxe5  13.Bb5  Kf7  14.Bxc6  Nxc6  15.Nxc6  bxc6  -+  with two extra pawns for Black and only very vague chances for White in Hodgson-Mednis, Ramsgate 1984  10...Be7  (Taking on e5 is also not clear.)  11.f4  Bxg5  12.hxg5  with a complicated struggle in Smykovsky-Nikitin, Moscow 1995.   9.a3  Be7  10.Re1  O-O  11.h3  a5  12.a4  Bd7 !  Keeping the queen on d8 and not even allowing h4-h5 looks easiest.  The pawn grab   12...Qb6  13.Na3  Qxb2  probably does not lose the advantage, but things got messy after  14.Nb5  Qb4  15.h4  Qc5  16.h5  Nh8  17.Bf4  Nf7  18.Rb1  Qb6 ?!  19.Nbxd4  Qd8  20.c3  in Gobet-Mednis, Rome 1984.  After 12... Bd7 White does not have much to show for the pawn, for instance  13.Nbd2  Rc8  14.Nb3  Bb4  15.Re2  f4  16.Bh2  Nh4  17.Nxh4  Qxh4  18.f3  Qg5  ∓  and e5 is just as weak as d4. }
9... gxf6 10. Nh4
{ This is too ambitious and it backfires.  White should regain the pawn with   10.Nxd4  Nxd4  11.Bxg6+  hxg6  12.Qxd4  After  Kf7  it is obvious that Black is doing well with his bishop pair and mobile center pawns. However, White has good chances to equalize with  13.c4 !  e.g.,  b6  14.cxd5  Qxd5  15.Qxd5  exd5  16.Rd1  Bb7  17.Nc3  Rd8  18.Nb5  and a draw was agreed in Hodgson-Mednis, Brighton 1983. Indeed, White is solid enough after  a6  19.Rac1 !  Rd7  20.Nd4 = }
10... f5 11. Qh5 Qf6 12. f4
{ White is well-advised to play this move to try to keep Blacks center pawns under control. }
12... Bd6
{ Black decides to castle kingside. The other approach   12...Bd7  13.Nd2  O-O-O  was good as well. }
13. Nd2 O-O 14. Rae1 Bd7 15. a3 a6 16. Kh1 Rac8 17. Nb3 Rc7
{ An interesting move; the rook can defend on the seventh rank, but it can also swing over to the attack as we will see soon ! It is obvious that Whites attacking attempts did not lead to much and Blacks extra pawn gives him an advantage. }
18. Nxg6
{ A risky exchange from a strategic point of view, as Black now gets even more influence in the center as a result of a potential ...g6-g5 break. }
18... hxg6 19. Qf3 Bc8 20. Rd1 Rh7 21. Be2 Qh8 22. h3 g5
{ Very typical. Without Whites f4-pawn, Blacks center pawns will become a deadly force. }
23. fxg5 { I also like } 23... Rxh3+
{ Actually, this is not a sacrifice, as Black immediately gets two pawns and a bishop for the rook.  Many roads lead to Rome in this position. Black played   23...Ne5  which is strong, and he eventually won after mistakes by both sides.   23...Bxg3 !  24.Qxg3  e5  -+  is massive for Black and probably the clearest way to victory. }
24. gxh3 Qxh3+ 25. Kg1 Bxg3 26. Qh5 { 26.Qg2  Qh4  is also hopeless. } 26...
Qxh5 27. Bxh5 e5
{ Blacks pawns are about to start rolling. This, in combination with the bishop pair and the weakness of Whites gpawn, means that Black is totally winning despite not having a material advantage yet. }

{ Giving up a center pawn like this looks illogical, but in the old days this move had been played by legends like Keres, Nimzowitsch and Tarrasch. In a few words, John Watson explains the concept behind this line: Rather than defend d4, White shifts his attention to bolstering e5 with pieces, so that after ...f6, he will be able to occupy the outpost on e5. The problem for White is that this concept fails, because if Black plays accurately, White will not be able to keep the crucial e5-square under control. Furthermore, it is worth noting that as Simon Williams points out in Attacking Chess: The French the position after 4. dxc5 can also arise from a Caro Kann after the moves 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. dxc5 e6, where it is Whites move. According to Williams, that Caro Kann line is known to be OK for Black; therefore it is no surprise that with an extra tempo Black already has good chances to gain the advantage ! }
4... Nc6
{ There is no need to allow   4...Bxc5 ?!  5.Qg4 !  after which White is doing fine. }
5. Nf3 Bxc5 6. Bd3 f6
{ This direct attack on Whites center probably leads to a black advantage even against best play, so there is no need to look into quieter alternatives like 6... Nge7. }
7. Qe2
{ White tries to fight for the control over the e5-square. Other moves are already very bad for White:   7.exf6 ?!  Nxf6  8.O-O  O-O  9.c4  Understandably, White does not want to get overrun in the center. Unfortunately for him, after  Moves other than 9. c4 run into even bigger trouble, e.g.,   9.Qe2 ?  e5 !  10.Nxe5  Nxe5  11.Qxe5  Ng4  12.Qh5  g6  13.Bxg6  Qe7  14.b4   14.Bxh7+  Qxh7  15.Qxd5+  is more resistant, but after  Rf7  White will soon run out checks, while h2 and f2 are hanging. Black has a winning position here as well, for example,  16.Bf4  Qf5  17.Qxf5  Bxf5  18.h3  Nxf2 !  19.Rxf2  Bxc2  20.g3  Rd8 !  21.Nc3  Rxf4  22.gxf4  Rd2  23.Raf1  Bd3  -+  14...Bxf2+  15.Kh1  hxg6  16.Qxg6+  Qg7  17.Qxg7+  Kxg7  -+  Lanc-Bombek, Slovakia 2012.  9...dxc4 !  10.Bxc4  Qxd1  11.Rxd1  Ng4  he loses material by force and only has the choice between different difficult endgames.  12.Rf1  is quite a passive move.  As White will lose material anyway, he could think about giving up the f-pawn straightaway and develop with   12.Nc3  However, after  Bxf2+   12...Nxf2  13.Na4 !  Nxd1+  14.Nxc5  is less clear.  13.Kh1  Bb6  14.Ne4  Nce5  15.Nxe5  Nxe5  16.Bb3  Bd7  it is clear that Black can play for a win without any risk. In some lines, there is also the option to give back the pawn for activity, for example,  17.Bd2  Bc6  18.Bc3  Rf4 !  19.Bxe6+  Kh8  20.Ng5  Ng4  21.Bxg4   21.Nf7+  Rxf7  22.Bxg4  Rf2  23.Bh3  Raf8  →  21...Rxg4  22.Nf3  Rf8  →  12...Nd4  13.Nbd2  b5  14.Bd3  White should probably look for salvation in the exchange sacrifice   14.Nxd4 !  Bxd4  The super safe way is   14...bxc4  to decline the sacrifice with  15.N4f3  Bb7  After  16.Nxc4  Bxf3  17.gxf3  Rxf3  Black will win the f2-pawn, but in the rook endgame after  18.Be3  Nxe3  19.Nxe3  Bxe3  20.fxe3  Rxe3  21.Rac1  =+  White has good drawing chances.  15.Nf3   15.Be2  Nxf2  16.Nf3  Bb6  17.Rxf2  e5  ∓  15...Bxf2+  16.Rxf2  Nxf2  17.Bxb5  ∓  White does not even have a pawn for the exchange and is of course objectively fighting for a draw. However, he has the bishop-pair and he is not terribly passive anymore. At least the position is quite complicated.  14...Bb7  ∓  15.Be4 ?  Black threatens to win material with   15.a3  Nxf2  or to improve his position calmly with   15...Rad8   xd3  White is in serious trouble.  16.Rxf2  Bxf3  17.gxf3  Nxf3+  etc.   15.h3 ?

He managed to convert his advantage into a full point in Feoktistov-Driamin, Saratov 1999.  15...Ne2+  16.Kh1  Bd5 !  -+  and there was no way for White to defend the f2-pawn in Barlov-Ambroz, Prague 1981.   7.Bf4 ?  fxe5  8.Nxe5 ?   8.Bxe5  is the lesser evil, but after  Nxe5  9.Nxe5  Qg5  10.Bb5+  Ke7  11.Nf3  Qxg2  12.Rf1  Nf6  Black was just a sound pawn up in Dumas-Guo, Aix les Bains 2009  8...Qf6  White already loses decisive material:  9.Nxc6   9.Qh5+  g6  10.Nxg6  hxg6  11.Qxg6+  Qxg6  12.Bxg6+  Kf8  13.h4  e5  -+  De Villiers-Leow, Athens 1971  9...Qxf4  10.Qh5+  Kf8  11.Ne5  Bd4  12.Ng6+  hxg6  13.Qxh8  Qc1+  14.Ke2  Qxh1  -+  Bracchi-Gruhska, Argentina 1982. }
7... fxe5 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Qxe5 Nf6
{ An important aspect of this position is that White cannot establish long-term control over the e5-square and thus does not manage to blockade the center on the dark squares. It is Black who will control the center after a later ...Bd6, possibly followed by ...e6-e5. }
10. O-O
{ The check   10.Bb5+  is actually played more often. Of course, Black does not reply  Bd7 ?  Instead he can easily perform artificial castling after   10...Kf7  11.O-O  Rf8  Whites bishop is not well-placed on b5 and often there is nothing better than to retreat it to d3, after which the game can in fact transpose to 10. O-O O-O lines. One example from praxis went  12.Nc3  Kg8  13.Bd3  Bd6  14.Qg5  e5  15.f3  Bd7  16.Bd2  Bc6  17.Rae1  Qb6+  18.Kh1  Rae8  19.Bc1  e4  20.fxe4  dxe4  21.Bc4+  Kh8  =+  Blacks e-pawn is actually more strong than weak. In Smolin-Tovmasian, Zaporozhye 2011, White now sacrificed a pawn in order to activate his bishop:  22.Be3  Qxb2  23.Bd4 !  but the correct reply,  h6   xe5  24.Qd2  Be5  would have left White without sufficient compensation after  25.Bxe5  Rxe5  26.Ne2 !  Qb6  27.Nf4  Be8  11.Qxe6+ }
10... O-O 11. Nc3
{ 11.c4  as played in Makropoulos-Hug, Nice 1974, loses a pawn to  Ng4 !  12.Qh5  Rxf2  After  13.Qxh7+ ?  After   13.Rxf2  Bxf2+  14.Kh1  Nf6  15.Qe2  Black has several playable options:  dxc4  16.Bxc4  Qd4   16...Bd4  or Watsons   16...Bb6  The only remaining question is if White can develop enough play for the pawn to equalize. A comfortable spot to be in with Black !  13...Kf8  14.Qh8+  Ke7  White soon runs out of checks and loses material:  15.Qxd8+   15.Qxg7+ ??  Rf7+  -+   15.Qh4+  Kd7  16.Qxd8+  Kxd8  transposes to 15.

In the following game White, a very solid FIDE master from Germany, experienced a quick catastrophe:   11.h3 ?!  Protecting the g4-square, but this is very slow and the h3-pawn can also become a target later this is very slow and the h3-pawn can also become a target later.  Bd6  12.Qe2  e5  →  13.c3  Qe8  14.Bc2  Bd7  15.a4  Rc8  16.Bb3  Kh8  Black has ideas of playing ...e5-e4, ...Qe5, or simply ...Qg6   xh3  . Blacks attack is probably already decisive.  17.Be3 ?  d4  18.Qd3  Of course   18.cxd4  exd4  loses a piece  but   18.Bg5  Qg6  is just as hopeless, for example,  19.Bxf6  d3 !  20.Qe3  Rxf6  21.Nd2  Bc5  this is the point of 19... d3  22.Qe4  Qg3  -+  18...dxe3  19.Qxd6  Ne4  -+  Proehl-Palm, Muenster 1993.  Here is a more recent example illustrating Blacks great attacking potential in this line, again with an experienced FM on the white side:   11.Bg5  Bd6  12.Qd4  Qc7  13.Qh4  h6  14.Bxf6  Rxf6  15.Nd2  e5  16.c4  Rf4  17.Qh5  Bg4  18.Qg6  e4  19.g3  Bf5  20.Qh5  g6  21.Qd1  exd3  22.gxf4  Bxf4  -+  Is it possible to have more compensation for a mere exchange ?  23.cxd5  Rf8 !  Black calmly brings his last piece into the attack.  24.Kg2  Qd7  25.f3  Bh3+  26.Kf2  Qd8 !  The final touch. Death is coming on the dark squares.  27.Ne4  Qb6+  28.Ke1  Qe3+  0-1 Zambor-Krak, Slovakia 2015. }
11... a6
{ However, there was also nothing wrong with the immediate   11...Bd6  aiming for a quick ...e6-e5. Then,  12.Qg5  e5  interestingly transposes to 10. Bb5+ Kf7 11. O-O Rf8 12. Nc3 Kg8 13. Bd3 Bd6 14. Qg5 e5, which is in Blacks favor. }

However,  Bd7  still looks promising for Black.  7...Nb4 !  Forcing White to give up the right to castle.  8.Kd1  c4 !  ∓  Another excellent move. It not only restricts Whites pieces  (the f1-bishop in particular)  , but White now has to watch for an attack against the c2-point.  9.a3   9.c3  The direct  Qa4+ ?!  is not so clear and leads to messy positions:  Stronger is Watsons   9...Nc6  10.Be2  b5  11.Ke1  b4  12.Nb1  Be7  ∓  intending ... O-O and ...f6 in combination with ...Rb8. White is really suffering here, with attacks coming from both sides of the board.  10.b3  cxb3  11.Nxb3  Nxa2  12.Kc2  Bd7  13.Nfd2  Rc8  14.Bb2  Bb4  15.Kb1  Bxc3  16.Rxa2  Bxd2  Now in the Megabase, the score of the game Nei-Gleizerov, Osterskars 1995, ends with the result 0-1. I doubt that the Estonian International Master resigned here, at least it would be a strange moment to do so because he has just survived the worst !:  17.Qg3 !  The straightforward   17.Rxa4  Bxf4  18.Rxa7  is also playable, though slightly better for Black.  17...Bf4 !  18.Qxg7 !  Rg8  19.Rxa4  Rxg7  20.Rxa7  Ng4  f2 falls, but White has enough resources, for example,  21.Be2  Nxf2  22.Rf1  Be3   22...Rxg2  23.Bf3  Rxh2  24.Rh1  with counterplay.  23.g3  Bc6  24.Bc1  Bxc1  25.Kxc1  and White should have sufficient compensation for the pawn to hold his own.  9...Bd7  10.b3   10.Ne1  Nc6  This retreat is not forced, but it is fine as the knight has done a good job on b4 by forcing the move Kd1.  11.c3  was Kappler-Schmidt, Belgium 1995, when Black should have played the simple  Be7  intending to open the position quickly with ...f7-f6. White is way behind in development and has lost the right to castle. His position is a positional disaster.  10...Rc8 !  Bringing more forces into the attack.  11.Bb2  Nxc2  12.Kxc2  c3  13.Kb1 ??  White cracks under the pressure.  The only way to continue the game was   13.Nb1  cxb2+  14.Kxb2  hen the c3-square is protected so that Blacks attack does not decide immediately. Still, after  Be7  15.Bd3  O-O  with the idea of .. .f7-f6 Black is clearly better with the bishop-pair and safer king.  13...cxb2  0-1 Pusch-Kern, Recklinghausen 2000.   5.c3  has the drawback that, after  cxd4  White is more or less forced to play a dubious gambit with  6.Nf3  If instead White plays the slow   6.Qxd4  here, it is already clear that his opening concept has failed.  Nc6  7.Qf4  Nge7  8.Bd3  Ng6  9.Bxg6  hxg6  10.Nf3  This position occurred in the stem game of 4... Qa5+, Rabinovich-Botvinnik, USSR 1937. Now the future Soviet world champion played  Qa6  which prevents castling and is a strong move.  I also like directly attacking Whites center with   10...Qc7 !  11.O-O  f6  when  12.Qg3  Nxe5  13.Nxe5  Qxe5  14.Qxg6+  Ke7  would win the center and intend ...Qh5, Watson.  6...Nc6 !  After the immediate   6...dxc3  7.Nxc3  Qb4 ?!  8.Qg3  =∞  Black has experienced some difficulties in praxis.  7.Bd3  dxc3  8.Nxc3  is now well met by  After   8.bxc3  Black has several options. The bad news is that the position remains very complicated no matter what Black plays, for example,  d4  But the good news is that   8...b6 !  which activates the light-square bishop and is another good suggestion by Watson.  9.O-O  Ba6  Watson stops his analysis here. As the position is very sharp after  10.c4 !  I decided to look a little bit deeper:  Nge7  Not the computers first choice, but a very human and good developing move.  A major alternative is   10...Rd8  with the idea that after  11.Bd2  Qc5  12.Be3  d4  White cannot take on d4.  11.Bd2  Qc5  and now:  12.Rc1   12.Be3  d4  13.Nxd4  Nxe5  14.Qg3  Nxd3  15.Nxe6  Qxc4  16.Nc7+  Kd7  17.Nxa8  Nd5  Whites a8-knight will be lost, which means that Black will soon have a material advantage of two pieces against a rook. Still, Black has to worry about his king, but with exact play he comes out of the complications with a clear advantage. Here are a few sample lines:  18.Nd2   18.Qb8 ?  Qc6  19.Qxa7+  Bb7  20.Rd1  Bc5  21.Rxd3  Rxa8  -+  18...Qc6  19.Nf3  Qxa8  20.Qg4+  Kd8  21.Rfd1  Nxe3  22.fxe3  Qd5  and now one beautiful line goes:  23.Qa4  Bb5  24.Qxa7  Bc5 !  25.Rxd3  Bxd3  26.Qb8+  Kd7  27.Qxh8  Be2 !  28.Qxh7  Bxe3+  29.Kh1  Qxf3 !  ∓  That was the nasty idea behind 27... Be2. Of course, the queen cannot be taken because of mate, which means that White is suffering with a rook against two bishops.  12...dxc4  13.Bxc4  Bxc4  14.Rxc4  or   14.Qxc4  Qxc4  15.Rxc4  Rc8  16.Nc3  Nd5  17.Nxd5  exd5  =+  and White will have to fight hard for a draw in this endgame.  14...Nxe5  15.Nxe5  Qxe5  16.Nc3  White has compensation for one pawn, but unfortunately he is down two. After  Rd8 !  17.Re1  Qf5  18.Qd1  with the idea of Qa4+  b5 !  19.Rc7  Ng6  20.Ne4  Be7  21.Rxa7  O-O  ∓  Black has consolidated, keeping one extra pawn.  9.O-O  dxc3  10.Na3  was quite messy and White had good practical chances for the sacrificed pawns in Jimenez Villena-Shabalov, Linares 2000.  8...f5 !  9.Qf4  Nge7  10.O-O  Ng6  11.Qg3  Be7  and it is hard to see Whites compensation for the pawn  (Watson)  . }
5... Qb6
{ Now, in Play the French 4, Watson favors the rarely played   5...Nh6 !?  giving the following lines:  6.Qxe6+   6.Qg3  Qb6  7.Qb3  Nc6  8.Nf3  cxd4  9.Qxb6  axb6  =+   6.Bxa5  Nxg4  7.h3  Nh6  8.Nf3  Nc6  9.Bc3  Nf5  =+  6...fxe6  7.Bxa5  Bd7  or   7...Nf5  8.dxc5  Nc6  9.Bc3  Bxc5  10.Nf3  O-O  8.Nf3  Nc6  9.Bc3  Rc8  =+  concluding that these lines are close to equal, but Black has slightly better chances. Indeed, Blacks position is more harmonious in these endgame positions. White has some problems with his center and his darksquare bishop is a little misplaced on c3. 5... Nh6 looks easier to play for Black and is certainly worth a try ! }
6. b3
{ This move is played most often, but defending b2 like this is rather slow and also weakens the dark squares. The dynamic   6.Nc3 !  is critical.  Nh6  and now:  7.Qh3 ?  (Wanzek-Willsch, Germany 2000)   7.Bb5+ ?  does not work, because after  Qxb5  8.Nxb5  Nxg4  9.Nc7+  Kd7  10.Nxa8  cxd4  11.Nf3  Nc6  (Watson)  , White will lose his a8-knight and the e5-pawn is weak as well. Black ends up with two pieces for the rook and a winning position.   7.Bxh6 ??  Qxb2  -+   7.Qg5 ?  cxd4  8.Nb5  Nf5  9.g4  Be7  10.Qh5  a6  11.gxf5  axb5  12.fxe6  Bxe6  ∓  and White had no compensation for the lost pawn in Vega GutierrezGalvan Sarmiento, Gran Canaria 2012. Yes, Black has two doubled pawns, but they also control a lot of important squares  (especially the d-pawns)  .   7.dxc5 !  is the attempt to keep things unclear.  Nxg4  The solid choice, which leads to an equal endgame.  Grabbing a pawn with   7...Qxb2 !?  is more ambitious and might objectively be in Blacks favor. However, the position after  8.Qd1  looks quite messy and should be analyzed carefully before going for this.  8.cxb6  Bc5  9.f4  Bf2+  10.Ke2  Bxb6  White played  11.Na4 ?  in Wanzek-Gottuk, Germany 2002, when Black could have simply won a pawn with  John Watson improves Whites play with   11.h3  Nf2  Black can also play the simpler   11...Nh2  12.Rxh2  Bxg1  13.Rh1  Bb6 =  12.Rh2  with approximate equality. This judgment is correct; I would like to analyze the position a little further as Black has to look out for his knight on f2. Play could continue  Bd7  (intending ...d5-d4, without running into Na4)  13.Be3  d4  14.Bxf2  dxc3  15.bxc3  Na6 !?  16.Bxb6  axb6  =∞  with positional compensation for the pawn. Black wants to move his knight to c5 and then continue with moves like ...Ke7, ...Ra3 etc.  11...Bxg1  12.Rxg1  Nxh2  Of course, the offside knight on h2 is not in danger, as it can simply take on f1 if necessary.  7...cxd4 !  8.Nxd5  Qc5  ∓  and after Whites knight retreats, Black wins an important center pawn on e5. }
6... cxd4 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. Bd3 Nb4
{ This is a very solid solution. Black gives back the d4-pawn, but gains the bishoppair. The resulting positions are slightly better for Black with little risk. It is very possible that one of the alternatives like 8... Nge7 or 8... f5 is objectively stronger, but the positions tend to be rather complicated after these moves, and the results have been mixed. After 8... Nb4 on the other hand, White has scored one measly point in five games. }
9. O-O Nxd3 10. cxd3 Ne7 11. Na3
{ 11.Qxd4  Qxd4  It is also possible to keep queens on the board with   11...Qa6 !?  intending to play ...Nf5  (or ...Nc6)  with tempo and keeping an eye on Whites d3-pawn. In the only practical example, White played poorly and Black soon reached a dominating position:  12.Rd1  Nf5  13.Qc3  Bd7  14.d4  Rc8  15.Qa5  Qxa5  16.Bxa5  Bb5  17.Ne1  b6  18.Bc3  a5  19.Nc2  Kd7  ∓  Black has the bishop pair and he puts serious pressure on the c-file, making it difficult for White to finish development. White did not manage to find a good reply, and after  20.f3  Be7  21.Kf2  Rc7  22.a4  Ba6  23.Ra2  Rhc8  -+  Black won decisive material in Stojanovic-Straub, Budva 2002.  12.Nxd4  Bd7  was comfortable for Black in Stojanovic-Maric, Budva 2003. }

{ threatening ...Rf6-h6 with mate.   Summary: In the French Advance, instead of maintaining a pawn on d4 by playing the standard 4. c3, Aron Nimzowitsch developed an alternative concept of focusing on bolstering the e5-pawn with pieces and at the same time looking for attacking chances on the kingside. Truly an instructive concept, but as we have seen in this chapter it does not really work out too well for White, regardless if he starts with 4. Nf3, 4. Qg4 or 4. dxc5. One problem for White is that, in reality, keeping control over the crucial e5-point can prove quite difficult, in particular in the line 4. dxc5 ?! Nc6 ! 5. Nf3 Bxc5 6. Bd3 f6 !  (game 49)  , but also in the variation 4. Nf3 cxd4 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. O-O Nge7 7. Bf4 Ng6 8. Bg3 f5  (game 48)  , where White is left with an unpleasant choice of either giving up his center with exf6 e.p., or accepting that his dark-square bishop will be locked out at least temporarily. Finally, after 4. Qg4, Botvinniks move 4... Qa5+ is quite annoying and difficult to meet for White, as was shown in game 50. }

{ Chapter 12 The King's Indian Attack and Chigorin's 2. Qe2  The Kings Indian Attack  (KIA)  after 1. e4 is quite popular, especially on the amateur level. A pragmatic advantage is that the development scheme d3, Nf3, g3, Bg2, O-O, Nbd2 can be deployed against most of Blacks replies to 1. e4. Thus, if you play the Kings Indian Attack, there is much less preparation work to be done compared with a player who learns systems against the French, CaroKann, Pirc, Sicilian, etc. Furthermore, in the structures that arise in the Kings Indian Attack, an understanding of typical motifs and plans tends to be more important than memorizing concrete lines. There are different ways for Black to meet the KIA. Quite frequently you see sharp positions with a closed center, in which White is attacking on the kingside and Black on the queenside. A typical example is the following popular variation: }
1. e4 e6 2. d3
{ 2.Qe2  The move 2. Qe2 is named after Mikhail Chigorin  (1850-1908)  , who played it a lot  (especially against Siegbert Tarrasch)  . It is closely related to the Kings Indian Attack in that after 2. Qe2, White also often ends up playing a set-up with g3, Bg2, Nf3, d3, Nbd2 etc. However, there are also some differences. In a way, Qe2 is more flexible than the KIA, as White retains the options to play f2-f4 before Nf3 or d2-d4 in one go instead of d2d3-d4. On the other hand, the queen is committed to e2, which is not always the optimal square in the resulting positions. I recommend playing  c5  intending to follow up with the moves ...Nc6, ...g6, ...Bg7, ...Nge7. This is in fact one of the main lines against 2. Qe2, which has served Black players well for many years. For detailed information see the games Liu-Ding  (Game 58)  and Morozevich-Dolmatov  (Game 59)  . }
2... d5
{ The next diagram shows the starting position of our setup. It can arise via different move-orders after 1. e4; the most typical move order for the French Defense is   2...c5  3.Nf3  b6  4.g3  Bb7  5.Bg2  d6  6.O-O  Nf6  For the sake of simplicity and clarity, all seven KIA games in this chapter start with these moves, which, however, in most cases may not correspond to the actual move order. In the diagram above, Black usually continues ...Be7 and ...O-O, and thus postpones the development of his queens knight, which depending on what White does will be best placed either on c6 or on d7. Now lets take a look at the different white plans. Since the center is not closed, Whites attempts to build up a kingside attack promise little chance of success. In the game Drygalov Lysyi  (game 51)  , White trotted out his standard opening moves without thinking:  7.Nbd2  Another attempt at an attack on the king sees White moving his knight away from f3 in order to continue with f2-f4. In such cases, Black should place his queens knight on c6, for example,   7.Nh4  Nc6 !  There are two reasons for this:  (a)  The most active position for the knight is on c6, from where it can support counterplay in the center and on the queenside.  b  The d7-square is left free for the other knight, should White later play g3-g4-g5. On the whole, the attack with f2-f4 is playable for White, but Black does not need to panic. He should have confidence in his defensive resources and usually aim for counterplay in the center and/or on the queenside. For detailed information see the game Czebe-Jovanovic  (game 52)  .  A rarely played idea for White is   7.Re1  Be7  8.Nc3  attempting to transpose to a hedgehog formation. After  O-O  9.d4  Black took on d4 with a somewhat level form of hedgehog in Josefsson-Behling  (game 56)  .  Another possibility for White is   7.b3  Be7  8.Bb2  O-O  Now  9.Nbd2  More interesting is   9.c4 !?  in order to continue with Nc3 and soon transpose into a hedgehog formation with d3-d4. By a transposition of moves, you end up in a more or less level sub-variation of the English Opening; see Bologan-Laznicka  (game 57)  .  9...Nc6  is comfortable for Black, as he plans to continue with ...Nd7 and ...Bf6, thus neutralizing Whites dark-square bishop.  7...Be7  8.Re1  We now come to some seldom played lines for White. One method which I sometimes meet in online blitz games is   8.a4  O-O  9.Nc4  White has placed his knight on c4, but he can hardly maintain it there; after  a6  there is already the likelihood of ...b7-b5. So White often continues with  10.e5  but after  dxe5  11.Nfxe5  Bxg2  12.Kxg2  Nd5  or   12...Qd5+  Black has a good game. For more information on this, see Maki-Veingold  (game 55)  .  8...O-O  9.Nf1  The main line against Blacks setup is a method which does not concentrate on kingside play, but rather on play in the center or, when appropriate, on the queenside:   9.c3  White is now ready for d3-d4; his other plan in this position is to proceed on the queenside with a2-a3, b2-b4. Black has to decide on a square for his queens knight and  Nbd7  makes the most subtle impression as, in contrast to 9... Nc6, this does not block the a8-h1 diagonal as well as the c-file. Then, in the event of  However, it has to be said that upon closer inspection,   9...Nc6  looks just as good, because in case of  10.d4  cxd4  11.cxd4  Black has the concrete  Nb4 !  which is analyzed in Suba-Kovacevic  (game 54)  .  10.d4  cxd4  11.cxd4  Qc7  Black gets nice counterplay down the c-file, as in our game to 9... Nbd7, Becker-Langrock  (game 53)  .  9...Nc6  10.h4  Qc7  11.N1h2  but it did not have the desired effect and Black quickly gained the upper hand with refined play. }

Nf1 a5 11. h4
{ Black will try to open the position on the queenside, while White has different ideas to build up his kingside play, e.g., by bringing his knights into the action with Nf1-h2-g4 and/or Ng5. Many players do not like to see their king under attack and thus do not feel that comfortable participating in this kind of race. Therefore, I would like to recommend a very solid, but comparatively rare set-up for Black. This set-up has the advantage of avoiding the kind of sharp play that I just described. }

{ Chapter 12 The King's Indian Attack and Chigorin's 2. Qe2  The Kings Indian Attack  (KIA)  after 1. e4 is quite popular, especially on the amateur level. A pragmatic advantage is that the development scheme d3, Nf3, g3, Bg2, O-O, Nbd2 can be deployed against most of Blacks replies to 1. e4. Thus, if you play the Kings Indian Attack, there is much less preparation work to be done compared with a player who learns systems against the French, CaroKann, Pirc, Sicilian, etc. Furthermore, in the structures that arise in the Kings Indian Attack, an understanding of typical motifs and plans tends to be more important than memorizing concrete lines. There are different ways for Black to meet the KIA. Quite frequently you see sharp positions with a closed center, in which White is attacking on the kingside and Black on the queenside. }

7. Nh4 Nc6
{ There are two reasons for this:  (a)  The most active position for the knight is on c6, from where it can support counterplay in the center and on the queenside.  b  The d7-square is left free for the other knight, should White later play g3-g4-g5. On the whole, the attack with f2-f4 is playable for White, but Black does not need to panic. He should have confidence in his defensive resources and usually aim for counterplay in the center and/or on the queenside. For detailed information see the game Czebe-Jovanovic  (game 52)  . }

{ As Whites last move indicates playing on the kingside, moving the knight to c6 makes perfect sense and I now even prefer it slightly.  In the first edition of this book the focus was on   9...Nbd7  which is also fine:  10.h4  White plays his standard moves automatically, not realizing that he will not get much of an attack with the center pawn structure not defined like in Kings Indian Attack main lines where White has played e2-e4-e5, Black ...d7-d5.   10.h3  with the idea g3-g4, can again be met with:  c4  as once played by the famous Polish-American open specialist Aleksander Wojtkiewicz:  Another good option is   10...b5  11.g4  Re8  12.Ng3  Nf8  13.Nh2  e5  14.g5  N6d7  15.h4  Ne6  16.Nf5  Ndf8  17.Ng4  Ng6  18.Kh2  Ngf4  =+  Blacks control over the f-file gives him the edge and after  19.Bf3  the grandmaster from Argentina played the instructive  f6 !  It might have come as a surprise for White that Black is opening the kingside himself !  20.Nxe7+  Rxe7  21.gxf6  Rf7  22.Rg1  Kh8  Obviously it is Black who is attacking here. The direct threat is to get at the h4-pawn after 23... h5 24. Ne3 Qxf6. White has a tough task and he does not manage to put up much resistance:  23.Bxf4  Nxf4  24.Rg3  h5  25.Ne3  Qxf6  26.Rg5  g6  27.Ng2  Ne6  28.Rg3  Nd4  29.Ne1  Qxh4+  30.Kg1  Raf8  -+  Marrero Lopez-Flores, Santos 2012.  11.Nd4  cxd3  12.cxd3  Now Black choose a solid hedgehog-like approach with  Re8  13.b3  Rc8  while I also like   13...e5 !?  14.Nf5  Bf8  with equal chances.  14.Bb2  Bf8  15.Ne3  g6  and went on to win a long game in Zaichik-Wojtkiewicz, Philadelphia 1995  10...c4 !?  As White has shown ambitions to attack on the kingside, it certainly makes sense to open the position in another part of the board. Chances are roughly equal. This position was discussed in some detail in the first edition; the most recent example continued:  Black is also doing fine with less direct approaches, for example   10...Qc7  11.Ne3  b5  12.g4  (Dominguez Matito-Spraggett, Seville 1993)  Nb6  with a good position.  11.Bg5  cxd3  12.cxd3  h6  Black could also ignore the bishop and immediately focus on the queenside with   12...Rc8  or   12...a5 !?  intending ...Nc5.  13.Bd2  Nc5  14.Bc3  Ba6  The pressure on d3 forces White to give up his bishop-pair.  15.Bxf6  Bxf6  16.d4  (Halvax-Kessler, Feistritz an der Drau 2014)  Nd7  and Whites advantage in space compensates Blacks two bishops. }

White was already slightly worse, but giving a Black knight access to the f4-square is suicidal.  Nd5  16.dxc4  Ndf4  ∓  17.Qd4  Nxg2  18.Qxb6  axb6  19.Kxg2  dxe5  20.N1d2  Rad8  21.Kg1  bxc4  with a winning advantage for Black in Stocko-R.Markus, Bosnjaci 2011. }

{ In this game, we will look at lines in which White moves his knight away from f3, following up with f2-f4 and initiating a kingside attack. In these variations, Black should develop his queens knight to c6 for two reasons:  (1)  It is the most active square for the knight to support fast counterplay on the queenside or in the center; and  (2)  The other knight can retreat to d7 after a possible g3-g4-g5 by White. }
7. Nh4
{ Not only preparing f2-f4, but also setting a trap if Black goes for the natural ...Be7.  For   7.Nc3  Be7  For  8.Nh4   8.Ng5  Nc6  9.f4  O-O  10.f5  exf5  This is a case where opening the f-file typically is much more safe for the defender than closing the center with ...e6-e5, when Whites kingside pawns could soon be rolling dangerously.  11.Rxf5  h6   11...Nd4  12.Rf2  Qd7  13.Bh3  This prevents ...Ng4, but after  Qd8  intending ... Bc8, White has hardly anything better than to repeat.  14.Bg2  Qd7 =  Rerouting the bishop with   11...Bc8  12.Rf1  Bg4  is another playable option.  12.Nh3  Nd4  13.Rf2  b5 ?  as played in Romanishin-Browne, Mexico 1985, allows the piece sacrifice  14.e5 !  Surely both grandmasters had seen this, but did not realize how strong it is.  Bxg2  15.exf6  Bxh3  16.fxg7 !  Kxg7  No better is   16...Re8  17.Qh5  attacking h3 and h6.  17.Qh5  Bg5  A sad necessity; giving up the h6-pawn would be even worse.  18.Qxh3  ±  White has won back the piece and Blacks king remains weak.   8.Ne1  Nc6  9.f4  a6   9...Qc7  10.Bd2  a6  11.Ne2  h5  12.h3  O-O-O  I am not a big fan of plans involving castling queenside in these positions. In most cases Black should just castle short and trust his defensive resources as well as his counter-chances on the queenside and in the center.  13.Nf3  Nh7  14.c3  Rhg8  15.Ng5  Bxg5  16.fxg5  Qe7  17.h4  f6  18.g6  Nf8  19.Nf4  Rh8  20.d4  Kb8  21.b4  cxd4  22.cxd4  →  Lazic-Klinger, Belgrade 1988  10.Nf3  O-O  11.h3  d5 !?  12.e5  Nd7  13.Ne2  b5  14.d4  cxd4  15.Nexd4  Nxd4  16.Nxd4  We have reached a structure typical for the Classical French   3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5  Nfd7  5.f4  c5  , etc.  . But this is a good version for Black, who does not have anything to fear on the kingside, and can slowly build up his own play on the queenside.  Qb6  17.Kh2  b4  18.Be3  Bc5  19.Bg1  Rac8  20.Qd2  a5  21.Rfe1  Rfe8  A typical precaution against f4-f5 ideas.  22.Rac1  h6  23.h4  Nb8  24.c3  Nc6  25.Rb1  Ba6  =+  Aguero Jimenez-Papin, Guarenas 2012.  8...Nc6  9.f4  see 7.

Nc3.   7.Nbd2  Be7  8.Ne1  Nc6 !  9.f4  O-O  10.g4  d5  Black is by no means planning to close the center; his intention is to open the position with ... f7-f6 very soon:  11.e5   11.g5  Ne8  12.e5  f6 !  13.exf6  gxf6  14.Ndf3  Ng7  was better for Black, but the players agreed to a draw in TorreAdamski, Polanica Zdroj 1977  11...Ne8  12.Ndf3  Qd7  13.Bh3  f6  14.exf6  gxf6  15.Ng2  Ng7  16.Nfh4  Rae8  =+  Black has nice, mobile center pawns. Mestel manages to push them along in an impressive way:  17.f5  e5  18.Qd2  c4  19.dxc4  Bc5+  20.Kh1  d4  21.Qh6  Nd8  22.Qd2  e4  23.b4  e3  24.Qe1  e2  25.Rg1  Bd6  26.g5  Qe7  27.c5  bxc5  28.bxc5  Bxc5  29.gxf6  Qxf6  -+  In this position from ChristiansenMestel, Tjentiste 1975, White was totally lost despite material equality. Whites knights are pitiable, while his queen is left with the poor role of blockading Blacks e-pawn. The immediate threat is ...d4-d3, attacking both white rooks. }
7... Nc6
{ 7...Be7 ?  is a typical mistake, which allows the tactical  8.e5 !  Bxg2  After   8...Nd5  9.c4  g5  10.cxd5  gxh4  11.dxe6  Bxg2  12.exf7+  Kd7  13.Kxg2  dxe5  14.Nc3  +-  Blacks position was a disaster in Carlier-Magnusson, Gausdal 1990  9.exf6  Bxf1  10.fxe7  Qxe7  11.Qxf1  White has a solid advantage with B+N vs. R+P. The game Kulhanek-Tesar, Czechia 2013 continued  Nd7  12.Nc3  O-O  13.Bd2  a6  14.Re1  Nf6  15.Bg5 !  Qc7  16.Bxf6  gxf6  17.Qh3  f5  18.Nxf5  exf5  19.Nd5  Qd8  20.Qh6  f6  21.Re7  1-0   7...Nbd7 ?!  This development of the queens knight is too passive. Furthermore, the other knight might need the d7-square to retreat after a possible g3-g4-g5 by White. After  8.f4  White has scored excellently in practice.   7...Qc7  followed by ...Be7 and ...Nc6 is certainly playable and has been doing fine in praxis. However, it is not clear that c7 will be the best square for the queen, while 7... Nc6 definitely moves the knight to its best square. Anyway, here is one practical example after after 7... Qc7:  8.f4  Be7  9.Nd2  Nc6  10.Re1  Nd7  11.Nhf3  O-O  12.Nf1  Nd4  13.c3  Nxf3+  14.Qxf3  b5  15.Qf2  a5  16.g4  Rfe8  17.g5  d5  18.Ne3 ?  A significant positional blunder, after which White suddenly has a problem on the d3-square.  Preferable was   18.exd5  Bxd5  19.Bxd5  exd5  20.Bd2 =  18...dxe4  19.dxe4  c4  20.Ng4  Nc5  ∓  Thaler-Sedlak, Philadelphia 2010. }
8. f4 Be7 9. h3
{ This move is rather slow and also has a weakening effect, which will be brilliantly exploited later in the game. Given the dynamic nature of the position it is no surprise that White has played all kinds of moves here. Some examples are:   9.f5  White wants to exchange on e6, and then put pressure on the e6-point with the move Bh3. However, this plan does not harmonize well with the knights placement on h4 White would need his knight ready to jump to g5 for this plan to be challenging.  O-O  10.Nc3  Qd7  11.fxe6  fxe6  12.Bh3  Now in Nalbandian-Baramidze, Dortmund 2009, Black played  Rac8 ?!  which is a bit mysterious; what exactly is the rook doing on c8 ?  Instead   12...d5  looks good:  13.e5   13.exd5  Nxd5  rather favors Black, although after  14.Nf3  Nd4  15.Nxd4  cxd4  16.Ne4  his centralized knight still gives White's position decent stability.  13...Ne8  After   13...Nxe5  14.Qe2  White wins back the pawn  Nf7  15.Qxe6 =  14.Rxf8+  Bxf8  15.Qg4  Nc7  16.Nf3  and now  g6  intending to develop the bishop to g7, gives Black a nice game.   9.c3  O-O  10.Qe2  b5  11.Nf3  b4  ⇆  Sepp-Smirnov, Tallinn 2000.   9.Nc3  Nd7   9...O-O  as played in Seeman-Dautov, Poland 1998, is also fine  and now:  After  10.Nf3   10.Be3  (Weindl-Bozinovic, Biel 2004)  Bxh4 !?  Black takes the opportunity to shatter his opponents pawn structure.   10...O-O=  11.gxh4  and now, not 11... Qxh4 ? 12. Nb5, attacking d6 and c7, but simply  O-O  with a good position, for example  12.h5   12.Qe1  Nf6  with the idea of ...d6-d5  13.h5  h6  14.Rf3  Qe7  15.Rg3  Kh7  and it is difficult for White to build up his attack.  10...a6  11.Re1  O-O  12.Be3  the players agreed a draw in a balanced position in Lazic-Markus, Neum 2004.   9.c4  is okay, although it has the drawback of weakening the d4-square. A recent example went:  O-O  10.Nc3  a6  11.f5  Nd7  12.fxe6  fxe6  13.Rxf8+  Nxf8  14.Nf3  Bf6  15.Be3  Ng6  16.Qd2  Nge5  17.Nxe5  and now the creative  dxe5 =  was fine for Black in Yandemirov-Rodchenkov, Kazan rapid 2016.  but after the 'normal'   17...Nxe5 !  Black is simply a bit better with the hole on d4 and the idea to gain space on the queenside with ...b5. }

{ Castling queenside is usually not best in this line, but the Serbian IM realizes that this case is different. White has moved all his pawns on the kingside, which means that Black has great attacking prospects at this wing. }

{ The question mark almost feels unfair, especially as Blacks position remains clearly better. And seeing that   17...Nxg3 !!  is a decisive blow required some masterly calculation.  18.Kxg3  Bd6 !  Increasing the pressure on f4.  19.e5  What else ? But this opens the long diagonal.  gxf4+  20.Bxf4  Rhg8+  21.Kh2  Rxg2+ !  The key of the whole combination. Without the light-square bishop, Whites position quickly falls apart.  22.Qxg2  or   22.Kxg2  Nxe5+  e.g.  23.Kh2  Ng6  22...Bxe5  23.Qf2  Bxf4+  24.Qxf4  Rxd2+  25.Kg3  Rd3+  26.Rf3  Rd6  -+  No queen exchange !

{ In a game between two Russian super grandmasters White combined c2-c3 with Qe2:   8.c3  Nbd7  Tomashevsky delays castling for a few moves.

{ This is the main line against the black set-up. Realizing that the usual kingside play does not promise him much, White intends to get active in the center   d3d4  or on the queenside  (by means of a2-a3, b2-b4)  . }
9... Nbd7
{ This move is more subtle than   9...Nc6  as it does not block the a8-h1 diagonal as well as the c-file. Now White has tried no less than ten moves, of which the most popular are  10.d4   10.a3  and   10.a4 }
10. d4

Black has achieved excellent results with this move, which leads to a change of pawn structure that makes the position more clear-cut.

Blacks pawn structure is healthier, as Whites d3-pawn is weak; therefore it should not surprise us that it is usually White who tries to develop active play. Depending on the circumstances, he can play on the kingside  (f2-f4)  , on the queenside  (b2-b4)  or in the center  (d3-d4)  . However, Black is very solid and he has done well in praxis.  Nd7  13.a4  After   13.b4  Qc7  14.Be3  Black should prevent b4-b5 with  a6 =  13...Bc6  Most logical is   13...a6  directly preparing ...b5.  14.Qh5  b5  15.Ne3   15.Nxe5 ??  g6  loses a piece.  15...g6 =  P.Nielsen-U.Nielsen, Aarhus 1990.  14.f4  exf4  15.gxf4  Whites pawn structure is very loose.

Prophylactic, because a4-a5 can now always be answered by ...b6-b5 without running into a possible a5-a6 by White. Active, because it prepares the advance ...b6-b5, which is one of Blacks main ideas in these positions. Chances are level, for instance:  11.d4   11.Qb3  Rc8  or   11...Qc7  12.Nc4  Bc6  13.Bf4  b5  with a comfortable game for Black in Domont-Desancic, Switzerland 1997.  12.Nc4  d5  13.exd5  Bxd5  14.Qc2  b5  15.axb5  axb5  16.Ne3  Bc6  Blacks pawn-structure is somewhat healthier and he stood quite well in Hulak-Andersson, Zagreb 1975.

White develops his bishop to b2 and only then decides which kind of structure to go for.  Qc7  or   10...b5  immediately:  11.Bb2  Qb6  12.a3  Rfc8 =  Jones-Navara, Aix-les-Bains 2011  11.Bb2  b5  12.c4  a6  13.Rc1  Rfd8  14.Qc2  Rac8  15.Qb1  Qb8  16.Qa1  Ne8  Black carries out a typical maneuver to neutralize Whites dark-square bishop.  17.Re2  Bf6  The exchange of bishops is favorable for Black who controls more dark squares. He was doing well in Pirisi-Stein, Budapest 1989.  One of my opponents played   10.Qc2  but the queen does not seem to belong on c2.  b5  11.d4  Qc7   11...cxd4  12.Nxd4  The generally more desirable   12.cxd4  runs into  Rc8  with tempo.

This move has multiple ideas; sometimes Black can double on the c-file or he can move one rook to the a-file  (after ...a5-a4, bxa4)  , keeping the other one on the c-file.

9... a6
{ Black is playing a waiting game regarding the development of his queens knight.  In the first edition I had recommended the move-order   9...Nbd7  but after taking a second look and understanding some subtleties of this line, I am not so sure if this is optimal in case White does not transpose into a Hedgehog. In particular, the variation, which might be somewhat unpleasant to meet, is  10.Nc3  a6  11.Ne1 !?  White prepares f2-f4, while the knight can go to c2. Generally, against that Ne1-plan Black would be happier playing ...Nc6 and then potentially ...Nd7, ...Bf6. Instead of 11. Ne1:   11.Re1  Qc7  transposes to 9... a6 10. Nc3 Qc7 11. Re1 Nbd7.   11.Qe2  Qc7  12.d4   12.Nd2  is well met by the maneuver  Ne5 !  13.f4  Nc6  14.Nf3  Nd7  15.Kh1  Bf6  16.Qd2  Nd4  17.Nxd4  Bxd4  18.Rae1  Bc6  with the idea ...b6-b5 and the more active position for Black in McNab-Adams, London 1989  12...cxd4  13.Nxd4  Rfe8  ⇆  Here are two examples from the master praxis in the 1980s:  14.Rae1   14.Rac1  Bf8  15.Rfe1  g6  16.Rc2  Rac8  17.Qd1  Qb8  18.Rce2  Bg7  19.Nc2  Rcd8  20.Ba1  Ba8  21.Rd2  Bf8  22.a4  Bb7  23.Ne3  Rc8  24.Qb1  Red8  25.f4  Qa8  26.Rde2  Bg7  27.Nf1  Qb8  28.Nd2  Qc7  29.f5 ?  It would have been better to keep sitting still.  Ne5  30.fxe6  and just in time, the favorite playing White made a draw offer, which was accepted in Miles-Langeweg, Holland 1981. The position after  fxe6  is already quite unpleasant for White, who has no active ideas, while Blacks wonderful centralized knight secures a sound positional advantage. With  31.Nf3  White can exchange it, but Black could simply send the next knight to e5 with  Nxf3+  32.Bxf3  Nd7  14...Bf8  15.Qd1  Rad8  16.Re2  g6  17.Qa1  Qb8  18.Rd1  Ba8  19.h3  Bg7  ⇆  Smejkal-Pritchett, Bundesliga 1987  An option worth considering is   9...Nc6  Now the b7-bishop does not attack e4 anymore. Also the knight on c6 does not fit in well with a possible hedgehog. However, Black can steer the game into almost untrodden and non-Hedgehog paths by answering  10.Nc3   intending  10...a6  11.d4  with  If instead White prepares d3-d4 with   10.Re1  e5 !?  looks interesting  (Whites rook would rather be back on f1 now)  .  11.Nc3  Re8  12.Bh3  Bc8  13.Bxc8  Qxc8  14.Kg2  Nd4  was equal in Zaim-Florea, Romania 2014.  10...Nd4 !?  Two games have continued  11.Nxd4  cxd4  12.Ne2  e5  which is fine for Black. Here ...a6, ... b5, intending ...bxc4 is a good plan. Most likely White will recapture with the b-pawn, which would give Black a square on c5 for the knight and potential play on the open b-file. }

21... d5
{ This is an excellent example of the hedgehogs counter-attacking potential. Astonishingly, White is now lost; Black threatens to win a piece directly with ...axb4, or ...e6-e5 followed by ...d5-d4. }
22. Ncxd5
{ One can only speculate what Bologan had overlooked. Maybe he had planned   22.cxd5  and saw too late that Black has  (e5 ! -+)  followed by ... axb4 after the queen moves back.  On   22.Na2  dxe4  White only loses a pawn, but his position is still hopeless with that awkward bishop on a3 and Blacks knight ready to jump to e5. }
22... exd5 23. cxd5 Qe5
{ Whites center pawns do not provide compensation for the lost piece. In fact, White cannot avoid losing more material as the pawns on e4 and b4 are weak. Bologan could as well have resigned here, but with much at stake at the World Cup, he decided to continue the hopeless fight. After 54 moves: 0-1 }

{ Against 2. Qe2, I am recommending a very common approach for Black including the moves ...c5, ...Nc6, ...g6, ... Bg7 and ...Nge7. This is one of the main lines against the regular Kings Indian Attack as well, but here White has already committed to the move Qe2, which is not always optimal and makes life easier for Black.  In the first edition the queenside fianchetto   3...b6  was covered, which is playable and more in the spirit of my recommendation against the KIA. However, after taking a fresh look at the variation it seems unnecessarily risky to give White the chance to reach a hedgehog by playing d2-d4 in one go, e.g.  4.g3  Bb7  5.Bg2  d6  6.d4  cxd4  7.Nxd4  These lines can become quite tricky, and I found the new, more standard recommendation to be more in the general solid spirit of this book. }

{ 4.c3  is well met by  d5  5.d3   5.exd5  Qxd5  We have basically transposed to a c3-Sicilian, in which White has played the odd move Qe2 which he never does after for instance 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 d5 4. exd5 Qxd5, when 5. Qe2 ?! Nc6 would reach the diagram ! Still, via our French move-order this line has been tried by grandmasters, even repeatedly by Russian GM Vadim Zvjaginsev.

{ Black wins back the pawn on d5 or f5, keeping his positional advantages. The endgame is close to winning; and despite long resistance by Morozevich the result after 59 moves was: 0-1 Summary In this chapter we have seen a very solid and harmonic set-up against the Kings Indian Attack, starting with the moves 2.. .c5 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O Nf6. In other systems against the KIA, where Black plays ...d5 and White replies with e4-e5, a kingside attack by White can be very dangerous. But against our set-up with the black pawn on d6, quick kingside aggressions by White have not proven to be promising. This was shown in the games 51 and 52. More critical is Whites attempt to play in the center or on the queenside, starting with 7. Nbd2 Be7 8. Re1 O-O 9. c3. Here, in my game against Becker I have preferred 9... Nbd7 in order to get play on the c-file after 10. d4 cxd4 11. cxd4 Qc7  (game 53)  , but the development with 9.. .Nc6 is just as good if combined with the concrete 11... Nb4 ! after 10. d4 cxd4 11. cxd4 as was investigated in game 54. Some less frequent lines have been covered in the games 55   7.Nbd2  Be7  8.Nc4  and 56   7.Re1  Be7  8.Nc3  O-O  9.d4  and we have seen that Black has no problems to equalize in these lines with normal play. The verdict equality also stands for the hedgehog positions that can arise after 7. b3 Be7 8. Bb2 O-O 9. c4 !? and a later d3-d4  (game 57)  . The double fianchetto is generally not the most critical way to fight the hedgehog, but there is a lot of play left with all the pieces on the board and Viktor Laznicka managed to get in a typical hedgehog break   21...d5 !  to beat his strong opponent. Finally, the Chigorin Variation   2.Qe2  was investigated. It has similarities to the Kings Indian Attack, but it can also be significantly different, for example if White decides to play f2-f4 before Nf3. My recommendation is to play one of the main lines: 2... c5 followed by ...Nc6 and a kingside fianchetto, where the fact that White has already committed to the move Qe2 generally makes life easier for Black. }

{ Black has fantastically active pieces, while Whites center pawns are weak and generally Whites forces lack harmony. All in all, Black has more than sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. 0-1  (29)  Summary In this chapter we have seen a very solid and harmonic set-up against the Kings Indian Attack, starting with the moves 2.. .c5 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O Nf6. In other systems against the KIA, where Black plays ...d5 and White replies with e4-e5, a kingside attack by White can be very dangerous. But against our set-up with the black pawn on d6, quick kingside aggressions by White have not proven to be promising. This was shown in the games 51 and 52. More critical is Whites attempt to play in the center or on the queenside, starting with 7. Nbd2 Be7 8. Re1 O-O 9. c3. Here, in my game against Becker I have preferred 9... Nbd7 in order to get play on the c-file after 10. d4 cxd4 11. cxd4 Qc7  (game 53)  , but the development with 9.. . Nc6 is just as good if combined with the concrete 11... Nb4 ! after 10. d4 cxd4 11. cxd4 as was investigated in game 54.   Some less frequent lines have been covered in the games 55 - 7. Nbd2 Be7 8. Nc4, and 56 - 7. Re1 Be7 8. Nc3 O-O 9. d4, and we have seen that Black has no problems to equalize in these lines with normal play. The verdict equality also stands for the hedgehog positions that can arise after 7. b3 Be7 8. Bb2 O-O 9. c4 !? and a later d3-d4  (game 57)  . The double fianchetto is generally not the most critical way to fight the hedgehog, but there is a lot of play left with all the pieces on the board and Viktor Laznicka managed to get in a typical hedgehog break   21...d5 !  to beat his strong opponent.   Finally, the Chigorin Variation   2.Qe2  was investigated. It has similarities to the Kings Indian Attack, but it can also be significantly different, for example if White decides to play f2-f4 before Nf3. My recommendation is to play one of the main lines: 2... c5 followed by ...Nc6 and a kingside fianchetto, where the fact that White has already committed to the move Qe2 generally makes life easier for Black. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. c4
{ The most ambitious interpretation of the French Exchange for White.   Although  4.Nf3  can also be played in an ambitious manner.  In most cases, Black will take on c4 later  (after the f1-bishop has moved)  , when White will play with an isolated queen's pawn. Latvian grandmaster Normunds Miezis is the expert in this line. According to the Megabase 2018 he has played it 238  (!)  times with White since 1990 and with good success. He usually reaches this position via the English opening after 1. c4 e6 2. e4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. d4, and such was the move order in this game. }

Instead,  Ne6 ?!  15.f4  f5  16.Qf3  Kh8  17.Rad1  =∞  gave White enough pressure for the pawn in Fernandes-Giaccio, Vila Nova de Gaia 2004.   11.a3  went wrong badly for White in a more recent game of Miezis:  Bd6  12.h3  Bxf3  13.Qxf3  Nfxd4  14.Qd5  Perhaps   14.Bxd4  Nxd4  15.Qxb7  was Miezis original intention. But it turns out that after  (Rb8 =+)   xb2  White cannot take on a7:  16.Qxa7 ?  Nf3+ !  17.gxf3  or   17.Kh1  Nd2  with a double attack on f1 and c4.  17...Qg5+  18.Kh1  Qf4  -+  14...Nc2  15.Bg5  Be7  16.Bxe7  Nxe7  17.Qxd8  Raxd8  18.Rac1  Nd4  19.Rfe1  Rfe8  20.Rcd1  (Miezis-Dokutchaev, Finland 2016)  (Kf8 ∓)  with an extra pawn in the endgame and good winning chances for Black. }
11... Qd7
{ Of course not   11...Bxf3 ??  12.Qxf5  +-  and the bishop is lost. } 12. Ng5
{ 12.Bd5  allows Black to simplify the position.  Bxf3  13.Bxf3  Ne5  14.Qe4  Nxf3+  15.Qxf3  c6  with a slight advantage for Black in a risk-free position as first seen in Dittmar-Luther, Seefeld 1996.  16.d5  gets rid of the isolated d-pawn, but a new weakness soon appears and after  Nxe3  17.fxe3  Bxc3  18.dxc6  bxc6  19.bxc3  Qe6  20.Rf2  Rad8  21.e4  Qc4  =+  Black was happy playing for two results in Miezis-Kjartansson, Panevezys 2015. }
12... Na5
{ I think this is the best way to fight for the advantage.   12...Bh5  allows  13.Nd5 }
13. Bb5
{ Now   13.Nd5  is ineffective because of  Nxc4  14.Qxc4  Be2 !  15.Qxe2  Qxd5  with a clear positional advantage for Black.   13.h3 ?!  forces a move, which Black likes to play anyway.  Bh5  14.Bd5  h6  15.Bf3  Bg6  16.Nge4  Nh4  =+  17.Qd1  After  Nc4 ?!   17...Rad8 !  ∓  prevents the relieving Nd5 and gives Black a clear advantage. He not only has the better pawn structure, he is also more active.  After  18.Nd5 ??  Nxf3+  19.Qxf3  Qxd5  20.Nf6+  gxf6  Blacks rook protects the queen on d5  18.Nd5 !  Miezis managed to equalize gradually:  Nxf3+  19.Qxf3  Bxe4  20.Qxe4  Rfe8  21.Qf3  Nd2  22.Bxd2  Bxd2  23.Rad1  Bg5  24.Nc3  c6  25.Ne4  Qd5  26.Nxg5  hxg5  27.Qxd5  cxd5 =  Miezis-Dittmar, Seefeld 2000. }
13... c6 14. Ba4 Bh5
{ The bishop was a little shaky on g4, so Black brings it to g6. } 15. a3
{ In a later game, Miezis improved with   15.Ne2  Bg6  16.Nf4  b5  17.Nxg6  hxg6  18.Bc2  but White is fighting for equality here as well.  After  Rad8  (Miezis-Rodgaard, Gausdal 2003)  , the game would have been roughly equal after   18...Nc4 !  looks stronger. The best of bad choices for White seems to be  19.Nf3 !  which steps out of some ...Nxe3/...Qe7 tactics. After  Rfe8  20.Bg5  I like the forcing   20.Bc1  Rad8  20...Nxb2 !  21.Qb3  Nxd4  22.Qxb4   22.Nxd4  Qxd4  23.Bxg6  Qc4  24.Qxb2  Re2  is also in Blacks favor.  22...Nxc2  23.Qxb2  Nxa1  24.Rxa1  c5  =+  Here, R+PP are stronger than B+N, as Black also has a 3-1 queenside majority and two open central files for his rooks.  19.Nf3  or   19.Rad1  intending to meet  Nc4  with  20.Bc1  Instead, Miezis played   19.a4 ?  when  Nc4 !  would have been very good for Black. White has no active play and always has to be careful not to lose material on e3 or b2. One sample line is  20.axb5  cxb5  21.b3 ?  Ncxe3  22.fxe3  Rc8 !  and White is in trouble, given the threats of 23... Rc3 and 23... Rxc2 24. Qxc2 Nxe3. }
15... Be7 16. b4 Nc4 17. Qxc4 Nxe3 18. fxe3 Bxg5
{ Whites center is weak and is easily attacked by Blacks forces. Black, with the bishop pair, is clearly better in this position. }
19. Qd3 Rfe8 20. Rae1 Rad8 21. d5 Re5 22. e4 Qe7 23. Bb3 Kh8 24. Rf2 f5
{ Whites center is close to collapsing... } 25. Ref1 fxe4
{ ...but now the game starts to dramatically turn around. Black releases the tension too early and gives away his advantage.  Friedrich missed a great chance to beat a grandmaster:   25...Bg6 !  and Whites position falls apart.  After  26.exf5  Other attempts are also more or less hopeless:   26.Qf3   with the idea of  26...fxe4 ??  27.Qf8+  Bf6  27.exf5  Rxf5  28.Qe2  Rxf2  29.Rxf2  Qc7 !  30.Qd2  Qe5  31.Rf3  cxd5  -+   26.Qd4   with the idea of  26...fxe4 ??  27.Qxe5  Bf6  27.Qxa7  fxe4  28.dxc6  bxc6  29.Qxe7  Rxe7  30.Ne2  Ra7 !  31.a4  Rb7  -+  26...Be3 !  Black wins decisive material as White cannot take on g6:  27.fxg6  Bxf2+  28.Rxf2   28.Kxf2  Rf8+  29.Kg1  Re1  -+  is the same.  28...Re1+  29.Rf1  Rf8  -+ }
26. Nxe4 Bh4 27. g3 Bg6
{ A fatal blunder, which loses on the spot.   27...cxd5  28.gxh4  Rxe4  29.Qxd5  White has mating tricks, but with a few exact moves, Black equalizes:  Rg4+  30.Kh1  g5  31.Rf8+  or   31.Qxd8+  Qxd8  32.Rf8+  Qxf8  33.Rxf8+  Kg7  34.Rb8  b6  ⇆  31...Rxf8  32.Rxf8+  Kg7  33.Rg8+  Kh6  34.hxg5+  Rxg5 = }
28. d6
{ This zwischenzug opens the way for Whites bishop. Perhaps Friedrich only considered 28. gxh4 Txe4, which is fine for Black. }
28... Qe8 29. Bf7 Bxf7 30. Rxf7 h6
{ The bishop had no square:   30...Bf6  31.Nxf6  Qxf7  or   31...gxf6  32.Qxh7#  32.Qxh7# }
31. gxh4 { 1-0 } *

As a rule of thumb, piece exchanges are not desirable for the player who has the IQP. Every exchange brings us closer to the endgame, where the weak pawn will be more of a factor.

The automatic reaction  19.b3  already loses decisive material:  c6 !  20.dxc6  bxc6  21.Qxc6  or   21.Qc5  Be7  22.Qe5  Re8  23.Qg3  Bb4  -+  21...Rc8  17...a3  18.b3  Bxf3  19.Bxf3  Bxd4  20.Rac1  Re8 =  13...Bf5  14.O-O  Qe7  15.Rac1   15.Rfc1  Rfd8  16.h3  was Sedina-Hoang, Riga 2017, and here I like the same idea as in the Lputian-game:  Qb4 !?  17.Qxb4  axb4  18.Nb5  Nxd5  19.Nxc7  Nf4  with obvious compensation for the sacrificed pawn.  15...Qb4  16.Qxb4  axb4  17.Nb5  Nxd5  18.Nxc7  Nf4  19.Bb5  In the first practical example of the move 12... a5, Black went wrong with  Rad8  Instead,   19...Rac8 !  would have been at least equal, for example,  20.Rfe1  (preventing ...Be4)  Bd3  21.g3  Bxb5  22.gxf4   22.axb5 ?  blunders an exchange  Nd3  22...Bxa4  23.Nd5  Rxc1  24.Rxc1  Bc6  25.Nxf6+  gxf6  and White will have to defend accurately for the draw.  20.Rfe1  Bxd4  21.Rc4 !  Bxf2+  22.Kxf2  Nd3+  23.Ke2  Nxe1  24.Kxe1  With two knights vs. rook + pawn and Blacks b-pawn being weak, only White had chances to play for a win in Ulibin-Lputian, Simferopol 1988.   8.Bc4 !?  Re8+  9.Be3  Ng4  This looks better than   9...Nb6  10.Bb3  Ng4  because Black retains the option of moving his d7-knight to f6.  10.O-O  White also cannot hold his extra pawn with   10.Qd3  Nb6  11.Bb5   11.Bb3  Bf4  11...Re7  12.O-O  a6  13.Ba4  Nxa4  14.Nxa4  Qe8  15.Nc3  Nxe3  16.fxe3  Rxe3  and Black is fine.  10...Nxe3  11.fxe3  Rxe3  12.Qd2  Re8  is unclear; naturally, both sides have options  (Watson)  . This is quite an interesting position. Whites d-pawns can become a fatal weakness in the endgame, but now in the middlegame they guarantee White a space advantage and control several squares. White is quite active, but, on the other hand, it would be strange if Black with the two bishops and no weaknesses were worse.  13.Rae1  Rxe1  14.Qxe1  Nf6  15.Ne5  a6  After this the complications seem to end in equality/draw.   15...Bd7 !?  is a good alternative, one point being  16.Ne4 ?!

Bg4  15.Nd4  Re5  16.f4 ?  Rxe3 !  The exchange sacrifice is already decisive.  17.Qxe3  Bc5  18.Bb3  Defending d5.  Qd6  But the next threat is ...Qb6.  19.Rac1  Re8 !  Black is precise.   19...Qb6 ?  would allow the sacrifice  20.Rxc5  20.Qd2  Re4  -+  and Black soon won the game Artemiev  (2692)  - Derjabin  (2360)  , RUS-ch rapid Sochi 2017. }

The position is equal; here are two examples:  10.Qc2  Bf5  11.b4   11.Nf1  Bxd3  12.Qxd3  Qf5  13.Qe2  a6  14.Ng3  Bxg3  15.hxg3  Ng6  16.b3  Qd7  17.Ba3  Rfe8  18.Qd3  Rad8  19.Rxe8+  Rxe8  20.Re1  h6  21.Kf1  Re6  22.Rxe6  Qxe6 =  Sedina-Yusupov, Switzerland 2001  11...Bxd3  12.Qxd3  Qf5  13.Qxf5  Nxf5  14.a4  Rfe8  15.Rxe8+  Rxe8  16.Kf1  h5  17.Nb3  f6  18.b5  Nd8  19.Ba3  Bxa3  20.Rxa3  Ne6  21.Nc5  Nd6  22.Nxe6  Rxe6  Again Whites queenside advance rather had a weakening effect, and Black was already more comfortable in V.Sveshnikov-Kovalenko, Parnu 2016.  8...Qd7  9.b4  This pawn advance is the correct way to play if Black has castled queenside. However, if Black castles short, it is not clear if the queenside activity really helps White. He can also just end up weakening his structure as in the following example:  O-O  10.h3  Bf5  11.Nb3  Ng6  12.b5  Nce7  13.Nc5  Bxc5  14.dxc5  Bxd3  15.Qxd3  a6  16.Rb1  axb5  17.Qxb5  Qxb5  18.Rxb5  Rfb8  19.Rb2  Kf8  20.Be3  Ke8  21.Rfb1  Kd7  22.Rd2  Ra4  23.Rbb2  f6  24.Rd4  Rxd4  25.Nxd4  Ne5  =+  Black went on to win the endgame in Berger-Rakhmanov, Pardubice 2010.   5.Ne2  allows  Nb4  forcing the exchange of Whites light-square bishop.  6.O-O   6.Bb5+  Bd7  7.Bxd7+  Qxd7  8.c3  Nc6 =  Evertsson-Westerberg, Stockholm 2014.  6...Nxd3  7.Qxd3  Nf6  8.Ng3  Be7  9.Nf5  Bxf5  10.Qxf5  Qd7  11.Qxd7+  Kxd7  12.Bg5  h6  13.Be3  Bd6  14.Nd2  Rae8  15.Rfe1  Ng4  16.Nf1  f5 !  and Black started to press in Orev-Sedlak, Bulgaria 2013. }
5... Bd6 6. Qf3
{ An ambitious idea; on f3, the queen is placed actively and also makes it difficult for Black to bring his bishop to f5.  On   6.Ne2  Black has the option to apply the same idea himself,  Qf6 !?  Black usually follows up with . ..Nge7, and probably  (but not necessarily)  ...Bf5. If White plays inaccurately/ too passively, Black will soon have good chances to take over the initiative.  7.O-O   7.Ng3  Nge7  8.Nh5  For 8. O-O, see 7. O-O Nge7 8. Ng3.

Now  Qxf3  It would have been more exact to halve Whites bishop pair before taking the pawn:   14...Qg2 !  15.Bxe7  The only move, as after   15.Ne3 ??  hat bishop would be hanging.  15...Nxe7  16.Ne3  Qxf3  ∓  15.Rg1  f6  16.Be3  Kf8  17.Be2  was not so clear in Herzog-Knaak, Bad Woerifshofen 1993.

Qh4  losing a piece,  10.Nxg7+  Kf8  -+  Interestingly, in the most recent example a 2300+ player on the white side was so impressed by Blacks attacking ideas that he immediately allowed his pawn-structure to be ruined:   9.Qf3 ?

Qe7  9.Ne2  dxe4  10.Qe3  f5  11.O-O  O-O  Black had two bishops and a nice edge in Molenda-Wisniewski, Solina 2012   8.Bf4  O-O  9.Ne2  f5 =  Sarsam-Nikolic, Istanbul 2000  8...O-O !  9.Bxe4 ?!   9.O-O  f5  gives Black comfortable equality.

Ng6  12.g3   Perhaps White had overlooked  11...Ng6  , or that after  12.Bxd6  , Black wins a pawn with the zwischenzug  12...Nxh4  Nxf4  13.Nxf4  c6  ∓  White cannot easily develop his knight and already faces serious problems.  14.Re1  Qb6  15.Re2  Bd7  16.Rc2  Qc7  17.Nd2  Rae8  18.Nf1  g5 !  19.hxg5   19.Ng2  gxh4  20.Nxh4  f4  is also terrible for White.  19...Nxg5  20.Qg2  Bxf4  21.gxf4  Qxf4  -+  Zarcula-Drasko, Berlin 1986.  9...dxe4  10.Qxe4  Re8  11.Qf3   11.Qd3  Qf6 !  intending ...Bf5 is also good for Black. Here is one crushing example:  12.Na3  Bf5  13.Qf3  Qg6  14.Kf1  Bd3  15.Be3  h5  Black wants to play ...Be4 without allowing Qg4.  16.h4  Be4  17.Qh3  Bf5  18.Qf3  Bg4  19.Qd5  Qd3  20.Re1  Rxe3 !  Prasad-Kaidanov, Kolkata 1988  11...Be6 !  gives Black too much play  (Watson)  . Black is ahead in development, has the bishop pair and chances on the light squares. This adds up, and White is clearly the one fighting for equality here.  12.Be3  Ne7  and now:  13.O-O  Here is a beautiful victory by a former team mate of mine, FM Matthias Liedtke:   13.Nf4  Bd7  14.c4   14.O-O  keeps the balance according to the engine. From here, improvements surely can be found for both sides, but it is more about showing what kind of trouble White can get into by accepting the pawn sacrifice.  14...Nf5  15.O-O  Nh4  16.Qh5  g6  17.Qa5  b6  18.Qd5  Qf6  19.Nc3  c6  20.Ne4  Rxe4 !  21.Qxe4  Re8  22.Qd3  Bf5  23.Qd1  Qg5  -+  Not only is the Nf4 hanging, there are also serious problems on h3 and g2 !  24.g4  Bxf4  25.Bxf4  Qxf4  26.gxf5  Nf3+  27.Kg2  Qh2+  28.Kxf3  Qxh3+  29.Kf4  g5+  30.Kxg5  Re4  31.Rg1  Qh4#  01 Blaskowski-Liedtke, German League 2015.  13...Bd5  14.Qh5  g6  15.Qg5  Nf5  16.Qxd8  Raxd8  17.Nd2  Nxe3  18.fxe3  Rxe3  =+  Black had won back the pawn with an advantage in Balin-Cech, Czechia 2010. }

{ - Summary Frankly speaking, it was not that difficult to find solid lines against the French Exchange as the Exchange Variation is often played by white players without many ambitions in the first place. However, some players interpret the Exchange Variation in an ambitious manner, especially those who go for a quick c2-c4. Against the immediate 4. c4, I really like the answer 4... Bb4+ 5. Nc3 Ne7 !?, which was discussed in game 60. In the main line after 5... Ne7: 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Bd3   7.Be2  7... dxc4 8. Bxc4 Bg4 9. Be3 Nbc6 10. O-O Nf5 it is White, with the isolated queens pawn, who is fighting for equality. After 4. Nf3 Bd6, the only critical move is 5. c4, but as game 61 showed, after 5... Nf6, Black does not have to fear 6. c5 or the pawn-grab 6. Nc3 O-O 7. cxd5 Black will soon win back the pawn with good play or get some other compensation for it. The arising positions can be quite interesting, for example, after 7... Nbd7 ! 8. Bc4 !? Re8 9. Be3 Ng4 10. O-O Nxe3 11. fxe3 Rxe3 12. Qd2 Re8, we saw a complicated position with chances for both sides. Finally, against the popular 4. Bd3, 4... Nc6 was demonstrated to be a reliable answer in game 62. }

The arising positions can be quite interesting, for example, after 7... Nbd7 ! 8. Bc4 !? Re8 9. Be3 Ng4 10. O-O Nxe3 11. fxe3 Rxe3 12. Qd2 Re8, we saw a complicated position with chances for both sides. Finally, against the popular 4. Bd3, 4... Nc6 was demonstrated to be a reliable answer in game 62. }

{ Back in 2000, when I was 17 years old and rated around 2200, I experimented with this line for a while with the white pieces. From those games and their analysis I know that the move is not bad in the sense that White is not worse after it and that it tends to lead to complicated, somewhat unique positions. However, objectively it is not at all dangerous for Black. There are several reliable and roughly equal lines for Black, but I will concentrate on the main line   2...d5  3.Bb2  dxe4  4.Nc3  Nf6  5.Qe2  Be7  . }
2... d5 3. Bb2 { This gambit is the only interesting interpretation of 2. b3. }
3... dxe4 4. Nc3 Nf6
{ Refusing the gambit, as White now can win back the pawn with Qe2 etc.   4...f5  is a weakening move  (xe5, xe6, long diagonal)  and White gets sufficient play for the pawn after 5 f3 or  5.d3 !?  exd3  6.Bxd3  Nf6  7.Qe2 }
5. Qe2 Be7
{ A solid developing move; if White plays Nxe4-Nxf6+, Black can now always comfortably recapture with the bishop. }
6. O-O-O
{ 6.Nxe4  is as popular as 6. O-O-O and can in fact transpose to it as well.  O-O  7.Nf3   For  7.O-O-O  see  6.O-O-O  O-O  7.Nxe4.  b6 !?  makes a good impression. The bishop is well placed on b7 and Black keeps both options open regarding the development of his queens knight.   7...Nc6  also deserves attention, when one of the possible continuations is  8.O-O-O  a5  9.a4  transposing to 6. O-O-O O-O 7. Nxe4 a5 8. a4 Nc6 9. Nf3.  8.O-O-O  Bb7  9.Nxf6+  Bxf6  I believe Black is at least equal. Here are two examples:  10.d4   10.Ne5  a5  11.a4  Nc6  12.f4  Qd6  13.Qe3  Rfd8  14.d4  Nb4  15.Rd2  c6  16.h4  b5  17.h5   17.axb5  a4  is dangerous for White.  17...bxa4  18.bxa4  Rab8  =+  Black had made progress by opening the b-file in Alonso Gonzalez-Oren, corr 2008.  10...Nd7  11.Ne5  Qe7  12.f4  Rfd8  ⇆  Black is better developed and has no problems at all. His most obvious idea is to play ...c7-c5, although in the game he goes for another acceptable plan, ...g7-g6   xg7  followed by ...Nxe5:  13.Rg1  g6  14.g4  Nxe5  15.dxe5   15.fxe5  Bg5+  16.Kb1  c5  is fine for Black.  15...Rxd1+  16.Kxd1 ?  Not a very intuitive recapture; Whites alarm bells should have been ringing to prevent putting the king in the center like this.   With  16.Qxd1  White would have kept an acceptable position.  Rd8+  17.Kc1  Now  Qc5  But even stronger would have been   17...Qb4  attacking the pawn on f4.  18.Bg2  The tactical point is that   18.exf6 ??  loses to  Bf3 !  19.Qxf3  Qe1+  with mate.  After   18.Kb1  Rd2  19.Qe3  Rd1+  20.Bc1  Be7  the threat of ...Bc5 leaves White with nothing better than to sacrifice his queen for rook+bishop.  21.Bc4  Bc5  22.Rxd1  Bxe3  23.Bxe3  Qc3  with excellent winning chances for Black.  18...Qxf4+  19.Kb1  Rd2  20.Qb5  c6  21.Bxc6  Bxc6  22.Qxc6  Bxe5  ∓  18.Rg3  Bh4  19.Rh3  Be7  was better for Black in Rozsa-Toth, Hungary 2008. }
6... O-O 7. Nxe4
{ The gambit   7.d3 ?  exd3  8.Rxd3  has brought White good results in a few games, but it is simply bad.  Nbd7  9.g4  and Black has a pleasant choice:  c6  prepares ...Nd5.  In fact, ...Nd5 does not necessarily have to be prepared with ...c7-c6:   9...a5 !?  10.g5  Nd5  11.Nxd5  exd5  Now after  12.Rxd5  the g5-pawn is hanging as well.  Instead,   12.h4  was played in Boog-Wuest, Switzerland 1991, when 12... Nc5 or 12... c6 would have left Black with an extra pawn and the compensation. By moving his kingside pawns forward, White has just weakened his position and neglected development.  12...Bxg5+  13.Kb1  Bf6  -+  10.Rh3   10.h4  Nd5  11.Nxd5  cxd5  ∓  Ullmann-Breiter, Kassel 1999  10...Nd5  ∓ }

{ Probably White should rather keep the long diagonal open and pursue his own kingside play with   10.h4 !?  b6  11.Nxf6+  Bxf6  12.h5  After  h6  the position is balanced, here are two examples from correspondence play:  13.Bxf6   13.Qe4  Rb8  14.Qf4  Bb7  15.Bc4  Kh8  16.Rh3  Qe7  17.Bxf6  Qxf6  18.Qxf6  gxf6 =  Jarabinsky-Alonso Gonzalez, corr 2010.  13...Qxf6  14.Qe5  Qe7  Black decides to keep queens on the board, at least for the moment.  15.Rh3  Nd5  16.Kb2  Bb7  17.Rg3  Nf6  18.Nd4  Now Nf5 is a huge threat and Black agrees to enter an equal ending.

Not really surprising as Whites king loses all his pawn protection, but still difficult to calculate.  13.Nc3  Nxc3  14.Bxc3  Na2+  15.Kb2  Nxc3  16.Kxc3  Ba3  Whites king will not find a safe place in the near future. However, White can try to start consolidating with  Instead of 16...

{ Blacks obvious plan is to attack the opponents king so he has to open files on the queenside. }
14. Qf2 b5 15. axb5

18. Nc3 Ra8
{ Moving back the attacked rook followed by bringing the rest of the army into the attack felt very natural. However, it was already possible to go for the knock-out with   18...Qb6 !  for example,  19.Nxa4  or   19.Bc4  Nxc2 !  20.Nxa4   20.Qxc2  Rxc4  is hopeless, as well.  20...Bxa4  21.Rd2  Na3  -+  19...Bxa4  20.Bd3  Na2+  21.Kb1   21.Kd2  Qxb2  -+  21...Rb8  -+ }

{ 5.g4 ?!  I do not think that an early g2-g4 is necessarily bad for White in the 2. b3 line, but here it is premature and after  Nc6  White cannot equalize anymore.  The knee-jerk reaction   5...h6 ?!  is played the most, but Black does not need to be afraid of the move g4-g5 as this weakens the white position even further.  6.g5   6.Bg2  e5 !  is good for Black,  7.h3  or   7.g5  Bg4 !

6... O-O 7. g4
{ This advance is positionally risky as it weakens several squares, especially f4. But it also has some plusses: White intends to gain space with g4-g5 and he has the option to develop his bishop to g2 now. }
7... a5
{ Another good option is   7...Nc6  the knight is heading for the d4-square.  After  8.g5  Black has tried two knight moves:   8.Nxe4  and now:  Nd4   8...a5 !  as played in some more recent games is most logical after Whites knight has left c3 and probably also strongest. In the latest example White allowed the a-file to be opened without resistance, which led to quick disaster:  9.d4 ?  a4  10.Nxf6+  Bxf6  11.Nf3  axb3  12.axb3  Nb4  13.Ne5 ?

With the queen no longer on e2, this move has become possible. From h5 the knight can of course go to f4 in many lines, but it also blocks Whites kingside play.  9.Nxe4   9.h4 !  looks best. White protects the g5-pawn before taking on e4 and also leaves the knight on c3 for the moment, reducing the strength of the ...a5-a4 idea.  f5  10.gxf6  Black will have to recapture on f6 with a piece; in the resulting structure both sides have their weaknesses and chances are about equal.  Nxf6   10...Bxf6  also deserves attention.  11.Nxe4  Nd4  12.Qd3   12.Nxf6+  Bxf6  13.Qe4  Qd5  14.Bd3  Nf5  is equal.  12...e5  13.Ne2 !   13.Bg2  allows  Nd5 !  14.Ng5  Bf5  15.Be4  13...Bf5  14.N2g3  Nxe4  15.Nxe4  c5  ⇆  9...a5 !?  Ignoring the hanging pawn on g5 and instead fighting for the initiative.   9...Bxg5  was played in Hoffmann-Karwatt, Germany 2014. As the engine suggests, Black should be better after  10.Nxg5  Qxg5  11.Nf3  but with the open g-file many things can happen in a practical game.  If White physically prevents the further advance of the a-pawn with  10.a4  the radical  b5  deserves attention, e.g.  11.Qxb5   11.axb5  Ncb4  ∓  intending ...a4, and  12.c3 ?  Nf4  sees a Black knight landing on d3.  11...Ndb4  12.Qe2  Nd4  13.Bxd4  Qxd4  with great play for the pawn. One of the possible lines goes  14.c3  Qd5  15.Qc4  Bb7  16.Qxd5  Bxd5  17.Re1  Na6  18.Bxa6  Rxa6  and Black will win back the pawn on b3 or g5 with the advantage. }

Here is a beautiful sample line:  12.Nxb5  Ba6 !  13.Qxe4  Bxb5  14.Bxb5  How to break through ?  Qd6 !  15.Qd4  (The only move.)  e5  16.Bxa3  Rxa3  17.Qb2  and now  Nb4 !  forces White to give up his queen.  18.Qxa3  Nd3+  19.Bxd3  Qxa3+  20.Kb1  Nc6  21.Ne2  Nb4  22.Nc1  Nxa2 !  -+ }
12. Na4 f5

1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e5 c5 4. b4
{ This is the French Wing Gambit, which is in fact a playable line. White hopes to build up a strong center by eliminating Blacks c-pawn and in the main line 4... cxb4 5. a3 Nc6 6. axb4 Bxb4 7. c3 Be7 8. d4, he has long-term positional compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Here, I will not discuss the question if this compensation is entirely sufficient from an objective point of view. Instead I would like to show a good way for Black to reject the gambit. }
4... c4
{ From c4 the pawn controls thed3-square and thus keeps influence on the center; furthermore it restricts Whites lightsquare bishop. The most obvious counterplan for White is to free this bishop by playing d2-d3, but first he should take care of the attacked pawn on b4. }
5. c3
{ 5.a3 !?  is played less often, but has some merit. One advantage over 5 c3 is that after d3   d4  / ...cxd3, White now has the option to recapture on d3 with the c-pawn.  a5  is the main continuation, but I am not so sure about it, for example,  Instead,   5...b5 !  is a good move. Black gains further space and can think about taking over the initiative on the queenside with 6... a5 next without White having the answer b4-b5.  6.a4 !?  Moving this pawn for the second time in a row, but White felt the necessity to act on the queenside.  After   6.c3 ?  as in Von Rahden-Wuttke, Germany 1995, Black already gains the advantage with  a5 !   6.Nc3  targeting b5 has been played the most.  6...Bd7  Insisting on ...a7-a5.   6...a6 =  7.d3 !   7.Bb2 ?!  a5  8.bxa5  Rxa5  9.d4  Ne7  10.Be2  Nf5  11.O-O  Nc6  with a clear positional advantage for Black in Ster-Rohde, corr 2002  7...a5  8.dxc4 !

One point of this move is that  8.Ba3 ?  is now met with   8.c3  Ba5 !  It looks strange to move the bishop away from the a3-f8 diagonal, but there are good reasons for this:  After   8...Bc5 ?!  9.d3 !  is slightly annoying, while now 9. d3 ? would simply be met with 9... axb5 as the a8-rook is not hanging.  9.bxa6  Ne7  10.d3  cxd3  11.Bxd3  Bxa6 =  Black is not worse. In fact, his sounder pawn structure can become a factor, for example,  12.O-O  Bxd3  13.Qxd3  Nbc6  14.Ba3  Bc7 !  and White has some problems with his e5-pawn.   8.Be2  Bb7  9.bxa6  Nd7  10.O-O  Rxa6 =  8...axb5   9.Bxb4  Rxa1  . White will have to exchange the b5pawn soon and chances are about equal.  5...a5  6.b5  Nd7  7.d3  cxd3  8.cxd3 !

5... a5
{ A strong positional move with the idea of gaining control over the c5-square.   Compared with the line 5  a3  , the answer  5...b5?  would be bad here as White can play  6.a4  in one move with the useful c2-c3 already having been played. }

{ After his positional achievements on the queenside, Black attacks the opponents center with this typical break. The position is probably still equal, but White is the one who has to play exactly. }
9. exf6
{ I think this move is fine if White follows it up correctly and fights for the e5-square. Other options are:   9.Qc2 ?  Giving up the center for Blacks h-pawn is strategically dubious and can only be justified if White gets a promising attack. This is not the case here.  Nxe5  10.Nxe5  fxe5  11.Bxh7  In this position in the game Najer-Moskalenko, Moscow 1995, Black has at least two ways to gain an advantage: Watsons  e4  and Simon Williams   11...Qf6  12.Bg6+  Kd8  Black will now continue his development with ...e4, ...Bc5 and ...Ne7 when his center looks very impressive  (Williams)  .  12.Bg6+  Kd7   9.Bf4  fxe5  10.Nxe5  Qf6 !  11.Nxd7  Bxd7  Black can develop his knight to h6, from where it can go to f7, increasing the control over the e5-square.

(preventing ...Ng4)  is Whites best chance to fight for equality  Qe7  15.Nd2  Nd7  16.Qh5  Rxf4   another option is the non-forcing  16...g6  17.Qxh7+  Kf7  18.Qh5+  and now Black can make a draw with  Kg8  19.Qh7+  etc., while an interesting winning attempt is  Kf7  20.Qh5+  Kf6 !?  for example,  21.h4  Qd6  22.g3  Rf5  23.Bxf5  exf5  24.Kg2  (reacting against the threat ...Qxg3+)  Ne5  Usually, in the middle game, two pieces are stronger than rook+pawn. Therefore, if Black manages to finish development and improve his kings position in the next stage of the game, he will have good chances to gain the advantage.   12.Bg5 ?  Bd6  13.Qe2  O-O  14.O-O  Qc7  15.h3  h6  16.Bc1  e5  ∓  left Black with an ideal position in Van den Berg-Vogel, Amsterdam 2011.  12...Bxa3  13.Nxa3  O-O  14.O-O  Bd7  Black was slightly more comfortable and later grinded out a good endgame win in Zakarian-Antic, Kalamaria 2009.

9... Ngxf6 10. Qe2
{ White could consider   10.Bf4  when he has good chances to keep the e5-square under control. Given Whites weakened queenside structure, Black has nothing to worry about though. One possible continuation is  Nc5  11.O-O  Bd6  12.Bxd6  Qxd6  13.Re1  O-O  14.Bc2  Bd7  15.c4  Rac8  with equal chances in a complex position. }

12. O-O O-O 13. Be3 Qc7
{ Slowly preparing ...e6-e5, but   13...e5 !  was already possible and in Blacks favor:  14.Nxe5  Instead,   14.Bxc5  Bxc5  15.Nxe5  or   15.Qxe5  Ng4  are also great for Black. The latter line is most tricky over the board, so lets continue a bit:  16.Qh5 ?   16.Qe2  Qd6 !  17.Nbd2   17.h3 ?  Rxf3 !  18.hxg4  Bxg4  19.gxf3  Qg3+  -+  17...Bd7  ∓  ..Rae8 is on the cards, and the idea ...Nxf2 is in the air  (especially if White plays h2-h3)  . One sample line goes:  18.Bb3  White tries to regroup.  Kh8  19.Qd3  Rf5 !  20.h3  Rh5 !  There is no good defense against Blacks armada of attacking ideas like ... Nxf2, ...Qg3 and even ...Rxh3.  If  21.hxg4  Bxg4  White is faced with the threat ...Qh6 and ...Rh1 mate.  16...g6  17.Bxg6  hxg6  18.Qxg6+  Kh8  White has no perpetual and therefore is clearly worse.  15...Re8  14...Bxe5  15.Bxc5  Bxh2+  16.Kxh2  Qc7+  17.Kg1  Qxc5  =+  when Black has won back the pawn with an advantage. }
14. c4
{ Now Black realizes all his ideas.  The computer defends very stubbornly in lines like   14.Bd4  Nce4  (Renewing the threat of ...e5)  15.b6  Qb8  16.c4  e5  17.Be3  d4  18.Bxd4  exd4  19.Bxe4 }
14... e5 15. Bxc5 { 15.cxd5  e4  ∓ } 15... Qxc5 16. cxd5 Bg4
{ It is already over ! } 17. Rc1
{ White would love to play   17.Nbd2  but this drops the bishop  (Qxc2 -+)   17.h3  Bxf3 !  Again making use of the hanging Bc2.  18.gxf3  e4  19.fxe4   19.Bxe4  Qc8  19...Be5  -+  Another way to end the game is   17.Be4  Nxe4  18.Qxe4  Rf4  19.Qe3  e4  20.Qxc5  Bxc5  21.Ne5  Be2  -+ }

Here, I will not discuss the question if this compensation is entirely sufficient from an objective point of view. Instead I would like to show a good way for Black to reject the gambit. }
4... c4
{ From c4 the pawn controls thed3-square and thus keeps influence on the center; furthermore it restricts Whites lightsquare bishop. The most obvious counterplan for White is to free this bishop by playing d2-d3, but first he should take care of the attacked pawn on b4. }

{ This is a strange and not very promising gambit. After Black takes on e4, White usually follows up with a quick f2-f3 in combination with either Nc3 or Nd2. As John Watson points out, there are similarities with the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit   1.d4  d5  2.e4  dxe4  3.f3  , with the drawback that the bishop on e3 would be poorly placed in a BlackmarDiemer  (an opening of marginal soundness anyway)  . }

{ White sticks with his plan. Objectively, it is best for White to bury any gambitstyle ambitions and play   5.c3 !  intending to win back the pawn by playing g3, Bg2 and if necessary, Qc2. White has good chances to equalize like this, but playing White it is not easy to admit that you are fighting for equality after only five moves !  b6  is the most frequent and also most logical move. Black prepares to develop his bishop to a good square, from where it also protects the extra pawn on e4.  6.g3 !  In the line   6.Qc2 ?!  Bb7  7.Ne2  White has more problems. Black can try to hold on to his extra pawn with 7... Qd5, but I prefer the idea of advantageously giving back the pawn with  Nbd7  8.Ng3  Be7  9.Ngxe4  Nd5 !  Black threatens to win a piece with ...f5-f4; White lacks a fully satisfying continuation.  10.c4  Nxe3  11.fxe3  was Edwards Wright-Burnett, England 2012, when  f5  would have given Black a considerable advantage.  12.Nf2  The knight would not have many prospects on g3 either, and after   12.Nc3  Bh4+  White loses castling rights as  13.g3 ??  would leave the rook on h1 hanging.  12...Bg5  13.Qc3  c5  14.Nf3   14.dxc5 ?  Bf6  15.Qc2  Nxc5  is a positional disaster for White.  14...Bf6  and White has problems.  6...Bb7  7.Bg2  c5 !?  Black wants more than easy equality.   7...Be7  8.Qc2  O-O  9.Nxe4  Nxe4  9... Nd5 10.

{ This takes control over the f4-square and is more active than the main continuation 8... Be7. After 8... Bd6 White scores terribly and it is quite obvious that he does not have sufficient compensation for the pawn, viz., slightly more space and a semi-open f-file, which might or might not be of importance later. Thats simply not enough. It is important for Black, though, not to play passively. White will castle queenside and then Black has to search for active play himself by pushing his a- and/or his b-pawn.  With   8...Nxe3 ?!  9.Qxe3  Black can secure the pair of bishops, but at the same time he exchanges his most active piece and gives White a very free position. Blacks bishops cannot easily show their potential in this slightly cramped position and White has done well in praxis. }
9. Ne4
{ After   9.Bf2  O-O  10.O-O-O  Black has successfully tried two active plans: Pushing ...b7-b5:  a6  Pushing the a-pawn:   10...b6  11.Rg1  a5  12.c4  Nf4  13.Qe4  Bb7  14.a3  a4  =+  The b3-square is fixed as a weakness and the c4-pawn may later become weak as it can no longer be protected by b2-b3. Black was better in Nicholls-Johnston, corr 2011.  11.g3  It is not easy for White to prevent ...b7-b5 even if he plays   11.c4  Nf4  12.Qe3  Ng6  13.Kb1  b5 !  14.cxb5  axb5  15.Bxb5  Nb4  16.Bc4  ∓  Watson  11...b5  12.Bg2  Qe7  13.Rde1  Bb7  14.Rhf1  Na5  15.Bg1  Rac8  16.Ne4  Nc4  17.Nfd2  Nxd2  18.Qxd2  Ba8  19.Qc2  Nb6  20.Be3  f5  21.Bg5  Qd7  22.Nc5  Bxc5  23.dxc5  Bxg2  24.Qxg2  Nd5  Black has a strong centralized knight, while White can try to put pressure on the backward e-pawn. At first sight it looks like a fairly normal, balanced position. But if you count the material, you will realize that Black is still a pawn up and therefore he was clearly better in Bullockus-Droessler, corr 2000. }
9... O-O 10. O-O-O a5
{ The advance of the a-pawn is quite typical in this type of position and I like it here.  Instead, Watson recommends the equally strong alternative   10...Rb8  with the idea ...b7-b5, giving the following sample line:  11.c4  Nxe3  12.Qxe3  b5  13.cxb5  Nb4  =+  In fact,   10...b5  can also be played immediately as  11.Qxb5  Nxe3  12.Qxc6  Bd7  -+  drops the exchange. }
11. Bg5
{ As White is not fully developed, it is no surprise that the attempt of a quick kingside attack fails:   11.Nfg5  b5  12.Nxh7 ??  Kxh7  13.Qh5+  Kg8  14.Bxb5  Nce7  15.Ng5  Nf6  -+  DAlfonsi-Richkov, corr 2000. }

20... f5 21. Ng3 Na5

By sacrificing a second pawn for quick development, White can at least keep things complicated in the next stage of the game.

Here are some sample lines:  11.Rb1   11.Bd2  Qa3  12.Rf1  Nbd7  13.Kg1  b6  14.Bf4  O-O  We can afford giving back one pawn !  15.Bxc7  Ba6  ∓  11...b6  12.Rf1  Preparing Kg1 to castle artificially.

7. Be3
{ The most popular continuation. It seems that White has tried almost every legal move in this position, I would like to take a look at some of them:  Blacks last move allows White to immediately win back the pawn with   7.dxe5  but this is almost never played as after  Qxd1+  8.Kxd1  Bf5  White lands in an uncomfortable ending with the inferior pawn structure. It is already clear that White will have to fight hard for a draw after 8 moves !  As usual   7.fxe4 ?  runs into  Qh4+   7.Bc4  is well met by  Nc6  8.d5  Na5  9.Ba2  Nf6  as given by Watson. Black is clearly better here and also has other promising options like   9...Qh4+  10.g3  Qh5  or   9...b6  (idea ...Ba6)  10.Qe2  Qh4+  11.g3  Qh5   7.Bb5+  c6  8.Bc4  is an attempt to improve over 7. Bc4, as Black now cannot develop his knight to c6. However, d7 is also not a terrible square for the knight, and after  Bf5  Black is better.  9.fxe4  Here is an example of how quickly White can go downhill in the 6... e5 line in over-the-board play:   9.Be3 ?!  Nd7  10.Qe2  Qa5  ∓  11.Bd2  Ngf6  12.Bb3  O-O  13.h4  exf3  14.Nxf3  e4  15.Ne5  Nxe5  16.dxe5  Qxe5  -+  Feicht-Hein, Gladenbach 2011  9...Qh4+  10.Kf1  Bxe4  11.dxe5   11.Qe2  Nd7  12.dxe5  Nxe5  13.Nf3  Bxf3  14.Qxe5+  Ne7  15.Bd3  and now in Grott-Leisebein, corr 1999, Blacks best would have been  f6  16.Qe3  Bd5  17.Rb1  Qg4  ∓  with a sound extra pawn and good winning chances.  11...Bxg2+  12.Kxg2  Qxc4  13.Rb1  Whites pawn structure is an absolute disaster and he is a pawn down. Surprisingly, he is still in the game. It is not enough to equalize though, for example,  b6  14.Rb4  Qd5+  15.Qxd5   15.Nf3  Qxd1  16.Rxd1  Ne7  17.e6  f6 !  18.Rbd4  Na6  ∓  The e6-pawn is slightly annoying, but also a potential target, which can be attacked by Blacks knight and after short castling rook.  15...cxd5  16.Rg4  g6  17.c4  Ne7  ∓  After 6... e5, White scores horribly in over-the-board play: 10/32 according to Mega Database 2018. This not only has to do with the objective assessment of the position  (which is probably =+)  , but also with the fact that Whites position is very unnatural and difficult to play. In my own games with 6... e5, I usually managed to reach winning positions quite quickly; here is one example:   7.Be2  My opponent was surprised by 6... e5 and produced this strange novelty. The bishop is placed passively on e2.  Nf6   the typical  7...Nc6 !  was slightly stronger  8.Bg5  the ending after   8.dxe5  Qxd1+  9.Bxd1  Nd5  is difficult for White and certainly not what a gambit player wants !  8...exd4  9.cxd4  Nc6  This is not a theoretically important line, so I will just show the moves of the game.  10.c3  h6  11.Bf4  Nd5  12.Qd2  Qe7  13.Kf2  Bf5  14.g3  Na5  White is not only a pawn down, but also under attack from all sides !  15.Qb2  O-O-O  16.Qb5  Nc6  17.Bc4  e3+  18.Kg2  a6  19.Qb2  g5  Now it is obvious that White loses decisive material.  20.Bxd5  Rxd5  21.c4  Rdd8  22.g4  gxf4  23.gxf5  Nxd4  0-1 Doehn-Langrock, Kassel 2003.  After   7.Qe2  Black has the choice between two promising continuations:  exd4   7...Nc6  8.dxe5   8.Bb2  Bf5  9.dxe5  Nh6  10.Rd1  Qh4+ !  Provoking White to weaken his light-squares.  11.g3  Qe7  12.fxe4  Bg4  13.Nf3  Nxe5  14.Bg2  O-O  15.O-O  f5  16.Qb5  Nxf3+  17.Bxf3  fxe4  18.Bxg4  Nxg4  ∓  Beutel-Leisebein, corr 2001  8...Nge7  is =+ according to Watson, who gives the sample line  9.Qxe4  Bf5  10.Qe2  Qd5  11.f4  O-O-O  8.Qxe4+  Qe7 ?  has been played in three correspondence games.  Instead, much more logical is Watsons suggestion,   8...Ne7  9.Qxd4  O-O  Black is ahead in development and has the better pawn structure. This cannot be fully compensated by Whites pair of bishops. }
7... Nc6
{ This looks most ambitious.   7...exd4  is a safe choice, although it releases the tension somewhat early.  8.Qxd4  Nf6   8...Qxd4 !?  9.Bxd4  Nf6  10.Bxf6  gxf6  11.fxe4  led to a slightly better endgame for Black in Von ZitzewitzElburg, corr 1999. Black now has his own pawn weaknesses as well, but still the overall better structure.  9.Qxd8+  Kxd8  10.O-O-O+  Black has kept his extra pawn, but with the two bishops and a slight initiative, White should be able to draw. The game Rodriguez-Haag, corr 2010, concluded  Nbd7  11.Bd4  Ke7  12.fxe4  c5  13.Bf2  Nxe4  14.Re1  f5  15.Bd3  Kf7  16.Bxe4  fxe4  17.Ne2  b6  18.Ng3  Bb7  19.Nxe4  Bxe4  20.Rxe4  Nf6  21.Rf4  g5  22.Rf3  Kg6  23.Rf1  Rhf8  24.Bg3  h5  25.Bd6  Rf7  -. }
8. dxe5
{ White has won his pawn back, but he ends up in a positionally worse position. A scenario, which is quite typical of the 6... e5-line.  Even worse is   8.d5  Na5  9.Bb5+  Bd7  10.Bxd7+  Qxd7  11.fxe4  Qa4 !  ∓  12.Qg4  Nc4  13.Qxg7 ?  Nxe3  14.Qxh8  O-O-O  and Black wins. }

9... Qh5 10. f4

5... c5 6. Ne2
{ Almost always played.  With   6.c3  White shows that he is happy to play with an isolated d-pawn.  Nc6  7.Ne2  cxd4  8.cxd4  Be7  9.Nbc3  O-O  10.O-O  In this position Black has tried different moves, but in particular I like  Qd7 !?  This move prepares ...b6, ...Bb7  (by protecting the knight on c6)  and also ...Rd8. With the slightly unusual placement of Whites minor pieces  (Bf3, Ne2)  there is no Ne5 to be feared and d4-d5 is usually well met by ...Ne5.  11.Qa4   11.d5 ?!  runs into  Ne5 !  and after  12.Nf4  Nxf3+  13.Qxf3  e5  14.Nh5  Nxh5  15.Qxh5  f5  16.Re1  Bd6  =+  Black was better in Kluczka-Knispel Roth, Germany 2006   11.Be3  b6 =  is also easy for Black.  11...a6 !  (with the idea ...b7-b5)  :  After  12.Bg5   12.Qc4  prevents ...b7-b5, but after  Rd8  13.Be3  Na5  Black has no problems whatsoever:  14.Qd3  Nc6  15.Qc4   Black had threatened  ...Ne5  and something like  15.Rfd1  allows  15...b5=  Na5  with a repetition of moves.  12...b5  13.Qb3   13.Nxb5 ??  axb5  14.Qxa8  Bb7  -+  13...Bb7  14.Bxf6  Na5  15.Qc2  Bxf6  Black was already slightly better in Green-Garcia Gallego, corr 2002. }
6... Nc6 7. Be3 { For 7. c3, see 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ne2. } 7... cxd4 8. Nxd4 Ne5
{ A strong move, first played by Nigel Short in 1983. Whites light-square bishop suddenly no longer looks that strong, and Black equalizes easily. }
9. O-O
{ 9.Nc3  which keeps the option of queenside castling, has become the main line in the last years and will be covered in the next game. }
9... a6
{ As after 9. Nc3 I like this move, which takes the b5-square under control so that Black can comfortably move his queen to c7. }
10. c4
{ 10.Nc3  Bd6  and now:  On   10...Qc7  11.Bf4  Bd6  as played in Hector-Short, Belfort 1983, Black has to assess the position after  12.Ndb5 !?  axb5  13.Nxb5  Nxf3+  14.Qxf3  Bxf4  15.Nxc7+  Bxc7  Often, three pieces turn out to be stronger or at least equal to a queen in the middlegame; so most likely Black is fine here. But I am not entirely sure, as White also has a pawn and a 3-1 queenside majority.  11.Qe2  The natural   11.Re1  was recently played against me by Jonasz Baum, a very talented young player from Poland.  Qc7  12.g3   12.Bg5  O-O  13.Bxf6  gxf6  14.Be4  Be7  is roughly equal and is similar to positions we have seen in the Rubinstein chapters.  12...Nxf3+  Making this exchange after White has played g2-g3 was too tempting to resist.  Still,   12...O-O !?  seriously deserves attention. White has no time to save his bishop with  13.Bg2 ?!  as  Nc4  gives Black the initiative.  13.Qxf3  O-O  14.Rad1  Be5 !  15.Qe2  The critical moment, in which exact and careful calculation was required. If Black completes development, he is obviously fine  (or rather more)  . But first White has some concrete ideas like f2-f4 or Bg5.  Bd7 ?   15...Rd8 !  was my second candidate and I should have played it. Now  16.Bg5 ??  would leave the d4-knight hanging.  After   16.f4  Bd6  White has no follow-up as the Bd6 is well protected.  and   16.Ndb5  which looked a bit scary over the board, also turns out in Blacks favor:  axb5  17.Nxb5  Rxd1  But not   17...Qe7 ?  18.Bc5 !  18.Rxd1   18.Nxc7 ?  Rxe1+  19.Qxe1  Bxc7  and Black has too much material for the queen.  18...Qc6  19.Rd8+  Ne8  20.Qc4  Here I stopped my calculation and decided it was unnecessarily dangerous to go for this, but Black has good options, the best being  f5 !  21.Qc5   21.Qxc6  bxc6  22.Rxe8+  Kf7  -+  21...Qxc5  22.Bxc5  Kf7  23.Na7  Bf6  24.Rxc8  Rxc8  25.Nxc8  Bxb2  =+  with a slight endgame advantage. In general, Black looks slightly better after 15... Rd8 !.  16.Bg5 !  Bxd4  17.Rxd4  Nd5  was Baum-Langrock, Teplice 2017, when  18.Qh5 !  would have been very strong.  f6   18...Nxc3 ?  19.Rh4  f6  20.Qxh7+  Kf7  21.Bh6 !  Rg8  22.Rg4  gives White a decisive attack.  19.Nxd5  exd5  and now the shot  20.Bxf6 !  ±  leaves White at least a healthy pawn up. Black has to try to survive some bad endgame after  Rf7  21.Qxd5  Bc6  22.Bd8  Bxd5  23.Re8+  Rf8  24.Rxf8+  Kxf8  25.Bxc7  Bxa2  11...Qc7  12.g3  Nxf3+  13.Qxf3  O-O  14.Rad1  Bd7  with a good position for Black in Gerola-Volovici, corr 2007. }
10... Qc7 11. Be2 Bd7 12. Nd2 Rd8 13. h3 Bc5 14. Qc2 O-O 15. Rfd1 Qb6
{ Possibly not the most exact move.   15...Ng6 !  eyeing the f4-square and enabling the option of ...e6-e5, is very comfortable for Black. }
16. Qb3
{ White can try to generate some pressure with   16.Ne4 !?  Nxe4  17.Qxe4  but I think that after  Nc6  Black gradually equalizes, for example,  18.Nb3  Bxe3  19.Qxe3  Qc7  20.Rd2  Ne7  21.Rad1  Bc6  22.Qg3  Qxg3  23.fxg3  Rxd2  24.Rxd2  Rc8 =  with the idea ...Kf8, ... Ke8. Then,  25.Na5  Kf8  26.Nxc6  Nxc6  27.Rd7  is pointless, as after  Na5  followed by ...Ke8, the rook has to leave the seventh rank again. }
16... Ba4
{ But not   16...Bxd4 ?  17.Qxb6  Bxb6  18.Bxb6  Rc8  19.Bd4 !  Ng6  20.Bxf6  gxf6  21.Ne4  with a double attack on d7 and f6. }
17. Qxb6 { 17.Qxa4  Bxd4  18.Bxd4  Rxd4  is comfortable for Black. } 17... Bxb6

{ 11.gxf3  is an interesting attempt over the board, but White takes serious structural risks and can never be objectively better.  Nd5  Black can also consider a set-up as in the Sicilian Paulsen:   11...b5 !?  12.O-O-O  Qc7  followed by moves like ...Bb7, ..Rc8. White seems to have sufficient compensation for the structural deficits, but not more.

It was recommended and analyzed in the first edition of this book, and I was happy to see that it has now been played in six games between 2016 and 2017, with Black making a positive score ! The pawn move frees the c8-bishop, but it is also directed against queenside castling, which will not be legal, when the white knight has left d4. }
12. O-O-O
{ White insists on queenside castling, but sacrificing a piece is a little too much. Instead, all three reasonable looking knight moves have been tried in praxis:   12.Nb3  Bb4  and now:  13.O-O   13.Bg5  Qd5  Or   13...h6  14.Bh4  O-O  15.O-O  Bxc3 !  and Black gets rid of the pin with a good game after  16.Qxc3  or   16.bxc3  Qd5  16...Ne4  14.Qxd5  Bxc3+  15.Qd2 !  Bxd2+  16.Nxd2  (Pruijssers-Pijpers, Leiden 2017)  Be6 =  Souleidis.  13...Bxc3  14.bxc3  O-O  or   14...Qd5  15.Qg3  O-O =  when  16.Bh6  is met with  Ne8  15.Nc5 ?!  (Fernandez Mazzetti-Labollita, Mar del Plata 2017)  (Qc7 =+)  and White does not have much to show for his bad structure.   12.Nde2  Be7  13.Rd1   13.Qg3  The double attack on e5 and g7 is not dangerous  O-O  or   13...Qa5 !?  14.Qxg7 ?!  Rg8  14.Qxe5  Ng4  =∞   13.Ng3  O-O  14.O-O  Qc7  Being almost 200 Elo points lower rated, Black is playing it safe.  Instead, the pawn sacrifice   14...Bg4 !  15.Qxb7  Rb8  16.Qxa6  Rxb2  looks promising. Both Whites queenside pawns are potential targets and Black has two bishops as well.  15.Nf5  Bxf5  16.Qxf5  h6  17.Rad1  Rfd8 =  J.Hirneise-Lelumees, Stuttgart 2017.  13...Qc7  14.Qg3  O-O  and before it gets worse, White should take the draw with  15.Bh6  Nh5  16.Qf3  Nf6  17.Qg3  After   12.Nf5 ?!  (Campos Olaya-Jordan Martinez, Masdenverge 2016)  Black can equalize with the queen exchange  Qd7  but   12...Qa5 !  with the threat to win a piece with ...e5-e4, gives an advantage.  13.Ng3  Not the idea of Nf5, but   13.O-O-O ??  e4  14.Nxe4  Qxf5  -+  15.b4  and Black is slightly for choice.  13.Ng3  Qg4 }

Souleidis stops here, but from Blacks point of view we should look a little deeper. White should not exchange queens, so  16.Qf3  After  Be7  Black is ready to castle, therefore  17.Bxf6  Bxf6  18.Nd5  Optically this still does not look so easy, but in fact Black has several good ways.

{ White was back in business and the game ended in a draw after 53 moves. Summary The last chapter of this book has shown how to proceed if White chooses one of the sidelines against the French Defense. As usual in a sideline chapter, some more or less obscure gambits had to be investigated. 3. Be3 ?! dxe4 4. Nd2 Nf6 5. f3 ?! is some sort of Blackmar-DiemerGambit with a passively placed knight on d2. After 5... Nd5 ! 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. c3 exf3 8. Ngxf3 Bd6 White maybe has the somewhat freer position, but as game 67 demonstrated, this is not enough to compensate for the lost pawn. While working on this book, I was surprised to find out how bad the natural-looking gambit 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. f3 ? is. The problem is that Black does not have to take on f3, but has a much better way to keep the extra pawn with 4... Bb4 !. I no longer think that White can equalize; see games 68 and 69. A much more sound choice is the Wing Gambit 2. Nf3 d5 3. e5 c5 4. b4. Todays strongest engines respect it, in the sense that they do not think that White is more than marginally worse if Black takes the pawn. This is no proof at all, but an indicator that White can count on reasonable long-term positional compensation after 4... cxb4 5. a3. If your opponent plays a bad gambit, you should take the pawn. Against sounder gambits like the Sicilian Morra or the French Wing Gambit, declining the offer is a good option. And as the motto of this book is to keep things solid, I decided to recommend the move 4... c4, which is a sound way to decline the gambit. One of the key ideas is to meet 5. c3 with 5... a5 !, fighting for the c5-square, and after 6. b5 Nd7 7. d3 cxd3 8. Bxd3 f6 ! Black can be optimistic as was illustrated in game 65. The move 2. b3 can also become a gambit after 2... d5 3. Bb2 dxe4 4. Nc3 f5, but here my recommendation is to follow the main line 4... Sf6 ! 5. Qe2 Be7 and not hold on to the extra pawn. Black should not forget to play actively as in many lines positions with opposite castling can arise. But if he does that, he is at least not worse as was shown in the games 63 and 64. Finally, there is the Two Knights Variation, 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3, and the modern line 2. d4 d5 3. Bd3. The former I recommended to meet in Rubinsteinesque fashion with 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7, which is rock-solid as could be seen in game 66. The latter is well answered by 3... dxe4 4. Bxe4 Nf6 5. Bf3 c5  (games 70 and 71)  . One point is that after 6. Ne2 Nc6 7. Be3 cxd4 8. Nxd4, Black has 8... Ne5 !, after which Whites bishop on f3 suddenly no longer looks that strong. }
