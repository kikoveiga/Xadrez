1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ The earliest mention of the Grünfeld Defense dates back to the 1860s, when an Indian player, Moheschunder Bannerjee, employed it in the games against John Cochrane. However, it wasn't until 1920 and the efforts of Ernst Grünfeld, that it came into prominence. Remarkably, the first time Grünfeld played that opening was in a game against the World Champion himself, Alexander Alekhine, in Vienna 1922 − and he won that game!   According to the classical principles of opening strategy, the concept of abandoning the fight for the center − after  3.Nc3  d5  4.cxd5  Nxd5  5.e4  Nxc3  6.bxc3  Bg7  White's two central pawns occupy the center, seemingly unopposed − would be seen as plainly incorrect, making the GD an epitome of 'hypermodern chess'.  That simplistic understanding of central control has undergone a massive shift between then and modern-day, of course, and today no one is shocked to see Black attacking the large pawn center from the side, with c5 and Nc6, and then, perhaps, Bg4 or b6 and Bb7, aiming to increase the pressure further. The appreciation of the fact that Black will have an 'a+b vs. a' pawn majority on the queenside in many endgames has also grown with time. }
3. Nc3
{ These days, the Grünfeld offers a wide variety of exciting dynamic structures − on a spectrum from 3.f3, to 3.g3 and to all points in between.   3.f3  , where play will soon become a tactical slugfest:  3...d5  4.cxd5  Nxd5  5.e4  Nb6  6.Nc3  Bg7  7.Be3  O-O  8.Qd2  ,  and White will castle queenside and attempt to go for a direct attack on the kingside with h4-h5.   3.g3  ,  where play is quite dry, in particular if White desires it to be:  3...c6  4.Bg2  d5  , and in a lot of cases play will revolve around White trying to squeeze blood from stone in symmetrical middlegames. }
3... d5 4. cxd5
{ There are also gambits:  4.Bg5  Bg7!?  5.Bxf6  Bxf6  6.cxd5  − is one of my favourite lines of all time. }
4... Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7
{ The Grünfeld holds a wide range of complex strategic battles for all tastes. I've played this opening for 30 years now, and I still find new and exciting ideas all the time. Enjoy the ride! }

{ The Grünfeld has the reputation of being very sharp and concrete, with theory sometimes starting after move 15 and going even deeper than move 40, occasionally. Since the number of trainable lines is very generous, crossing the 1000 barrier, we implemented the 'Learn Important Only' feature, known, to some of you perhaps, from the 5th Edition of Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual or other courses on the Chessable platform that share the same concept.  'Learn Important Only': clearly distinguishes the lines that Grandmaster Peter Svidler himself deemed essential to study in depth. Currently, the default setting is 'Learn Everything', but the most critical variations are distinctly marked by the title in bold. We believe that this feature is very helpful since many of us have difficulties in sorting out which lines are most relevant and should be committed to memory or insisted on.  We would recommend building up the knowledge by going through all the variations and using the bold titles as a reference and guidance throughout the study of this course.  Best wishes for a safe, happy and fulfilling journey through one of the most complex and energetic modern openings! }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3
{ This is a very central line in the @@StartBracket@@Anti?@@EndBracket@@Grünfeld these days. White is trying to aggressively fight for the center, and depending on how Black replies, play can become incredibly concrete and sharp. Black has the option of abandoning the Grünfeld and switching to King's Indian with  3...Bg7  4.e4  d6  , or Benoni-type play with  3...c5  − but that would be off-brand for me and this course. We're playing  3...d5  come hell or high water.  The line probably started life as an Anti-Grünfeld since Grünfeld proper starts from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3.Nc3  d5  , and it was seen as a way not to let us play our favorite opening. However, it has become one of the absolute main lines of the opening, and everyone just calls it the 3.f3 Grünfeld these days. }
3... d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4
{ One of the points of 3.f3 is that with the white knight still on b1, we have to retreat the knight from d5, instead of trading. }
5... Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2
{ To some degree, the only move White makes here. By playing 3.f3, White players make the normal development somewhat tricky, pretty much locking themselves into an ultra-aggressive plan involving castling queenside and launching the h-pawn up the board. }
8... e5
{ This is a switch from  8...Nc6  I recommended back when I did the chess24 course. I've always been wary of entering this line, thinking it was a little bit too memory-heavy. But over the years, the Nc6 lines became, if anything, even more bloated with long forcing lines, and for this course, I decided to finally bite the bullet and delve into 8...e5.  Our plan here is quite clear − we're driving the pawn forward to d5, immediately undermining it with c6, and since White is still going to castle queenside, we will be using the open c-file to try to generate counterplay against White's king. }
9. d5 c6 10. h4
{ It's important for White to begin with this as aftercastling queenside, we have more options. }
10... cxd5 11. exd5 N8d7
{ With White keeping the king on e1 for now, our Nb8 is much more needed on f6, where it will bolster the kingside, and also support the e5-e4 play which becomes crucial pretty soon. }
12. h5
{ It definitely makes sense for White to open the h-file before castling. }
12... Nf6 13. hxg6 fxg6 14. O-O-O { White needs to finish development first. }
14... Bd7 15. Kb1 Rc8
{ This is pretty much where the game starts these days in the 8...e5 line, but it does explode into branches from here. Black's plan stays consistent though − we will be playing e5-e4 as soon as possible, activating the Bg7, and aim to generate as much piece play as possible. Na4 is also a very typical resource, distracting White from kingside plans, and introducing Qa5.   Once the long diagonal has opened up a bit, we should always be on the lookout for opportunities to sacrifice the exchange on c3, blowing up White's queenside and generating direct threats against the white king, particularly in the  16.d6  e4  17.fxe4  Ng4  lines,  where we can follow it up with Na4, attacking the c3-pawn after White recaptures the rook.   White players, in their turn, should be trying to combine making progress on the kingside − Bh6 is always a useful move, and getting the Ng1 developed while also keeping an eye on our play in the center and on the queenside is very crucial. Pushing d5-d6 often affords White additional options because the opened a2-g8 diagonal, and access to the d5-square, could be very useful later in the game.  However, no matter how much I try to be descriptive about what's in front of us, the fact remains − this is probably the sharpest, and the most memorization-heavy, line among the topical responses you can expect to the Grünfeld today, and nothing will replace knowing exactly what to do against White's best moves here. With that, I direct you to thecorresponding chapters in the full course, and may the force be with you. }

It’s a very logical move − White protects the c4-pawn and plans to develop the bishop to b2, further discouraging our potential counterplay in the center.

{ This is the starting position of the 7...dxc4/8...c5 line.

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

{ This weird-looking move has gone almost entirely out of fashion by now − but it has a solid positional foundation, if you want to ignore the 'knight on a rim is dim' aspect of it. It was introduced into serious practice by the Armenian GM Ashot Nadanian in the mid-1990s.  White is aiming to play e2-e4 without allowing Black to trade knights on c3, while also keeping an eye on the c5 break.

10. Nxe5 Bxe2 11. Kxe2 Qe7
{ The compensation for the pawn is based on two main factors here: the white king is stuck in the center and the pawns on e4 and d4 are under quite a bit of pressure. Black is aiming to put the rook on d8, putting more pressure on the white center, and then either attack it with pieces or prepare for the c5 push. }
12. Nc3 Na6
{ Calmly connecting the rooks and further preparing for the c5 break, which can no longer be stopped. }
13. Nf3 c5 14. e5
{ The white center is being blown apart, while the king is still on e2. White players need to make sure they are stable before trying to get the king to safety.   For example after  14.d5  Bxc3  15.bxc3  Qxe4  ,  Black will win material as the pawn on d5 can no longer be saved. }
14... Rfd8 15. Re1
{ White gets to work evacuating the king from the center, while Black needs to continue creating threats. Here, we do this by improving the one piece that has done its job − the knight on a6. }

{ The knight is now calmly rerouted to c6, where it will assist in attacking the pinned bishop on d4. }
17. Kf1 Nc6 18. Re4 Qb4 19. Ne2 Nc4
{ Black's activity amply compensates for the pawn here. White managed to stabilize, but the pieces lack coordination, the unsupported bishop on d4 is awkwardly placed, and the pawn on e5 will continue to require protection.   For example  20.Qb3  Qxb3  The simplest.  21.axb3  N4a5  22.Re3  Bh6  23.Rc3  Bf8  24.g4  Rd5  and the pressure along the d-file aimed in particular against the poorly supported bishop on d4, combined with ideas of Rb5, gives Black a good game. }

4. cxd5
{ 4.Bd2  is an attempt that tries to avoid the lines with early Nb6 by Black. However, since I have decided against recommending the setup with Nb6 in this course, it should not concern us. After  4...Bg7  , White hardly has anything better than  5.cxd5  Nxd5  transposing to the main body of the line.   Note that @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5.e3  transposes into  4.e3  Bg7  5.Bd2  . }
4... Nxd5 5. Bd2
{ The idea of this somewhat strange-looking move is to play e4 next and recapture on c3 with a bishop if Black takes. In the past, I've leaned heavily towards replying with  5...Nb6  , reasoning that it's not logical to give White exactly what they want and they should be 'punished' for wasting a tempo on a move as optically useless as 5.Bd2.

8. Qd2 Nd7
{ The aim of this move is to be as flexible as possible − as you will see, while our main plan remains to push for the c5 break eventually, we're also ready to play e5 if necessary. Importantly, we're also very happy to meet  9.O-O-O  with  9...Nb6!  ,  threatening Na4.   There is a lot of theory after @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2B5/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 2 8@@EndFEN@@  8...c5  , but we won't be engaging with that today. }
9. Nf3

10. Bd3 e6 11. b4 { The only way to fight for an advantage here. } 11... c5
{ This is the way. If we start with  11...Bb7  , White will have additional options later of meeting  12.--  c5  with  13.bxc5  bxc5  and  14.Rb1  , hitting that bishop. }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 c5 8. Rb1
{ One of the most challenging and theory-heavy lines White can choose against the Grünfeld. It exploded in popularity in the late 80s-mid 90s, due to the efforts of Chernin, Gelfand, Khalifman, and later Kramnik. By moving the rook from the long diagonal, White players are giving themselves an opportunity to react to Nc6 with d5, making Black's play against the center a lot more difficult. }
8... O-O 9. Be2
{ And now we're at an important crossroads − there is a number of ways to chicken out of playing the main line @@StartBracket@@and over years, I believe I tried all of them@@EndBracket@@ − but if we want to actually equalize here we have to bite the bullet. }
9... cxd4 10. cxd4 Qa5+ 11. Bd2 Qxa2 12. O-O
{ The tabiya of the 8.Rb1 line. White has sacrificed the a2-pawn but as compensation White has better development, a good center, and the queen on a2 is very awkwardly placed. Black used to have a wide choice here, but by this point, only the main move remains. }
12... Bg4
{ Starting immediate counterplay against the white center. White has four replies here, two of which are quite easy to react to, and two that are worth at least a separate chapter each. }
13. Bg5
{ This is the most aggressive reply White has to 12...Bg4, but not the most popular right now. It would seem on the surface that the pawn on e7 is hanging, and the one on b7 definitely is − but it turns out we're not obliged to protect either of them. }
13... h6
{ Ignoring the 'threat' to the e7-pawn.   The materialistic  14.Bxe7  is met by  14...Re8  15.Rxb7  Nc6  and having given up both pawns, we're ready to take on e4 when the bishop retreats, with a good game. Provoking h6 like this may seem illogical, but there will be positions where that pawn might be hanging, restricting Bg7's mobility. }
14. Be3
{ Our reply here, just as you've seen in the13.Be3 lines, is to continue ignoring the fact that b7 hangs in favour of speedy development. }
14... Nc6 15. d5 Na5
{ If we get a tempo here to play b6 or Rc8, we'll be completely fine instantly. }
16. Bc5
{ Pretty much the only serious move here. White needs to be attacking Black's weak points while it's still possible.   16.h3  Bxf3  17.Bxf3  Nc4  is completely anemic, but the 16.Bc5 line is worth mentioning. }
16... Bf6
{ Once again, I'm deviating completely from the forced lines starting with  16...b6  that I suggested in 2014. I still think Black is more likely to hold than not in the exchange-down endgames after  17.Bxe7  Rfe8  18.d6  Nc6  19.Bb5  , but I came up short trying to find secure ways to nail down the draw there. The line I'm proposing will also lead to positions that look scary, but I believe this is a cleaner way to make a more or less forced draw.  @@StartFEN@@r4rk1/pp2pp2/5bpp/n1BP4/4P1b1/5N2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 3 17@@EndFEN@@  17.e5  is the only way for White to make progress here but after  17...Bxe5  and accurate play, the rather forced lines will end in a draw.

The general themes here could be described as follows: White wants to play in the center, in particular by pushing e4-e5 while combining it with Bh6 ideas. White is using the fact that our minor pieces are either badly placed or under attack, and our softened kingside, to generate quite a lot of play for the exchange.   In response, our biggest priority is to bring the Na5 back into play − in most cases, we'll be trying to play Rc8 and Nc4, but b6/b5 with Nb7-c5 ideas are also not unreasonable in slower lines.

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{ 7.Be3 is very logical − by playing this move, followed by Qd2, White is aiming to prepare as solidly as possible for our typical counterplay against the d4-pawn and along the long diagonal.  It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.  In view of that, I’m quite happy with the chosen solution for this course − it features as few of those positions as possible, and the main line is in fact one of the maddest lines of the entire series. }

11. d5 b5
{ The justification for the choice of Bg4 is this striking pawn sacrifice. White wanted to continue improving in the center by playing c3-c4, and we're actively fighting against it − with the pawn on b5, c4 will almost always be met with b4, establishing an important foothold on the queenside for the future.   We're also often interested in playing c5-c4 ourselves, especially if we can make sure White can't reply to it by getting the knight from f3 to c6 straight away. All of these good things come at a price, of course − we must have a good reply to  12.Bxc5  . }

But by taking on c5, White opened up the c-file, and will now have to worry about the c3-pawn constantly. White's king is also stuck in the center. However, it should be fairly obvious that we have to play extremely energetically here because allowing White to finish development will most likely have lethal consequences. }

17... Na6
{ After  17...Na6  the play could go in two very distinctly different directions:  18.Nc6  leads to quieter positions where play revolves around positional compensation for the exchange, whereas after  18.f4  it becomes a tactical free-for-all. There are also a couple of less critical options we need to discuss here.   17...a4  was played in Esipenko-Jones, IoM Fide Swiss 2019, but it's a bit too slow. }

4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ This line, often called the Russian System, has been an important weapon in White’s arsenal for quite some time. Botvinnik used it in his World Championship matches in the 50s, it was also heavily featured in Karpov-Kasparov matches, and its popularity never really waned.

8. Be3
{ Now we come to the two main moves in this position. This particular choice is a very modern one. Ian Nepomniachtchi used it to win an all-important game vs. MVL in Jerusalem 2019 which qualified him for the Candidates spot. Black needs to be very precise here.   The point of this move is to stop Black's two most natural sources of counterplay − much sting is taken out of Bg4 by further protecting the d4-pawn, and  8...e5  9.d5  is also not very attractive since White is much better prepared to meet  9...Nd4  there. }
8... Ng4
{ The most natural reply − the one thing that 8.Be3 definitely doesn't stop is this move, which will help Black trade the knight for the bishop on e3. }
9. e5
{ The point of the previous move. White is now committed to keeping the bishop on g7 under lock and key for as long as possible since the other typical Grünfeld source of counterplay − c5 − is hindered by Black's own knight on c6.   9.Rd1  Nxe3  10.fxe3  e5!  would absolutely defeat the purpose. }
9... Be6
{ It is important to time the capture on e3 properly, and playing this move first is crucial.   While the knight is still on g4, White cannot play  10.d5?  in view of  10...Ncxe5  . }
10. Qa4 Bd7
{ Continuing to hassle the queen and also moving the bishop away from e6, where it was somewhat in the way. }
11. Qb3
{ 11.Qa3  a5!  is a typical way of reacting to the queen appearing on a3. It makes the threat of the knight landing on b4 a lot more annoying. }
11... Na5
{ Once again, Black is at the crossroads here. I've chosen to suggest the riskier line, where Black goes for a pawn sacrifice to open some files for our rooks and is aiming to fight hard for the initiative.   But  11...Nxe3  12.fxe3  e6  is again quite playable, although the extra tempo White gains in comparison to the11.Rd1 line is quite important, and Black will have to be precise after both  13.h4  and  13.Ne4  . }
12. Qa3 c5
{ The point of the previous move − Black gives up the c-pawn for a couple of tempi and access to the c-file. }
13. Qxc5 Rc8 14. Qa3
{ 14.Qb4  Nxe3  15.fxe3  Bh6  is an inferior version of the same, the  queen is much more useful on a3, while the pawn on a7 is taboo.  Bad is @@StartFEN@@2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/6p1/n1Q1P3/3P2n1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 14@@EndFEN@@  14.Qxa7?  Ra8  15.Qc5  Nb3  and White loses material. }
14... Be6
{ It is also possible to play  14...Nxe3  15.fxe3  Bh6  here, but with the queen on a3 we're not actually threatening to take on e3 right away because of Nd5, attacking e3 and e7, which gives White some time to consolidate. I believe Black holds there, but I like the text solution better. Black is intending to play Nc4, White will be obliged to take that knight, and the bishop landing on c4 will make it very difficult for White to castle. }
15. Bc1
{ The only way to avoid the scenario I've just described − by moving the bishop back, White is preparing to grit their teeth and ignore the Nc4. I’m going to show you how we deal with that move, because it is the most principled, and our play in response is very indicative of general ideas here. White can, of course, try other moves here, but I believe the end result will be the same − we’re fine. }
15... Nc4 16. Qxa7 f6
{ With the white pieces basically on starting squares, it makes perfect sense to start blasting the position open.  Chessable note: how to conduct the initiative further can be seen in thecorresponding chapter. }

I will provide as much concrete info as I think is reasonable, but I would still encourage viewers to look at this line on their own after completing the chapter, to internalize the craziness that might happen here.

Chessable note: to see all the ramifications of this variation,check the corresponding chapter. }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4
{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }

{ White has three main moves here:  5.e3  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.Rc1  . The first two are by far the more important @@StartBracket@@and flow into each other quite often@@EndBracket@@, while  5.Rc1  has more or less been solved, as far as I'm concerned, and is almost never seen anymore in games by strong players. }

Doing it without h3 would invite Bg4! and Black's counterplay with Rd8 and possibly Nd4 later develops very naturally.   12.Nd4  should be met with  12...Bd7!  − there is no reason to give White some play along the e-file with  12...Nxd4  13.exd4!  followed by Re1. }
12... Bf5

15... Nxg5 16. Nxg5 Qd8
{ It’s important to take the e7-square under control.   A sample line to illustrate why  16...h6?  doesn't work.  17.Rxc6  bxc6  18.Ne7+  Kh8  19.Nxf7+  Kh7  20.Nxf5  gxf5  21.Qh5  and Black is lost due to White's mating construction  with Ng5+ and Qg6. }
17. h4
{ This idea, introduced in 2009, briefly revived this old line which used to be considered borderline unplayable due to  17.Nf3  e4  18.Nd2  Qg5  and Black's play is faster than anything White is doing. }
17... h6 18. g4 Bd7 19. Ne4 Qxh4 20. f3
{ This is the point of 17.h4!? − by giving up on h4, White establishes a very nice pair of knights, and is planning to play Rf2-h2 and then launch a direct attack on the black king. However, by playing energetically and challenging the white setup, Black equalizes. }
20... Kh8

When g4 was first introduced, my initial reaction was − what kind of a crazy idea is this, why is White so happy to be ruining the structure on the Q-side for one seemingly insignificant tempo? But after you spend a short while on it, you realize how sound the main point is.  White is indeed compromising their position a bit, but Black will be on the run for quite a while as a result. The bishop either has to go all the way back to c8, disrupting the carefully built connections, or to d7 where it will give White additional tempi with Rd1-d5. All in all, this isdangerous line, requiring a lot of precision from us. }

However, in the 1990s, at least in part due to my efforts, the idea of leaving our central pawn en prise began to take hold. }
4... Bg7
{ The closest I've ever come to having a titular line in the Grünfeld − I wasn't the first to play this move, but access to information in the early 90s St. Petersburg was quite problematic, and I did think of it and the ideas behind it, on my own.  The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement. It should also be noted that in case of  5.Nf3  ,  we're transposing back into normal Ne4 territory.

This move has been around for a while but only gained serious traction around 2011-12, when Topalov and Giri played it.

Our plan here is quite clear − we're driving the pawn forward to d5, immediately undermining it with c6, and since White is still going to castle queenside, we will be using the open c-file to try to generate counterplay against White's king. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3
{ This is a very central line in the @@StartBracket@@Anti?@@EndBracket@@Grünfeld these days. White is trying to aggressively fight for the center, and depending on how Black replies, play can become incredibly concrete and sharp. Black has the option of abandoning the Grünfeld and switching to King's Indian with  3...Bg7  4.e4  d6  , or Benoni-type play with  3...c5  − but that would be off-brand for me and this course. We're playing  3...d5  come hell or high water.  The line probably started life as an Anti-Grünfeld since Grünfeld proper starts from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3.Nc3  d5  , and it was seen as a way not to let us play our favorite opening. However, it has become one of the absolute main lines of the opening, and everyone just calls it the 3.f3 Grünfeld these days. }
3... d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4
{ One of the points of 3.f3 is that with the white knight still on b1, we have to retreat the knight from d5, instead of trading. }
5... Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2
{ To some degree, the only move White makes here. By playing 3.f3, White players make the normal development somewhat tricky, pretty much locking themselves into an ultra-aggressive plan involving castling queenside and launching the h-pawn up the board. }
8... e5
{ This is a switch from  8...Nc6  I recommended back when I did the chess24 course.  I've always been wary of entering this line, thinking it was a little bit too memory-heavy. But over the years, the Nc6 lines became, if anything, even more bloated with long forcing lines, and for this course, I decided to finally bite the bullet and delve into 8...e5.  Our plan here is quite clear − we're driving the pawn forward to d5, immediately undermining it with c6, and since White is still going to castle queenside, we will be using the open c-file to try to generate counterplay against White's king. }
9. d5 c6 10. h4
{ It's important for White to begin with this as aftercastling queenside, we have more options. }
10... cxd5 11. exd5 N8d7
{ With White keeping the king on e1 for now, our Nb8 is much more needed on f6, where it will bolster the kingside, and also support the e5-e4 play which becomes crucial pretty soon. }
12. h5
{ It definitely makes sense for White to open the h-file before castling. }
12... Nf6 13. hxg6 fxg6 14. O-O-O { White needs to finish development first. }
14... Bd7 15. Kb1 Rc8
{ This is pretty much where the game starts these days in the 8...e5 line, but it does explode into branches from here. Black's plan stays consistent though − we will be playing e5-e4 as soon as possible, activating the Bg7, and aiming to generate as much piece play as possible. Na4 is also a very typical resource, distracting White from kingside plans, and introducing Qa5. }
16. Ka1
{ Probably the quietest of the lines here, often leading straight into equal endgames. }
16... e4 17. Bd4 { 17.d6  transposes to the16.d6 variation. } 17... Na4
{ Continuing to attack White's setup, and now we have some forced lines. } 18.
d6 Nxc3 19. Bxc3 Qb6
{ Gives Black an easy game since White is still somewhat undeveloped, and we have ideas of e3 and, in some cases, even Rxc3 to start breaking open the long diagonal for Bg7. }

{ This is a very central line in the @@StartBracket@@Anti?@@EndBracket@@Grünfeld these days. White is trying to aggressively fight for the center, and depending on how Black replies, play can become incredibly concrete and sharp. Black has the option of abandoning the Grünfeld and switching to King's Indian with  3...Bg7  4.e4  d6  , or Benoni-type play with  3...c5  − but that would be off-brand for me and this course. We're playing  3...d5  come hell or high water.  The line probably started life as an Anti-Grünfeld since Grünfeld proper starts from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3.Nc3  d5  , and it was seen as a way not to let us play our favorite opening.

3... d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4

5... Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2
{ To some degree, the only move White makes here. By playing 3.f3, White players make the normal development somewhat tricky, pretty much locking themselves into an ultra-aggressive plan involving castling queenside and launching the h-pawn up the board. }
8... e5
{ This is a switch from  8...Nc6  I recommended back when I did the chess24 course.  I've always been wary of entering this line, thinking it was a little bit too memory-heavy. But over the years, the Nc6 lines became, if anything, even more bloated with long forcing lines, and for this course, I decided to finally bite the bullet and delve into 8...e5.  Our plan here is quite clear − we're driving the pawn forward to d5, immediately undermining it with c6, and since White is still going to castle queenside, we will be using the open c-file to try to generate counterplay against White's king. }
9. d5 c6 10. h4
{ It's important for White to begin with this as aftercastling queenside, we have more options. }
10... cxd5 11. exd5 N8d7

12. h5
{ It definitely makes sense for White to open the h-file before castling. }
12... Nf6 13. hxg6 fxg6 14. O-O-O { White needs to finish development first. }
14... Bd7 15. Kb1 Rc8
{ This is pretty much where the game starts these days in the 8...e5 line, but it does explode into branches from here. Black's plan stays consistent though − we will be playing e5-e4 as soon as possible, activating the Bg7, and aiming to generate as much piece play as possible. Na4 is also a very typical resource, distracting White from kingside plans, and introducing Qa5. }
16. d6 e4
{ Our usual starting point − here White not only can, but in fact should accept this pawn sac. The fact that the Ng1 can go to f3, and the a2-g8 diagonal is open, makes a huge difference. }

{ A logical move, but Black's advantage in development is quite telling. }
17... Na4 18. Nd5

{ One of the points of 3.f3 is that with the white knight still on b1, we have to retreat the knight from d5, instead of trading. }
5... Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2
{ To some degree, the only move White makes here. By playing 3.f3, White players make the normal development somewhat tricky, pretty much locking themselves into an ultra-aggressive plan involving castling queenside and launching the h-pawn up the board. }
8... e5
{ This is a switch from  8...Nc6  I recommended back when I did the chess24 course.  I've always been wary of entering this line, thinking it was a little bit too memory-heavy. But over the years, the Nc6 lines became, if anything, even more bloated with long forcing lines, and for this course, I decided to finally bite the bullet and delve into 8...e5.  Our plan here is quite clear − we're driving the pawn forward to d5, immediately undermining it with c6, and since White is still going to castle queenside, we will be using the open c-file to try to generate counterplay against White's king. }
9. d5 c6 10. h4
{ It's important for White to begin with this as aftercastling queenside, we have more options. }
10... cxd5 11. exd5 N8d7
{ With White keeping the king on e1 for now, our Nb8 is much more needed on f6, where it will bolster the kingside, and also support the e5-e4 play which becomes crucial pretty soon. }
12. h5
{ It definitely makes sense for White to open the h-file before castling. }
12... Nf6 13. hxg6 fxg6 14. O-O-O { White needs to finish development first. }
14... Bd7 15. Kb1 Rc8
{ This is pretty much where the game starts these days in the 8...e5 line, but it does explode into branches from here. Black's plan stays consistent though − we will be playing e5-e4 as soon as possible, activating the Bg7, and aiming to generate as much piece play as possible. Na4 is also a very typical resource, distracting White from kingside plans, and introducing Qa5. }
16. d6 e4
{ Our usual starting point − here White not only can, but in fact should accept this pawn sac. The fact that the Ng1 can go to f3, and the a2-g8 diagonal is open, makes a huge difference. }
17. fxe4 Ng4 18. Bg5
{ White needs to lure the queen away from Na4/Qa5 counterplay, especially since this is being done with tempo, aiming the bishop at e7. }
18... Qe8 19. Nf3 { 19.Be7?  Nf2  is wrong. } 19... Rf7
{ An important quiet move, preparing for the eventual Be7, while also closing down the a2-g8 diagonal which might be useful to deny white checks later. Another useful facet of this move is the fact that we often want to play Ne5 next, and by moving the rook away from f8 we're getting ready to reply to Bh6 by moving our most important piece, the Bg7, out of the way of trades. Play becomes incredibly concrete here, so you will want to acquaint yourselves quite well with these lines. }
20. Qe1
{ Is a move with a similar idea as the move 20.Re1 − aim for the e-pawn push. However, there is one important difference. }
20... Rc5
{ Meeting the threat of e5. The move  20...Ne5  in the analogy to the Re1 line, is also playable.  21.Nxe5  Bxe5  but I prefer the rook move.   Also note that after  21...Qxe5  White can play  22.Be3  aiming for Bd4 next, something that was not possible with the queen on d2 instead of the rook on d1. This poses Black problems. }
21. Bd2 Be6 22. e5
{ Daniel Barrish ends his chapter here, correctly noting that Ding won a model game vs. Mamedyarov from this position in Stavanger 2019. Shakh's play can be improved on, though. }
22... Na4 23. Rc1 Nxb2
{ I like this very direct idea the most, although Black has a similar option in  23...Bxe5  24.Ng5  Nxb2  , which is also viable. }
24. Kxb2
{ White can include  24.Qh4  h5  here but it doesn't change much. Play won't have much to do with the K-side from now on. }
24... Nxe5
{ Despite having only one pawn for the piece, Black has such tremendously active pieces and White such an open king, that Black is fine here even without immediate threats.   As a possible continuation,  25.Rh4  makes sense to try to include the rook in the defense along the 4th rank,  25...Qd7  26.Be3  Nxf3  27.gxf3  Re5  and Black has great play for the sacrificed piece. }

However, in 2019 Alexander Grischuk went on a long streak of playing this any chance he got against 2750+ opposition, which finally made people sit up and take notice.  The line is so serious that I will be recommending something I normally avoid − switching to a different opening. I couldn't make any of the attempts to continue playing the Grünfeld here work, so we will be switching to the King's Indian structures instead. I will also note, for those of you looking for additional options here, that I suspect the switch to the Benko with  3...c5  4.d5  b5  should be playable, but I don't feel comfortable enough with those positions to recommend them. }

I will also note, for those of you looking for additional options here, that I suspect the switch to the Benko with  3...c5  4.d5  b5  should be playable, but I don't feel comfortable enough with those positions to recommend them. }
3... Bg7
{ For the safety-minded, I will mention that  3...c6  4.Nc3  d5  , which most likely leads to exchange-Slav type positions, exists as a backup plan − but this is most assuredly not why we're here. }
4. Nc3 Nc6
{ I like it slightly better than  4...d6  since this move order makes it less attractive for White to play  5.e4  , which is definitely his preferred next move.  The downside, of course, is that White will have the option of attacking it with d5 at any point in the near future − but that also gives us a target for counterplay in the center, since the pawn on d5 can easily be undermined with e6 and c6. This recommendation does come with a warning. The lines I'm about to give are riskier than I would normally suggest, play in general becomes extremely sharp, and the price of mistakes grows. However, I felt that the spirit of adventure White shows in playing 3.h4 should be acknowledged, and responded to in kind.   4...d6  5.e4  Nc6  6.Nge2  is the specific reason I'm suggesting we start with  4...Nc6  . This line, in my opinion, is a decent version of the Saemisch for White, and the one elite-level game played from here, Grischuk vs MVL 2019, proved that. }
5. Nf3
{ A logical move, fighting for central control before playing e4. But it's also a bit of an achievement for us since White would generally prefer to develop along the Saemisch lines here, with f3, Nge2 and Be3, and we've prevented that. }
5... d6 6. d5
{ Here in particular, we have to be very precise in our reply to d5. White will be aggressively trying to punish us for floating a couple of tempi for the sake of provoking targets for counterplay in the center. And the fact that h4 has been played can be both a problem and an asset − access to g4 is good for us, but we also constantly have to reckon with the h-file getting opened if we castle short too early. }
6... Nb8 7. e4 e6
{ We need to open up the center as fast as possible here. Our plan is to play O-O, take on d5, play Re8, and then continue hitting the pawn on d5 with c6 if White recaptures with the c-pawn. The b8-knight is going to be aiming at the c5 square via a6 or d7. }
8. Be2 O-O
{ I'm suggesting we castle 'into the storm' here, so to speak. By postponing the capture on d5, we maintain the tension in the center, making it harder for White to settle on a plan. }
9. dxe6
{ An important alternative here, using the fact that Black has already castled while White hasn't yet, to redefine the structure in the center and start pushing the opening of the K-side. }
9... Bxe6 10. Nd4 Qe8
{ It took me some time to figure out why the machine is so happy to make this weird-looking move over putting the rook on that very natural square, but I think I can explain it. The rook belongs on f8, to support Nh5-f4 later, and the queen will go to e5 in a lot of cases.   The natural  10...Re8  is worse after  11.h5  Nc6  12.Nxe6  Rxe6  13.hxg6  fxg6  14.Be3  when  the e4-pawn is taboo due to a check on d5 at the end of the line. }
11. h5
{ The point of previous play − White is banking on superior development to try launching an attack on the K-side. }
11... Nc6 12. Be3
{ Here,  12.Nxe6  Qxe6  13.hxg6  fxg6  is a whole different landscape.  The queen does an excellent job attacking e4, while the rook is well placed on f8 as well.  The line could continue  14.f3  Qe5!?  with active play for Black. }
12... Bd7 { We're attacking the e4-pawn. } 13. hxg6
{ We're ready to recapture fxg6, opening up the f-file for our dormant Rf8.  13.f3  would allow  13...Nxh5  . }
13... fxg6 14. f3 Nh5 { Ng3, Nf4, and even Qe5 are all legitimate ideas here. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. h4
{ This line, championed by the esteemed Chessable stalwart Simon GingerGM Williams from the late 2000s, was first played at the elite level by Veselin Topalov in the 2016 Candidates, and then promptly written off as something he'd only done because he was bored and wanted the tournament to end. However, in 2019 Alexander Grischuk went on a long streak of playing this any chance he got against 2750+ opposition, which finally made people sit up and take notice.  The line is so serious that I will be recommending something I normally avoid − switching to a different opening. I couldn't make any of the attempts to continue playing the Grünfeld here work, so we will be switching to the King's Indian structures instead. I will also note, for those of you looking for additional options here, that I suspect the switch to the Benko with  3...c5  4.d5  b5  should be playable, but I don't feel comfortable enough with those positions to recommend them. }
3... Bg7
{ For the safety-minded, I will mention that  3...c6  4.Nc3  d5  , which most likely leads to exchange-Slav type positions, exists as a backup plan − but this is most assuredly not why we're here. }
4. Nc3 Nc6
{ I like it slightly better than  4...d6  since this move order makes it less attractive for White to play  5.e4  , which is definitely his preferred next move.  The downside, of course, is that White will have the option of attacking it with d5 at any point in the near future − but that also gives us a target for counterplay in the center, since the pawn on d5 can easily be undermined with e6 and c6. This recommendation does come with a warning. The lines I'm about to give are riskier than I would normally suggest, play in general becomes extremely sharp, and the price of mistakes grows. However, I felt that the spirit of adventure White shows in playing 3.h4 should be acknowledged, and responded to in kind.   4...d6  5.e4  Nc6  6.Nge2  is the specific reason I'm suggesting we start with  4...Nc6  . This line, in my opinion, is a decent version of the Saemisch for White, and the one elite-level game played from here, Grischuk vs MVL 2019, proved that. }
5. d5 Ne5 6. e4 d6

7. Be2 c6 { Starting to dig into the white center. } 8. Nf3
{ 8.h5?!  Nxh5  is good for us since the king is still on e8, and we're not very worried about semi-opening the h-file. The white center will start crumbling without Be2 protecting c4. }

10. O-O O-O { Now we can castle. } 11. Be3 { Or  11.Bg5  h6  12.Be3  h5  . }
11... h5
{ I believe this is a pretty decent position for Black. White has more space, but we have potential for counterplay on the Q-side with Qa5 and Rac8, and a very nice g4-square for our pieces, which we will most likely be using to trade light-squared bishops. Play could continue: }
12. Rc1 Bg4 13. b3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Qa5 15. Bd2 Rac8
{ White has a bit more space here, but our structure is quite fluid, and we have a very nice g4-square for the knight. Our plans could include Rfe8 and e6, or Qa6, trying to find a good moment to push b5, or provoke a4 to have some play against the b3-pawn with Nd7-c5. }

We should also note that it's possible to play  5...dxc4  6.Qxc4  Bg7  which, in a majority of games, led to positions we will look at later in the7.Qb3 chapter, after  7.Nf3  O-O  8.O-O  Bf5  . }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3
{ The g3 systems vs. the Grünfeld are never entirely out of fashion, due to their  (deserved)  reputation for being almost entirely risk-free, if White wants, while also providing a decent chance for an opening edge if Black isn’t careful. Over the years, most top players played them. Kasparov himself chose it more than once against those foolhardy enough to play his favorite opening against him.  In response, we have to choose the structure we want. For quite some time, I felt submitting to White’s will and playing the symmetrical lines where Black plays c6 and d5 was too boring and tried making the sharper lines without c6 work − but I no longer fear boredom, and neither should you. The c6 lines provide Black with much more reliable equality, I believe − and you can still play for a win if White players choose to be adventurous in their search for advantage. }
4... c6 5. Bg2 { By far the best move. White can't really do without it here. }
5... d5 6. O-O O-O 7. b3
{ 7.b3 is one of the more critical tries in this position. It’s a very logical move − White protects the c4-pawn and plans to develop the bishop to b2, further discouraging our potential counterplay in the center. This is why, for as long as I can remember, my preferred solution here has been to challenge the white center straight away, before the bishop gets to the long diagonal. }
7... dxc4 8. bxc4 c5
{ This looks odd − we just played c6 and now we’re moving that pawn again. But being able to attack the white structure, and re-opening up the c6-square for our knight, are of more importance here. }
9. Bb2 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6
{ This is the starting position of the 7...dxc4/8...c5 line. White has numerous options here, but Black's general plan is almost always the same: we want to play Nc6, either immediately or after preparing it with Bd7, then the rooks go to d8 and c8, and we're ready to react to whatever White decides to throw at us. Let's look at possible continuations. }
11. Qb3
{ Is arguably the most concrete move White has here and Black can definitely go wrong. If we give White time to set up with Rd1 and Nc3, the monster bishop on g2 will be the most relevant factor. We begin by attacking the knight on d4. }
11... Nfd7 12. e3 e5
{ This is an important move.   The naive  12...Nc6  runs into a very strong reply:  13.Nc3!  ,  giving up the pawn on d4 to get Nd5 with tempo, and Black is in trouble. }
13. Nb5 Nc5 14. Qa3 Be6
{ Once again, the attack on the c4-pawn comes in just in time to prevent Nb1-c3-d5. }
15. Nd2 Rd8 16. Bc3
{ 16.Rfd1  Nc6  was seen in MVL-Giri and Black had no issues since he is ready to play Bf8 next move, beginning to harass the Qa3. }
16... Rd7
{ This position is very sharp, but Black is fine with accurate play. } 17. Rab1
Bf5
{ This is the move you have to be aware of in advance. We're attacking the rook on b1, but also, very importantly, we're creating squares for our queen to escape to in case of future Ba5. For example  17...Nba6  18.Ba5  . }
18. Ba5
{ 18.Rb2?  Nba6  19.Ba5  Qe6  is exactly why Bf5 was so important on the previous move.   18.e4?!  Be6  is another illustration:  by closing down the Bg2, White killed off most of their play, and Black safely finishes development now that the queen can go to c6 when attacked. }
18... Qa6 19. Qxc5 Qxa5 20. Qc8+ Bf8
{ And once again, this only looks scary. White should take a draw here. } 21.
Ne4
{ 21.Bxb7  Re7!  is not good since White has no good way of protecting that bishop once the queen gets driven away. }
21... Re7 22. Nf6+
{ 22.Qc5  Nc6  and once Black finishes development, there is nothing to worry about. }
22... Kg7
{ After  23.Nh5+  Kg8  24.Nf6+  Kg7  − there have already been a few draws like this. }

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

{ The idea here is quite obvious − White is trying to prevent us from playing c5 next move, and generally make it as hard and as awkward as possible. There’s a large downside to it, though: the bishop is misplaced on a3 and we have a very natural way of pushing for c5 anyway. }
7... Nd7

{ This is a surprisingly tricky line to face and I suspect it might be enjoying a serious revival. It has already been played by a number of high-profile GMs last year, and not without success, either.   White's idea is to mess with Black's normal development plan of playing c5 and Nc6. If we chose  7...Bd7  here, after  8.Be2  White switches back to playing  the Nf3/Rb1 type setups, but with the bishop on d7, where it gets in the way of our pressure against the d4-pawn − also, the b7-pawn is unprotected.  And in case of @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/1B6/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7...c6  ... }
7... c6 8. Ba4
{ In essence, White players are trying to play theClassical 7.Bc4 line here, but with the bishop on a4 instead. That gives them some bonus options later, such as a capture of our knight on c6 on tap, and the fact that we don't have the Na5/Ne5 tempi if the knight is driven away from c6. However, the fact that our pawn is on c6, for now, gives us the b5-b4 counterplay we normally don't have any access to. }
8... O-O
{ I think it's very smart here to castle before we play b5, and wait for White to decide exactly where the Ng1 is getting developed.   8...b5  9.Bb3  a5  is an extremely topical position, Dubov-Nepo and Nakamura-Nepo bearing witness to that, but I like this move order more. }
9. Ne2 b5 { Now it's time − the knight has been committed to e2. } 10. Bb3 Bb7

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

25. Rxb7 Nxe5 26. dxe7 Nxf3+ 27. gxf3 Re8

15... Qa3
{ I'm no longer recommending  15...b6  here.  As I also state in the13.Bg5 line where this choice comes up, I don't think Black loses there, but I'm not entirely sure we make a forced draw, either, and I think Qa3 is a better all-round option for us. }
16. Re1
{ This is the most recent try for White − in 2020, Magnus himself played this against Nepo. Black is fine though. }
16... Bxf3 17. gxf3
{ My Mega Database suggests this is a novelty, but my more learned friends informed me that this move is being played in correspondence chess, and that's always a signal to sit up and take notice. A lot of very deep-opening innovations are being done in that scene.  The biggest reason for this move is to stop exactly what we were planning to do against  17.Bxf3  −  with White having access to f3-f4, we can't really play Be5 anymore. Additionally, the Na5 is still in jail since the c4-square is being kept under control. }
17... Rfc8
{ I like this move the most, but I will note that  17...a6  is also playable and is also a mess. }
18. Bf1
{ This is probably the most critical try − White is pushing to play e5, and having access to Re3 is also quite useful.   An important other option to keep in mind is  18.f4  Bc3!  It's very useful to drive the rook back to  f1  .  19.Rf1  Bf6!  and we're OK after the bishop trade. }
18... Bc3 19. Re3 Nc4
{ It's way more important to trade off our stupid knight than it would be to keep the pawns alive. }
20. Bxc4 Rxc4 21. Rb3
{ In case of  21.Rxb7  the engine suggests  21...Qa6!  22.Rxe7  Bf6!  23.Bxf6  Qxf6  24.Rb7  a5!  and our passer, combined with the counterplay against the weakened white kind, compensate for the pawn quite well. }
21... Qc5 22. Bxe7 Qxe7 23. Rexc3 Rxc3 24. Rxc3 a5
{ Once again we'll have to rely  (successfully)  on our 'a' passer, and the slightly unsafe white king, to bail us out in the fight vs. the central pawns. }

9... cxd4 10. cxd4 Qa5+ 11. Bd2 Qxa2 12. O-O

I still think Black is more likely to hold than not in the exchange-down endgames after  17.Bxe7  Rfe8  18.d6  Nc6  19.Bb5  , but I came up short trying to find secure ways to nail down the draw there. The line I'm proposing will also lead to positions that look scary, but I believe this is a cleaner way to make a more or less forced draw. }
17. e5
{ The only way to make progress.   17.Rb4  Rfc8  18.Ra4  Qb3  with the usual fork with b6, in the end, is completely safe for Black. }
17... Bxe5 18. Rb4 Bxf3 19. Bxf3 Rfc8
{ This is an improvement over the old approach of  19...Rae8  20.Be3!  − this is the whole point, White is back to threatening Ra4 by moving the bishop away from the b6-fork, while also attacking h6. Here, Black has to play  20...Nc4  21.Bxh6  Nd6  , giving up the exchange but establishing a decent dark-squared blockade. However, I am not 100% sure this holds. }
20. Bxe7 Rc4
{ This is the point. We've given up the e7-pawn, which is very panic-inducing in these lines, but we're also quite active now, and will either get a pair of rooks off the board or get to play Rd4 if White tries to avoid the trade. The lines are still very forced, but I believe this is a draw. }
21. h4 h5 { Allowing White to play h5 would be unwise. } 22. g3
{ 22.Re1  is the same here as on 21st move:  22...Rxb4  23.Bxb4  Nc4  24.d6  Qb2  25.d7  Qxb4  26.d8Q+  Rxd8  27.Qxd8+  Kg7  . }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

{ This line, which in my mind I always called The Classical Grünfeld, has been a mainstay for White players for a very long time. Botvinnik played it in his title matches against Smyslov. Spassky won a number of brilliant games in it, including a famous win against Fischer at the 1970 Olympiad in Siegen. It has also been a very important topic of discussion in the Karpov-Kasparov matches.  In the new Millenium, its popularity was on the decline, but in the last couple of years, White players started returning to it, arguably due to the influence of Alpha Zero and other Neural Network engines, and their love for pushing the h-pawn forward in every possible position.  The basic idea of this move is to get the bishop out of the way so that White can develop the knight to e2, not f3, leaving the f2-pawn free to march up the board, if necessary, and also protecting the knight from the Bg4 pin which Black often employs when that knight is developed to f3. }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

{ This line, which in my mind I always called The Classical Grünfeld, has been a mainstay for White players for a very long time. Botvinnik played it in his title matches against Smyslov. Spassky won a number of brilliant games in it, including a famous win against Fischer at the 1970 Olympiad in Siegen. It has also been a very important topic of discussion in the Karpov-Kasparov matches.  In the new Millenium, its popularity was on the decline, but in the last couple of years, White players started returning to it, arguably due to the influence of Alpha Zero and other Neural Network engines, and their love for pushing the h-pawn forward in every possible position.  The basic idea of this move is to get the bishop out of the way so that White can develop the knight to e2, not f3, leaving the f2-pawn free to march up the board, if necessary, and also protecting the knight from the Bg4 pin which Black often employs when that knight is developed to f3. }

The basic idea of this move is to get the bishop out of the way so that White can develop the knight to e2, not f3, leaving the f2-pawn free to march up the board, if necessary, and also protecting the knight from the Bg4 pin which Black often employs when that knight is developed to f3. }

It has also been a very important topic of discussion in the Karpov-Kasparov matches.  In the new Millenium, its popularity was on the decline, but in the last couple of years, White players started returning to it, arguably due to the influence of Alpha Zero and other Neural Network engines, and their love for pushing the h-pawn forward in every possible position.  The basic idea of this move is to get the bishop out of the way so that White can develop the knight to e2, not f3, leaving the f2-pawn free to march up the board, if necessary, and also protecting the knight from the Bg4 pin which Black often employs when that knight is developed to f3. }

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

It has also been a very important topic of discussion in the Karpov-Kasparov matches.  In the new Millenium, its popularity was on the decline, but in the last couple of years, White players started returning to it, arguably due to the influence of Alpha Zero and other Neural Network engines, and their love for pushing the h-pawn forward in every possible position.  The basic idea of this move is to get the bishop out of the way so that White can develop the knight to e2, not f3, leaving the f2-pawn free to march up the board, if necessary, and also protecting the knight from the Bg4 pin which Black often employs when that knight is developed to f3. }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

{ This line, which in my mind I always called The Classical Grünfeld, has been a mainstay for White players for a very long time. Botvinnik played it in his title matches against Smyslov. Spassky won a number of brilliant games in it, including a famous win against Fischer at the 1970 Olympiad in Siegen. It has also been a very important topic of discussion in the Karpov-Kasparov matches.  In the new Millenium, its popularity was on the decline, but in the last couple of years, White players started returning to it, arguably due to the influence of Alpha Zero and other Neural Network engines, and their love for pushing the h-pawn forward in every possible position.  The basic idea of this move is to get the bishop out of the way so that White can develop the knight to e2, not f3, leaving the f2-pawn free to march up the board, if necessary, and also protecting the knight from the Bg4 pin which Black often employs when that knight is developed to f3. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{ 7.Be3 is very logical − by playing this move, followed by Qd2, White is aiming to prepare as solidly as possible for our typical counterplay against the d4-pawn and along the long diagonal.  It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.  In view of that, I’m quite happy with the chosen solution for this course − it features as few of those positions as possible, and the main line is in fact one of the maddest lines of the entire series. }

12. Bd4

12... Bg4
{ The immediate  12...Bd7  is also possible,  but provoking f3 limits White's choices even further by cutting off the possible squares for Ng1. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{ 7.Be3 is very logical − by playing this move, followed by Qd2, White is aiming to prepare as solidly as possible for our typical counterplay against the d4-pawn and along the long diagonal.  It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.  In view of that, I’m quite happy with the chosen solution for this course − it features as few of those positions as possible, and the main line is in fact one of the maddest lines of the entire series. }
7... c5 8. Qd2 { The easiest to deal with − we have a very direct response. }
8... cxd4 9. cxd4 Nc6
{ White can't react to the challenge to the d4-pawn in a way they would like to − by playing d4-d5, and this gives us a very useful tempo gain. }
10. Nf3 Bg4 11. Rd1 O-O 12. Be2
{ Now the easiest way to equalize is to get the queens off the board. } 12...
Qa5 13. O-O Rac8
{ The queens will get traded, but we can wait for a move and bring more pieces into play. }
14. h3 Bxf3
{ 14...Bd7  is also playable, but trading the  knight and then using the pressure on the d4-pawn, combined with Na5-c4 ideas, is simpler here. }
15. gxf3
{ A very rare, but quite decent alternative here, trying to keep control over the c4 square, taking the sting out of our Na5-c4 play. We should react very energetically to it − the approach I like the most here involves a pawn sacrifice. }
15... Rfd8 16. Qxa5 { 16.d5  Bc3! } 16... Nxa5 17. d5 Nc4
{ We need to play this move before White has time to reestablish control with Rc1. }

{ 19.Bxc4  Rxa7  and since  20.f4  runs into  20...Bh6  ,  we will be able to put a clamp on the dark squares with Be5. }
19... Nd6
{ Our counterplay against the a2-pawn, combined with ideas of Rdc8, Be5 and f5, gives us enough compensation for the pawn. }

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.  In view of that, I’m quite happy with the chosen solution for this course − it features as few of those positions as possible, and the main line is in fact one of the maddest lines of the entire series. }

It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames.

But White will most likely be in time to occupy the center with f4 and e5 by that point, rendering our push quite weak. Because of that, I would suggest a different plan − we want to let our bishop out with Bc3 and then lock the door behind it with e5, establishing a very solid construction in the center. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{ 7.Be3 is very logical − by playing this move, followed by Qd2, White is aiming to prepare as solidly as possible for our typical counterplay against the d4-pawn and along the long diagonal.  It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.  In view of that, I’m quite happy with the chosen solution for this course − it features as few of those positions as possible, and the main line is in fact one of the maddest lines of the entire series. }
7... c5 8. Nf3
{ 8.Nf3 is by far the main move here since White will be developing the knight to f3 in a vast majority of cases in the 7.Be3 line. It makes sense to play this before you commit to anything else.

We're also often interested in playing c5-c4 ourselves, especially if we can make sure White can't reply to it by getting the knight from f3 to c6 straight away.

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{ 7.Be3 is very logical − by playing this move, followed by Qd2, White is aiming to prepare as solidly as possible for our typical counterplay against the d4-pawn and along the long diagonal.  It is probably my least favorite of all the options at White’s disposal against the Grünfeld, mainly due to the fact that Black is often obliged to defend cheerless, and not always even easily solvable, endgames. The queen trade with Qa5/Qd2/cxd4 is a staple of the line.  In view of that, I’m quite happy with the chosen solution for this course − it features as few of those positions as possible, and the main line is in fact one of the maddest lines of the entire series. }
7... c5 8. Nf3
{ 8.Nf3 is by far the main move here since White will be developing the knight to f3 in a vast majority of cases in the 7.Be3 line. It makes sense to play this before you commit to anything else. If White gets to play Be2 and O-O without even having to spend time on Qd2/Rc1 − so much the better! Our task here is to make sure we don’t give White that luxury. }
8... Qa5 9. Qd2 O-O
{ We're choosing this line here to keep our options uniform for both 8.Nf3 and 8.Rc1. In this particular move order,  9...Nc6  10.Rb1  a6  11.Rc1  cxd4  12.cxd4  Qxd2  13.Kxd2  e6  or @@StartFEN@@r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/q1p5/3PP3/2P1BN2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 10@@EndFEN@@  10.Rc1  cxd4  11.cxd4  Qxd2  12.Kxd2  O-O  is a very valid alternative, but the resulting endgames don't offer Black much in a way of 'fun' − just equality. }
10. Rc1
{ The main line here − White needs to have the option of meeting Nc6 or Rd8 with d5. }
10... Bg4
{ This is the hyper-trendy line that has seen a number of exciting high-profile games in 2020, especially where Ian Nepomniachtchi was involved. Play will soon become extremely sharp and concrete. }
11. d5 b5
{ The justification for the choice of Bg4 is this striking pawn sacrifice. White wanted to continue improving in the center by playing c3-c4, and we're actively fighting against it − with the pawn on b5, c4 will almost always be met with b4, establishing an important foothold on the queenside for the future.   We're also often interested in playing c5-c4 ourselves, especially if we can make sure White can't reply to it by getting the knight from f3 to c6 straight away. All of these good things come at a price, of course − we must have a good reply to  12.Bxc5  . }
12. Bxc5 Rc8
{ The beginning of one of the wildest lines in modern Grünfeld theory, and there have been some absolutely epic games played in it recently. Let's try to figure out what we can expect. We're already a pawn down @@StartBracket@@and it's nowhere near the limit here, so be prepared!@@EndBracket@@.  But by taking on c5, White opened up the c-file, and will now have to worry about the c3-pawn constantly. White's king is also stuck in the center. However, it should be fairly obvious that we have to play extremely energetically here because allowing White to finish development will most likely have lethal consequences. }
13. Bb4 Qc7
{ Remarkably, Ian Nepomniachtchi once played  13...Qb6  and ended up not even losing!  The queen needs to go to c7 so that the threat of a5 will have to be addressed. }
14. Nd4 a5 15. Ba3
{ The only move, since  15.Nxb5?  Qe5!  allows us to win  the e4-pawn with check. }

{ If White goes for  16.cxb4  Qe5  17.Rxc8+  Bxc8  18.Qc2  Qxd4  19.Qxc8+  Bf8  , a peaceful end of the game could be  20.Qc4  Qa1+  21.Qc1  Qd4  with a repetition after  22.Qc4  Qa1+  . }
16... Qb6
{ Sidestepping the cxb4 ideas and putting White's setup under pressure again, with threats of bxc3. }
17. Bb5 { The main line. } 17... e5
{ We need to break up White's center.  17...Bxd4?  18.Qxd4  Qxb5?  19.c4!  with mate on h8 to follow would be an amusing way to lose by force. }
18. dxe6 Bxe6

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. e3 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2
{ This unassuming line has been briefly brought into the limelight by Shah Mamedyarov around 2012. If Black players refuse to engage with the forcing continuations, they could end up having to play somewhat cramped positions − but the direct central counterplay, so natural to any Grünfeld player, gives Black a good game. }
6... c5
{ There are slower options, but why bother when you can do proper Grünfeld things instead. }
7. dxc5 { Allowing cxd4 would give Black instant equality. } 7... dxc4
{ The pawn on c4 is not long for this word, but as usual, Black will have plenty of play for it. The bishop on g7 can enjoy a much more open long diagonal and the pawn on c5 will come under sustained pressure. In some cases, Black will have to accept winning the c5-pawn back by allowing c6 bxc6 − but this normally only gives him additional avenues of counterplay by opening the b-file for the a8-rook. }
8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Bxc4 Nbd7
{ This position is completely harmless: the pawn gets reclaimed and Black is generally much more active in the resulting endgames, easily compensating for the 'weakness' on c6. }
10. Ng5
{ Trying to distract the knight from d7 and save the c5-pawn that way, might even be a bit risky for White. }
10... Ne5 { Combining defense and attack. } 11. Be2
{ Now Black gets a very good game by playing forcefully and gaining a lot of time attacking White's exposed targets. }
11... h6 { Driving the knight back. } 12. Nf3 Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3
{ Now Black re-establishes control by a clever bit of re-routing. } 13... Nd7
14. Na4 { 14.c6  Ne5!  is very good for Black. } 14... Ne5

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Nf3 Bg7 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg5 c5 7. Rc1 Nxc3 8. bxc3 O-O
{ 8...Qa5  9.Qd2  Bf5  , but White has an explosive idea here:  10.e4!  Bxe4  11.Qe3  and while Black probably survives, this is a little bit too tricky for a safe sideline. }
9. e3
{ Compared to a lot of the lines we've discussed so far in this chapter, this is quite risky for Black strategically, because the c1-bishop is unchained for a change. Therefore, we must play energetically. }
9... Be6 10. Qd2 Nc6 11. Be2 { And now we accelerate. } 11... h6 12. Bh4 cxd4
13. cxd4 g5 14. Bg3 Qa5
{ Attacking the pawn on a2 and preparing to fight for the c-file if White trades the queens. }
15. h4 g4
{ 15...Qxd2  as in van Wely-Safarli, Antalya 2013 is also fine, but if White correctly takes with the knight it becomes quite messy. }
16. Qxa5 Nxa5
{ Here, after both  17.Ne5  and  17.Nd2  , we should be quite content to play  17...Rfc8  ,  force White to castle, and then trade the g4-pawn for the a2-pawn with a very unclear double-edged endgame, where our outside passers could play a decisive role down the road. }

{ This quirky move is rare but has gained some traction recently when a few strong players toyed with it. It is not, as it might appear, a signal for a cavalier attack on the kingside, with g4 to follow − rather White is preparing to get back into normal Grünfeld territory with cxd5 and e4 but is making early arrangements to stop Bg4 in the future.

The idea of this line is fairly self-evident −  Black often used the Bg4 resource to put additional pressure on the white center and White chooses to spend a tempo making sure that never happens.  However, the fact that White spent it on something prophylactic instead of furthering the development gives Black time to generate other counterplay against the center. }

White gets a lot of immediate play against the weakened black king. The choice is between Ne5 and Nd4 here, and we choose Ne5 because after the eventual trade, our bishop will be less vulnerable to attacks on e5.   Notably, I played  13...Nd4  here myself in my match vs. Yu Yangyi and didn't even last 30 moves. As usual in such structures, if White is allowed to finish development unimpeded, the spatial gains will become hard to neutralize − but Black is ahead in development for now, and can use the time White needs to castle and stabilize to develop a lot of play on the Q-side.   It is also worth noting that White ends up playing Rb1 in most lines here, giving up the pawn on a2 − that provides Black with an easy plan of taking it and then pushing the a7-pawn towards a1. }
14. Nxe5 Bxe5 15. Rb1
{ An attempt to define the issues with the knight trades right away. Black's plan remains the same − in most lines here, we want to play Bd7 with Ba4 ideas, and then take on a2 when comfortable, or sometimes @@StartBracket@@like here, for example@@EndBracket@@ do it in the reverse order.   15.O-O  Bd7  16.Rb1  Qxa2  transposes. }
15... Qxa2 16. O-O Bd7
{ Trying to hold on to the b7-pawn is how Black goes wrong in positions like this. It's a lot more important to be active than to be greedy here. Getting the bishop out connects the rooks and the eventual Ba4 also forces the white pieces onto awkward squares. }
17. Rxb7 Ba4 18. Qe1 Rfb8
{ An important resource − the pawn on e7 is normally a lot more important than the one on b7, but here taking it is bad. }
19. Rxe7 Bd6 20. Bg5 Qa3

Notably, I played  13...Nd4  here myself in my match vs. Yu Yangyi and didn't even last 30 moves. As usual in such structures, if White is allowed to finish development unimpeded, the spatial gains will become hard to neutralize − but Black is ahead in development for now, and can use the time White needs to castle and stabilize to develop a lot of play on the Q-side.   It is also worth noting that White ends up playing Rb1 in most lines here, giving up the pawn on a2 − that provides Black with an easy plan of taking it and then pushing the a7-pawn towards a1. }
14. Rb1
{ Since this move gets played anyway in most cases, White decides to make it straight away. Our plans stay the same though − activate the c8 bishop, pick up on a2, trade along the b-file when White opens it up by taking on b7. }
14... Bd7
{ Taking on a2 is also possible here, but I like this move order a bit better. }

19... Qxc1 20. Rxc1 Rfb8
{ Black is fine − using the usual trick of  21.Rxe7  Bd6  , catching the rook, we start the trades along the b-file, and the resulting endgames are quite safe. White has a nice center, but Black's outside passer ensures that he doesn't need to worry very much at all once the pieces start coming off. }

6... c5

7. d5
{ The center needs to be preserved at all costs if White wants to have any chance here. }
7... b5
{ Continuing to fight as hard as possible for central control. This move protects c4 and creates the threat of b4. }
8. h5 O-O
{ Castling 'into it', so to speak, but the threat of 9.h6 was too strong to ignore and I don't think  8...Nxh5  9.Nxb5  is entirely convincing. }
9. hxg6 fxg6
{ 9...hxg6  is not unplayable as such, but it makes no sense to open the h-file for White when we can be opening the f-file for ourselves. However, this does open up the a2-g8 diagonal, which means we'll have to constantly watch out for tactics connected with checks along it. }
10. Rh4
{ This is by far the biggest alternative to the main  10.e5  line, and arguably it's more serious @@StartBracket@@it's definitely much less researched, and as such much trickier to face@@EndBracket@@. Black needs to be extremely well prepared here. }
10... Ng4
{ There is a number of quite interesting alternatives here, but I like this move the most. We're activating our Bg7 and Rf8, pinning the Nf3 to its spot due to threats of Nxf2, and stopping e5 ideas. It does cost us the b5-pawn, though. }
11. Nxb5 Qa5+ 12. Nc3 h5
{ This is where play starts from if we choose 10...Ng4. 12...h5 is an important move − we're securing the Ng4, making our king safer by restricting Rh4 and giving him more squares, and preparing to meet White's next moves. Our immediate plan is to play Nd7, preparing Nde5.   Of course, White can't take  13.Bxc4  here because  13...Bxc3  14.bxc3  Qxc3  attacks a lot of pieces at once. }
13. d6
{ Is probably the easiest for us to face since it gives us the obvious plan of playing Nc6-d4. }
13... e6
{ Another reason why we played 12...h5 − the Ng4 is not hanging here. } 14. Bd2
Nc6 15. Bxc4 Rb8
{ We get a typical play for this line: Black is a pawn down but is extremely active, and White has to switch to the defence. You'll have to get used to me saying 'Black is fine' in these positions − I would be saying 'we're better' if not for the fact that the soulless computer insists it's generally equal. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ This line, often called the Russian System, has been an important weapon in White’s arsenal for quite some time. Botvinnik used it in his World Championship matches in the 50s, it was also heavily featured in Karpov-Kasparov matches, and its popularity never really waned. White is applying additional pressure on the pawn on d5, effectively forcing us to take on c4. }
5... dxc4 { 5...c6  is also possible but quite passive. } 6. Qxc4
{ White gets to occupy the center further with  7.e4  but  in reply, we get to choose how to attack the white center − and the somewhat overextended Qc4 provides us with an additional source of counterplay. }
6... O-O 7. Bf4
{ This is by far the main line when White includes 5.Qa4+ Bd7, but in a pure move order, this option is not very popular anymore. My proposed reaction to it has a lot of overlap with those5.Qa4+ lines anyway − in many cases we end up in exactly the same positions as we would there. }

8. Be3
{ Now we come to the two main moves in this position. This particular choice is a very modern one. Ian Nepomniachtchi used it to win an all-important game vs. MVL in Jerusalem 2019 which qualified him for the Candidates spot. Black needs to be very precise here.   The point of this move is to stop Black's two most natural sources of counterplay − much sting is taken out of Bg4 by further protecting the d4-pawn, and  8...e5  9.d5  is also not very attractive since White is much better prepared to meet  9...Nd4  there. }
8... Ng4
{ The most natural reply − the one thing that 8.Be3 definitely doesn't stop is this move, which will help Black trade the knight for the bishop on e3. }
9. e5
{ The point of the previous move. White is now committed to keeping the bishop on g7 under lock and key for as long as possible since the other typical Grünfeld source of counterplay − c5 − is hindered by Black's own knight on c6.   9.Rd1  Nxe3  10.fxe3  e5!  would absolutely defeat the purpose. }
9... Be6
{ It is important to time the capture on e3 properly, and playing this move first is crucial.   While the knight is still on g4, White cannot play  10.d5?  in view of  10...Ncxe5  . }
10. Qa4 Bd7
{ Continuing to hassle the queen and also moving the bishop away from e6, where it was somewhat in the way. }
11. Qb3
{ 11.Qa3  a5!  is a typical way of reacting to the queen appearing on a3. It makes the threat of the knight landing on b4 a lot more annoying. }
11... Na5
{ Once again, Black is at the crossroads here. I've chosen to suggest the riskier line, where Black goes for a pawn sacrifice to open some files for our rooks and is aiming to fight hard for the initiative.   But  11...Nxe3  12.fxe3  e6  is again quite playable, although the extra tempo White gains in comparison to the11.Rd1 line is quite important, and Black will have to be precise after both  13.h4  and  13.Ne4  . }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ This line, often called the Russian System, has been an important weapon in White’s arsenal for quite some time. Botvinnik used it in his World Championship matches in the 50s, it was also heavily featured in Karpov-Kasparov matches, and its popularity never really waned. White is applying additional pressure on the pawn on d5, effectively forcing us to take on c4. }
5... dxc4 { 5...c6  is also possible but quite passive. } 6. Qxc4
{ White gets to occupy the center further with  7.e4  but  in reply, we get to choose how to attack the white center − and the somewhat overextended Qc4 provides us with an additional source of counterplay. }
6... O-O 7. e4 Nc6
{ In the past, I have been almost exclusively an  7...a6  player, and while I still believe Black is fine there, I wanted to explore something else. The  7...Nc6  lines intrigued me @@StartBracket@@and I tried analyzing them on and off@@EndBracket@@ for quite a long time.  It's an attempt to solve all of our issues forcefully @@StartBracket@@in particular in reply to 8.Be2@@EndBracket@@, while preserving good chances for double-edged unclear play if White decides not to engage in the main lines. The immediate idea is to play  8.--  e5  9.dxe5  Ng4  @@StartBracket@@or @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/4p3/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 9@@EndFEN@@  9.d5  Nd4  @@EndBracket@@. }
8. Be2 e5
{ And with this move, we're finally entering into the proper main line territory of the 7...Nc6 lines. With e5, Black sacrifices the e-pawn to generate a ton of counterplay against the white center. The lines get extremely sharp and concrete, in particular, if White decides to enter the maze of the main stem with 15.f3, but I believe Black players hold their own if they know what they're doing. }
9. d5 Nd4 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Qxd4 c6
{ Black immediately starts undermining the white center. The current threat is  12.--  Nxd5  , which means White can't just complete development by castling. }
12. Qc4
{ The best choice.   Of all the other squares,  12.Qd3  just doesn't make any sense since after the trades on d5 it will give Black a free tempo to play Bf5. }
12... b5
{ This is not a line for the meek. This second pawn sacrifice wins a lot of time for Black and also lures the white queen deep into the black position, where it will become a target for attack. }
13. Qxc6 Bd7 14. Qd6
{ There is absolutely no justification for any other square for the queen. The threat of b4 was very serious and  14.Qc5  Rc8  just doesn't look right. }
14... Re8
{ Attacking the white center − since Black is two pawns down here, our play must be extremely energetic, giving White a tempo to stabilize will be extremely expensive. }
15. f3 Nh5
{ This position is extremely tricky to play, although it's possible to formulate some basic guidelines. Black is aiming for f5 breaks, with Be5/Qh4 as additional threats right now. White, on the other hand, will be trying to keep the position as closed as possible. I will provide as much concrete info as I think is reasonable, but I would still encourage viewers to look at this line on their own after completing the chapter, to internalize the craziness that might happen here.   Just to illustrate the dangers in this position, if White plays the automatic  16.O-O?  Bf8  17.Qa6  Bc5+  18.Kh1  Qh4  , Black is already winning. }
16. Be3 f5
{ Ideas remain the same here − push against the e4-pawn, hope to play b4, fight as hard as possible to prevent White from having enough time to castle. In most lines, you can do this by employing common sense, but fair warning − after 17.Qa3 you will need to be ready to sacrifice a LOT of material in very short order. }
17. Qa3
{ 17.g3  transposes to the16.g3 move order. In this line, play becomes very very forced and Black needs to sacrifice some more material. On the plus side, at the end of it, Black has a tremendous attack and relatively intuitive ways of reacting to White's possible defences. }
17... b4 { Opening up more files for our pieces } 18. Qxb4 Rb8 19. Qa3 fxe4 20.
f4
{ White can't possibly afford to leave the files open here, this is strictly the only move − and in reply, Black sacrifices a piece to stop White from castling. }
20... Qh4+ 21. g3 Nxg3 22. Bf2 Qh3
{ Making castle illegal for the foreseeable future by controlling the f1 square − also not allowing hxg3. }
23. Bxg3 Rec8
{ The end of the absolutely forced sequence which started with 17...b4. Black is threatening Rxb2, but on a more general level, every black piece here is arguably more active than its white counterpart, and as the 24.Rc1 line illustrates, just giving Black a tempo here might have lethal consequences.   Therefore, I think White probably should cut the risks and take the repetiton with  24.Bf1  Qh5  25.Be2  Qh3  26.Bf1  .   a.  24.Rg1  Bd4  25.O-O-O  Bc5  26.Qa5  Qf5  27.Rg2  Bb4  28.Qxa7  Bc5  29.Qa5  Bb4  30.Qa7  Bc5  31.Qa5  Bb4  32.Qa6  e3  33.Bd3  Rxc3+  34.bxc3  Qf6  35.Rb2  Qxa6  36.Bxa6  Ba3  , while after @@StartFEN@@1r4k1/3b3p/Q4qp1/3P4/1b3P2/2PBp1B1/P5RP/2KR4 w - - 0 35@@EndFEN@@  35.Qxf6  Ba3+  36.Rb2  Bxb2+  37.Kb1  Bxc3+  38.Kc1  Bxf6  Black's active pieces combined with White's exposed king compensate for the pawn deficit.   b.  24.Rc1?

5... Bd7 6. Qb3 c5 7. Nxd5 O-O
{ Black gets a gold-plated opportunity to attack the white center right away, while White is wasting time on queen moves − very much contrary to the spirit of 5.Bf4.   If White keeps consistent and makes another queen move  8.Qxb7  , then  8...Nc6  9.Bc7  Qc8  10.Qxc8  Rfxc8  11.Nxf6+  Bxf6  12.Be5  Nxd4  − a sample line to illustrate that Black can win already if White is too greedy. }

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4
{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }

{ White has three main moves here:  5.e3  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.Rc1  . The first two are by far the more important @@StartBracket@@and flow into each other quite often@@EndBracket@@, while  5.Rc1  has more or less been solved, as far as I'm concerned, and is almost never seen anymore in games by strong players. }
5. Nf3

12... Nb6 13. Bb3

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4
{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }
4... Bg7
{ White has three main moves here:  5.e3  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.Rc1  . The first two are by far the more important @@StartBracket@@and flow into each other quite often@@EndBracket@@, while  5.Rc1  has more or less been solved, as far as I'm concerned, and is almost never seen anymore in games by strong players. }
5. Nf3
{ This move normally is just a transposition into the 5.e3 lines after  5...O-O  6.e3  , but  6.Rc1  does have stand-alone relevance. It's not very scary, though. }
5... O-O 6. Rc1
{ Note that  6.Qb3  transposes to positions analyzed in theRussian System chapter after  6...dxc4  7.Qxc4  c6  . }
6... dxc4
{ The most straightforward move here. We'll play c5 next, continuing with our plan of removing the white center. }
7. e3 c5 { An active alternative to  7...Be6  . } 8. Bxc4 cxd4 9. Nxd4 Bd7
{ An important move − we want to play Nc6, challenging White's central setup, without compromising our structure. }
10. Nb3
{ 10.O-O  Nc6  is simpler − we want to trade pieces in the center, and after  11.Nb3  we continue asking:  11...Na5!  12.Be2  Qb6  ,  intending to take on b3 and play Bc6, with good play. }
10... a5
{ This is a fine tune − in the chess24 videos, I gave  10...Nc6  here, but I think this is a cleaner approach. Since White specifically  played Nb3 to be able to play Nc5 later, it makes sense for us to keep the c6-square open so that the Bd7 can go there if chased. }
11. O-O
{ 11.a4  Qb6  , and now we have a b4-square to aim for. If White tries to stop it with  12.Nb5  , we can simply take:  12...Bxb5  13.Bxb5  Nc6  14.O-O  Rfc8  , w  ith ideas of Na7 and Nh5, and we're fine.   11.Nc5  Bc6  12.O-O  a4  is the same as in the note to move  12. }
11... a4 12. Nd4
{ 12.Nc5  Bc6  and we're ready to play Qa5 or Nbd7, with good play. } 12... Qa5
{ We're threatening e5 and Nc6 can be played next if White prevents this idea. }
13. Ndb5
{ Sidestepping e5 and creating ideas of Bc7, but we have a nice simplifying response. }
13... Ne4
{ Since  14.Bc7  Nxc3  is no longer very attractive for White, Black will be able to trade some pieces off, with comfortable play. }

7. cxd5
{ 7.dxc5  Ne4!  8.Nxe4  dxe4  and  White has to spend more time defending against the threat of Qa5+ giving us time to play Be6, Nd7, and start rounding up the c5-pawn.

Trading queens would only add fuel to the fire since White's pawns on the Q-side are weak while the K-side is still undeveloped.  13.Bc4  e5!  14.dxe6   14.Bg5  would run into  14...f6  15.Bh4  and here Black can calmly continue playing positionally with  15...Qd6  ,  followed by Bh6, b5, or a5, and White doesn't get enough time to develop properly.  Another idea in this position is  15...Nd3+  16.Bxd3  Qxe3+  17.Ne2  Qxd3  18.c4  Bh6  , where Black has the initiative and the bishop pair.  14...Bxe6  15.Ne2  Bxc4  16.Qxc4  Rac8  .  Once again, without being able to castle due to Ne6, White's position is just worse. }
7... cxd4 8. exd4 a5

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4
{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }

5. e3 O-O

It's not the most exciting idea − our aim there will be to make a more or less forced draw, in some cases in endgames a pawn down − but it has the advantage of being, I believe, an actual novelty at the time of writing, and play afterwards does become quite forced and straightforward. }

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4
{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }
4... Bg7
{ White has three main moves here:  5.e3  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.Rc1  . The first two are by far the more important @@StartBracket@@and flow into each other quite often@@EndBracket@@, while  5.Rc1  has more or less been solved, as far as I'm concerned, and is almost never seen anymore in games by strong players. }
5. e3 O-O
{ The true starting point of the Bf4 lines.   This way, Black forces White to put the knight on f3 before committing to c5, and therefore avoid a huge chunk of theory connected with  5...c5  6.dxc5  Qa5  7.Rc1  dxc4  8.Bxc4  O-O  9.Nge2  , which also stands reasonably well right now, but would require a lot of very concrete @@StartBracket@@and memory-demanding@@EndBracket@@ knowledge in order to make a forced draw. }
6. cxd5
{ This line always annoyed me a great deal − so much so that for years I played 5...c5 instead of 5...O-O just so that I didn't have to study it. However, it's objectively quite safe, if very dry. }
6... Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Bxc7 Na6
{ We need to play quite energetically here. Of course, give White a tempo or two to stabilize, and the healthy extra pawn will become a massive factor. }
9. Bxa6 Qxg2 10. Qf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 bxa6
{ This endgame appears pretty much by force if White plays 6.cxd5. We have the bishop pair, but the Bg7 is very restricted right now, and White has a healthier pawn structure, due to our doubled a-pawns.  We should be aiming to start breaking the Bg7 free, in particular with f6 and e5, while in more general terms we're normally okay if we get to trade all the rooks along the c-file. f6, Rf7 and Bf8, intending to activate the bishop via the a3-f8 diagonal, is another typical setup we should be aware of. }
12. Rg1 f6 13. Rc1 Rf7
{ This low-key move is very useful for any of the plans we're going to be going for later. It covers the 7th rank once we play e6 or e5, opens up the f8-square for the Bg7 so that we can start bringing it into the game, and also allows us to look to double rooks on the f-file in case we do push e5 and there is a trade on that square, opening up the f-file. }
14. Ke2 Bb7
{ The bishop generally belongs on the long diagonal, although  14...Bd7  is not bad at all either here, now that White has to deal  with Bb5+ ideas.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4
{ One of the old classical lines of the Grünfeld − White develops the c1-bishop before setting up with e3 and Nf3. The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control. In most lines, our counterplay will be centered around the idea of playing c5 as early as possible, and Qa5 if White takes that pawn. }
4... Bg7
{ White has three main moves here:  5.e3  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.Rc1  . The first two are by far the more important @@StartBracket@@and flow into each other quite often@@EndBracket@@, while  5.Rc1  has more or less been solved, as far as I'm concerned, and is almost never seen anymore in games by strong players. }
5. e3 O-O

{ Does a double job of stopping Bg4 and giving the Bf4 the h2-square in case of Nh5. And now that Bg4 is cut off, White would like to play e3-e4 and start gaining space in the center. Doing it without h3 would invite Bg4! and Black's counterplay with Rd8 and possibly Nd4 later develops very naturally.   12.Nd4  should be met with  12...Bd7!  − there is no reason to give White some play along the e-file with  12...Nxd4  13.exd4!  followed by Re1. }

15... Nxg5 16. Nxg5 Qd8

17. h4
{ This idea, introduced in 2009, briefly revived this old line which used to be considered borderline unplayable due to  17.Nf3  e4  18.Nd2  Qg5  and Black's play is faster than anything White is doing. }
17... h6 18. g4 Bd7 19. Ne4 Qxh4 20. f3
{ This is the point of 17.h4!? − by giving up on h4, White establishes a very nice pair of knights, and is planning to play Rf2-h2 and then launch a direct attack on the black king. However, by playing energetically and challenging the white setup, Black equalizes. }
20... Kh8 { We need to be able to play f5. } 21. Rf2 f5 22. Rh2 Qd8 23. Rxh6+
Bxh6 24. Qh2 Kg7

26. Qxe5+ Kh7 27. Nef6+ Rxf6 28. Nxf6+ Kh8

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bf4

The bishop can sometimes target the c7-pawn, but more relevantly, it is out from behind the pawn chain and is quite useful for central control.

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bg5
{ 4.Bg5 is one of the sharpest options White has, at least if they want it to be. For decades, it was a given that the threat to the pawn on d5 needed to be addressed, and Black played  4...Ne4  without much pause for thought. However, in the 1990s, at least in part due to my efforts, the idea of leaving our central pawn en prise began to take hold. }
4... Bg7
{ The closest I've ever come to having a titular line in the Grünfeld − I wasn't the first to play this move, but access to information in the early 90s St. Petersburg was quite problematic, and I did think of it and the ideas behind it, on my own.  The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement. It should also be noted that in case of  5.Nf3  ,  we're transposing back into normal Ne4 territory. But I believe it's quite useful for us to make sure both Bg7 and Nf3 are included before we do that. }
5. Nf3
{ Forces Black to switch to Ne4 lines, but the inclusion of Nf3-Bg7 limits White's scope as well. }
5... Ne4 6. h4
{ This move, extremely topical in every single opening these days, is stronger when White plays it in advance, before we have the option of trading the offending Bg5. White will achieve the stated aim here, the opening of the h-file − but the center is too unstable for us to worry about getting mated, and besides, we haven't even castled yet, which means we can postpone that until it's safe.   6.Nxd5?

Nxg5  7.Nxg5  allows  7...e5!  , breaking open White's center straight away. }
6... Nxg5 7. hxg5 dxc4
{ The simplest. We won't be able to hold on to that pawn, but the time White now needs to spend on recapturing it, and neutralizing the c5 ideas, allows us to develop and generate a lot of counterplay. }
8. Qa4+
{ 8.e3  Be6  − now that we don't have to worry about  Ng5  , this square is very safe for the bishop −  9.Be2  c5  , and we're beginning to undermine White's center. }
8... c6 9. Qxc4 Qb6
{ MVL recently played  9...Be6  10.Qa4  Nd7  11.e3  O-O  here, which is also perfectly fine. But the text move more or less forces White to castle queenside, after which our eventual opening of the files and diagonals  with c6-c5 greatly gains in strength. }
10. O-O-O Be6 11. Qa4 O-O
{ With very unclear play, but I would pick Black here. } *

{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bg5
{ 4.Bg5 is one of the sharpest options White has, at least if they want it to be. For decades, it was a given that the threat to the pawn on d5 needed to be addressed, and Black played  4...Ne4  without much pause for thought. However, in the 1990s, at least in part due to my efforts, the idea of leaving our central pawn en prise began to take hold. }

The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement.

For instance after  11.Qb3  O-O  11.Qb4  Qc7  12.Nf3  Na6  ,  the knight is one move away from a very comfortable perch on c5 and we can often follow up with Bxf3/gxf3/Rab8 and Rfd8.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bg5

For decades, it was a given that the threat to the pawn on d5 needed to be addressed, and Black played  4...Ne4  without much pause for thought.

The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement.

However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }

The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bg5
{ 4.Bg5 is one of the sharpest options White has, at least if they want it to be. For decades, it was a given that the threat to the pawn on d5 needed to be addressed, and Black played  4...Ne4  without much pause for thought. However, in the 1990s, at least in part due to my efforts, the idea of leaving our central pawn en prise began to take hold. }
4... Bg7
{ The closest I've ever come to having a titular line in the Grünfeld − I wasn't the first to play this move, but access to information in the early 90s St. Petersburg was quite problematic, and I did think of it and the ideas behind it, on my own.  The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement. It should also be noted that in case of  5.Nf3  ,  we're transposing back into normal Ne4 territory. But I believe it's quite useful for us to make sure both Bg7 and Nf3 are included before we do that. }
5. Bxf6 Bxf6 6. cxd5 c5
{ I am deviating from  6...c6  , which was my idea way back in the early 90s and continued being my preferred option when I recorded the chess24 course. I don't believe my proposed solution in those videos has been refuted, but the surprise element is gone and for this course, I wanted to explore something else.  This move has been around for a while but only gained serious traction around 2011-12, when Topalov and Giri played it. The idea is to sidestep the  6...c6  7.e4  lines, but it comes with a price − we're @@StartBracket@@at least temporarily@@EndBracket@@ giving up a 2nd pawn. }
7. dxc5 Nd7 8. Ne4 Bxb2 9. Rb1 Qa5+ 10. Qd2 Qxd2+ 11. Kxd2 Ba3
{ Is immediately very good for Black − the pawn gets driven to c6 and it will get picked up there, while the Kd2 is not going to feel too safe either. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{ When the Grünfeld was first introduced, it instantly joined the ranks of the ‘hypermodern’ chess openings, since at first glance we’re breaking a lot of rules by not fighting for the center directly, as opposed to, say, Queen’s Gambit Declined or the Slav.  However, the idea that you can cede control of the center to White for the time being, and then aim to pressure it by playing c5 and Nc6 after trading the knights on c3, while quite revolutionary at the time, is now quite standard, and the pawn structures you will find everywhere in the Grünfeld are very much part of the landscape we’re all quite familiar with. }
4. Bg5
{ 4.Bg5 is one of the sharpest options White has, at least if they want it to be. For decades, it was a given that the threat to the pawn on d5 needed to be addressed, and Black played  4...Ne4  without much pause for thought. However, in the 1990s, at least in part due to my efforts, the idea of leaving our central pawn en prise began to take hold. }
4... Bg7
{ The closest I've ever come to having a titular line in the Grünfeld − I wasn't the first to play this move, but access to information in the early 90s St. Petersburg was quite problematic, and I did think of it and the ideas behind it, on my own.  The line has evolved greatly since then, though − in fact, I will be offering a take on the main gambit continuation that was developed much later and entirely without my involvement. It should also be noted that in case of  5.Nf3  ,  we're transposing back into normal Ne4 territory. But I believe it's quite useful for us to make sure both Bg7 and Nf3 are included before we do that. }

This move has been around for a while but only gained serious traction around 2011-12, when Topalov and Giri played it.

[Black "Donald Byrne vs. Robert James Fischer, New York 1956"]
[Result "*"]

{ No collection of model games can ever be complete without the games of the famous American World Champion, Robert James Fischer, played against the Byrne brothers.  We will take a look at the first one against Donald Byrne, a strong International Master who had already won the US championship at that point. Fischer was only 13 years old at the time and due to his brilliant play, this game was later labeled as the game of the century. However, it has to be said that his opponent did cooperate, which is something we will emphasize throughout the analysis.  I am pretty sure most of you have seen this game already, but it is such a precious gem that it doesn't hurt to see it again. }
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ Not our usual move order. Bobby is clearly inviting his much more experienced opponent to play the King's Indian... }
4. d4 O-O { Continuing to invite the opponent to play  5.e4  . } 5. Bf4 { No! }
5... d5
{ OK, let's play the Grünfeld then! This is still the 4.Bf4 Grünfeld, but at the next move it takes a rather strange turn. }
6. Qb3
{ A rare move, switching the game from Bf4 lines into the Russian System. Normally, this position is reached by playing 5.Qb3 first. }
6... dxc4 7. Qxc4 c6 8. e4 Nbd7
{ Not the most ambitious move − but Bobby was 13 and still making somewhat imprecise moves every now and then.   8...Qa5  is the prescribed solution here with the idea of  pushing b5 later − see the chapter on theRussian System. }
9. Rd1 { Even the immediate  9.Be2  is playable. } 9... Nb6 10. Qc5
{ A good move, as the queen is positioned well on c5. } 10... Bg4 11. Bg5
{ A move that is difficult to understand. Byrne probably wanted to prevent  11...Nfd7  due to the hanging e7-pawn. However, even if we disregard the tactical possibility found by Fischer, moving the knight to d7 is by no means bad.   11.Be2  followed by O-O would have been more prudent. This is really the only mistake Byrne makes in this game, but it will prove to be enough. It's hard to justify 11.Bg5 though, even if you miss Fischer's fantastic reply. White needs to develop, not spend time pretending to prevent Nfd7. }
11... Na4
{ And suddenly, Black's position explodes and everything collapses for White. }
12. Qa3 { After  12.Nxa4  Nxe4  13.Qc1  Qa5+  White is already lost. } 12...
Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4
{ Of course, Bobby is not remotely interested in letting White finish development in peace. }
14. Bxe7 Qb6
{ With the white king stuck in the center, Black's attack just develops naturally. There's no particular need to even give lines here − assessment of positions like this should come as no surprise to anyone. }
15. Bc4
{ A sensible decision, trying to create some potential pressure against the pawn on f7, although that will never happen. If White plays  15.Bxf8  , we can calmly recapture with  15...Bxf8  and  then take on c3 on the next move. Even if the queen continues protecting it with  16.Qb3  , after  16...Nxc3  17.Qxc3  Bb4  wins on the spot. But also without this resource, with the open  king on e1, White is in tremendous danger. However, the text move also runs into tactics. }
15... Nxc3
{ Continuing to play very energetically and exploiting the position of the bishop on e7. }
16. Bc5
{ Byrne probably counted on this intermediate move, but he probably didn't consider Fischer's splendid continuation.   16.Qxc3  Rae8  and the bishop on e7 is doomed. }
16... Rfe8+ 17. Kf1 Be6
{ A beautiful, beautiful move. Black is leaving everything that is already hanging en prise, introducing a new direction of attack, and White is suddenly helpless.   Black could also take on d1  17...Nxd1  , but after  18.Bxb6  axb6  19.Qb3  the knight on d1 is in trouble and the pawn on f7 is hanging. }

[Result "*"]

{ After seeingthe game between Fischer and Donald Byrne, let us now examine how Byrne's brother, Robert, fared about Fischer's Grünfeld. The following game was played during the US Championship in 1963. Fischer was now 20 years old, an established grandmaster, and arguably the favourite to win the game, which probably makes Byrne's passive opening choice somewhat easier to understand. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 c6 4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5 cxd5 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. e3
{ Ultra solid, as ironic as it sounds considering how the game went. On the surface, this is a reliable setup as White has a very solid pawn structure aimed against the bishop on g7. But  7.Nf3  would be a more natural developing move. }
7... O-O 8. Nge2 Nc6 9. O-O b6
{ An extremely quiet line − or is it? Fischer clearly intends to put his bishop on the very active a6-f1 diagonal. }
10. b3
{ As Fischer himself indicates in his notes, after the more precise  10.Nf4  e6  11.b3  Ba6  12.Re1  Rc8  13.Ba3  Re8  14.Rc1  ,  as in Stahlberg-Flohr, Kemeri 1937, the game is very equal. With the knight on f4, it is much more difficult for Black to ever play e5 and the game is basically a 'very symmetrical snooze-fest'. }
10... Ba6
{ The pin on the Ne2 will turn out to be very influential and we start seeing the differences between what White is doing and what Black is doing. If the position becomes open, the fact that Black has a knight on f6 and White on e2 might become relevant as Black will have the more active pieces. }
11. Ba3
{ White is developing normally, not expecting the game to blow up soon. } 11...
Re8
{ With the e-pawn unpinned, it is very difficult for White to stop the e5 break. }
12. Qd2
{ This very natural move allows Fischer to start what will soon become a devastating attack in the center.  I spent some time trying to figure out if White had an easy way out here, and came to the shocking @@StartBracket@@at least to me@@EndBracket@@ conclusion that Black is actually already a bit better.   In case of  12.Rc1  Rc8  13.Rc2!  , this move is sorely needed.

A fantastic engine idea. Black hard stops Nf4, and now White will find it difficult to make useful moves.   If  15.Nc1  we can return to our main idea:  15...e5!  16.dxe5  Nxe5  17.Bb2  , and now we have a very showy follow up.  17...d4!  18.exd4  Qxd4!!  , with a very nice position, since  19.Qxd4  Nf3+  20.Bxf3  Rxe1+  21.Kg2  Bf1+  22.Kg1  Bh3 }

Qxe4  21.f3  Qc6  22.Nc1!  and the game probably ends in a draw. }
14... Nd3
{ Now Black wants to play Ng4 or Ne4, turning the knight on d3 into a permanent fixture. }
15. Qc2
{ 'There is hardly any other defense to the threat of ...Ne4.'  (Fischer) }
15... Nxf2
{ A very beautiful combination − but the most surprising thing about it, for me, is the Byrne quote you'll see next. Of course Black wants to destroy the white center while bringing the knight from f6 to e3 − none of this should come as a shock. }
16. Kxf2 Ng4+ 17. Kg1 Nxe3 18. Qd2
{ 'As I sat pondering why Fischer would choose such a line because it was so obviously lost for Black, there suddenly comes the reply in the game.'  (Byrne)   This is quite stunning since this position definitely doesn't look good for White. Apart from the fact that the text move wins @@StartBracket@@and quite beautifully, I must say@@EndBracket@@ Black is also winning after  18...Rc8  , for instance. }
18... Nxg2
{ Of course, the Bg2, the last defender of White's kingside, is way more important than the rook. With it gone, White will be entirely helpless. }
19. Kxg2 d4 { Preparing to bring the other bishop to the long diagonal. } 20.
Nxd4 Bb7+ 21. Kf1

It was played in an 8-board simul against the German player, Frank Behrhorst, and it is a game Kasparov himself was very fond of and included in his game collections as well.

It is, therefore, a very warm memory and I am also very happy that the game does hold to the modern standard and scrutiny of the engines. }

{ The following game was played between Alexei Shirov and Vladimir Kramnik in their Candidates Match in Cazorla, in 1998. The game was played in the later stage of the match and Kramnik was not doing very well result-wise, so he was in a sort of a must-win situation. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3
{ A very good choice for a must-win game by Vladimir − the match wasn't going his way and he chooses the sharpest possible approach here. }
3... d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 e5
{ Shirov follows the recommendation outlined in this course. It was very interesting to read the annotations from the match and compare them with the current thinking. }
9. d5 c6 10. h4
{ Not a novelty at a time, but the commentators were saying that perhaps  10.O-O-O  is a decent alternative. }
10... h5
{ It's interesting to read the comments this game garnered at the time. This move was praised, and  10...cxd5  11.exd5  N8d7  that Irecommend in the course, was considered somewhat inferior. }
11. Be2
{ A solid move, but White could already launch a direct attack on the black kingside with  11.g4  . I believe this to be the reason 10...h5 is extremely rare these days.  11...cxd5  12.exd5  hxg4   12...N8d7  13.gxh5  Nf6  14.hxg6  fxg6  15.Nh3  was good for White in Ivanchuk-Akesson, Antalya 2004.   12...Na6  was played in a somewhat recent game: Ding Liren-Gupta, Doha 2014 − but I believe White is better after both  13.gxh5  and Ding's choice,  13.Bh6  .  13.h5  Bf5  and now  14.hxg6  ,  14.fxg4  , and even  14.Bh6!?  are all pretty dangerous. }

Bg5 Re8
{ Logical, and will in fact be vindicated later in the game, but the e5-e4 counterplay doesn't compensate for the pin along the h4-d8 diagonal if White plays well.   14...Qe8!?  trying to free the pinned pieces, was preferrable. }
15. Rd1
{ White needs to be mindful of the e4 breakthrough and only needs to bring the Ng1 into play. The plan of Nh3-f2 is simple but extremely hard to stop. }
15... Be6
{ The whole plan of placing the knight on  c4  seems appealing, but it shouldn't have provided Black with enough counterplay. But even after  15...Bd7  16.Nh3  the position is very difficult.  Allowing Nf2 would give White a very good grip in the center and taking on h3  16...Bxh3  is an option that also existed in the game. After  17.Rxh3  it will be very difficult for Black to challenge the d6-pawn. This position is no fun for Black. }
16. Nh3 Nc4
{ 16...Bxh3  17.Rxh3  a6  stopping Bb5/Nb5 and trying to at least play Qd7, may have been better − but then we wouldn't have had this wonderful game. }
17. Bxc4 Bxc4 18. b3
{ It is too early to play d7 and it makes sense to ask the question on where the bishop is planning to go. }
18... Ba6
{ Strictly speaking, this might be a decisive mistake, but Alexei is playing for maximum chances of counterplay here.   18...Be6  19.Nf2  would have been sad, and I can definitely understand why he chose a6 − at least the king on e1 is stuck in the center for now. }
19. Nd5
{ This is a grievous miscalculation and it ends up costing White the game.   19.d7!  would have been very strong, using the fact that  19...Re7  20.Nd5  is bad.

With this victory, Shirov qualified for the World Championship match − a match that never happened, which is a completely different topic that was heavily discussed in the 90s. }

{ For this model game, I am choosing a bit of a mixed approach. I have chosen a fair number of my own games as those are the games that I can describe on a much deeper, personal level and I have also chosen a fair amount of Kasparov's games when he was on the black side of this opening.   This game was played in the Wijk Aan Zee 1999 tournament, where Kasparov was in good form @@StartBracket@@this was the tournament that produced the famous Kasparov-Topalov game@@EndBracket@@. I, on the other hand, was in my '90s' state of mind, starting the tournament with 5 draws and then seeking chances and playing even 'half-dubious' lines in order to generate winning chances.  I am giving you all this context to explain why, after seeing Garry's first move, I decided to go for the sharp approach − I did know some other openings and was not committed exclusively to the Grünfeld. Kasparov complimented me on that decision and called it 'manly' after the game and whereas it is debatable how 'manly' it was, I am pretty sure it was not very wise. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5

4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3 dxc4 { 5...c6  is also possible but quite passive. } 6. Qxc4
{ White gets to occupy the center further with  7.e4  but  in reply, we get to choose how to attack the white center − and the somewhat overextended Qc4 provides us with an additional source of counterplay. }
6... O-O 7. e4 a6
{ This was a favourite weapon of mine for many years and I thought I knew the theory of this line quite well. Once again,  7...Nc6  is what I recommendnowadays. }
8. e5 b5 9. Qb3 Nfd7
{ A very sharp position. At the time, the theory was mainly concentrated around playing e6 straight away, as in the game, or  10.h4  . }
10. e6 fxe6
{ I considered myself quite well booked up in this line, but Garry came armed with a very important new idea. }
11. Be3 { Garry played this instantly. } 11... Nb6
{ Opting to 'die standing' rather than 'live on my knees'.   These days, I would definitely choose  11...Nf6  12.a4  , and now Black is not obliged to defend an unpleasant position after bxa4 −  12...b4!  13.Qxb4  Nc6  gives Black plenty of immediate counterplay. }

18. Rh5
{ Garry was very proud of this move and correctly so. White is arguably losing two tempi with this move, and also the pawn on g6. But it's much more important to stop Nd5, and taking on g6 will open up the g-file for the white rook. }
18... Qe8 19. Ne2 Qxg6 20. Rh1

23... Bd7
{ 23...Nf4  24.Qe4  Rb8  25.Rxg7  Kxg7  26.Qe5+  is a demonstration of how difficult it is for Black to coordinate. }
24. Qe4
{ With the Qe4/Bd3 battery in place, White is ready to launch the final assault. }
24... Rc8 25. Bd3
{ Black had finally developed all his pieces, but he has only one pawn for the sacrificed exchange and his king is under attack. }
25... Nf6 26. Qh4
{ While I was finishing development, White managed to get his pieces on good squares and some assault will happen on the queenside. It is difficult to defend against a frontal attack. }
26... Rc5
{ 26...Nd5  may have been a better try, but after  27.Ne2  Qxf3  28.Rg6  Qf8  the comp suggests a cool  29.b3!  and Black is helpless against the slow, slow death of Kd2, followed by Rdg1. }
27. Ne2 Nd5 28. Rg6 Qf8
{ Taking on h6 was definitely a threat, for example  28...Be8  29.Rxh6+!  Bxh6  30.Qxh6+  Kg8  31.Kd2  Qg7  32.Rg1+- }
29. Qe4 { Threatening Rxh6+ followed by mate. } 29... Qf7 30. Kd2
{ And with this move, White is finally including the second rook in the attack, with immediate decisive results. }
30... Nf6 31. Qe3
{ I resigned here, and I maintain it's perfectly timed, for once. Rdg1 can not be stopped. A very powerful game by Kasparov, demonstrating his knowledge of weak points of the opening, even though this line is far from the refutation of this system. It was definitely a very interesting experience trying to uphold the Grünfeld against him! }

{ For this time, I have chosen a game I have lost to Vladimir Kramnik − one of many I lost to him in this opening.  Even though talking about your losses is never pleasant, it is very instructive to show the play of one of the greatest players of the White side of the Grünfeld − in particular, one of the greatest players of the Rb1 Grünfeld − and demonstrate the dangers of being inaccurate in the opening by disregarding White's threats.  On a more personal note, this game was played in my second Linares. I started well and then lost four in a row − I believe this one was the final loss in the sequence after losing to Kasparov, Anand, and then Ivanchuk. It is a good indication that the field in this tournament was not soft and once they sensed someone was a clear target, they went for the blood. }

{ This game was played in the match Russia vs.  Rest of the World rapid match in 2002. This game will be probably drier than the rest of the Model Games, but I wanted to show it specifically because the structure featured in this game is something you might encounter in a decent amount of Grünfeld games. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Teimour played a lot of the Russian System at some point. } 5... dxc4 6. Qxc4
O-O 7. e4 a6
{ I played this line my entire life, and I still believe it's decent. Allow me to gently remind you that  7...Nc6  is the mainrecommendation of this course. }
8. Be2
{ Probably the main move, even though  8.e5  is a lot sharper and a more threatening way of meeting the advance of the a-pawn. }
8... b5 9. Qb3 c5 10. dxc5 Bb7
{ 10...Be6  would be my choice in 2021 − or even in 2013, when I did the chess24 course. }
11. O-O { 11.e5  is an important other option here. } 11... Nxe4 12. Nxe4 Bxe4
13. Bg5 { 13.Bf4  is probably more critical here. } 13... Nc6
{ And this is specifically the structure I am talking about − White has a passed pawn on c5 which is blockaded by the knight on c6. The Russian System with a6 is the variation that produces this variation the most, so it will not be featured that much within the Russian System with the continuation I give in this course, but it will still be featured quite a lot so it is worth knowing main ideas. }
14. Qe3 Qd5
{ White has a passer on c5, but it's safely blocked by our Nc6. This is a typical Grünfeld structure and it definitely pays to learn not to fear. White wants to trade minor pieces, in particular the dark-squared bishops − and we would like not to let this happen. }
15. Rad1
{ 15.Bh6  would be met by  15...Nd4!  16.Bxg7  Nxe2+  17.Qxe2  Bxf3!  and we're fine. }
15... Qe6 16. Bh6
{ The ideal moment to play this move as Ng5 is also threatened, but Black has a very nice counter! }
16... Bc2 { Very strong, virtually forcing the exchange of the queens. } 17.
Rd2
{ 17.Qxe6  doesn't work out tactically:  17...fxe6  18.Rd2  Bxh6  19.Rxc2  Nb4!  20.Rc3  Nxa2  21.Rb3  Nc1  and the knight is not trapped at all but rather winning a lot of material. }
17... Qxe3 18. Bxe3 Bf5
{ We've prevented the trade of the dark-squared bishop for now, and would be quite happy to start trading along the d-file. However, White's next move gift wraps an ideal scenario for us. }
19. Nd4 { This is arguably the big mistake of the game. } 19... Bxd4
{ Somewhat counterintuitive, but I knew about the motif of giving up the bishop and retaining the strong blockading knight. }
20. Bxd4 Rad8 21. Be3
{ Teimour was maybe counting on  21.Rfd1  but after  21...Bc2!  his position is bad:  22.Rxc2  Nxd4  . }
21... Rxd2 22. Bxd2 Rd8 23. Be3 Bd3
{ A key move! With this, we trade the light-squared bishops and end up with Nc6 vs. Ne3 − an endgame that is very difficult for White, despite the protected passer, particularly here, where we also control the d-file. }
24. Bxd3 Rxd3
{ It seems that Black has unnecessarily simplified into a position where White has a strong passed pawn. But in reality, the pawn is securely blockaded and it restricts the bishop on e3 and therefore the endgame is extremely favourable for Black. }
25. Rc1 e5 26. Kf1 f5 27. Ke2 Rd5 28. f3
{ 28.Rd1  Rxd1  29.Kxd1  Kf7  30.a3  a5  31.f3  Ke6∓  Even with the rooks off, White is still in trouble here since the pawn on c5 is potentially vulnerable and our Kd5 can not be challenged. }
28... Kf7 29. g4 { 29.g3  may have been better. } 29... f4
{ We limit White even further, and can start preparing e5-e4. The move doesn't look obvious, but White doesn't have a minor piece he can place on e4. }
30. Bf2 Ke6 31. h4 a5 32. Rh1 h6
{ Important in order to lock the kingside in case White advances one of the pawns. }
33. Rc1 Rd7
{ It is not clear how to make progress, but the idea is to push in the center. With this nice move, we're going to play e4 soon, and the rook sidesteps the tempo White would gain with f3xe4. }
34. Rc3 e4 35. fxe4 Ke5 { Black is finally starting to make progress. } 36. Kf3
{ 36.Rd3  Rxd3  37.Kxd3  Nb4+  and  White loses the pawn on e4. } 36... Rd2 37.
a3 b4
{ Of course not  37...Rxb2?  38.Rd3+=  with a lot of threats and definite counterplay. }
38. axb4 axb4 39. Rc1
{ 39.Rb3  g5  White is completely tied up and we'll win by freeing the e5-square for the knight.  40.h5  Ke6  and if @@StartFEN@@8/8/2n4p/2P1k1p1/1p2PpPP/1R3K2/1P1r1B2/8 w - - 0 40@@EndFEN@@  40.Be1  Nd4  . }

Rxb2 41. Rd1 Ne5 42. Rd6+ Ke7
{ Our passed pawn is much stronger and we are making progress on the kingside. }
43. Kg1 Rc2
{ This was a rapid game, and I took a few conservative choices in converting here, so that I don't blunder anything. But the win is never really in doubt anymore. }
44. Rb6 Nxg4 45. Rb7+ Ke6 46. Be1 { 46.Bd4  f3  47.Rb6+  Kd7  48.Be3  Re2-+ }

Kf3 b3 53. Rb6 Nc4 54. Rb8 b2 55. c6 b1=Q
{ Teimour finally resigned. As I mentioned, this was less of an adventure, but I think it is a nice demonstration of Black's advantages in these thematic structures and a great example of why you shouldn't be afraid of endgames, even if they don't look as attractive at the first glance. }

{ For the last model game, I have chosen another game of mine − one I haven't looked at in a while and the one I was very happy to stumble upon when browsing some old games to choose for this course. It is a very messy game and one of the best examples of why I fell in love with this opening in the first place. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bg5 Ne4
{ 4...Bg7  is myrecommendation in the course, but the text move is perfectly fine and often leads to very sharp games as well. Back in the day, I was more inclined towards the non-gambit move. }
5. Bh4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 dxc4 7. e3 Be6
{ There was a period where I got a lot of games in this system with varying results, but mainly decent results. This is a sharp variation that leads to messy games, which I have always enjoyed. }
8. Nf3
{ These days,  8.Be2  and  8.Qb1  are probably considered more critical, but the theoretical coverage of this variation is beyond the scope of this game − or this course, for that matter. }

11... c5
{ Beginning the fight for the center right away, but in order to play this move, Black needs to be ready to sacrifice material.   11...Qd7  12.O-O  c5  13.Bxc4  looks fine, but there were some games played in 2004 @@StartBracket@@very recently in terms of this model game@@EndBracket@@ that proved that White has a bit of a pull there. }
