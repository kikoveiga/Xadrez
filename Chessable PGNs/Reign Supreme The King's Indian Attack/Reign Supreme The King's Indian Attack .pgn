{ Welcome to the King's Indian Attack world!  This is my 3rd course for Chessable and as the title suggests it is about the King's Indian Attack  (KIA)  . What is KIA? It is a system of playing for White which is characterized by moves 1. e4 2. d3 3. Nd2 4. Ngf3 5. g3 6. Bg2 7. O-O. It can also be reached via different move orders but the most popular alternative to 1. e4 + 2. d3 etc. is 1. Nf3 2. g3 3. Bg2 4. O-O 5. d3 6. Nbd2 7. e4. In many cases, these positions will transpose to each other but both of them have some pros and cons:  a  1. e4 move order:  PROS:  - White avoids   1.Nf3  d5  which is not to everybody's taste  - This is the move order usually chosen by modern KIA player  - You can use it as a weapon vs for example the Sicilian and French while sticking to your favourite lines in other openings  CONS  - White has to allow   1.e4  e5  and   1.e4  d5  which are not ideal openings for the KIA set-up  b  1.Nf3 move order:  PROS:  - White avoids   1.e4  e5  and   1.e4  d5  so he is guaranteed to reach the KIA setup  - Ideal for the King's Indian Defence players  CONS:  - White allows   1.Nf3  d5  where Black can choose from multiple setups such as  2.g3  Nf6  3.Bg2  Bg4  (reversed Torre)  or 3... Bf5  (reversed London)  or 3... c5  (reversed KID)  .  - Black has some additional options such as 1... f5  All in all, it wasn't an easy decision but I decided to stick to the 1.e4 move order. The biggest reason is that the reversed Torre and the reversed London are not to everyone's taste and I thought I will follow a 'pure' form of the KIA which was favoured by Bobby Fischer and the best chess coach in history, Mark Dvoretsky. I started to play the King's Indian Attack regularly around 3 years ago. I fell in love with that opening when watching Hikaru Nakamura's streams. Firstly, I started employing this setup in the faster time control games but later I discovered that it is a perfect weapon for beating lower-rated players. Why is that the case? You will reach certain types of positions when you play this opening. Very rarely you will see piece exchanges and in many cases, even pawns won't be exchanged. That means that your opponent can't easily simplify the position and you will have a ton of chances to outplay him in the middlegame or in the endgame. Also, he won't be able to prepare with computer-like variations, because the positions will be just equal and there are almost no forced lines - with some exceptions of course. If you add the fact that in many cases your opponent will have a decent repertoire after 1.d4 and 1.e4  (main lines)  it is very likely that after you employ the KIA setup he may be forced to enter the unfamiliar territory. If you combine these aspects of the KIA, it is obvious that your lower-rated opponents will hate it since they can't out prepare you in the main line Najdorf. But I'd like to give you a small warning! This opening is usually perfect when you face a lower-rated or equal opponent. Whenever you play someone much stronger it is not a bad weapon but now it is your opponent who probably wants to avoid exchanges and outplay you in an equal position. Don't get me wrong! It is a good opening to use even against a higher-rated opponent but I can imagine that he will be more afraid of some more aggressive lines. Before I present you a list of some pros of this system let me just inform you that in most of the lines Black will be objectively equal. That means that if he doesn't commit any mistake you won't be able to win the game. But when you think about it, it is a case with all of the openings! The difference is that in most of the KIA variations, White scores 60%+. That means, that in practice it is unavoidable for Black not to go wrong. Now some pros:  - The King's Indian Attack was used by Bobby Fischer who claimed that this is a really good opening vs systems with ... e6. He scored a few brilliant victories and some of his games are annotated in the 'Model Games' chapter.  - Another positive aspect of playing the KIA setup is that you will reach it in every game with the White pieces while Black will witness this setup in like 2-3% of his games. That means that you will have like 30-40 times bigger experience than your villain colleague.  - Also, if you are a person who puts King's safety as his priority - if that is a case for you, we are in the same team! - you are guaranteed to have a safe King in this opening. If Black ever tries to launch a razor-sharp attack on your Monarch you will punish very quickly. I promise! No attacks on your King! These are always objectively bad for your opponent!  - This opening should suit players with a dynamic positional style but there is something about the KIA that some players may find very helpful. This opening is based more on plans and understanding than precise calculations. Of course, there will be positions where nothing can substitute precise calculations, but these cases will be quite rare; or at least much more rare than in the mainstream openings.  - I think that the KIA is a perfect practical weapon for classical chess, but for rapid and blitz - it is a real killer! You will be familiar with plans and ideas and in most cases, you will be able to save time on the clock. On the other hand, your opponent will usually waste time to try to come up with a sensible plan, which is not easy in this opening.  - Another positive aspect of this opening is that when you make an inaccuracy or a mistake it usually means that you either lose the initiative or just guarantee equal chances for your opponent. On the other hand, if Black goes wrong - he is often mated. Take a look at some of the model games where the French Defence was played. Black is often dead after only one mistake.  There are many strong players that used the KIA in their careers but I think that a player that deserves the most praise is GM Amin Bassem from Egypt. He plays this opening regularly against top players with outstanding results. It shouldn't surprise you that many of his games are analysed in the 'Model games' chapter.  Now some non-chess related things:  - There is a video recorded for the course. I think it may be a nice addition for some of you and as a bonus, you have a golden opportunity to see me in a jacket! Normally, I'd go with my Adidas slav clothing but sometimes you need to sacrifice a part of you for a bigger reason!  - There are arrows added and I will quickly explain my chosen colours:  green - ideas and plans  blue - also ideas and plans, but the ones that have a very high chance of being played next  red - careful, it's hot! Don't touch that! The same rule applies here, you see something red? It is wrong.  yellow - with this colour I marked secondary plans or additional ideas. Sometimes there are two plans in the position so one of them is usually blue and the other one is yellow.  In the end, I want to say that there are two lines for which I suggested two different approaches. One of them is   1.e4  c6  2.d3  d5  3.Nd2  e5  4.Ngf3  Bd6  and now:   - 5. g3 - a traditional and natural way of playing the position  - 5. d4!? a more modern and higher scoring approach  The other line that I've added is   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  e6  3.d3  and whenever Black goes for ... d5 we play Qe2 instead of more natural and more popular Nbd2. I devoted a whole chapter called 'KIA vs Sicilian - 2...e6 lines with Qe2' to this great variation which is probably my favourite line in the whole course.  There are a lot of annotated games added to this course. There are 37 annotated model games, usually played by strong grandmasters. I also added a chapter with my KIA games - there are 16 of them. If you want to laugh - taking a look at my games it is a great opportunity!  Finally, I will mention that in the 'French' chapters I mention the Plan A and Plan B quite often. I explain what I mean by that in the theory section a couple of times but if you decide to look at the variations randomly not step by step, then it may be unfamiliar for you. So here I provide you with brief explanations: In positions similar to 1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 Nc6 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Be7 7.O-O O-O 8. Re1 b5 9. e5 Nd7, the Plan A is an attacking scheme for White based on the moves Nd2-f1 + h2-h4 + Nf1-h2-g4 followed by h4-h5-h6 - with or without Bf4 included. The Plan B is to play h2-h4 followed by Ng5 and Qh5 but it is usually less effective due to the GM Uhlmann's discovery which you can see in the second and the third line of the 3rd chapter - about French Main Line.  I really hope that you will love this opening as much as I do. I think it should be clear but let me mention that all of the lines have been thoroughly checked with the Stockfish chess engine.  Sincerely  FM Kamil 'Kaldas90' Plichta }

1. e4 e6
{ The French Defence is the 3rd most popular opening against 1. e4. When I think about the King's Indian Attack - KIA - after 1. e4, it is this opening that comes into my mind. The great Bobby Fischer played a few games vs that tough-to-crack defence scoring remarkable victories. I decided that it is worth starting with 1... e6 so here we go. }
2. d3
{ Of course, if you want to play the KIA, you need to start with this move.  2.g3 ?!  d5  and White doesn't have time for  3.d3  due to  3...dxe4  and Black will get Queens off the board - it is not what we want. }
2... d5
{ A 'French' move. 2... c5 would transpose to the e6 Sicilian - Chapter #5. }
3. Nd2
{ Just in time. Now, if Black decides to go for  3...dxe4  we can safely play  4.dxe4  and the Knight on  d2  is very useful. }
3... Nf6
{ In practice, Black very often starts with this move. It is necessary to memorize arising variations - especially 4... Nc6 and 4... Bc5 - because we can't follow with our standard plans there. }
4. Ngf3 Nc6
{ A third most popular move after 4... c5 and 4... b6. It is necessary for you - dear reader - not to follow up stereotypically. }
5. c3
{ An excellent move. Note that  5.g3 ?!  is dubious because Black can play  5...dxe4  6.dxe4  Bc5  7.Bg2  O-O  8.O-O  e5  and Black's position has to be better due to great control over the centre. Databases confirm that statement giving Black around 60%! Please avoid this position.  A rule of thumb would be that if Black puts his piece on the c-file on move 4 - the same will happen in the 4... Nc6 line - then we can't play g3. }
5... a5
{ The most popular move. Black makes a waiting move to see what our plans are. If we play g3 he may stick to ... dxe4 followed by ...Bc5 and ...e5. }
6. e5
{ Playing in style of the reversed Philidor with 6. Be2 is also possible but I think not to my taste. }
6... Nd7 7. d4
{ We got a position similar to the Advance French with 3. e5. In fact, this is a very good version of the aforementioned opening because the Black Knight is misplaced on c6. It blocks Black's most typical French plan which is to play ...c5 undermining White's centre. }
7... f6
{ Being unable to strike with the c-pawn Black has to strike with the f-one to get any shade of counterplay. }
8. Bb5
{ I like this move a lot. We pin both of Black's Knights and indirectly fight for the e5-square combining that with development. }
8... fxe5 9. dxe5 Be7 10. Nd4
{ We break a basic rule here. Just please don't tell my parents. We shouldn't move the same piece twice in the opening but this position requires active measures. }
10... Ndxe5 { This is inaccurate due to } 11. f4
{ and Black has to go for a mediocre piece sacrifice with } 11... O-O 12. fxe5
Nxe5 13. N2f3
{ White will safely castle and if we don't have problems with our King here, then I am confident about our chances. }

8... Qc7 9. c3
{ A start of one of the most typical plans associated with the KIA. } 9... Bd7
10. a3
{ White wants to expand on the queenside with b2-b4. It is better for Black to let us proceed with our idea because stopping it with ...a5 will have unpleasant consequences. }
10... a5 11. a4
{ We gain eternal control over the b5-square and we will land our Knight there with the Nd2-b1-a3-b5 manoeuvre. Note that if our Knight would stay on b1 as in Sicilians we would be able to save two tempos.   I want to mention that  11.d4 !?  is also an interesting plan  with the idea of playing e4-e5 and attacking on the kingside. Just remember not to combine both a4 and d4 because then the b4-square would be mortally weakened. }

{ This is the 2nd most popular move after 7... O-O. Black's idea is to provoke White into playing e4-e5 and then he will happily castle long. }
8. Re1
{ We would play this sooner or later so it is better to stick to it now. It is a useful waiting move. Note that  8.e5 ?!  would be premature due to  8...Nd7  9.Re1  Qc7  10.Qe2  Bb7  followed by long castling.  Black will be able to attack us on the kingside with moves such as . ..g5 or ...h5. Also, White's score in this line isn't particularly convincing so 8. Re1 is our move ! }
8... Bb7 9. a3
{ I really like this little move. We want to get our standard plan of going c2-c3 + a2-a3 forcing through b2-b4 but I think it is necessary to start with a3.   9.c3  allows Black to change his plans completely and play  9...O-O  after which  10.e5  Nd7  11.Nf1  b5  12.h4  is not that effective because Black can play  12...b4.  The pawn on c3 is a hook for Black's queenside actions and in the main line after 7... O-O we rarely play c3. That's why I prefer 9. a3 to see Black's idea. }
9... Qc7 10. c3
{ There is also an interesting line for reversed KID lovers.  10.exd5  Nxd5  11.Nc4  with a typical reversed KID position.   Note that after  10.exd5  Black can't play  exd5 ?!  due to  11.b4 !  and now  cxb4 ?!  is bad for Black after  12.axb4  Nxb4  13.Ba3  O-O  14.Rxe7  Qxe7  15.c3  with a big advantage for White.   After  10.exd5  exd5 ?!  11.b4  the only chance for Black would be  11...O-O  but  12.bxc5  bxc5  13.Rb1  guarantees White a small edge.  I give you this line as an alternative if you like positions arising after exd5 Nxd5. }
10... dxe4
{ It is possible for Black to clarify the situation in the centre. White wasted some time playing a3 and c3 so it is quite a logical continuation. }
11. dxe4 O-O 12. Nc4
{ As I've already mentioned I don't like to commit to  12.e5  when the centre isn't stable. After  12...Nd7  13.Qe2  Rad8  14.h4  Black has a clear plan of playing ... a6 followed by ...b5 and ...c4. Then he will plant the Knight on c5 and eventually d3 - it is not my cup of tea. }

Qc7 9. e5 Nd7 10. Qe2 b5 11. Nf1
{ Before we dig deeper into theoretical variations I want to show you White's basic attacking setup - plan A. It is marked by blue arrows. A secondary plan for White marked with yellow arrows is to play h2-h4 + Ng5 + Qh5 - plan B - but you need to watch out for Wolfgang Uhlmann's defensive concept which is analysed in the next two lines. Back to White's basic attacking plan which will be called a 'Plan A' in the rest of my repertoire. White starts with Nf1 and he will follow it up by h2-h4 Nf1-h2-g4 and h4-h5-h6 to attack Black's kingside weaknesses. Sometimes White will insert Bf4 in the process to support the e5-pawn. Black has a tough decision. If the White h-pawn reaches h6, it will create a lot of dark-squared weaknesses in the Black's camp. On the other hand, if he stops our expansion with ... h7-h6, his h6-pawn will be prone to all kinds of sacrifices.  Let me also mention that Black will look for counter chances on the other side of the board. We need to remember that whenever the Black pawn will land on a4, we need to respond with Fischer's a2-a3 patent. That avoids our queenside being weakened by ... a4-a3. It is funny because it is the same scenario that Black faces on the kingside but the fact that our King is on the kingside allows White to stop Black's expansion with this little a3 pawn thrust. }

{ This is a starting position of the standard KIA vs the French Defence. I want to share with you two things: 1  White's results in practice are excellent; 2  Engine's evaluations may be misleading. The thing about engines is that they underestimate White's attacking chances on the kingside. The same thing happens in the classical lines of the King's Indian Defence. I saw many cases when the engine gave 'a winning advantage' for White but after a few moves it changed it to a winning advantage for Black. Black's defensive task is not easy at all. White's plans of storming the kingside are clear: Nf1-h2-g4 or Nf1-e3-g4 - the Ne3 route is especially useful when Black's Queen is on c7. Then Nxd5 ideas are very effective - see Plichta - Sliwerski from 'My KIA games' chapter to see what I mean. White's other plan includes pushing the h-pawn up the board to force weaknesses on the dark squares. Black may stop this plan by playing ...h7-h6 but then he has to be ready for sacrifices on h6. }

{ Personally, I really like this setup. White abandons his usual c3 + a3 + b4 ideas and focuses on planting the Knight on d5. Note that the d5-square has been mortally weakened and White swifts his attention to that point of the board.   That being said, White can also play in a stereotypical way by  7.c3  Nge7  8.a3  O-O  9.b4  h6  10.Nbd2  Be6  11.Nb3  c4  12.dxc4  Bxc4  13.Re1  with a complicated battle ahead. }
7... Nge7 8. Nd2
{ White will increase his control over the centre with Nc4 to come next. Moving the Knight helped to increase the scope of our light-squared Bishop. True, it is behind the e-pawn at the moment but it secures the d5-outpost for the other Knight. Let me tell you that this setup was used by Mr Carlsen himself a couple of times. }
8... O-O 9. Nc4 Be6 10. Nd5
{ Just in time.  10.a4  would allow Black to play  10...d5.  White will play a2-a4 next followed by c2-c3 when our pieces and pawns take away all of the important squares from our opponent's pieces. }
10... Qd7 11. a4 f5 12. c3 { With f2-f4 and a4-a5 to come next. } *

1. e4 c5
{ The most popular of Black's responses to 1. e4. By playing the Sicilian Black is ready for tactical fireworks and long theoretical lines. It is very useful to have the KIA ready whenever facing these players. Please note that the resulting positions will quite often transpose to the French lines. }
2. Nf3
{ It is useful to include this move before committing to d3 or g3. Please note that the resulting position can be also reached via the 1. Nf3 c5 2. e4 move order. }
2... Nc6
{ In this chapter we will take a look at Black's lines connected with 2... Nc6 and 2... d6. After 2... e6 I will recommend a specific setup connected with a quick Qe2. You can check my analysis of that line in the next chapter. I want to mention that lines with 2... g6 will transpose to either 2... d6 or 2... Nc6 - or even sometimes to the lines with ...e6 ...d5 and ...Nge7/...Nf6 from the previous chapter. I didn't analyse variations such as 2... a6 or 2... Nf6 - you can use the same setup against all of them and they will transpose one to another sooner or later. }
3. d3
{ If you want to play the  3.g3  move order you have to be prepared to meet  3...d5  4.exd5  Qxd5  5.Nc3  Qe6+  6.Be2.  If the resulting position looks interesting to you, then I recommend taking a look at GM Munoz's games. }

{ This is one of the positions that you will reach quite often. Black plays the reversed English being a tempo down. It is important because we will use that tempo against Black. }
7. c3
{ This is a favourite of mine. There are also moves such as 7. Nbd2 or 7. h3 but I choose this system to be our main line.   Note that  7.h3  allows Black to go  7...e5  followed by ... Be6 and ...Qd7 so I wouldn't recommend that. }

After  8...d4  we are forced to play some kind of reversed KID position but I don't like the fact that our Rook is on  e1.  From f1 it may prepare f2-f4 break but it requires losing two tempos to go back to f1. Let me show you two short lines to show you my doubts.   8.Re1  d4  9.Nc4  allows  9...b5  and  10.Nxe5  runs into  10...f6.  If we need to retreat after 9... b5 it indicates that something went wrong.   The other line that I don't like is  8.Re1  d4  9.a4  c5  10.Nc4  Nbc6  and Black managed to get all of his needed moves. This is a reversed KID position but outside of this repertoire and also not to my personal taste. }

{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter. After that lengthy introduction - let's proceed ! }

d5
{ 2... e5 is covered under 1... e5 2...

3. exd5

That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter. After that lengthy introduction - let's proceed ! }
1... d5
{ Some people call this opening The Scandinavian Defence but for us - KIA players - a more appropriate name would be a pain under our back. Why ? Because we can't use our favourite setup and need to play something else. Still, I think I managed to get positions which at least resemble the King's Indian Attack. }
2. exd5
{ We need to take. 2. d3 allows 2... dxe4 while 2. e5 ?! Bf5 with the worst version of the Caro/French after ...e6 next is unacceptable. }

{ This is the most popular move for Black trying to keep the material equality. }
6. Nbd2
{ This is the reason behind 5. d3. After 6. Nc3 Bb4 it is not so clear. Statistics also confirm that 6. Nbd2 - 71.8% is better than 6. Nc3 - 37.9%!!! Black shouldn't try to defend the e4-pawn because it will lead to more problems. }

{ 12...Bg6 ?!  doesn't lead anywhere due to  13.Qc4  Bb6  14.Nh4  and Black's light-squared Bishop is in trouble. If we manage to exchange it for our Knight we will have a longterm advantage. }
13. Qh4
{ If you don't feel that you want to exchange Queens, then you can go for 13. Nh4 with similar ideas. It is a matter of taste which move to choose. If you think that your opponent is worse than you in tactical play, then strive for 13. Nh4. If you think you are more likely to beat him in the endgame, then 13. Qh4 is for you. }

{ I think White has a more pleasant position. We can strengthen our grip on the light squares with a2-a4 and Be4. At some point, Black will be obliged to play ...a5 or ...a6 due to a4-a5 threats and then we will put our Rook on b1 followed by Be3 with nice pressure. }

The text move is quite tricky because Black will try to reach positions which are not typical for the French Defence. One of his ideas after our g3 is to wait for Bg2 and go for ...dxe4 dxe4 followed by ...Ba6 and we can't castle. Fortunately, this line doesn't work for Black tactically so you can sleep well ! }

{ I had a tough time deciding what to do with the 10... Qc8 line. Firstly, I wanted to briefly mention a few moves for White but it wouldn't be fair. On the other hand, there is so small chance of getting this line in practice that it would be a waste of time and energy to learn 10 more crazy lines. If that would be an aggressive repertoire I think I would add them as trainable variations but because we study the KIA I finally decided to show you these lines in comments. Let's start.   10...Qc8  starts a crazy line that doesn't lead to equality for Black. I need to mention that this analysis is fully influenced by an engine.  11.a3 !  Nxc2   11...Nbd5  12.Nce5  Bxf3   12...Bd6  13.Nxf7   12...Be7  13.c4   12...Bc5  13.b4  13.Bxf3  and White will be able to push his c-pawn two squares up the board.  The next few moves are forced.  12.Bg5 !  Nxa1  13.Bxf6  Bb7   13...gxf6 ?  14.Qxe4  with much better chances for White.   13...Qb7  is another possibility.  14.Bc3 !

O-O  19.Nxh6+  Bxh6  20.Bxb7  Qxb7  21.Qxe6+  Rf7  22.Ne5  winning.  15.Nce5  Nc5   15...Ba6  16.Qc2  Bxf1  17.Qc6+  16.b4  Ne4   16...Ba6  17.Nc4  Nd7  18.Nd4  17.Nd4  Nc3   17...Nd6  18.Bxb7  Qxb7   18...Nxb7  19.Qf3  19.Nxf7  18.Qh5  g6  19.Qg5  h6  20.Qf6  Rh7  21.Ndc6  g5  22.Re1  with Nxf7 to come next. I hope you forgive me almost no comments to presented lines. I think these one of the sickest that I've ever analysed and I included them ONLY for sake of completness. Under any circumstances - even with a gun pointed at your head - you shouldn't memorize them. }

{ White wants to expand on the queenside with b2-b4. It is better for Black to let us proceed with our idea because stopping it with ...a5 will have unpleasant consequences. }
10... a5 11. a4
{ We gain eternal control over the b5-square and we will land our Knight there with the Nd2-b1-a3-b5 manoeuvre. Note that if our Knight would stay on b1 as in Sicilians we would be able to save two tempos.   I want to mention that  11.d4 !?  is also an interesting plan  with the idea of playing e4-e5 and attacking on the kingside. Just remember not to combine both a4 and d4 because then the b4-square would be mortally weakened. }

White's pieces are very active.  13...Nd4  is the only move for Black not to get a strategically suspicious position.  14.Nc3  planning a4 - a5 - a6  14...Bd6  is the best move for Black.   14...Qxb2?  15.Ne2  Nxe2+  16.Rxe2  White will continue with Rb1 and a strategically winning position. The pawn deficit doesn't matter too much here.  15.Nb5  Nxb5  16.cxb5  Qxb5  17.a4  Qe8  18.d4  with huge compensation for White. }

10... c4 { 10...cxd4  11.Nb3  += } 11. c3

I think that the move order may be a matter of personal taste but if you prefer to keep things more simple, then 15. Nbd2 is good enough. If you, however, are a trappy creature like the author of this book, then you will love 15. Bf4 ! }

{ Not fearing ...g5 is the best way to play for White.   17.h4 ?  would be a big mistake due to  17...Rae8  with the idea of playing ...e5 and it is not clear who is better. White will play Qc2 or Qf1 next clearing a way for the Rook to reach e1. Move such as Bh3 to put more pressure on the e6-pawn is also interesting and worth considering. }

Qc7 9. e5 Nd7 10. Qe2 b5 11. Nf1
{ Before we dig deeper into theoretical variations I want to show you White's basic attacking setup - plan A. It is marked by blue arrows. A secondary plan for White marked with yellow arrows is to play h2-h4 + Ng5 + Qh5 - plan B - but you need to watch out for Wolfgang Uhlmann's defensive concept which is analysed in the next two lines. Back to White's basic attacking plan which will be called a 'Plan A' in the rest of my repertoire. White starts with Nf1 and he will follow it up by h2-h4 Nf1-h2-g4 and h4-h5-h6 to attack Black's kingside weaknesses. Sometimes White will insert Bf4 in the process to support the e5-pawn. Black has a tough decision. If the White h-pawn reaches h6, it will create a lot of dark-squared weaknesses in the Black's camp. On the other hand, if he stops our expansion with ... h7-h6, his h6-pawn will be prone to all kinds of sacrifices.  Let me also mention that Black will look for counter chances on the other side of the board. We need to remember that whenever the Black pawn will land on a4, we need to respond with Fischer's a2-a3 patent. That avoids our queenside being weakened by ... a4-a3. It is funny because it is the same scenario that Black faces on the kingside but the fact that our King is on the kingside allows White to stop Black's expansion with this little a3 pawn thrust. }

{ White built up a nice attacking position on the kingside. Check Yuferov - Zakharov, Moscow 1995 to see how to proceed.   The other decent possibility is  16.Ne3  using the Queen on c7 against Black. We have a typical threat of Nxd5 followed by e6 hanging in the air, which practically forces Black to lose a tempo. 16... Qa5 17. c4!? White stops Black's initiative on the queenside. }

See Dvoretsky - Damsky, Moscow 1970 to see how Black can be easily crushed.   The other way for the Knight - which would be typical for the ...  Qc7  lines - is  13.Ne3  not only preparing Ng4, but also threatening Nxd5.  You don't have to be discouraged by  13...Ndxe5?  since after  14.Nxe5  Nxe5  15.Ng4  White gets the pawn back with a highly superior position. }

Bf5  15.g4!  secures White a small plus. However, the character of the game is quite atypical for the King's Indian Attack, which makes 10. c3 our preferred line. }

I will also mention that a dream scenario for White would be to get a position with a White Knight on d5 and Black would be left with the dark-squared Bishop. }

The thing about engines is that they underestimate White's attacking chances on the kingside. The same thing happens in the classical lines of the King's Indian Defence. I saw many cases when the engine gave 'a winning advantage' for White but after a few moves it changed it to a winning advantage for Black. Black's defensive task is not easy at all. White's plans of storming the kingside are clear: Nf1-h2-g4 or Nf1-e3-g4 - the Ne3 route is especially useful when Black's Queen is on c7. Then Nxd5 ideas are very effective - see Plichta - Sliwerski from 'My KIA games' chapter to see what I mean.

11. exd5 Nb4 12. Ne3
{ Last moves were forced. Now, if Black wants to prove that giving up a pair of Bishops makes any sense, he needs to go for ... f5. }
12... f5

13. c3 Na6 14. f4
{ I tried to make other moves work, but I finally decided that stopping Black's kingside pawn storm is necessary. Engines may tell you a different story, but I went through some lines and it would require a surgical precision to defend. }
14... exf4 { Otherwise White will take on e5 with a big advantage. } 15. Rxf4
{ Taking with a pawn would be much weaker due to its potential weakness and Black would have an easy game with ... Nc7 and ... b5. }
15... Nc7 { Black has to improve his pieces. } 16. Rf1
{ We arrive at a critical position for the whole line. Last few moves were forced, but now Black has some options. I think that we should treat 16... Qd7 as the main move, because it is the most obvious and it prepares ... Rae8 to finish development. }
16... Qd7
{ 16...g5?  doesn't work due to  17.Qh5  and White is on a verge of victory.   Better is  16...b5  but after  17.a4  b4  18.Bd2  a5  19.Qb3  safeguarding the d5-pawn  19...Qd7  20.Rae1  finishing development Black doesn't have any sensible and dangerous plan. The best what I could find is  20...Bh6  , but White is on top after  21.Nc4.  After  21...Bxd2  22.Nxd2  we can simply improve the position by means of Qc4 or Nc4 and double Rooks on the e-file. On the other hand, Black's Knights are bad pieces that don't have any active duties. }
17. a4
{ Gaining space on the queenside, stopping ... b5 and in some cases preparing Nc4. }
17... Rae8 18. a5
{ The same thing, we gain more space. Black's army is fully developed, but the question remains - How is Black going to attack us on the kingside? The e7-Knight is a bad piece that can't be easily improved. If it goes to c8 it will be restricted by the a5-pawn - another point for us! }
18... Bh6
{ This is the only sensible option. Black wants to take on e3 and then capture the pawn on d5. }
19. d4
{ Remember, a side with a pair of Bishops wants to open up the position. }
19... Bxe3+ 20. Bxe3 Nexd5
{ Firstly,  20...c4  looks positionally desirable but it fails to  21.Bh6  Rf7  22.Qa4!  and White will take on  c4  with a big advantage.   Secondly,  20...Ncxd5?  is bad due to  21.Bh6  Rf7  22.dxc5  dxc5  23.Re1  with a story of a thousand pins. White is winning with a direct threat being  Rxe7 }
21. Bh6 Rf7 22. Qb3 { Simply attacking b7. } 22... Ne3 23. Bxe3 Rxe3 24. Qxb7
{ In such an open position a Bishop should be superior to a Knight. Also, Black has more weaknesses and White will open up the position by means of dxc5. }

{ The most popular of Black's responses to 1. e4. By playing the Sicilian Black is ready for tactical fireworks and long theoretical lines. It is very useful to have the KIA ready whenever facing these players. Please note that the resulting positions will quite often transpose to the French lines. }
2. Nf3
{ It is useful to include this move before committing to d3 or g3. Please note that the resulting position can be also reached via the 1. Nf3 c5 2. e4 move order. }
2... Nc6
{ In this chapter we will take a look at Black's lines connected with 2... Nc6 and 2... d6. After 2... e6 I will recommend a specific setup connected with a quick Qe2. You can check my analysis of that line in the next chapter. I want to mention that lines with 2... g6 will transpose to either 2... d6 or 2...

{ The most popular move but very risky. After any other approach, we will play Bf4 followed by Nc2. If Black castles kingside, then our attack will be very strong due to his weakened position on that side of the board. }
13. Rb1
{ White is much better. We have a clear plan of attacking on the queenside. Check out analysis of the game Morozevich - Lastin, Moscow 2001. }

It is also possible to employ this setup against the French in the following move order: 1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Qe2 and in most cases, you will transpose to positions from this chapter. On the other hand, you need to be ready for some extra lines there connected with a fast ...b6 or ...dxe4 followed by ...e5. So the decision is yours ! In the Sicilian move order, it is the best weapon ever ! In the French move order, it is possible to play it but I like to see my opponent committed to ...d5 before I move my Queen to e2. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 b6
{ This has been recommended in some sources. Black won't go for ... d5 but will play ... d6 followed by ... Bb7, ... Be7 and ... O-O instead. The downside of this approach is that this is quite passive for Black and I think we should get a good game. }
4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O Nf6 7. Re1

9... O-O 10. b3 { I prefer to play this move without including Nc4. } 10... d5
{ Black should play this pawn break sooner or later. If Black waits with  10...Qc7  White can just play  11.Bb2  with ideas such as Nc4 followed by e4-e5, or even Nh4 followed by f2-f4 may be interesting. }
11. e5 Ne8 12. h4
{ With ideas similar to the French Defence. White doesn't have to go all-in on the kingside because his position on the queenside prevents Black from pushing the pawns there. Note that in this line there is big freedom of implementing your own ideas. The setup that I've chosen is my personal preference. If Black decided to fight in the centre with a thematic  12...f6  then White strikes with  13.a5  Nc7  14.axb6  axb6  15.Rxa8  Bxa8  16.exf6  Bxf6  17.Nf1  with ideas such as N1h2-g4 or Bh3 with a nice pressure on Black's position. }

White changes gears and tries to use the fact that the c-pawn blocks a natural developing square for the Black Knight and the d6-Bishop is prone to our Knight's jumps. Let me tell you that White scores 51.2% after 5. g3 and 56.4% for 5. d4. These numbers differ even more in my 2000+ database - 49% for 5. g3 and 58% for 5. d4. Knowing these numbers we can easily indicate that Black faces practical problems against 5. d4. I decided it is a very interesting line that deserves to be analysed. Here we go. }
5... exd4
{ Virtually the only move. 5... Nd7 is weaker and would transpose to the 4... Nd7 5. d4 Bd6 line of the previous chapter. }
6. exd5 { Clarifying situation in the centre is the strongest concept. } 6...
cxd5
{ The most popular continuation. Black accepts the fact that he will play with an isolated pawn on d5. Note that by employing the Caro-Kann Defence, Black may not be familiar with different plans and subtleties of the Isolated Queen's Pawn positions. }
7. Nxd4
{ The choice of most top players. It was also possible to go for  7.Bb5+  and it scores even better than the text move but I am not a huge fan of the position after  7...Nc6 !  8.O-O  Qb6. }
7... Nc6 { Countering White's plan of going for Bb5+. } 8. Bb5 Ne7 9. O-O O-O
10. N2f3 Bg4 11. Be2 h6 12. h3 Bh5 13. Be3
{ With mutual chances. White will solidify the centre with c2-c3. White's plan should be to exchange pieces - ideally the dark-squared Bishops - because then Black would be left with a potentially bad Bishop on h5. Black, on the other hand, should avoid exchanges and try to create an attack. }

1. --
{ I decided to add this very promising 6. Bd3 line. It leads to equality with best play, but usually, Black makes a ton of mistakes early in the game. If you choose this 6. Bd3 weapon as your mainline, then I suggest pausing 6. exd5 lines from the previous chapter, to keep your learning and reviewing experience as comfortable as possible. if you learn two lines, then it might cause some issues while reviewing. The same goes for 5. g3 or 5. d4 - you can learn both, but choosing one option would be ideal! }

1. e4
{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter. After that lengthy introduction - let's proceed ! }

{ It is also possible to start with 2. d3 and it would be slightly lighter in theory but our move order provokes Black to play 2... f5 or 2... d5 which are bad for Black. Also, if we go 2. d3 Black knows what we are doing and can adjust accordingly. After 2. Nf3 he still has a guessing game and he needs to for a setup that he maybe would prefer to avoid after KIA. }
2... d6 3. g3 Nc6 4. Bg2 Bg4 5. h3 Bh5 6. d3 Nf6 7. O-O Be7 8. c3
{ I like White's chances. We can combine b2-b4 with g3-g4 and Nf3-h4. We can also consider d3-d4 in the future. As you can see, we have three different pawn breaks to go for while Black's plans are not that clear. }

1. e4
{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter. After that lengthy introduction - let's proceed ! }

{ So Black is like a parrot - he speaks by repeating after someone. We should take a close look at this symmetrical position because it will be very hard for us to get an advantage. Even the slightest plus should satisfy us ! }
7. c3
{ There are many different plans available for White but this is my personal favourite. It also scores better than alternatives. }
7... c6
{ We should focus on this continuation.  7...Nc6  allows  8.b4  while after   7...c5  we should strike with a familiar - I hope so  ! - plan of  8.a3  followed by b2-b4. }

10. d4
{ 10.b4  is an interesting alternative with the point being that  10...b5  is weak due to  11.a4.  After the text move, White scored very well - around 80%!.  EDIT: After 8 months since the course has been published, an observant user spotted that this line leads to the same position as the #111 line. There, I suggested 10. b4 as the mainline and here, my recommendation is 10. d4. Considering that these moves are equally good, I decided to leave the variations untouched but I inform you that this is the same position as in the #111 line. }
10... d5

11. exd5 Nxd5
{ If the villain insists on  11...exd4 ?  then  12.Rxe8+  Qxe8  13.dxc6  dxc3  14.cxd7  and he can sign his scoresheet. With his own signature, not copied from us. }
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Rxe5 14. Rxe5 Bxe5 15. Nb3
{ I like this plan the most. White threatens c3-c4 and plans Nc5 or even Na5 in some cases. }

{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter.

{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter.

{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter.

{ White has a weakened kingside structure but our pieces are very active. I think that this position is dynamically balanced. Note that White threatens Bxc6 and Black has to take with the b-pawn due to the hanging Bishop on e7. White's plan may be to strengthen the position with moves such as Kb1 and Qf2 and then develop our Rooks. }

{ By far the most popular move. Black is definitely ready for the Ruy Lopez, Italian, Scotch etc. Is he ready for the King's Indian Attack though ? }
3. d3 Nf6
{ We can reach this position by different move orders. Black can choose 1... e5, 1... Nc6 or 1... Nf6. }
4. g3 d5 { Striking at White's centre is also a popular plan for Black. } 5.
exd5

5... Nxd5 6. Bg2 { Black can now choose from three different Bishop moves. }
6... Be7
{ The most common option, just finishing development and preparing to castle. }
7. O-O O-O 8. Re1
{ I think that this is annoying for Black who needs to make some kind of concession. }
8... Bf6
{ 8...f6  allows White to strike with  9.d4  or you can prepare it with 9. c3 with the other idea being Nh4 and play on the light squares.   After  8...Bg4  Black has to part with his precious Bishop after  9.h3  because  9...Bh5  allows  10.g4  and Nxe5. }
9. Nbd2
{ White will annoy Black with Ne4 ideas. We can also play a2-a3 to take away the b4-square from Black's Knights and then proceed with Ne4 followed by Bd2 and eventually c2-c4 and b2-b4 with a big initiative on the queenside. }

1. e4
{ In this chapter, we will take a look at Black's different 1st move options. A lot of them will very often transpose one to another. For example 1...g6 or 1... d6 can reach the Sicilian chapter and 1... e5, 1... Nc6 and 1... Nf6 should reach the same position too. Of course, some independent treatment is possible and it depends on Black how he is going to handle the position. That being said, I think that White can employ the KIA against any of Black's 1st moves except for 1... d5. Still, I think I managed to find a nice line for White, in which our play will be very similar to the other lines - especially from the Reversed King's Indian Defence chapter. There is one thing that I need to tell before we continue with further analysis. White's setup won't be as effective as against the French, Sicilian or Caro-Kann. The reason for that is that Black can easily claim the centre and follow it up by playing natural moves such as ...e5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 ...Bc5 etc. I hesitated if I want to add this chapter or not but I think it is your choice if you want to employ the KIA against virtually any of Black's defences, or just stick to 1... e6 1... c5 and 1... c6. But, if you insist on playing the King's Indian Attack against everything there is some good news. White won't ever be objectively worse in lines that I suggest. My job will be to present you with variations that lead to interesting positions and fill them with different plans for White. One more thing to point out is that if you have good lines against 1... g6 1... d6 1...e5 etc, then you can safely use them and add the KIA whenever you want. and stick to your lines against variations from this chapter. After that lengthy introduction - let's proceed ! }

2. Nf3
{ It is also possible to start with 2. d3 and it would be slightly lighter in theory but our move order provokes Black to play 2... f5 or 2... d5 which are bad for Black.

5. Bg2 d6
{ 5... O-O will transpose to 5... d6 if Black decides to go for ...d6 or to 4... d5 if he will push his d-pawn to d5. }
6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3
{ I like this approach. White plans to play h2-h3 followed by Be3 with attacking chances on the kingside. }
7... h6 { This is the most common move but I think it is an inaccuracy. } 8.
Na4 { White will get a pair of Bishops. } 8... Bb6 9. Nxb6 axb6 10. h3
{ White can implement different plans. One of them is to play d3-d4 and the other to prepare it a little with b2-b3 and Bb2. As a rule of thumb, we want to open up the position because we have a pair of Bishops. Check out my analysis of Harikrishna - Erenburg, Mainz 2006 to get more feel for the middlegame. }

[Result "*"]

{ Before I go on with the analysis I want to say a few words about GM Vladimir Malaniuk. He was one of the first grandmasters that I've seen in over the board tournaments. I met him a lot of times because he played quite often in Poland. Once I was paired against him with the Black pieces and I prepared a long theoretical line which was quite new so I thought that GM Malaniuk may be unfamiliar with it. He fell into my preparation only to play 6 best moves with White and even strengthen White's play from my preparation ! I lost without a fight. Let me add that he was the biggest expert on the Leningrad Dutch. Unfortunately, he passed away a few years ago. Let's see this game as a tribute to the Ukrainian GM. }

b6
{ Not the most popular move for Black but the position will very often transpose to more popular lines. }
9. c3 a5 10. a3
{ I would play 10. a4 myself securing the b5-square as I've mentioned a few times in the theory section. I don't see the reason behind 10. a3 and GM Malaniuk will play a3-a4 in a few moves. In the theory section, we were obliged to lose a tempo on a2-a3-a4 because we wanted to provoke Black's ...a5. Here, if Black does this move unprovoked, I think we can skip a2-a3. }
10... Ba6 11. exd5 Nxd5 12. Nc4 Bc7 13. a4
{ We've transposed to the 5... Bd6 and 8... Bc7 line of the French Minor Lines Chapter. }
13... Qd7 14. Qb3
{ We have a position that resembles the reversed King's Indian setup. I think that White has a good version of it because he has the b5-square secured and the Knight on c4 is very stable. On the other hand, Black's plans aren't obvious. Normally, he would have a pawn not on e6 but on e5. }
14... Rab8 15. Rd1
{ White prepares d3-d4 in some cases and secures the e1-square for our dark-squared Bishop. It may look strange, but White wants to connect Rooks and for the moment there is no good purpose for our Bishop to serve. Sometimes White wants to play Na3 and our Rook defends the d3-pawn in advance. }
15... Rfd8 16. Bd2 { I would prefer Na3-b5 immediately. } 16... h6 17. Be1 e5
18. Na3 { Regrouping the Knight to b5. } 18... Na7 19. Rd2
{ I think that  19.d4 !  was a way to go with the point being that after  19...e4  20.Nd2  Be2  White can sacrifice an exchange with  21.Nxe4 !  with great compensation. }
19... Qe6 20. Rad1 Bb7 21. Qc2
{ I think that White missed his chance on 19th move and now Black consolidated his position. }
21... Nf6 22. Nh4
{ I think that White understood that he messed up and he decided to at least exchange some pieces. Why is it important ? White has less space and lacks an active square for all of our pieces. If we exchange one or two pair of them, then it will be much easier to activate the remaining pieces. }
22... g5 23. Bxb7 Rxb7 24. Ng2 Nc6 25. Ra1
{ White decided to overprotect the a4-pawn and free the d1-square for the Queen. It may go to e2 or f3 later. }
25... Bb8 26. Qd1 Rbd7 27. Qe2 Qh3 28. Ne3 e4
{ I think that this is a wrong idea. Black should keep the c5/e5 grip on the position. }
29. dxe4 Rxd2 30. Bxd2 Nxe4 31. Be1
{ White got rid of his problems. If he manages to consolidate, then Black's weaknesses all over the board may tell. Our dream scenario would be to exchange everything and leave only the Knight vs the dark-squared Bishop. It would be restrained by its own pawns and our Knight would be dominant. }
31... Bc7 32. Qf3 Qe6 33. Nac4 Ne7 34. Rd1 Rxd1 35. Qxd1 f5 36. Nd2
{ Proceeding with exchanges policy. } 36... Nf6 37. Qb3 Qxb3 38. Nxb3
{ I think that only White can play for a win here. Black has some weaknesses and White will bring his pieces towards the centre and the queenside. }
38... f4 39. Nc4 f3
{ It is a very responsible decision. Our King will need to take more time to activate itself, but on the other hand, Black's pawn may be weak on f3. }

{ White can safely start to move with his King towards the Queenside. } 45...

48. Nxe4 Kxe4 49. Kd2 Ne7 50. Kc2 Nf5 51. Nd2+ Kd5 52. Nf1
{ White wants to play b2-b3 to secure more light squares. } 52... c4 53. Bd2

I saw tens of his games in my database and his results are really impressive ! This is only the start of my analysis of his games. More to come ! }
1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. Ngf3 b6 5. g3 dxe4 6. dxe4 Bc5 7. Bg2 Ba6
{ This move scores quite well for Black but as I've mentioned in a theoretical section, it is objectively not a good concept. }
8. c4 e5 9. b4
{ The point of White's play. We expel the Black Bishop and gain space on the queenside. }
9... Bd6 10. Bb2 Qe7 11. a3 O-O 12. O-O Bb7
{ This is a mistake. Black should finish development by means of  12...Nbd7  with a slightly worse position. }
13. c5
{ White exchanges the c-pawn for the e-pawn which increases our control over the centre. Also, Black's c-pawn will be isolated. }
13... bxc5 14. bxc5 Bxc5 15. Nxe5 Rd8 16. Qc2 Na6
{ After  16...Nbd7  , Black would have only a slightly inferior position. Now, bigger problems are coming. }
17. Nb3 Bb6 18. Nc6
{ I think that this is an incorrect approach. White should prefer Rac1 followed by Rfe1 and only then proceed with active operations. }
18... Bxc6 19. Qxc6 Rab8 20. Rac1 Ng4 21. Qc4 Qe6
{ That's the point behind Black's last moves. It also confirms that 18. Nc6 was slightly inaccurate. }
22. Qxe6 fxe6 23. Bh3
{ The only move for White. Black threatened nasty things on f2 since some minor pieces are hanging on the b-file. }
23... Bxf2+
{ 23...h5  was the only move and Black should be close to equality.  After the text move, he will get an ending which should be objectively lost. }
24. Rxf2 Nxf2 25. Bxe6+
{ Not losing the whole advantage but there was a stronger option.  25.Kxf2 !  forces  25...Rxb3  26.Bxe6+  Kf8  27.Bxg7+  Kxg7  28.Bxb3.  If Black doesn't take on b3 on move 25, then we can play Rc3 with a winning position. }
25... Kf8 26. Kxf2 Ke7
{ Now we see the difference. White doesn't win a pawn and Black's king is closer to action. }
27. Bd5 Rxb3 28. Bxb3 Rd2+ 29. Ke3 Rxb2 30. Bc4
{ Don't get me wrong after previous comments - White is still much better because, in such an open position, the Bishop has to be better than the Knight. A reason for that is that it can move much faster and can control both wings with ease, while the Knight will be slow and unstable - like me in time pressure ! }
30... Nb8 31. Bg8 c6 32. h4
{ White chooses the correct path to avoid exchanges. Black is on a defensive so every exchange of pawns should ease his defensive task. }
32... Rg2 { It was better to just defend the pawn with 32... h6. } 33. Kf3 Rd2
34. Bxh7
{ But this exchange of pawns is a different story. White's h-pawn is closer to the promoting square and our King is more active. }
34... Rd3+
{ 34...Nd7  was the only reasonable drawing attempt but it is hard to play a move like this when you can reach material equality. }
35. Kf4 Rxa3 36. Bf5
{ Black's Knight is glued to the defence of the c-pawn and White will just push the kingside pawns. }
36... Rb3 37. g4 a5 38. h5 a4 39. Rc4 { Getting the Rook behind the -pawn. }
39... a3 40. Ra4 c5 41. Ra7+ Kf8 42. Be6 Rb6 43. Bc4 Rf6+ 44. Kg3 Nc6 45. Rxa3
{ It was even stronger to include  45.Ra8+ !  Ke7  46.g5 !  and only now take on a3. That would disable Black the possibility of playing ... g5 himself. }
45... Ne5
{ 45...g5  was the last chance trying to create some kind of blockade but White should also win. }
46. g5 Rb6 47. Bd5 c4 48. Kf4 Nd3+ 49. Ke3 Nb4 50. Ra7 Rc6
{ It has to be a database glitch. Black probably played 50... Rd6 but then 52. Kd3 would be impossible. I won't try to imitate detective Holmes and guess what was the move. White is completely winning anyway so it shouldn't be too relevant. }
51. Bxc4 Nc2+ 52. Kd3 Ne1+ 53. Kc3 Nf3 54. Rf7+

On the other side of the board, there is White's King - safe as a cow on a vegan meeting. Black has no real counterplay. Also, note a funny thing.

Bc6 25. b4 Nb7 26. Ndc4

26... exf4 27. gxf4 b5

31. Kg3 Bxe4
{ 31...Ne6 !  putting even more pressure on White's position was stronger. }
32. Bc5 Bxc2 33. Nxc2

33... Kg8 34. Nd4 Nc4
{ It was better to exchange this Knight by  34...Nc8.  Of course, this kind of move doesn't often come into mind when we have a more active option. }
35. Nxc4 bxc4 36. Nc6
{ It doesn't win material but the b-pawn is very strong now. White has full compensation and Black has to be very careful not to go downhill. }
36... Rd3+ 37. Kf2 Rb7 38. f5 { White should play for a draw with Na5-c6-a5. }
38... c3 { Black reminds White that he also has his trumps. } 39. Re2 Bf8
{ I would prefer to preserve the Bishop with 39... Bf4 or 39... Bg5. I believe that Black's Bishop is better than White's as it hits the c1-square. }
40. Bxf8 Kxf8 41. fxg6
{ It serves a nice purpose of reducing material but the problem is that Black gets two passed pawns and it should be enough for a victory.  41.Re7  was necessary. Maybe Amin was afraid of  41...Rd6  but after  42.fxg6  hxg6  43.b5 !  White keeps everything together while preserving the active Rook on the 7th rank. }
41... hxg6 42. Ra5 Rb6 43. Rc5 Ne8

44. Ne7 Kf7 45. Nd5 Rb7 46. b5
{ White managed to stop the c-pawn and starts pushing his b-pawn up the board. }
46... Nd6
{ 46...Rh3 !  was the last chance to get some winning chances. The point is that White has to give up the h-pawn due to  47.Kg2  leading to  47...Rh5  !. }

Let me just mention a funny line:  60...Rxh3  61.b7  Rh2+  62.Kg3 ??  loses at once due to  62...Rg1+  63.Kxh2  Nf3+  64.Kh3  g4#. }

{ Black tried to set up a drawing mechanism with ...Nh2-f3-h2 and of course if White ever plays Kg1 Nf3+ Kh1 ?? it is mate after Rh2#. 68. Rb3 is the only winning move which prevents Black from utilizing the aforementioned perpetual check. }
68... Rxb7 69. Nxb7
{ The rest of the game is just a technical task. White needs to coordinate all of his pieces and it is a win. }
69... g4 70. Nc5 Rc2 71. Rd3
{ After this it should be a draw. It was a rapid game so it is obvious that such mistakes will appear sooner or later.  71.Re3 !  should be preferred to control the b3 and e4 squares. }
71... Kf5
{ Slipping a drawing chance.  71...Nd2+  72.Ke1  Ne4  73.Rd5  Rc1+  74.Ke2  Nc3+  75.Kd2  Rd1+  76.Kxc3  Rxd5. }

{ I've explained in the Sicilian chapter why this is more accurate than 12. Nbd2. }
12... Nxc3 13. bxc3 Bd7 14. h4
{ I think that White's attack is very strong. Black's kingside is defended only by his Bishop and his dark squares can be easily targetted. }
14... Rc8 15. h5 Na5 16. h6
{ A responsible decision. White gives up ideas connected with hxg6 but he plays for control over the dark squares. }
16... Bh8 17. Bg5 f6
{ This has to be played. If Black's Queen retreats then White would defend the c3-pawn and play Nf3-h2-g4 and the f6-square would lead to even bigger problems for Black. }
18. exf6 Bxf6 19. Bxf6
{ 19.Qc1  would be my preference.  We defend both the g5-Bishop and the c3-pawn while preparing Rb1 and Re2. }
19... Qxf6 20. Rc1
{ The most natural move but White had a nice possibility in the form of  20.Re2 !  The point is that Black can't take with  20...Rxc3  due to  21.Ne5 !  Bb5  22.Rb2  a6  23.Qd2  Ra3  24.Rxb5 !  axb5  25.Nd7  with a big positional advantage. Black's pieces on the queenside are out of play.  Black can, of course, ignore the c3-pawn but that means that we don't need to defend it with a passive Rc1. }
20... Nc4 21. Qe2
{ I think that this setup leads nowhere. I would prefer Re2 followed by Qc2 and Rce1. }
21... Qf5 22. Nh2 { White prepares Ng4-e3 to challenge Black's Knight on c4. }
22... Rc6 23. Rb1 b6 24. Ng4 Be8 25. Rbd1 g5
{ Black prepares ...Bh5. In these types of structures, Black's Bishop is quite bad and it is hard for it to find a decent job. }
26. Ne3 Nxe3 27. Qxe3 { White will employ a very nice-looking plan of c3-c4 ! }
27... Qf6 28. c4
{ White gets rid of his only weakness while the d-pawn will require constant protection. }
28... Bf7
{ 28...Rxc4 ?  29.Qxe6+  Qxe6  30.Rxe6  Bf7  31.Re5  with a big advantage for White. Exchanging Queens helped White a lot because it was defending a lot of important squares. Now, it is much easier for White's pieces to create threats. }
29. cxd5 exd5 30. Qe7 Qxh6 31. Re5 Rf6 32. Rc1
{ This move is unnecessary.  32.Qxa7  was simple and strong. } 32... Kh8 33.
Qxa7 Bg6 { Black has counterplay now. } 34. Re2 Qh5
{ But not like this.  34...Bh5  with ...Bf3 next would guarantee Black enough play to get a draw. }
35. Qe7 Bd3 36. Rc8
{ The point of White's play. He threatens not only Rxf8+ but also Qxf6+. }
36... Qh6 37. Rxf8+ Qxf8 38. Qxf8+ Rxf8 39. Re5 Bc4
{ 39...h6  would offer more chances for resistance.  The d-pawn is more important here than the g-pawn. It looks like it is better to get rid of the weakness on d5 but White gets a strong passed pawn. }
40. Bxd5 Bxd5 41. Rxd5 Ra8 42. Rxg5 Rxa2 43. Rb5 Rd2 44. Rb4
{ Now, it is a simple win. White will play Kf1-e1 and after ...Rd3 Ke2 when the Black Rook must move away from our d-pawn and White will be in time to consume the one on b6. }

16... Qd7 17. Qf3
{ Of course, not  17.Kh2 ?  and White loses to  17...Ng4+  18.hxg4  Bxd4.  We would either lose the b2 or the g4 pawn. }
17... Qe7 18. Nb3
{ The other options for White are 18. b4 cementing the Black b-pawn on the light square or 18. Qe3 with the idea of playing f2-f4. }
18... a4 19. Na5 Qc7 20. Bxf6 Qxa5 21. Red1 Rb6
{ This move leads to the first wave of problems for Black.   He should look for his chances by means of active counterplay, for example,  21...b4  22.Bxg7  Kxg7  23.Rxd6  bxa3  24.bxa3  Qe5  25.Qd1  Rfd8. }
22. Bxg7 Kxg7 23. Rd4
{ White's play is easy now. He should play Qe3 consolidation on the dark squares and Rad1 will come next while the d6-pawn will require constant protection. }
23... Rc8 24. Rad1
{ White should think about stopping ...b4 before playing this move.   24.Qe3  b4  25.axb4  Rxb4  26.Qd2  would retain the advantage. }
24... Rc2 { 24...b4  was even stronger. } 25. Qf4 b4 26. Rxd6 Rxd6 27. Qxd6 Qc5
{ 27... b3, 27... bxa3 or 27... Qa7 were all better than the text move. Exchanging Queens helps White. If you compare the Kings' safety, then it should be obvious that Black's pieces are more active and White's King is more prone to the attack. By taking the Queens of the board White will be able to concentrate on the endgame without worrying about his King. }
28. Qxc5 Rxc5 29. axb4 Rc2
{ Black has enough activity to get a draw but he needs to play precisely. } 30.
Ra1 Bb3 31. e5 Rxb2 32. Bc6 f6
{ It is obvious that the position heads towards the Rook 4 vs Rook 3 pawns. In that case, I would avoid weakening my King's position. A waiting move like 32... h6 was to be preferred. }
33. Bxa4 Be6 34. Bc6
{ Maybe Black was counting on  34.exf6+  Kxf6  and Black's King is closer to the centre.   Now, Black has a sad choice to make - he can either play  34...fxe5  allowing  35.b5  or play like in the game. }
34... Rxb4 35. Ra7+ Kf8 36. exf6
{ I think it was a lesser evil to go for 34... fxe5 instead. White is two pawns up and all of his pieces are active. It should be easy to convert this. }
36... Rb6 37. Be4
{ It was not too late to spoil everything.   37.Bg2 ?  would be bad due to  37...Rb1+  38.Kh2  Rb2 !  and White can't protect the f-pawn without allowing a repeat of moves.   Also,  37.Bf3 ?  would be inaccurate due to  37...Bxh3  38.Rxh7  and Black has  38...Rxf6 !  attacking the Bishop. In both cases, it would lead to a draw. You need to be precise everywhere. A position that looks completely winning can be spoiled by one stupid move. }
37... Bxh3 38. Rxh7 Bf5 39. Bxf5 gxf5 40. f7
{ It was much easier to win by  40.Kg2 !  Rxf6  41.Kf3  Kg8  42.Ra7  with Kf4 and Ra5 to come. Black would be unable to block the 7th rank due to a won pawn endgame for White. }
40... Rg6
{ Maybe White missed this one. Trust me or not but this is a draw now. White can't stop ...f5-f4. It is normal for the 40th move because on the 41st one there is usually some additional time for both players added. }
41. Kh2
{ The last winning try for White was  41.Kf1  f4  42.gxf4  Rf6  43.Ke2  Rxf4  44.Rh3 !  and Black can't take on f7 with anything due to Rf3 and the resulting pawn endgame is winning. Still, Black will be able to hold that with the best play. Just check this position with the Syzygy Endgame Tablebases on lichess. }
41... f4 42. Kh3 fxg3 43. fxg3 Ra6 44. g4 Ra1
{ White was ready for g4-g5 so it is the only move which threatens ...Rh1. }
45. Kg2 Ra3
{ There was only one drawing move for Black.  45...Re1 !  The point is that after  46.Kf2  it is a draw after  46...Re7.  It is possible for White to play this only on the e-rank. Let's extend this line a little further to get to the point.  47.Rh8+  Kxf7  48.Rh7+  Kf8  49.Rxe7  Kxe7  50.Kg3  Kf6=  and Black is in time to get the opposition.  Now, if he put the Black Rook on d1 instead of e1, Black won't be on time for opposition. Let's check it.   45...Rd1 ??  46.Kf2  Rd7  47.Rh8+  Kxf7  48.Rh7+  Ke8  49.Rxd7  Kxd7  50.Kg3  Ke6  51.Kh4  Kf6  52.Kh5  A small detail but as you can see the one that makes the difference between saving the game and losing it. }
46. Kf2
{ With the White King on the g-file it would be a mistake to play  46.g5  due to  46...Ra5 !  and it is a draw.  47.g6  Rg5+  is with a check  ! which is important.  By playing 46. Kf2 ! White threatens to play g4-g5-g6. }
46... Ra4
{ A drawing mechanism from the 45... Re1 ! line doesn't work here.   46...Ra7  47.Rh8+ !  Kxf7  48.Rh7+. }
47. Kg3
{ White can easily improve his position now. It was not too late to allow  47.g5 ??  Rg4= }

15. Nd3
{ We followed my recommended line of the 5. d4 vs the Caro Kann chapter. White managed to blockade the d4-pawn. We have a pair of Bishops and we control the important g4-square. On the other hand, Black has a space advantage and active pieces. I think that this position is dynamically balanced. }
15... Ne4 { Matlakov goes for the attack. } 16. Re1 f5
{ A necessary move but also a weakening. White might be able to use it against Black in the future. }
17. Bf4

35. a5
{ But now it is a different story because if we repeat the same variation, the Black Rook is already on the a-file so he would be able to stop the d-pawn on the 7th rank instead of 8th. It would be a draw then. So 35. Bc6 was a better move. }
35... Qd6
{ As I've mentioned in comments to the previous move  35...Nxd5 !  was a way to go and if  36.cxd5  then  Qe2  with drawing chances. }
36. Bf3 Qc5 37. Qc6 { 37.a6  Qxc4  38.Bb7  would secure a winning advantage. }
37... Qxa5
{ I would prefer to eliminate the a-pawn while exchanging Queens. Therefore,  37...Qxc6  38.Bxc6  Rxa5  would be my preference. Black would need to defend precisely but it would give him more chances than the game continuation. }
38. Qe6 Rc2 39. Bd5 { Breaking communication between Black's army. } 39... Nxd5
40. Qxf5+
{ Black loses the Rook. A nice performance by Alekseev. I think that if we consider it was a blitz game, it was a relatively high-quality one. }

24... dxc4 25. dxc4 f6
{ It was much better to play 26. Bc3 or 26. Ra1 trying to force a3 + b4 plan. }
26. Qe3 Rd8 27. Qxa7
{ After this move, I should lose. I completely underestimated the danger to my King, when my Queen went pawn-grabbing and I should be punished. }
27... Bc5 28. Qa5 b6
{ 28... Red7 followed by ...e4 should guarantee Black a victory. After the text move, White can regroup and is back in the game. }
29. Qc3 Red7 { 29... e4 ! was necessary to keep an advantage. } 30. Qc2
{ It was necessary to take control over some light squares with 30. Qf3 or 30. Kg2. I thought that I control everything now and I remember being quite optimistic about my chances. As usual, when everything seems to work quite well, there comes an unwanted guest whose name is Mr Tactics and spoils the whole party. }
30... Kf7
{ Returning the favour.  30...e4 !  was an excellent move with the point being  31.Qxe4 ??  Re7  32.Qf3  Rxe2 !  and White's Queen is overloaded.  33.Qxe2  Qg3+  is curtains.   After  30...e4  I would need to play something like  31.Kg2  but Black builds up his attack with  31...f5 !  and White is in big trouble. }
31. Qe4 Qe6 32. Kg2
{ The dust has settled and what I need to do is to convert my extra pawn. But firstly, White needs to consolidate. 32. Kg2 is a natural move stepping away from any issues on the dark-squares. }
32... Bd4 33. Rd1
{ One of the basic positional rules is to exchange pieces only when it serves some positive purpose. Here, I don't mind the exchanges, but I want to do it on my terms. }
33... f5 34. Qf3 Bxb2 35. Rxd7+ Rxd7 36. Rxb2
{ By exchanging a pair of Rooks, I eased my defensive task. Now the d-file control is not so important because it is quite unlikely that Black will create any dangerous threats with his two remaining heavy pieces - three would be a different story. That's why I really like 33. Rd1. }
36... Qd6
{ Black was in time trouble and he forgot about his f-pawn. It was necessary to strengthen Black's position with something like ...Qf6. }
37. gxf5 { Now everything is easy. } 37... Kg8 38. fxg6 Qxg6+ 39. Qg4 Qxg4+ 40.
hxg4 Kf7 41. Kf3 Kf6 42. Ke3 Ke6 43. Rd2 Ra7 44. a4
{ Followed by Rd5-b5 and a5 or c5. Another tough game which indicated that still a lot of work has to be done to play the KIA confidently. On the other hand, even nowadays I consider the set-up with ...d5 ...c6 ...Nf6 and ...Bg4  (which I like to call the reversed Torre)  to be the best for Black vs the 1. Nf3 2. g3 move order. That's why I prefer to go for the Reti set-up after 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 whenever I choose the 1. Nf3 move order. }

{ Black achieved a complete symmetry after 8 moves. Still, I think that having this additional tempo guarantees White at least a small push for an advantage. I can also add that these kinds of positions are my favourite to beat the lower rated opposition because there is almost nothing to fear while we can set problems for our opponents. }

{ As usual, positional reasons to play this move were correct but tactics didn't work. 13. Ne3 with a stable advantage was preferable. }

{ 13...c5 !  was an excellent resource.  14.Qxb5  Rb8  15.Qa4  Rb4  16.Qa3  Re6 !  with the plan of playing ...Ra6. I would be forced to give away the e4-pawn with a complex struggle ahead. On the other hand, the line starting with 13... c5 is extremely hard to find over the board because it is completely unnatural and requires to see resources such as ...Rb4 and ...Re6. So I have a clear conscience and don't blame myself for that miss ! }
14. a4
{ Opening up the queenside. This is one of my favourite themes in the King's Indian Attack. We don't need to move the a-Rook to make it active.   14.Qxb5  Ba6  , of course, would get messy and there's no reason for it. }

Very silly reasoning. I can't count how many points or half points have I lost during my chess career. I did some work to eliminate that habit and now, two years later, I think I act calm as a Buddist monk.   20.Nfd2  was one way to keep things together and maintain the advantage. }

22... Rb6 23. Nd2 Reb8 24. h4
{ One of my favourite plans. Black lacks the light-squared Bishop so we can start building up on the light squares. The text move enables White two things: 1  Kh2 followed by Bh3; 2  h4-h5 under good circumstances. }
24... h5 25. Kh2 Qc6 26. Bg2

8... Rb8 9. Nc4
{ Black wants to go for the ...a6 followed by ...b5 break.   It is good to put our Knight on  c4  because after  9...a6  we may consider  10.a5  Be6  11.Nfd2  taking control over the queenside. }
9... Bg4
{ I don't like this move. White should be able to gain an upper hand after simple measures. }
10. h3 { 10.Ne3  was also interesting. } 10... Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Nd7

13... a6 14. h4
{ It is an interesting plan for White. I think we should always consider it whenever the Black Knight abandons the kingside. A more obvious plan was to go for 14. f4 using the fact, that Black's Knight is misplaced on e5. }
14... Nd7 15. h5
{ Now Black has a guessing game: Will he prepare h5-h6 ? Will he take on g6 ? Or is he going to stand there and irritate me for eternity ? }
15... Nf6 { Forcing me to make up my mind. } 16. hxg6 hxg6
{ Afer  16...fxg6  Black would weaken the light squares too much.  17.c3  followed by Qb3 would guarantee White a large advantage. }
17. f4
{ Black's King has been weakened so it is a good idea to build up on the kingside. }
17... Nd7
{ Note the Black Knight's journey in this game: g8-f6-d7-e5-d7-f6-d7. A hard-working mustang ! }

{ Black relies on the light-squared blockade but it can't work. } 20. Qb3

Rxf5 23. Bxf5 c4 24. Qxc4 d5 25. Qa2 exf5 26. Qxd5+ Qf7 27. Qxf7+ Kxf7
{ Now, when the dust has settled, we should analyse the resulting position. White has the Rook and three pawns for two minor pieces. In the middlegame, it may be difficult to evaluate but endgames are simpler. In this position, it is all about control. White controls all of the important central squares. If, for example, our c-pawn would be on c4 instead of c3 then White would be in trouble due to some ...Nd4 and ...Nc5 ideas. Here it is not a problem. }
28. Be3
{ Ideally we want to exchange as many stuff as possible to avoid any problems. In this position, we can somehow imagine Black creating anything, but if we exchange everything, then White will have a Rook + 3 pawns vs two minor pieces only - Black would be completely busted. }
28... Re8 29. Rfe1 Bf8 30. Bf2 Bc5
{ Remember me mentioning exchanges on our terms ? So now I get everything I wanted. I manage to exchange two sets of pieces and the rest will be easy. Black should keep as many pieces as possible and somehow try to create threats. }

7... Bb6 8. Na3
{ I want to have my Knight on c4. Why not Nbd2-c4 then ? I can imagine in some cases that I will also play Na3-c2-e3 or just Na3-c2 followed by d3-d4. In other words - I wanted to stay as flexible as possible. }
8... h6 9. Nc4 f5 10. exf5
{ 10.a4  right away was probably even stronger. The point is that  10...f4 ??  would be impossible due to  11.a5  and Black's Bishop is history. }

16. Qe2
{ 16.Nxe5 !  Nxe5  17.Bf4  N7g6  18.Bxe5  Nxe5  19.Qe2  would lead to an even larger advantage. }

{ Now White gets access to everything and he wins. It was necessary to keep the Bishop on the h4-d8 diagonal. }

{ This was an important game because in this tournament I fought for my IM norm. My opponent was much younger than me so I decided that playing a position based on understanding is much better than trying to prove whose memory is better. }
1. Nf3 e6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 c5 4. O-O Nc6 5. d3 Bd6 6. e4
{ I like this flexible move. Normally White starts with 6. Nbd2 but I can imagine that my Knight can sometimes go to a3 or even c3. In this kinds of positions, it is very useful to make moves that we are 100% sure we will do such as O-O or e4, but such continuations as Re1 c3 or Nbd2 may be useful or not - it depends on our opponent's plan. }
6... Nge7 7. c3 O-O 8. a3
{ The same policy. I keep my queenside pieces untouched because they may be useful in different ways. White's plan is to go for b2-b4 gaining space on the queenside and preparing Bb2. }
8... b6
{ If Black goes  8...a5  then  9.a4 !  and we can see the point of keeping White's Knight on  b1.  We would be able to follow up with Na3-b5 without spending two tempos on Nbd2-b1 as in the Plichta - Mokal game. }
9. b4 Bb7 10. Re1
{ 10. Nbd2 or 10. Bb2 would be more natural but I wanted to know what my opponent's intentions are. }
10... Bc7 { I think that this waiting move doesn't achieve much. } 11. Nbd2
{ As you can see there is no other square for our Knight so we develop it do d2. Our c1-Bishop doesn't have anything useful to do on d2 e3 f4 or g5 squares so we keep it on the starting square. Flexibility ! }
11... Ng6
{ This move is a serious inaccuracy. Black probably wants to play ...Ne5 exchanging some pieces but he won't be given this luxury. }
12. bxc5
{ the other good plan was  12.exd5  exd5  13.d4  when Black's pieces are horribly misplaced. }
12... bxc5 13. Rb1 Bb6 14. exd5 exd5 15. c4
{ White wants to transpose to a Benoni structure with Black's pieces very badly placed - especially the Knight on g6 and the Bishop on b6. }
15... dxc4 16. Nxc4 Nd4 17. a4
{ White's a-pawn will be a ram to Black's fortress. } 17... Rb8 18. h4
{ Positionally this move is quite nice because we want to do exchanges on our terms, but the problem is that it allows Black to muddy the waters.   18.Nxd4  was simple and strong. }
18... Re8
{ Returning the favour.  18...Qd5 !  with big complications was a way to go. }
19. Rxe8+
{ Now back to normality. White will exchange all of Black's active pieces leaving him with the passive ones. }
19... Qxe8 20. Nxd4 Bxg2
{ Of course Black has to take because after  20...cxd4 ??  there goes  21.Bxb7  Rxb7  and  22.a5  winning a piece. That is why moves such as  a4  are very often quite useful in this system }
21. Kxg2 cxd4
{ A nice picture for White. Black is left with his bad minor pieces and a weak pawn on d4. White has a large advantage. }
22. h5 { Now, another flank pawn will knock to Black's doors. } 22... Ne5 23.
Nxe5 Qxe5 24. Bf4 Qd5+ 25. Qf3 Rd8 26. Rb5
{ 26.Qxd5 ?  Rxd5  27.Rb5  Rxb5  28.axb5  followed by moving the Black King to the queenside is unnecessary to allow. The text move allows White to get a clean advantage without any counterplay.   26...Qxf3+  27.Kxf3  followed by a4-a5 and maybe a5-a6 would be hopeless for Black. He would lose at least one of his weak pawns. }
26... Qd7 27. h6
{ Now Black has a difficult choice: 1  He can allow his pawn structure to be damaged; 2  He can play ...g6 and have his King weakened. }
27... Re8 28. hxg7 Re6 29. Qd5 { Simplifying White's task. } 29... Qxd5+ 30.
Rxd5 { Black has no time for  30...Kxg7 ??  due to  31.a5. } 30... a6 31. a5
Ba7 32. Be5 f6 33. Bf4
{ This is the point of the whole operation. The g7-pawn is untouchable due to Rd7. Now Black has to take care of the 7th and 8th ranks. }

{ 4. c4 is also an option for White leading to the English Opening. } 4... d5
5. d3
{ The fact that I play the King's Indian after 1. d4 exclusively for like 15 years definitely helps to understand some details about this position. Here, I have my favourite position being a tempo up. }
5... Nf6 6. e4 d4
{ I think that this is the best approach. In positions with a closed centre being a tempo or two down doesn't matter as much as in open or semi-open positions. }
7. a4

7... h6 8. Na3 Be6 9. Nd2
{ The White Knight on f3 is not great so it is very often useful to put exactly this Knight on c4. Now White will be ready for f2-f4 and in some positions Na3-b5 becomes an idea. 9. Nh4 was also interesting. }
9... Qd7 10. Ndc4 Bd6
{ I am not a big fan of Black's setup. Normally the f6-Knight should go to d7. }
11. f4 Bc7 12. Bd2
{ Finishing development. 12. f5 would be anti-positional because our g2-Bishop would be dead forever. }
12... Bh3

Qxh3 14. Nb5 O-O-O 15. Nxc7

15... Ng4 16. Qe2 Kxc7 17. fxe5
{ Once again I will mention that the plan with 17. Qg2 was quite strong. I wrongly assumed that Black's Queen can be in trouble on h3 but I've never managed to trap it and only wasted some time. }
17... Ncxe5 18. Nxe5 Nxe5 19. Bf4 f6 20. Bxe5+ fxe5 21. Rf5 Rhe8 22. a5
{ White tries to open up the other front. } 22... Rd7 23. b4

{ A simple Qd2 would keep all of White's advantage. The problem is that I still dreamed about keeping the Black Queen trapped but it never happened. In other words, I used two pieces to block one... Stupid ! }

37... Ka6 38. Rxh7 Qxh7 39. Qxe5 Qd7
{ It was necessary to keep the Queen active. Something like ...Qh4 or ...Qh5 should be preferred with a probable draw. Now, White's advantage returns as an australian boumerang. }

{ Both sides followed their normal plans. } 13. h4 b4 14. Ne3
{ The is the extra option that we have against the ... Qc7 lines. White wants to take on d5 followed by e6. }
14... Nb6
{ A risky move. The problem is that the Knight is now far from the kingside and it will be tougher for Black to withstand the pressure on that side of the board. }
15. h5
{ Starting with 15. Ng4 was probably stronger, because I wouldn't have to worry that much about any ... Nd4 ideas.   15.Ng5 !  was the probably the strongest move preparing Qh5 next. }

{ Black is obliged to stop h6 from White. I remember that it took my opponent some time to play this move. I was walking through the playing hall hoping he will not play that ! }

Nb6 - the Knight had to go back.  22.f4  +-  G4 and f5 are next with a devastating attack.  20.Qg5  Bg7  21.Qf4  ±  would lead to a very strong attack for White. Ng4 and h6 are next. }
18. Bh3
{ And I found it ! This move brings the Bishop to the action by pressurizing e6, which will be crucial for the attack to succeed. }
18... Nd4
{ This is a mistake that allowed me to carry through my attacking ideas.   18...Bf8  was the best defence but White would still have a strong attack.  19.Ngh2 !  Clearing the way for the g-pawn !  c4  20.g4  →  White's attack is running by itself. }

22... a6

The Knight has to retreat since taking on h3 would imprison the Horsie.  Ng6  26.Kf1  White is still somewhat better but it is a smaller advantage than in the game. }
23. Re1

25. g3
{ This move is OK but there was a better option.   25.Nf5 !  Ne7  26.Ne3  ±  followed by Rd1 would lead to a dream setup for White. }
25... Re7 26. Rxe7 Nxe7 27. h4
{ Another tough decision for Black. If the pawn is allowed to h5, it will create a cage for the King. On the other hand, playing ... h5 will result in eternal weaknesses in front of the King. }

30... Nc6 31. Nxc6 Qxc6 { My opponent was low on time at this point. } 32. Qe5
Qb5 33. b4
{ This move has to be played sooner or later. This Queens endgame might look innocent but it is extremely dangerous for Black. Few conditions make this position so tough to play. 1. The pawn on d5 is a longterm weakness; 2. My Queen is more active that the Black Queen; 3. The pawn on b7 is a 2nd weakness that might be a target in many positions; 4. Finally, my King is somewhat safer and it has more active possibilities. Amazingly, it is the 4th point that will decide the game ! }
33... Qc6 34. Kh2

34... Kf8 35. Qd4 Ke7 36. Kg2 Kd7 37. Kf3 Qd6 38. Ke3
{ So far so good. Black was playing on increment and he needed to play three moves before the clock adds the additional 30 minutes. }
38... Qc6 { A risky move, allowing my King to march towards the kingside. } 39.
Kf4 Qe6
{ This move fails to see my plan of bringing the King up to g7 !   39...f6  This was the only chance, keeping my King away from the kingside. The problem is that Black has the 3rd weakness on g6 now. My longterm plan would be connected with f3 and g4. }
40. Kg5
{ Black is completely defenceless ! A simple plan of bringing the King to g7 - resembling a famous game Short - Timman - is impossible to stop. }
40... Ke8 41. Qf6
{ It is useful to put the Queen on f6 since all of my pawns are nicely defended and the pawn endgame is hopeless for Black. }
41... Qg4+ 42. Kh6 Qe2
{ At this point I started to calculate lines like  43.Kg7  Qe7  trying to decide if the resulting pawn endgame will be winning for me.  With the King in the centre, it would be easily winning, but with the King on g7, I wasn't sure. I thought it is winning, and then I stopped calculating and was like: Why the hell am I even calculating this ?! I can win this position by simple means. }
43. Qf4
{ Threatening Qb8+ and allowing my King to come to g7 with 0 counterplay. }
43... Qb5 44. Kg7
{ This was the biggest problem with the move ... h5. The dark squares around the King have been weakened and Black crumbled under pressure. The rest of the game is easy. }
44... Qd7 45. Qe5+ Kd8 46. Kf8 { Black is completely dominated. } 46... f5 47.
Qb8+ Qc8 48. Qxc8+ Kxc8 49. Ke7
{ Everything was winning at this point, but I wanted to allow 0 counterplay and didn't even want to calculate a single thing. The King goes to e6 followed by Ke5 - e6 and Black has to lose the d-pawn. }

{ The same policy as a few lines before - we open up the diagonal for the Bishop, secure a space advantage and prepare an attack on the Black King. }

1... Nb6 2. Ng5
{ With the Black minor pieces standing on the other side of the board, it is useful to start the 'plan B' attack. We will continue with Qh5 and whenever ... Bxg5 happens, we take with the h-pawn and prepare Ng4 - f6 piece sacrifice. }

1... axb5 2. e5
{ A typical trick which follows the theme of striking at the strongest point. Black can't take the pawn since any capture will lose the piece - taking with the pawn or the Bishop drops the c6-Knight, and taking with one of the Knights loses to f4. }
