{Hello everyone, I am FM Amro El Jawich from Lebanon. I am a 3-time Lebanese 
champion and the youngest to achieve the feat (at the age of 15). My current ELO 
is 2309 and I am currently working to achieve the IM title. This is my second 
course for Chessable, my first course being 'The Shirov Gambit: Break Down the 
Philidor Defense'. I hope you like it and the others yet to come!} 1. e4 c5 2. 
Nf3 {You can get the Rauzer structure after both 2... Nc6 and 2... d6. If you 
wish to keep your opponent confused on if you are playing the Rauzer or the 
Najdorf, you can go for 2... d6. It is crucially important to choose your second 
move according to the variations you play against the Anti-Sicilians.} (2. Nc3 
Nc6 {Against the Closed Sicilian or the Grand-Prix attack I prefer to have a 
c6-knight than a d6-pawn.} 3. Nf3 {Rauzer players are not afraid of White trying 
to get back into Open Sicilians.} 3... d6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 {We are back to 
our Rauzer structure.}) Nc6 {If you are not prepared for 3. Bb5 with a c6-knight 
you should go for 2... d6.} (2... d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {Our 
Rauzer structure is on the board.}) 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {The Rauzer 
structure is on the board. It is considered a risky Sicilian and perhaps this is 
the reason why it is not played as much as other Sicilian variations. In this 
course, I tried as hard as possible to choose simple variations where you don't 
get lost in heavy preparation and risky variations. This is especially the case 
if you are not a former Rauzer player. That being said, there is no total escape 
from some complex variations. This is the soul of the Sicilian defense. In case 
you are a Najdorf player, you will find many structures similar to the 
Najdorf-structures: especially against sidelines. On the other hand, if you are 
an Accelerated-Dragon/Dragon player, you will find variations where I chose to 
fianchetto the f8-bishop to be relatable.} *
