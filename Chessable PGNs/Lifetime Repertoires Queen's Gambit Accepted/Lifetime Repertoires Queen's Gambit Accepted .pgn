{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted arises after 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 and is an exciting, yet very reliable and respected weapon to fight against 1.d4 and 1.Nf3!. It became the core part of my opening repertoire since 2017 when I had to prepare for the World Women Knock-out Chess Championship - my most important tournament to date. I needed something complete, yet very compact, easy to remember and juicy enough to feel ready for my games. If that is what you need as well, then you are in the right place. This opening has served me well ever since and I had continued to work on it, refining the lines further and further to keep it in good shape and battle-ready. Join me on this journey and by the end you will come out ready to face the 1.d4 players with the wonderful QGA! }
1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ With 2... dxc4 Black temporarily wins a pawn, but gives up the center in turn. The idea is not to try and hang on to the extra pawn til forever but instead fight against White's pawn centre. The two main moves are 3. e4 and 3. Nf3, but we will of course take a look at all of White's options. }
3. e4
{ This leads to very sharp play in particular because I have an exciting suggestion for you here, which involves a trendy exchange sacrifice.   3.Nf3  Usually leads to a slower game after  3...Nf6  4.e3  e6  5.Bxc4  c5  6.O-O  a6  I will advise this solid system. I had experimented with 6... Nc6 myself, but for this course I decided to settle on this reliable and trusted main move. White has many options here, all of which will be covered!   3.e3  likely transposes to 3. Nf3 and has no added value for us.  3...Nf6  4.Bxc4  e6  5.Nf3  c5  6.O-O  a6   3.Nc3  is a natural move, but already quite inaccurate! I had to face it in a 2020 Bundesliga game. We will deal with this move too - it is going to be a joy. }
3... b5
{ This is considered dubious by official theory, but they are very wrong and I will show you why! }
4. a4 c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Nc3 a6 7. Nxb5 axb5 8. Rxa8 Bb7
{ Our repertoire is based on this exciting exchange sacrifice. You will be backed not only by my enthusiasm, but also by tons of verified high-end computer analysis, made accessible and explained throughout this course to club players and chess enthusiasts of all levels! }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nc3
{ This has never had a good reputation and that seems very unlikely to change. With 3. Nc3, White doesn't gain any control over the important central squares d4-e5, he just develops. However, it's not clear yet if c3 is the best square for the b1-knight as it might be a target when the b-pawn advances. }
3... a6 { With the clear intention of b5. } 4. a4
{ This is just dubious. White stops b5, but generally the a4-a6 inclusion is in Black's favour as White weakens the b3 and b4 squares. Nevertheless after Nc3, most games continued with 4. a4. You can find other white tries in this chapter. }
4... Nc6
{ A multipurpose move. Black attacks the d4-pawn - thus developing with a tempo, supporting the e5-advance and intending to defend the c4-pawn with Na5. }
5. Nf3 { White successfully defended his d4-pawn, but does he stop e5? } 5...
e5
{ The answer is no! Black successfully breaks in the centre and grabs the initiative. }

10. Be3
{ I consider this as the main line, nevertheless there are more games with 10. Bg5 or 10. Re1 those moves will transpose into each other. The reason behind it is that 10. Be3 was recently played by the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen against Fabiano Caruana in an online match. And, well, you know how the World champion influences the crowd with his games, so I expect many will follow this trend in the future. }
10... O-O 11. Ne5
{ Although 11. Qe2 has more games, 11. Ne5 is more challenging and was tried in the game between Carlsen-Caruana in the 2020 Magnus Invitational online match. }

{ The most precise, hitting the knight on e5 and asking White what he wants to do about it. }
12. Nxc6 bxc6
{ 12... Qxc6 is also fine of course, but 12... bxc6 is more challenging. Opening up the b-file and having full control over the d5-square - that's what we want. You can find a few sample lines of how the game might continue in the theory chapter. }

7. Nbd2 { This prepares e4. } 7... Nbd7

8. e4 { Intending e5 and Ne4. 8. Be2 transposes to 7. Be2. } 8... b5

{ This was tried in the game of Grischuk vs Caruana in a blitz game of the Saint Louis Champions Showdown 2017. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Bxc4 c5 6. O-O a6
{ In this chapter we will cover some odd lines, like 7. Be2, 7. Nbd2 and 7. a3. }
7. Be2
{ This move was examined by none other than Magnus Carlsen, Ding Liren Levon Aronian and co. Once again, we face a prophylactic move against b5, where White chooses to move the bishop first and leave all other options open. }
7... Nbd7
{ This is our go-to move: a very useful developing/waiting move. Generally, Black doesn't want to start with Be7 because then with after dxc5 and Bxc5 we lose a tempo. He also doesn't want to touch the b-pawn yet, as he wants to leave the choice of b6 or b5 to himself. Another good alternative to 7... Nbd7 is 7... cxd4. }
8. Nbd2 b6
{ As in similiar sidelines, here as well we go for the solid 8... b6. } 9. Nc4
{ Intending dxc5. } 9... b5
{ We already met this idea in the 8. b3 line. 9... b5 is the easiest way to disturb White's plans. However this might be more critical than the 8. b3 sideline, as we are not yet fully developed. }
10. Nce5 Bb7 11. a4
{ This is the critical try. Otherwise, Black will just develop with Be7 and follow the same plan as in the 8. b3 sideline. }
11... b4 { The only move, but a good one. } 12. a5
{ A common follow-up after a4 and b4. White fixes the queenside, frees up the a4-square and intends to put pressure on the b4-pawn. }
12... Bd6
{ The most precise way to develop. The bishop seems a bit vulnerable on d6, but actually it's more active there.   12...Be7  is met with the strong  13.Qa4  when Nc6 is a threat to win one of the black bishops. For example:  13...Rc8  14.dxc5  Bxc5  15.Rd1  and Black is in huge trouble. }
13. Nc4 Be7
{ Having chased away the knight, the bishop returns to the modest e7-square. }
14. Bd3 O-O 15. Qe2 Qc7
{ Our plan is simple: get the rooks to the semi-open files and start jumping with our f6-knight. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Bxc4 c5 6. O-O a6 7. b3
{ This variation has become very trendy lately and some of our opponents may want to follow in the footsteps of Carlsen, Ding Liren and So etc. No worries though, you'll be provided with a rare but solid line, which might come as a surprise to your opponent. }
7... Nbd7
{ Once again we meet our go-to move. Starting with 7... Nbd7 is very flexible: we cover the d-file and don't commit to anything yet.   7...Be7  for instance is dubious because of  8.dxc5 ! }
8. Bb2 Be7
{ Here we have a bit of a change in plans. Normally, when we faced similar positions, we would go for b5 or b6. 8... b5 is natural, but creates weaknesses after   8...b5  9.Be2  Bb7  10.a4  b4  11.Nbd2  with a slightly more pleasant position for White.   As for  8...b6  , now this is met with the very strong  9.d5  White didn't lose any tempi like in other lines and is completely ready for this breakthrough in the center  9...exd5  10.Bxd5  Nxd5  11.Qxd5  Ra7  12.Rd1  Bb7  13.Qh5  and White has a big advantage, because it's not easy for Black to develop and Black's pieces lack coordination. }
9. dxc5
{ This is sort of the main response to Be7, because White wins a tempo by taking dxc5 and then Bxc5. }
9... Bxc5
{ We are not shy to lose a tempo on Be7 and Bxc5, because White's set-up is quite passive. After   9...Nxc5  10.Qxd8+  we would have a worse version of the Exchange Variation. }
10. Nbd2 b6
{ Nothing new: we just follow our plan. We can easily transpose into 9. Nbd2 or 9. Be2 lines. Thus, I'll give a sample line of how the game can continue without trying to tranpose into other lines. }
11. Qe2 Bb7 12. Rfd1 O-O 13. Rac1 Qe7

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Bxc4 c5 6. O-O a6 7. dxc5
{ The Exchange Variation has always been around and is a respectable option for White. That said, as long as we are a little precise and finish our development, we should be able to play this endgame on equal terms. }
7... Bxc5
{ This is probably the most precise. Black can also exchange on d1 which gives White a tempo, but retains castling rights. However, when queens are off, we are not afraid to have our king in the center. 7... Bxc5 is a more classy choice, that is preferred by the majority of the top players. }
8. Qxd8+
{ White almost always goes for 8. Qxd8+, however he can still tranpose to the Furman Variation 6. Qe2 by playing 8. Qe2. }
8... Kxd8
{ Now White has a range of choices here, and you can find them all in the theory chapter. Mostly though, White is trying to get his f3-knight towards d3 or b3 and one of his main ideas is to establish the f3-e4 construction. }
9. Be2
{ As we already met such prophylaxis against b5 before, here as well the move 9. Be2 doesn't come as a surprise. This keeps the development of his other pieces flexible as the bishop usually has to be tucked away to e2. }
9... Ke7
{ Just like White's Be2, this is by far the most useful move of all. The other pieces remain flexible. Now White has a wide choice of setups. }
10. Ne5
{ At some point this was White's main attempt to fight for an advantage, but it has long been neutralized. }
10... Nbd7 11. Nc4 b6 12. Nbd2 a5
{ This is very clever. We have to give up the c5-bishop, but can now focus on active counterplay. }

{ In this chapter, we will look at a rather calm set-up for White: 10. Nf3/Be2. }
10. Be2
{ It doesn't really matter which move order White chooses, first Be2 or first Nf3 - both of them would transpose into our main line. }
10... Nf6
{ Totally necessary! We've already covered similar positions where taking on e4 would be dangerous for Black. This position is no exception hands White a big advantage.   10...Bxe4  11.Nf3  Nf6  12.O-O  Be7  13.b3 ! }
11. Nf3 Bb4+
{ Both sides are aiming to develop as fast as possible. 11... Bb4+ is a nice little check that disturbs White's comfortable development. }
12. Bd2 Bxd2+ 13. Qxd2
{ Giving up the d4-pawn by playing 13. Nxd2 is worse for White. } 13... Nxe4
{ Now the idea of Bb4+ is more clear. Black can take the pawn with tempo! } 14.

{ Prophylaxis! Black can now meet 15. b3 with 15... cxb3! Black would find himself in trouble after the impatient   14...O-O  15.b3  cxb3  16.Qxb3 }

Rxa8 Bb7 9. Ra1 e6 10. Ne2
{ Last but not least, we will look at the ambitious 10. Ne2 line. The knight from e2 is clearly headed to c3 and that's the square where the knight belongs. From c3, the knight puts a lot of pressure on the b5-c4 pawn chain and if he manages to crack that chain without giving back much, then we will find ourselves material down without any compensation. }
10... Bxe4
{ IMPORTANT: There is no time to waste now: this is the only moment where we take on e4 right away. We cannot allow white to defend the pawn via Nc3. }
11. Nc3 Bb4
{ NOTE: The natural 11...Bc6 we play in a similar line with the rook on a2 doesn't work here  The subtle difference of having the rook on a1 and not on a2, gives White a big advantage.   11...Bc6  12.Be2  b4  13.Nb1  Bxg2  14.Rg1  Bd5 }

{ 14... Nd5 was played in some games, but there is no need as we are not afraid of the 15. Bg5 pin. After 14... O-O, White has a few options at his disposal. }
15. Ba3 Re8 16. Bf3 Bd5
{ We have this very strong Bd5 option here, to keep the tension. It's important to note that we have this option because the white bishop cannot jump to g5 anymore. See the theory chapter. }

Rxa8 Bb7 9. Ra2
{ Finally we reached the very last chapter of the 3. e4 b5 line. It's important to study 9. Ra2 carefully because the arising lines demand a complete different response from Black's side. It might look like 9. Ra1 and 9. Ra2 are similiar, but if we respond in the same way as we do against 9. Ra1 we will soon find ourselves in trouble. }
9... e6
{ For now we can continue in the same spirit as we need to develop as fast as possible. }
10. Ne2 Bxe4
{ Just as after 9. Ra1 e6 10. Ne2, here as well we need to take on e4. We cannot allow White to play Nc3 and comfortably defend the e4-pawn. }
11. b3 Nf6
{ 11...Nc6  12.bxc4  Nb4  looks attractive, but the point of Ra2 is seen on the next move  13.Rd2 }
12. bxc4 bxc4 13. Qa4+
{ This is the first move that comes to mind. Surprisingly, it was never played, so it is a novelty. An obvious novelty :D }
13... Bc6 14. Qxc4 Be7
{ This was one of the positions where it seemed like Black doesn't have enough compensation, but a Neural Network based chess engine shows that Black has a lot of resources and is in very little danger of losing here. In fact, it is very likely that we will eventually pick up the d4-pawn and have a 4 vs 3 pawns endgame an exchange down. That would be a draw, despite some engines claiming a plus for White. See here. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 b5
{ The main question for decades has been if the greedy 3... b5 is possible or not. As I already mentioned in the introduction, by official theory this line is considered to be dubious, but thanks to the super powerful engines and super sharp lines which are not easy to deal with, we will be able to prove everybody wrong! }
4. a4
{ If White doesn't try something very quick, he will just be a pawn down. 4.a4 serves the idea to break the pawn chain and develop quickly by attacking weak pawns. }
4... c6
{ This is the only sensible way to defend the b5-pawn. Already at this point White has a couple of options at his disposal. }
5. axb5 cxb5 6. Nc3 a6
{ First introduced in Genzling-Donchenko, March 2014, and as the exchange sac looked brilliant, it was very hot for a while.   It was picked up by Nakamura, ex-World Champion Kasimdzhanov used it in a serious Grand Prix game against Mamedyarov and later another ex-World Champion, Ponomariov, played it in a rapid/blitz tournament in 2016.   Around that time, white players started to have a look at it and a few critical positions appeared, where the engine gave White an advantage and it seemed the compensation wasn't fully sufficient.   However, thanks to the engines dramatically improving with all the recent AlphaZero developments, it is now possible to go much deeper and it seems the exchange sac is sound after all and the initial human assessment prevails in the end. }

axb5 8. Rxa8 Bb7 { The first critical position for this line. } 9. Ra1
{ By far the most natural move. Returning the exchange is not principled, while retreating to a2 looks strange @@StartBracket@@though it has a point and is a very challenging move too!@@EndBracket@@ }
9... e6
{ There are three options here. 1. The principled f3 which leads to a lot of fun play when Black sacrifices pawns for rapid development and develops a huge initiative. 2. Nf3 Be2 in some order is very simple for White, but Black is fine there. There is a long forced line where White has a choice to allow a draw or give up the g2-pawn and let Black have excellent practical compensation and objectively fine play too. 3. Ne2 is the main line and leads to a position with Black having one pawn for the exchange and total control of the juicy d5-square. The engines suggest some advantage for White at first, but upon continuing the variations, it becomes clear that Black always has enough counterplay. We'll examine all of these options in the next chapters. }

10. Ne2 Bxe4

18. Qxc3 Bh4+ 19. g3 Bf6

26. Bc5 e5 { 25...Re8  would be pretty pointless without e5! } 27. dxe5 Nxe5
{ Now Black's target is the white king, which is slightly weak and also the f3-pawn! }
28. Rhd1 Qf5 { Threatening Ng4.   29.Rxd5  Ng4+  and   29.Kg2  Bc6! } 29. Qf4
Qh3
{ Getting closer to the white king and setting up a trap in case of 30. Rxd5. }
30. Rg1 Bc6

{ Despite the fact that there are twice as many games with 8. Bb3, I consider this the main line of 7. Qe2. Nowadays 8. Bb3 is almost never played on the highest level, although we should still know how to react against it. }
8... Nbd7
{ A very flexible move, covering the a4-e8 diagonal against any kind of Bb5 sacrifices. For example, after   8...Bb7  9.dxc5  we cannot take back on c5 with the bishop as  9...Bxc5  is met with  10.Bxb5+  axb5  11.Qxb5+  when White regains the piece. }

{ 16.Qxc4  Rc8  looks good for Black. } 16... Bd5
{ Not a difficult improvement over 16... Bxf3. Black wants to keep the pressure on the long diagonal and keep the bishop. }
17. Bd2 { Defending the c3-pawn. } 17... O-O 18. Ne5 Qc7
{ The queen wasn't doing much on a5 after Bd2, so it's time to go back and support the c4-pawn as well as the b8-square. }
19. Bg5 Rab8 { Black starts fighting for the b-file. } 20. Rbe1
{ The most dangerous attempt: White chooses to abandon the b-file and try to go all out in the attack. }
20... g6
{ An important defensive move, building a stronghold on g6 against the c2-bishop and preparing to simplify with Kg7 and Ng8. }
21. Qe3 Rb2
{ Distracting White from the kingside attack. It is important to sometimes be annoying! }
22. Re2 Nh5
{ We are happy to trade the dark-squared bishops. If need be, we can reroute the knight through g7. Our kingside is very solid and we will have our counterchances thanks to the full control over the b-file and the juicy d5-square. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Bxc4 c5 6. O-O a6 7. Re1
{ This is a relatively new line, that can become more popular. 7. Re1 prepares e4. }
7... Nc6 { We of course don't want to allow White to comfortably play e4. } 8.
Nc3 b5 { 8... Be7 is another good alternative. } 9. Bd3
{ The best square for the bishop at the moment. White sets a trap, but we of course won't fall for it. }
9... cxd4 10. exd4 Nb4
{ Obviously, we cannot take the pawn on d4 twice as we lose the queen after   10...Nxd4  11.Nxd4  Qxd4  12.Bxb5+  +-  ...Nb4 is a very precise move. White has a lot of options at his disposal, but before getting there let me give you another possible alternative   10...Be7  11.a4!  Bb7?!  12.axb5  axb5  13.Rxa8  Bxa8  14.Bxb5  O-O  15.d5  and it it looks like White has a nice initiative  Better is   10...Be7  11.a4!  bxa4  12.d5  Nxd5  13.Nxd5  Qxd5  14.Qxa4  Bb7  15.Rd1  Qh5  which looks fine for Black. }
11. Ne5 { The engine's favourite. } 11... Be7
{ The most precise move.   11...Nxd3  12.Qxd3  Be7  13.Nc6  +=   11...Nxd3  12.Qxd3  Bb7  13.Qg3  White ties the f8-bishop to g7 and it won't be easy for Black to develop. Starting with 11... Bb7 runs into an unusual but very beautiful idea:   11...Bb7  12.Bf5!  exf5  13.Nc6+  or   11...Bb7  12.Bf5!  Be7  13.Nxf7!  Kxf7  14.Bxe6+  Kf8  15.Bg5  and White has a dangerous attack. }
12. d5
{ A very interesting sacrifice. White's using the momentum while the black king is still in the center. }
12... Nbxd5
{ It seems like Black can capture the d5-pawn in many ways, but only one is good since 12... exd5 runs into a3 and Nc6 and if   12...Nfxd5  13.Be4  and the pin looks really unpleasant for Black. }
13. Nc6 { The main idea of d5! } 13... Qd7 14. Nxe7 Nxe7
{ 14...Kxe7  is the engine's favourite, but I don't think it's necessary to be so creative. }
15. a4 { White has sacrificed the pawn, thus he has to be active now. } 15...
b4 16. Ne4 Nxe4 { 16....Nfd5  makes a lot of sense as well. } 17. Rxe4 O-O
{ Giving back the pawn but running away from any danger. } 18. Rd4 { Tricks! }
18... Nd5
{ We can't take the rook of course, as it's poisoned   18...Qxd4??  19.Bxh7+  loses the queen. }
19. a5 Bb7 20. h3 Rad8
{ We have an extra pawn, but White does have full compensation for it, thanks to his pair of bishops. Black is now threatening e5 and once White takes care of the threat, Black can easily improve his position by playing Qe7 @@StartBracket@@renewing the threat of e5@@EndBracket@@, Re8 or Rd7 and Rfd8. }

25... g5 26. Ke2 Ke7 { having in mind Kf6-Kg7. } 27. h4
{ The losing move.   27.Rc1  with Rcc8 next would give White extremely good chances to draw the game. }
27... gxh4 28. Rxh4 Bc6 { Better late than never! } 29. Rc4 Be8 30. Rc7+ Kd6
{ 30...Kf8  -+  with the idea of Nf6 would finish the game pretty quickly. }
31. Ra7
{ 31.Rcb7 !  It is super important to keep control of Bb5 check!  31...Ne7   31...Nf6  32.Rxf7  ∞  32.Rd8+  Ke5  33.Rbb8  and now Bb5 is met with Rxb5 check!  33...Bb5+  34.Rxb5+ }

15. Kf2 { So far so good: the game followed our theoretical line. } 15... O-O
{ Well well, 15...exf5 is a better option as is noted in our line. That said, 15... O-O keeps the tension in the game and keeps all other options open. }
16. Rf1
{ It is very hard for White to find a precise way not to get immediately worse here.  It seems like   16.f4  with the idea of  16...exf5  17.g5  to close the kingside, is the only way to keep equal chances. }
16... e5 { 16...exf5  looks good as well. } 17. dxe5
{ 17.Kg3  seems to be the safest move in this position.  17...Re8  keeps White under pressure.  18.dxe5  Nxe5  19.Nd4  Qb6  =+ }
17... Qb6+
{ 17...Nxe5 !  The direct Nxe5 followed by Nd3 gives Black a huge advatange. }
18. Kg3 Nxe5 19. h3
{ Too slow: now Black gets the upper hand.   19.Nf4  was the way to go. After  19...Nxf4  20.Bxf4  Nd3  21.Bd2  it is a mess. }
19... Nd3 20. Kh2
{ White is trying to secure his king, but he doesn't have the time. } 20... Ne3
21. Bxe3 Qxe3 { Black has a dominant knight on d3 and a winning position. } 22.
f4 Bxg2
{ 22...Nxb2  was quite strong, snatching the pawn and creating two connected passers on the queenside.  23.Qc2  Bxg2  24.Kxg2  Nd3  with a winning advantage, as Black has a safer king and the connected passed pawns. }
23. Kxg2 Rd8 { Black keeps the pressure. } 24. Qc2
{ This allows Black to win by force.   24.Rf3  keeps the game more complex, but Black is better after  24...Qe4  25.Qf1  Nxb2  26.Kg3  Black is better, but the game goes on. }
24... Ne1+ 25. Raxe1 Bxe1 26. Rxe1 Rd3
{ The point of the operation: now the white king is defenseless. } 27. Rd1 Qe4+
{ Winning the queen by force and with it, the game. } 28. Kg1 Rg3+ 29. Nxg3
Qxc2 { The rest is easy. } 30. Rd7 Qc1+ 31. Kg2 Qxb2+ 32. Kf3 Qa3+ 33. Kf2 Qc5+
