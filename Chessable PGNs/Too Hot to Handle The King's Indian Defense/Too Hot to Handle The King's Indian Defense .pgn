{ Welcome to the King's Indian world! A world that I entered back in 2004 and I still enjoy my 15-years-long journey. A journey that players such as Geller, Gligoric, Stein, Bronstein, later Fischer, Kasparov and nowadays Radjabov also decided to hop into. }
3. Nc3 Bg7
{ There are a few things about the King's Indian Defence that have to be said. If I needed to describe this opening in two words I would say 'strategically suspicious'. Black doesn't follow one of the basic chess principles which is to fight for the centre from the start of the game. It is obvious that White will enjoy a big space advantage  (especially in the four pawns attack)  .  So why do I recommend to play the opening that is 'suspicious'? Remember that nowadays nothing is for free! That is also the case for White here. Black's basic concept is to let White take over the centre and lure our opponent into a false sense of safety. We will use all of our power to fight back at White's centre with ideas such as ... e5 ... c5 ... f5 or ... b5. Note that Black will base his play on active pieces. }
4. e4 d6
{ I present you a list of characteristics of my approach to the King's Indian Defence: 1   Going for 7... exd4 instead of 7... Nc6 in the Classical Variation. This is one of the most important lines and the core of my repertoire. We avoid learning 25 moves + lines and go for understanding + plans instead.   2   This may be surprising for many people - low amount of lines where Black goes for ... f7-f5 - We will only go for this standard pawn break when it is either very beneficial for Black or it is the only plan available.   3   In some lines, White will be left with a += evaluation at the end. White would need to play very precisely to be able to do that, so I wouldn't be too concerned that something like that will appear in a practical game. Remember, we don't play the King's Indian to equalize. We play the KID to win games!   4   I offer sidelines in almost every variation. My recommendations in the Classical, Samisch  (especially this!)  , Averbakh or Four Pawns will catch many of your opponents by surprise.   5   Whenever I had an option of going for two equally strong lines I usually went for a less popular one. That means that you will have more experience than your opponent  (most of the time)  when you learn this course.   6   The chapters are ordered from the most popular lines to sidelines. We start with the Classical Variation, where 7... exd4 will be my basic recommendation. Then we have the Samisch where 6... Nc6 is a suggested line, but we will play an unusual 8... Na5!? most of the time. Against the Fianchetto Variation I recommend 6... Nc6 followed by 7... e5. This line has been revitalized during the last years. My recommendations against minor systems are: 6... Na6 against the Averbakh, 6... c5 followed by 9... Nbd7!? vs the Four Pawns Attack, 6... e5 followed by 7... Nh5 against the Makogonov System. In general, we avoid main lines, but we will go for the active and promising systems anyway - less theory = more fun!   7   Most of White's tries after 1.d4 are covered in this course. Not only is this a full King's Indian repertoire, but it is a full 1.d4 repertoire for Black   8   In every possible scenario, I tried to go for original lines and for variations that have never been published.It was sometimes impossible so here is a list of books that I sometimes worked with when creating this course: 
a   New Weapons in the King's Indian by Milos Pavlovic  b   Modernized: The King's Indian Defence by Dejan Bojkov  c   Attacking Chess - The King's Indian by David Vigorito  d   A Practical Black Repertoire by Alexei Kornev    The 22nd chapter of this course is devoted to the general plans  (mostly for Black)  . I strongly recommend taking a look at these before digging into theory. Why isn't it presented in the beginning? I know that many users prefer to stick to learning immediately after purchasing a course. That means that for those of you, it wouldn't be preferable to show these plans at the beginning - you might skip them anyway! That's why I decided to move the general ideas to the end and you can acknowledge yourself with them by clicking this.  Also, I went for something new to me and included statistics for White after any theoretical move. So if you see something like 'White's score 55%' that means that on average, out of 100 games White scored 55 points. I hope that these numbers will be an interesting factor to you, dear reader, and whenever you see 60% +, you won't be discouraged!  I wish you a wonderful journey with the King's Indian Defence. Let this wonderful opening guide you as well as it has guided me for more than 15 years.  Kamil Plichta, Koszalin 2019 }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3
{ This is by far the most popular move. It prepares e2 - e4 enabling White to claim even more space in the centre. }
3... Bg7
{ This is the move that is characteristic to the King's Indian Defence. If Black would play  3...d5  we would enter the Grunfeld territory. }
4. e4
{ Sometimes White starts with  4.Nf3  only to land in the same place after  4...O-O  5.e4  . }
4... d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2
{ White's last two moves are characteristic to the so-called Classical Variation. The same thing happens in the Najdorf Sicilian - if White goes for Be2 followed by O-O we call it the Classical Variation. White will most probably castle kingside, but there are some options of delaying that manouver. }
6... e5
{ This is a standard way of challenging the strong centre. Black is done going for a slow approach and starts attacking White's pawn wall. The other options would be 6... Na6, 6... Nbd7, 6... c5 or 6... Bg4 but none of them is a theme of this repertoire. Note that this is a first critical position both for White and Black. White has many options, but in the first theoretical chapters, we will focus on the most popular move which is... }
7. O-O
{ White safeguards the King and is ready for a fight  ! Usually Black plays here  7...Nc6  and after  8.d5  Ne7  a critical position with a ton of theory appears. If your opponent castles on move 7, you can be more than sure that he has something prepared and doesn't mind playing these race-type-of positions.  When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King. The problem is that when I started improving, I found these positions to be very crazy and complicated. I started to dislike situations when only one tempo could decide the game. It was obvious that a new approach for me is necessary. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move. We immediately force White into playing a pawn structure that he may not be familiar with. Normally, White would definitely be prepared for 7. Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved. We will learn plans, ideas and implement them into our games. That's it ! One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3
{ 9.Bf3?!  is not a good option due to  9...Nbd7  and  the f3-Bishop might be a target to some ... Ne5 jumps. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 56.6%. This is our move ! If you checked out my King's Indian attack course for White you can see some resemblance. Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d6 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black would be to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although they have a very high drawish tendency and I don't find them too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5 of the main course. }
10... Nbd7
{ White's score - 60%.   Before we dive into the lines, I just want to mention that you may be misguided by database statistics in the  10...Nh5?!  line. At first glance, it is a great line for Black, but after a forcing sequence  11.g4!  Nf6   11...Qf6?!  doesn't help due to  12.Nf5  and White is much better  12.Bf4  h5  13.Nf5!  gxf5  14.gxf5  and even engines claim that White is much better  ! I strongly recommend avoiding this variation and sticking to my recommendation.   Also, note that with the White King on  h1  it is premature to play  10...d5?!  due to  11.cxd5  cxd5  12.Bg5!  and Black's centre is under heavy pressure as seen in Tal - Spassky, Montreal 1979.  Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }
11. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.9%. The first two lines of the Quickstarter Guide are devoted to this continuation which is the most popular after 10... Nbd7. As you can see, we've started with the most popular line for White - 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 - and now we dig into the most popular 11. Bg5. This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ... d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ...Qxb2 but also ...Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Nb3
{ This is a ten times more popular approach than 12. Na4. White defends against both threats while creating a threat on his own - Qxd6.   After  12.Na4  I advise going for a simple  12...Qc7  13.Qd2  Nc5  14.Nc3  a5  with a very similar position to the one after  12. Nb3. }
12... a5
{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ...a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Qxd6
{ This is the variation that you will encounter a lot on the club level. I hope that your opponents will play this because it hands over the initiative to Black. Usually, taking on d6 is too greedy for White. }
13... a4 14. c5 Qb4
{ The tricks are over for White and now he is forced to either exchange Queens and enter a slightly worse ending, or do something even riskier. }
15. Qd4
{ If instead the Knight from b3 moves, Black may take on b2 or play ... a3 with a big advantage. Note that most of White's problems in this line usually happen on the dark squares. }
15... Qxd4 16. Nxd4 Nxc5
{ Black threatens ... Nfxe4 using the fact that the d4-Knight is undefended. If White defends the d4-Knight with either Rook, we will play ... Ne6 and enjoy nice pressure on White's queenside. }

{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ... a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Qd2
{ White finishes development, defends the b2-pawn and connects the Rooks. This continuation is around 10 times more popular than all of the other moves combined. }
13... a4
{ Very often we will use this pawn as a hook into our opponent's queenside. }
14. Be3 Qd8
{ White's score 57.6%. This is the best square, from which the Black Queen may choose from joining the kingside or the queenside later. }
15. Nd4 Nc5
{ A critical position has appeared. White has a nice clamp on the centre and Black's pawn break ... d5 is stopped for good. White can also strengthen the position with moves such as Rad1 and Rfe1 but it is quite hard to formulate an obvious plan for our opponent. If White ever touches the b-pawn we will take with the a-pawn and enjoy the opened a-file. Playing f3- f4 seems also very unlikely due to Black's pressure on the e-file. As you can see, it is quite hard to see what to do with both sides. That means that we will start a little hide and seek game, in which the side with more patience and experience will come out victorious ! Black's basic plan in this position is to play ... Nfd7 followed by ... Be5 and in some cases ... Qh4 or ... Qa5. }
16. Rfd1
{ This is the most popular continuation for White. White brings the Rook into the semi-open d-file, while claiming that the other Rook will have some important duties on the queenside.  16.Rad1  will lead to a similar position after  16...Nfd7  17.Rfe1  Be5  . }
16... Nfd7
{ This is the standard idea for Black. The Knight has nothing useful to do on f6 and it relocates itself to f8 and eventually e6, while ... Nb6 should also be kept in mind. Black has two basic plans: 1  Play ... Be5 to solidify the centre, defend the pawn and sometimes to pressurize h2 with a combination of ... Qh4. 2  Whenever White will play Rab1, we will play ... Qa5 to be able to respond to b4 with axb3 axb3 and ... Qb4! The queenside would be blocked and Black would have great chances. Let's see one possible scenario. }
17. Rab1
{ White prepares b2 - b4.   17.Nc2  doesn't change much after  17...Be5  with mutual chances. }
17... Qa5
{ I like this move which is a novelty. Black anticipates b2 - b4 and plans to take on b3 and put the Queen on b4 blocking White's queenside play !   The other possible continuation for Black is a more popular  17...Be5  but it leads to a slightly inferior endgame after  18.f4  Bg7  19.Bf3  Nf6  20.Nxc6  Nfxe4  21.Nxe4  Nxe4  22.Bxe4  Qc7  23.Qxd6  Qxd6  24.Rxd6  Rxe4  25.Rd8+  Bf8  26.Bc5  bxc6  27.Rxf8+   27.Bxf8  Bb7=  27...Kg7  28.Rd8  Bb7  .  It is a slightly worse position for Black but should be easily holdable. My suggested novelty 17... Qa5 keeps things more complex. Also, please don't be afraid of such long variations ! I just want to show you different middlegame possibilities for both sides. }
18. b4
{ The most forcing continuation. 18. Nc2 is a standard continuation safeguarding the b4-square before proceeding with the queenside expansion, but it doesn't lead to problems for Black.   18.Nc2  Be5  is a normal move after which White may play  19.Bd4  Ne6!  inviting White to take the Bishop with  20.Bxe5  dxe5  . A possible continuation may be  21.b4  axb3  22.axb3  Qc7  23.b4  Rd8  24.Qe3  Ndf8  with equal chances.  Black managed to get rid of a backward d6-pawn and can look into the future with confidence. A possible plan for Black would be to play... h5 - h4 and plant the Knight on f4 - once again playing on the dark squares. White, on the other hand, doesn't have too many active possibilities and the e2-Bishop may become useless - blocked by its own pawns. }
18... axb3 19. axb3 Qb4
{ This was Black's idea ! The queenside is blocked for a moment and we will continue with ... Nf8 - e6 pressurizing White's centre. }
20. Qc2 Nf8
{ That's it. The Knight had nothing valuable to do on d7 so it relocates itself to e6. Black has great chances. }

12. Bxd6 { White's score - 58.8%. } 12... Qf6

Nc2 first and only then we will proceed to a stronger 13. Nb3. A rule of thumb - no matter what White does we will put the Knight on f4. }

Going back to 14. c5?! it is a bad move which is just a tactical miscalculation. Black immediately gets the upper hand with a nice shot ! }

16. g3 Nxe2 17. Be3 Nxc3
{ After a few accurate moves, Black is hugely on top. We have a better pawn structure and a pair of Bishops. Also, the g7-Bishop is a monster. White shouldn't be able to hold this. See the game Premnath - Kokarev, Mumbai 2010. }

{ White's score - 55.1%. A critical try for us. Black sacrifices a pawn and forces White to take it. No retreats or half-measures will be allowed now.   The other try for Black is  11...Ne5  12.Qd2  d5  13.cxd5  cxd5  14.Nc2  Nc4   14...Nh5  also doesn't equalize after  15.Nxd5  Nxf4  16.Qxf4  Be6  17.Rad1+=  .  15.Bxc4  dxc4  16.Qf2+=  .  I prefer to grab the bull by its horns than to escape from it through a long tunnel without any clear exit doors ! }
12. Bxd6 { White's score - 58.8%. } 12... Qf6
{ White's score - 58.5%. Attacking both the Bishop and the Knight. White has two sensible options here - either to retreat the Knight to c2 or b3. We will take a look at an inferior 13. Nc2 first and only then we will proceed to a stronger 13. Nb3. A rule of thumb - no matter what White does we will put the Knight on f4. }
13. Nb3
{ White's score - 65.3%. This is the strongest option at White's disposal. Around 5 years ago it was considered harmless, but GM Markus Ragger came up with the idea that put the whole 11... Nh5 in question. But don't worry, Black is fine in the end ! }
13... Nf4 { Once again we see this idea of activating the Knight. } 14. c5
{ 14.Bxf4  Qxf4  is once again harmless for Black who can claim full compensation.  The text move is quite dangerous and Black has to know what to do. You can see the main difference from the 13. Nc2 line - the c5-pawn is securely defended by the b3-Knight and any tricks with ... Nxc5 followed by ... Qg5 don't work. }
14... a5
{ That means that the a-pawn has to be used ! Our main threat is to play ... a4 followed by ... a3. Note that in many ... exd4 lines whenever the pawn reaches a4 - or ideally a3 - then Black has great chances ! White has to do something about the aforementioned threat. }
15. Bxf4
{ This is the aforementioned Ragger's idea. White wants to put the Knight on a4 and block Black's queenside play.   Playing  15.Na4??  first would be a big blunder due to  15...Nxe2  16.Qxe2  b5!  and due to the hanging Bishop on d6 White can't capture the b-pawn.  That means that the Knight has to go back with  17.Nc3  and after ...  a4  followed by ...  b4  and eventually ...  a3  or ...  Ba6  Black is on a verge of victory. }
15... Qxf4 16. Na4 Qc7
{ A strong novelty by GM Milos Pavlovic from his book 'New ideas in the King's Indian'. I consider this to be the only saving grace for Black, so I am forced to borrow some of his analysis and back it up with my own research. A funny thing is that 6 games reached that position - 5 correspondence games and one over the board game - mine xD Also, the result of that game, Gbyl - Plichta, POL-chT 2018 rapid is wrong - it was a draw. One important thing that I want to tell you is that there are a lot of different lines possible from now, but the chance of getting one in over the board competition is small. I was the chosen one, but that's punishment for digging in such lines. So it would be a waste of your time to have 30 crazy computer-like lines as trainables. There is a small rule of thumb for you: After 17. Qc2 and 17. Nd2 play 17... b5! while after 17. Rc1 prepare it with 17... Rd8 and only play ... b5 next. Now you are ready to rock and roll ! }

{ White's score - 56.3%. In this chapter, we will take a look at White's different 11th move attempts. We start with 11. Nc2 which safeguards the Knight and let's White attack the d6-pawn at the same time. It has a large disadvantage though - Black will be able to force through ...d5. }
11... Nb6
{ White's score - 54.9%. Preparing ... d5. Note that usually, we will start with ... Be6 attacking the c4-pawn and only then play ... d5. }
12. Bg5 h6
{ This is an important point to remember ! Whenever you see the Bishop on g5, you should be extra careful about playing ... d5. Let's see two bad examples for Black:   12...d5?!  Pultorak - Plichta, Vasylyshyn Memorial 2016 was inaccurate and my opponent should punish me with the following sequence:  13.cxd5  cxd5  14.a4!  followed by a5 and Black's position is unpleasant.   12...Be6?!  also fails to impress after  13.b3  and  13...d5??  White wins with simple  14.e5±  .  Therefore some preparatory measures with 12... h6! are necessary. }
13. Bh4 Be6 14. b3

14... Nxe4
{ Yes, we sacrifice the Queen ! Not only is this an amazing concept, but I think this is a necessary continuation to get a good game with Black !   14...g5?!  would allow  15.Bf2  d5?!  16.exd5  cxd5  17.c5  and White is MUCH better.   The other thematic try also doesn't work:  14...d5?!  15.cxd5  cxd5  16.e5  g5  17.exf6  Qxf6  18.Be1  Once again White is much better. }
15. Bxd8 Nxc3 16. Qd2

16... Raxd8
{ Our main threat is to take on e2 followed by ... Bxc4. Our positional plan is to play ... c5 and ... d5 later. If we go ... d5 immediately, White will close the centre with c5. }

19. cxd5 Nbxd5 20. Nxd5 Rxd5
{ Let's think about the results of the sacrifice. The engine will probably laugh at you giving around +1 for White, but things are far from clear. Black has a Bishop, a Knight and a pawn for the sacrificed Queen. Also, Black has no real weaknesses and it will take White some time to activate his pieces. In the meantime, Black will push ... b5 followed by ... c4 creating a passed pawn on the queenside. Two games reached this position, and Black scored one win and one draw ! Let's proceed ! }
21. Qc1 { Played in both games. } 21... b5
{ Not only preparing to take on e2, but also threatening ... Nxa2 when the Knight can be securely defended with further ... b4. }
22. f4
{ 22.Qa3?  was played in the other game, and Black could get the upper hand with  22...Bf5!  It is not obvious what White will do with the hanging Bishop on e2.  23.g4  is a must, but after  23...Bd7!  Black renews the threat and leaves White in a regrettable situation. }
22... Nxe2
{ Improving on Huzman - Yurtaev, Tashkent 1987.   Even after the inferior  22...Rdd8  the game ended in a draw soon, because White was so afraid of playing this type of position over the board. }
23. Rxe2 Rc8
{ Black will push ... c4 - c3 and so on. The only source of counterplay for White may be some exchange sacrifice on e6, but then Black won't be material down anymore. }

Re8 9. f3 c6 10. Kh1 Nbd7 11. Be3
{ White's score 72.1% - be alert ! This is a serious line. We can't play ...d5 too easily here. Also, the problem is that the lines suggested by both Bojkov and Pavlovic don't work for Black. This line was my biggest concern about if the whole repertoire will work, but fortunately, I managed to find a solution that leads to only a marginal advantage for White - if he plays correct moves of course ! }
11... Nb6
{ White's score - 0.5/2. This is my recommendation. I believe that from the whole 11. Be3 complex, you will get the most playable and the soundest positions here, after 11... Nb6. Let me mention two of the most popular continuations:   11...a6?!  was for a long time considered to be the best line for Black and it is a line that is played until I started working on this course.  12.Nc2  Ne5  13.f4  Neg4  14.Bg1  h5  15.Bf3  Be6  16.Qd3!  spoils all fun for Black. I spent a few hours trying to make the whole line work, but it just doesn't.  16...b5   16...Qe7?!  is a strange recommendation by Pavlovic, but White is hugely on top after  17.Nd4  17.Rfd1!  and Black is just worse in all lines, for example,  17...Bh6  18.cxb5  axb5   18...Bxf4?!  19.Qf1!  Be5  20.bxc6  is much better for White.  19.Qxd6  Qxd6  20.Rxd6  Bxf4  21.Rxc6  and White is just better everywhere. I tried many moves to prove Black's compensation and maybe someday there will be some correspondence game to prove that Black is OK, but for me, now in 2019 Black is far from ok.   Also,  11...d5?!  is premature due to  12.cxd5  Nxd5   12...cxd5  doesn't help either after  13.Ndb5!  13.exd5  Rxe3  14.dxc6  with an advantage for White.  So Black's idea of playing 11... Nb6 is to prepare ... d5 under the right circumstances. }
12. Qd2
{ Played in the only two games that reached this position.  12.Qc1  is the most testing continuation that can be checked here. }
12... d5 { We want to break free ! } 13. exd5
{ Playing in style of the 12. Qc1! line is not efficient here. } 13... cxd5 14.
c5 Nc4
{ This is a big difference ! We manage to get the light-squared Bishop for the Knight. }
15. Bxc4 dxc4
{ Black's basic idea may be to finish development with ... Bd7 and put the Queen on a5. Both sides have their chances in this strategically complex position. }

It is the third line in which White puts the Bishop on e3 so it may be slightly confusing in the beginning, but you will quickly get used to them and you will see basic differences between the lines.

{ White's score - 54.4%. The most popular move characteristic for the Petrosian System. White's main idea is to play Nd2 next with perfect harmony.

I won't dig deeply into details, but White clears the c4-square for the Knight and his compensation will be too big to handle in a practical game. The score after 14. c5 is 3/3 for White, so I decided to abandon this line and go for a more classical 9... Na6 instead. }

There is a crazy option available for Black that I'd like to mention.  11...Nc5  looks like a normal move, but after  12.b3  Black can uncork a maverick-like  12...Nfxe4!?!?  sacrificing the Queen. Let's see some lines:  13.Bxd8  Nxc3  14.Qe1   14.Bxc7?  is much worse due to  14...Nxd1  15.Rfxd1  Ra6  with an advantage for Black.  14...Rfxd8  15.Nb1  - the only move to get an advantage.   15.f3  allows  15...f5  16.Bd1  Rf8  17.Bc2  e4!  18.fxe4  fxe4  19.h3  Nd3  20.Rxf8+  Rxf8  21.Bxd3  exd3  22.Kh1  Ne2  23.Rd1  Nc3  24.Ra1  Ne2=  15...Nxe2+  16.Qxe2  e4  17.Na3   17.Nd2  Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  with mutual chances.  17...Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  .

The fact that it is exactly 13 times less popular makes it a great surprising weapon ! Black's basic plan is to exchange the dark-squared Bishops and play on the dark squares next. }

It would be very impractical to allow that.  White has a few options now. He can ignore our Bishop on h4 and proceed with b4, he can take on h4 or he can avoid the exchange with g3. We will look at these moves now. }
17. Qe1
{ I think this is a nice idea for White. He knows that the exchange is forced so he tries to do it on his own terms. }
17... Bxf2+ 18. Qxf2 Nc5
{ This is important ! The difference from previous positions is that White has a Queen on f2. That means that it supports the c5 break and sometimes White will be even able to push f4, but White's main idea is to play b4 closing our Knight on a6. Therefore, it is necessary to activate the Knight before doing anything else.   18...h4?!  would be a positional mistake due to  19.b4  axb4  20.axb4  and the thematic  20...c5  doesn't work due to  21.dxc6  bxc6  22.f4!  with an advantage for White.

White wants to provoke Black into transposing to the main KID lines with  7...Nc6?!  but after  8.d5  Ne7  9.Nd2!  White found the perfect set-up for his minor pieces. You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.  However, it doesn't disturb us at all, because we will take on d4 as fast as possible.   One more line that I want to mention is  7...c6!?  It is quite smart because we want to lure White into  8.O-O   8.Qd2  exd4  9.Nxd4  Re8  10.f3  d5   transposes to the  10.Qd2  line of this chapter  8...exd4  9.Nxd4   9.Bxd4!?  is possible though  Re8  10.f3  d5!  which scores highly for Black.   The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.   Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the  7...c6  move order might be a good start. }

The other positive aspect is that the number of lines drastically decreases, which is always a good sign.   Objectively, I don't even think that  7...exd4  is any worse   than  7...Ng4  which is a mainline for Black.  Also, I can share a practical tip. In the Classical system with 6.

Qd2 doesn't give White any advantage.   Note that  10.O-O  d5  transposes to the 5th chapter with  7. O-O exd4 8. Nxd4 Re8 9. f3 c6 10. Be3 d5 move order. }

{ 12.c5  Nc6  13.O-O  will lead to the same thing. } 12... Nc6 13. c5
{ White's score - 59.6%. This is White's idea. He eliminates tension from the centre and creates a 3 vs 2 pawn majority on the queenside. A position with an isolated d-pawn appears and usually, the side with such a pawn has dynamic possibilities. White has weak squares on the kingside and in the centre - especially f4 and e3, but also the d4-square can be very important. If Black succeeds in forcing White to take on c6, then the pawn on d5 won't be weak any more and becomes a strong passed pawn instead. Additionally, an open b-file combined with the strong Bishop on g7 pressurizing b2 might be problematic for White.   13.Nxc6?!  is wrong. White shouldn't strengthen our centre for free.  13...bxc6  14.cxd5  Nxd5  15.Nxd5  Qxd5  16.Qxd5  cxd5=  .  With so active pieces it is only Black who can be better, although with accurate play from White it should be equal. }
13... Bf8
{ White's score - 53.8%.   This is a modern treatment. An old mainline goes  13...Nh5  14.Qd2  Be5  15.g3  Ng7  ,   but I think that  13...Bf8  is more dynamic and more interesting.  Black immediately threatens to take on c5 and forces White to do something about it. Normally, White should avoid taking on c6 as I've mentioned and he will either put the King in the corner, play Bb5 or retreat the Knight from d4 to b3. }
14. Kh1
{ This is the main move for White. He tactically defends against the hanging c-pawn, as  14...Bxc5??  runs into  15.Nxc6  and Black loses. }
14... Bd7
{ White made a useful move with Kh1 without revealing his plans, so we do the same. We develop the Bishop and wait !   I will repeat that  14...Bxc5??  loses to  15.Nxc6  . }
15. Qd2
{ I think that only this move enables White to fight for anything. It is important to finish development with Black and avoid jumping around. }
15... Rc8
{ Black improves the Rook and threatens to take on c5 with the Bishop, because after a typical Nxc6 we would be able to take back with the Rook and protect the Bishop on c5! }

6... e5 7. dxe5
{ White's score - 48%. The last chapter about the Classical System is devoted to the Exchange variation. White liquidates tension in the centre and will proceed with the Queens Exchange. I once read that there are three types of players that strive for this approach:   1   'I offer a draw' - a player with the White pieces is lower-rated and wants to achieve a draw at all costs. He will exchange all pieces and think that with every exchange he is much closer to fulfiling his dream. We should continue playing against this type of player until two Kings are left on the board because very often he will crack under the first sign of trouble;   2   Psychologists - players who think that when we go for the King's Indian Defence, we prefer active uncompromising chess. They decide to take away that dynamism from us and this approach is not stupid at all. Fortunately, I will show you a perfect line to play for a win from the start; and   3   Specialists - this is the type of player that you should be serious about. These are the players that prefer technical positions and will exploit every inaccuracy. Fortunately, this is a very rare guest in Exchange town ! }
7... dxe5 8. Qxd8
{ This is the only sensible move.  8.O-O  Nbd7  - White's score 38.6%  9.Qc2  c6!  (Whenever we manage to play ... c6 we control the d5-square and White doesn't control the d4-square.)  10.Rd1  Qe7  with a slightly better position for Black due to the firm control over  d4  and  d5  .   8.Bg5  is also wrong due to  8...Nbd7  9.O-O  c6  with a similar position. A sample line goes  10.Qd6  Re8  11.Rad1  Bf8  kicking the Queen back with a slightly better position.  Note that in both cases Black's ideal plan is to exchange everything and be left with the Knight vs the light-squared Bishop. If we manage to plant the Knight on d4, we would be positionally dominating. Of course, it is not simple to do that, but if we play ... Bg4 and take on f3 and manage to exchange the dark-squared Bishops we would be pretty close. }
8... Rxd8 9. Bg5
{ White's score - 49.2%. White threatens Bxf6 followed by Nd5 or Nd5 right away. }
9... Rf8
{ White's score 46.2%. This is only the 4th most popular move for Black. ...Re8 is known to be the most sensible equalizer, but I even don't like this word - equalizer. We need something sharper, something that will let us play for a win ! 9... c6!? is also that kind of line, and I even wrote an article about it to the Polish chess magazine, but I think it is too theoretical. 9... Rf8 allows us to get positions with chances for both sides without a lot of theory necessary to learn. }
10. Nd5 { This is by far the most popular continuation. } 10... Nxd5
{ This Knight has to be eliminated. } 11. cxd5 c6
{ A standard way of challenging White's pawn centre. The next moves are rather forced. }
12. Bc4 b5 { I like this active approach. } 13. Bb3 a5 14. a4

15. Bxa4 f6
{ It is beneficial to kick the Bishop first, since  15...cxd5  runs into  16.Be7  . Still, if you want to sacrifice the exchange, it is possible to play like this with full compensation for Black. }
16. Be3 cxd5

{ White's score - 54.6%. In this chapter, we will take a look at one of the most popular lines for White, which is the Fianchetto system. Firstly, I want to mention that we will take a look at the mainline first, and only then we will check out some of White's alternatives in the next chapter. The position after 7. Nc3 may be reached via different move orders, such as 3. Nc3 and only Nf3 later, or even 1. Nf3, 1. g3 etc. All in all, we will probably land in this position sooner or later. White developed his forces harmoniously, strengthened his King's position and will try to squeeze every active try from us. This is a completely different approach to the one seen in the previous chapters. White doesn't want to occupy the centre as fast as possible, but he focuses on stopping our active operations. This variation is also a recommendation of GM Boris Avrukh, so it definitely has to be taken seriously. }
7... e5
{ White's score - 56.7%. This is my recommended line for Black. Actually, I had the biggest difficulties in deciding on one line against the Fianchetto system, because I saw drawbacks everywhere. For example, the line that I normally play which is 6... Nbd7 7... e5 8... exd4 doesn't guarantee Black equal chances and it requires a lot of experience to handle these positions well. The 7... e5 line was quite popular in the 60s and 70s, and it has been gradually repelled by other systems. Only a few years ago we experienced the 2nd boost of popularity of this variation. A reason for that is that after 8. d5 White can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8... Nb8 is the best move for Black and you can see the details by going through this chapter. }
8. d5
{ White's score - 58.4%. The most popular and the most natural move for White. White gains space and wins a tempo on the attacked Knight. The disadvantage is that now, the g2-Bishop's scope has been blocked by the d-pawn and White reduced tension in the centre. }
8... Nb8
{ White's score - 54.4%.   This is a more modern treatment of the position which resurrected the whole line. It was considered for a long time that after  8...Ne7  Black has some issues, especially connected to the fact that  the Knight on e7 stands badly. So we lost two tempos, but the Knight will be able to move to a6 after the eventual ... a5  (.) }
9. e4
{ This position can also be reached via the  9.Ne1  a5  10.Nd3  Na6  11.e4  Nd7  move order.  White just grabs space in the centre and will most probably regroup with Ne1 - d3  (.) }
9... a5
{ Before putting the Knight on a6 we gain some space and secure the c5-square. The position resembles the Petrosian Variation from the 6th chapter. }
10. Ne1
{ By far the most popular move. White prepares Nd3 followed by c5.   After  10.h3  we will play similarly with  10...Na6  11.Ne1  Nfd7  with ... f5 next  (.) }
10... Na6
{ White's score - 48.8%. This is the best square for the Knight. Note that in virtually every line we play the same moves, which is great because we always know what to do in practice. }
11. Nd3 Nd7
{ The Knight obstructed f-pawn's route to ... f5. Also, Black prepares ... Ndc5.   That being said,  11...Nb4!?  is an interesting alternative trying to exchange the strong Knight on  d3  12.Nxb4   After  12.Ne2  we can repeat the position with  12...Na6  .  12...axb4  with mutual chances. The text move is more ambitious though. }
12. Be3
{ The main move for White. ... Ndc5 is stopped, so we switch to the ... f5 plan. }
12... f5
{ This is a critical position for the whole line. White will try to solidify the position and claim that the space advantage is going to guarantee him an edge. On the other hand, Black will try to play actively on both wings. }
13. Qd2 b6 { A typical way of preparing ... Nc5. } 14. b3 Ndc5
{ 14...Nac5  allows  15.Bg5  , therefore it is better to use the other Knight. }
15. Nxc5 Nxc5 16. exf5 gxf5 17. Rab1
{ The problem with this move is that it allows a thematic pawn break ... f4.   Stopping this idea by playing  17.f4  himself is possible, but Black has a fair amount of chances after  17...e4  White's main idea will be to reroute the Knight to d4  18.Rab1  Bd7  19.Ne2  Qe7  20.Nd4  Bf6  with the idea of ... Kh8 + ... Rg8 and ... Qg7 coming next with good attacking chances  (.) }

{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nc1
{ White's score - 47.1%. This is a more popular move than all of the other 3 tries combined. White plays in style of the usual Samisch with 8... Rb8. Our opponent will either kick our Knight with b4 next or play a more reliable Nb3. }
9... Nd7
{ White's score - 46.7%.   This is the only line where we don't play for a quick  ...b5  . Note that  9...b5  just gives up the pawn since  10.cxb5  axb5  11.Bxb5  Nb3??  (doesn't work because the b3-square is protected by the Knight on c1.)  By playing 9... Nd7 Black prepares ...c5. }
10. b4
{ White's score - 41.1%. This is a common guest in tournament practice. If you go for the 8... Na5 line you will meet 10. b4 sooner or later. White wins even more space but he is seriously behind in development. We will try to use this and strike at White's centre. }
10... Nc6 11. Rb1 e5
{ I think this is the right way of attacking White's centre. The other way of doing it  11...f5  isn't accurate here due to  12.exf5  gxf5  13.d5  Nce5  14.f4  Ng6  15.Be2  e5  16.dxe6  Nf6  17.O-O  Bxe6  18.Nb3+=  . }
12. d5 Nd4 { White has to challenge the Knight with either N1e2 or Nb3. } 13.
Nb3 f5
{ When going through the whole course and working on the update, I noticed that this is a significant improvement over  13...Nxb3  . We keep the tension and force White to take the pawn giving us huge compensation! Note that ...  fxe4  followed by ...  Rxf3  is a fine threat! }
14. Nxd4
{ This is the only sensible way forward.   14.Bd3  Qh4+  15.Bf2  Qh5!  is very good for Black.  White can't really castle due to ... f4. }
14... exd4 15. Bxd4
{ So Black sacrificed a pawn and now let's try to understand where lies our compensation. We are still ahead in development. White is two tempi from castling which gives us some attacking chances. Also, both the long diagonal and the e and f files are opened for our pieces. }
15... Qh4+ { Harassment continues! White has two sensible option now. } 16. Bf2
{ This is what I would expect to see in practice. } 16... Qf6
{ White has only one move now. } 17. Rc1
{ Anything else allows a combination of ... a5 and ... fxe4 with a crushing initiative. }
17... a5
{ This is one of the key themes that secures Black great compensation. We want to open up the a-file and secure the c5-square for the Knight. }
18. a3 { The most solid move. } 18... axb4 19. axb4 fxe4 20. Nxe4 Qb2

10. Bh6
{ This is virtually the only move not to be worse for White. We need to be slightly careful because White's attack is usually strong and shouldn't be underestimated. }

13. d5 bxc4
{ In my original analysis, I correctly stated that we can and should take on c4 now. What was wrong, is the unit chosen to carry out this capture!

{ 16.Nxd5?  Nxd5  17.exd5  g5!  with a big edge for Black. } 16... Rb7
{ It looks mysterious, but the Rook starts looking at b2 and in some lines, White has to watch out for different counterattacks. Our next moves will usually be ... Kh8 followed by ... Ng8. }
17. Be2 Kh8
{ Black is ready to kick the Queen with ... Ng8. The position is dynamically balanced. }

Nf4 is a very rare move but it is also one of the most dangerous ones and I briefly mention it in this line. However, I recommend spending your time to learn the lines resulting after 9. Nf4 by heart, since it is one of these lines that require precise handling. 9. b3 is the least popular move and you can just play 9... b5 with a good game. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sign is that ... b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5
{ Now we switch to some only moves for Black. A pawn push h4 - h5 has to be stopped here ! It allows White to strike at the h5-pawn, but we will hold the balance with accurate play. }
11. g4
{ The most dangerous move played in 5 out of 7 games that reached this position.   11.O-O-O  is also not a walk in the park. The thing is that we will need to sacrifice  the Bishop in case of g4 from White, but now, we have to find a useful move  11...Rb8!  is what we need and after  12.g4  Bxg4  we have a position similar to the main game. Once again, check out the whole Samisch chapter to acknowledge yourself with the lines! }
11... Bxg4
{ This theme of sacrificing a piece for two pawns is a must to keep the chances balanced. Both sides have to tread this position with extra care and every step in a wrong direction may be the last one. }
12. fxg4 Nxg4 13. O-O-O { Played in the only game that reached this position. }
13... b4 { This move secures us an ongoing queenside initiative. } 14. Ncd5 c6
{ Sacrificing another pawn to open up more lines. White can choose from different options here and you are advised to check out the whole chapter about the Samisch - this is the only one that I truly recommend to learn by heart.   A possible line is  15.Nxb4  but after  15...Rb8  Black has tremendous compensation. The point is that  16.Nxa6  allows  16...Rxb2  and White has to walk a thin line to survive.  17.Kxb2  Qb6+  18.Nb4  is a must for White but after  18...Nxe3  Black has great attacking chances. }

White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable.

Na6 we prepare ideas connected with ...e5 since the plan seen in the 6... e5? line above isn't that effective due to Black's extra option of ...Rd6 in the end.

It is possible because the c5-square is secured by the a6-Knight ! }
7. f4
{ White's score - 56.4%. This is a very aggressive approach compared to 7. Nf3 or 7. Qd2. White reveals his attacking intentions which shouldn't be underestimated. The good sign for Black is that f4 quite rarely combines well with Bg5. }

{ 10.cxb5  cxb5  11.a3  doesn't stop ... b4  due to  11...a5=+  By playing 10. e5 White tries to grab as much space as possible and will try to prove that Black's active operations will backfire. Fortunately, they won't ! }

{ White's score - 58.4%. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at a system named after the legendary grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable. With this method you will be guaranteed to focus on what is most important without wasting your precious time on lines that aren't primary. }
6... Na6
{ White's score - 52.6%. I like this move a lot, because both 6... c5 and 6... h6 lead to positions typical for a Benoni.

It is possible because the c5-square is secured by the a6-Knight ! }
7. Qd2
{ White's score - 50.8%. This is a more popular move than all of the other tries combined. White doesn't reveal his plans yet and makes a useful developing move. }
7... e5
{ White's score - 50. 5%. Having the c5-square under control we can go for this one. The point is that in all of the exchange lines we will have ... Rd6 as a response to Bg5. }
8. d5
{ Played in more than 90% games. This is a typical Averbakh move closing the centre and trying to eliminate counterplay. }
8... Qe8
{ White's score - 40.8%. This is a standard move in these types of closed positions in the Averbakh system. Black prepares ... Nh5 or in some cases ... Nfd7. }
9. Bd1
{ White's score - 57.5%. By far the most popular move regrouping the Bishop to c2 from where it will defend the e4-pawn while simultaneously freeing the e2-square for the Knight. Note that 9. Nf3 would transpose to the 8. Nf3 line. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 46.3%. Since White prepares Bc2 as a response to ... Nc5 it is better to switch to this continuation. Not only do we prepare to take on d5 but in some cases might even consider ... b5. }
10. Nge2
{ The most popular move finishing development and preparing to castle. } 10...
cxd5
{ White focused on development by playing Nge2 so we shouldn't continue with ... b5. It would be not that great when White is only one tempo short from castling - unlikely as in the 10. f3 line where ... b5 was strong. }
11. cxd5
{ Usually in the Averbakh White tries to keep the centre solid. Two other lines are possible. Let's see:   11.exd5  Nc5  12.Ng3  a5   11.Bxf6  Bxf6  12.Nxd5  Bd8  planning ... Nc7 next to challenge the d5-Knight.  In both cases with good counterplay for Black. }
11... b5
{ With the centre more stable it is a different story. This is not even a pawn sacrifice now. Note how useful the Queen is on e8. }
12. a3 { White has to stop b4. } 12... Nc5
{ We will seize the queenside initiative with ... a5 next. } 13. Bc2
{ 13.f3  a5  followed by ...Bd7 is similar  (.) } 13... a5 14. O-O
{ Be careful now ! White's positional idea is to play b4 and our Knight has no good retreating square. }
14... a4
{ This is a necessary continuation since ... b4 is not possible due to the a8-Rook hanging after axb5. }
15. Nc1
{ White has a very nice positional idea in mind. Our opponent will try to show us that our pawn moves on the queenside created a lot of holes. White will play Na2 - b4 next and the Knight on b4 is very strong. We can't stop that plan so it is better to create a strong plan on our own. }
15... Bd7 { Firstly, finishing development. } 16. N1a2
{ 16.f3  Nh5  17.Nd3  Nb7!  is similar to the main game - we will play ... Na5 and we have ... Nf4 options too  (.) }
16... Nb7 { Secondly, also regrouping the Knight, this time to a5! } 17. Nb4
Na5
{ The Knight is very well placed here. It might have looked pretty on c5, but it wasn't doing anything valuable there. From a5 it stops b3 and can jump to c4 in many variations. }
18. Qe2 Nh5
{ ... Nc4 won't run away from us - and in fact, might not be that strong due to Bd3. }
19. Bd3 Rb8
{ Strengthening b5 and preparing either ... Nf4 or ... f5 with good kingside counterplay. On the other hand, White doesn't have any active possibilities so he has to wait for us to do anything. I think this is already a depressing position for White - he didn't do anything wrong and now is left without any active plan. }

I've met the Bagirov line or the Makogonov line or even just the h3 King's Indian while polish GM Michal Krasenkow is considered to be one of the world's leading experts. White's basic idea is to meet ... e5 with d5 and be ready to play g4 next stopping Black's ... f5. This is a very positional idea that puts more effort into stopping Black's plans than implementing White's own ideas. I recommend paying serious attention to this chapter. You won't see this line too often, but you need to be aware that White manages to win games without Black firing a single shot. }
6... e5
{ White's score - 56.5%. If you are into Benoni positions than 6... c5 might be for you, but for us, the KID aficionados, I recommend to play in style of the Classical Variation. }

7... Nh5
{ White's score - 54.8%.   It is necessary to play this move right away. If we start with  7...a5  which is similar to the Petrosian system, then White can play  8.g4  and we can't proceed with our usual kingside counterplay. We should play  8...Na6  9.Be3  Nd7  but I don't like  10.a3!  and  10...Ndc5?  would be wrong due to  11.b4!  and White is significantly better.   It is possible to play  10...Nb6!?  defending the Rook but I don't like to put my Knight on  b6  in this structure. It is playable but not to my taste. }

13. Be3 { I consider it to be the best way for White to get anything. } 13...

{ Only now should White capture on e4.   14.Ng4  Nf4!  15.Bxe4  Bf5!  is excellent for Black. }
14... Rb8
{ I like this rare concept a lot. Our plan is very simple - play ... b5. } 15.
Qe2

15... Bf5 16. f3
{ 16.Nf1  runs into  16...Nf4!  17.gxf4  exf4  18.Bc1  Qe7  with great positional compensation for the piece. My engine gives evaluations around -1.19.  f3  Rbe8  20.Nfd2  Nc5  and Black is much better - White has nothing to do here and we can increase pressure. }
16... h5 { A similar idea of stopping g4. } 17. Nf1 Nf4
{ Once again this positional sacrifice. } 18. gxf4 exf4 19. Bf2 Nb4
{ Our basic ideas are ... Qa4 followed by ... Rbe8 while ... Bxe4 can also be considered as a back-up plan. Stockfish gives 0.0 but only after White's accurate defence.   Note that  19...g5!?  is also very interesting. The idea is to simply play ... g4.  20.Nxg5   20.O-O-O?!  is inaccurate due to  20...c5!  stopping Bd4 and preparing ... b5  20...Nb4!  21.Ne4   21.Qxe8  Rfxe8+  22.Kd2  Nd3  looks extremely risky for White.  21...Qa4  and by sacrificing the g-pawn we won a tempo for the attack. }

7. d5
{ White's score - 61.5%.   7.Nf3?!  exd4!  leads to a bad version of that pawn structure for White.

5. Bg5
{ White's score - 54.6%. This is only the 8th popular move for White. Our opponent doesn't do anything extraordinary, just develops the Bishop and waits. If we castle now, then after Be2 f3 or h3 play may transpose to respectively the Averbakh, the Samisch or the previous chapter. I think we can punish White right here, right now without allowing him to transpose to one of these openings. }
5... h6
{ White's score - 53.1%. Immediately challenging the Bishop is the most critical. White has to make a decision about the Bishop's future.   I think that  5...O-O  is slightly inaccurate since White can play either  6.Qd2   or  6.f4  (in both cases with lines that we should avoid.) }

Another interesting line was to play the Benko style with  6...a6!?  7.Be2  c5  8.d5  b5  with a good version of the Benko. Normally, White never puts the Knight on g3 in this pawn structure.  By playing ... h5 we want to push the h-pawn up the board. And I don't mean push it up to h4, no. We will push the pawn up to h3! }

I recommended going  7...h4  which is a nice practical weapon, but after  8.Nf1  h3  White has  9.gxh3!  and I couldn't make everything work!  7... a5 is a nice preparatory move.

5... d6 6. b3
{ White's score - 56.5%. This is a better version of the double fianchetto for White. Our pawn is already on d6 so any ideas connected with ... d5 would require losing a tempo.   6.c4  is the most popular move and will transpose either to the 9th or to the 10th chapter. }
6... e5
{ White's score - 53.6%. I think that in this scenario this is Black's most reliable move. If we go for 6... c5 and take on d4, we will be a tempo down in comparison with the 5. b3 c5 variation. }

1. d4 Nf6
{ In the last theoretical chapter we will take a look at White's different options of avoiding the King's Indian on move 2. They will include the Veresov Opening, the Jobava System, the 2. g3 line and ... the Tromp... Note that we will usually abandon the ...g6 line since we will have better options against most of these openings. }
2. Bg5
{ White's score - 54.3%. As you probably know, my first course for Chessable was about the Trompovsky for White. You can safely resign here and go for a walk pondering what went wrong. Just kidding ! We can counter even that ! }
2... d5
{ White's score - 54.3%. I think that this is the best response to the Trompovsky. We follow the strategy of playing in the centre and White has to make a decision if he wants to take on f6 or not. }
3. e3
{ It is a tricky line. White doesn't really abandon his plans of taking on f6 and waits for Black's response. }
3... c6
{ White's score - 56.4%. I like this solid move the most.   If we play  3...c5  White can change gears and go for  4.Bxf6  forcing  4...gxf6   4...exf6  5.c3  and  (d5 is the problem.)  (Taking on f6 with the g-pawn is a perfectly playable line but I will recommend taking with the e-pawn.) }
4. Bd3
{ 4.Bxf6  exf6  will transpose to 3. Bxf6.  By playing 4. Bd3 White just develops the Bishop on a natural square and prepares to castle short. }
4... Bg4 { White's score - 53%. The same approach as in the 4. Nd2 line. } 5.
Nf3
{ It is not a popular line but I find some of Black's ideas here quite amusing so I decided to add it. Have a nice learning ! }
5... Nbd7 6. h3 Bxf3
{ It is not a natural move but it speeds up our development. } 7. Qxf3 Ne4
{ Initially, I thought that  7...e5  is best and I even awarded that move with an exclamation mark. But there is a problem.  8.Bxf6  Nxf6  9.dxe5  Qb6  allows  10.exf6!  Qxb2  11.c3  Qxa1  12.Qe2  g6  13.O-O  with tremendous compensation - avoid!  With 7... Ne4, we attack the Bishop and prepare a cute trap. }

3... exf6
{ White's score - 54.2%. This is my recommended recapture. With White, I absolutely love to play against 3... gxf6 while 3... exf6 is a tougher nut to crack. We will try to get a solid position and use a pair of Bishops. }
4. e3 Bd6 { It is also possible to start with ... c6. } 5. g3
{ White wants to fianchetto the Bishop and play Ne2. } 5... c6 6. Bg2 f5
{ White's score - 46.1%. It is crucial to delay castling in this line. White's plan is to play Ne2 and O-O followed by b3 followed by c4 and Nbc3. However, with the Black King still in the centre castling for White is extremely dangerous due to ... h5 - h4 ideas. And going for the b3 and c4 plan with the King in the centre is risky. }

2... c5
{ White's score - 39.8%. This is the most sensible option for Black. It would be logical to play  2...g6  but after  3.Nc3  suddenly we are tricked into an unfamiliar territory of the Jobava London System.   If we, however, try to play  2...d5  then White may change plans and strive for  3.e3  and now we are tricked from our anti-London system.  Be careful ! The text move leads to some original positions, but if you want to stay faithful to the previous lines, then we need to play 2... c5. }
3. e3
{ The most common continuation for White. White's basic plan is to build a kind of pyramid with c3 and then Nd2 with usual London-like play. We want to avoid that ! }
3... Nd5
{ White's score - 29.9%. I think that this is a very interesting continuation that is both underestimated and neglected in the literature. There are different ways of playing that give Black a good position but I like the text move.   Trying to transpose into normal London lines with  3...g6  is tempting but I don't like  4.c3  Bg7  5.Nd2  O-O  6.dxc5  . }
4. Bg3
{ I hope that you don't need too much guidance after  4.Bxb8  . Just enjoy a pair of Bishops, enjoy the game and especially - enjoy life  ! Because life is good if your opponent plays like this. }
4... Qb6
{ Just threatening to take on b2. It is a typical way of playing when the Bishop abandons the queenside. White has two decent options now - play actively with Nc3 or just defend the pawn. }
5. b3
{ The disadvantage of this move is that it loses time and weakens the dark squares. }
5... cxd4 6. exd4
{ 6.Qxd4  is not that bad but when you realize that White scored 0 wins 1 draw and 9 losses with it, then you should expect not to experience too many problems.  6...Qxd4   6...Qa5+!?  keeping the Queens on the board is also possible.  7.exd4  Nc6= }

{ This is a key move.  9...O-O ?!  allows  10.c4  and White managed to get a nice advantage. }
10. c3 Bf5
{ Castling is also fine, but we develop the Bishop with tempo. Black threatens ... Bxb1 followed by ... Nxc3. }
11. Bc4
{ White is obliged to play this move, counterattacking on the c4-Knight.   11.Bd3?!  Bxd3  12.Qxd3  O-O  with ... Rc8 next is a positional mistake for White. Our opponent should keep the light-squared Bishops on the board. }

12. d5 { The only way to stop our plan. } 12... Na5 13. Bd3
{ A must. 13. Be2?! Rc8  threatening ... Be4 is problematic - suddenly, our light-squared Bishop is better than White's. }

{ This is by far the most popular move. It prepares e2 - e4 enabling White to claim even more space in the centre. }

Nbd7, 6... c5 or 6... Bg4 but none of them is a theme of this repertoire. Note that this is the first critical position both for White and Black. White has many options, but in the first theoretical chapters, we will focus on the most popular move which is... }
7. O-O
{ White safeguards the King and is ready for a fight  ! Usually Black plays here  7...Nc6  and after  8.d5  Ne7  a critical position with a ton of theory appears. If your opponent castles on move 7, you can be more than sure that he has something prepared and doesn't mind playing these race-type-of positions.  When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King. The problem is that when I started improving, I found these positions to be very crazy and complicated. I started to dislike situations when only one tempo could decide the game. It was obvious that a new approach for me is necessary. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move. We immediately force White into playing a pawn structure that he may not be familiar with. Normally, White would definitely be prepared for 7... Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved. We will learn plans, ideas and implement them into our games. That's it ! One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3
{ 9.Bf3?!  is not a good option due to  9...Nbd7  and  the f3-Bishop might be a target to some ... Ne5 jumps. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 56.6%. This is our move ! If you checked out my King's Indian attack course for White you can see some resemblance. Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d6 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black was to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although it has a very high drawish tendency and I don't find it too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5. }
10... Nbd7
{ White's score - 60%.   Before we dive into the lines, I just want to mention that you may be misguided by database statistics in the  10...Nh5?!  line. At first glance, it is a great line for Black, but after a forcing sequence  11.g4!  Nf6   11...Qf6?!  doesn't help due to  12.Nf5  and White is much better  12.Bf4  h5  13.Nf5!  gxf5  14.gxf5  and even engines claim that White is much better  ! I strongly recommend avoiding this variation and sticking to my recommendation.   Also, note that with the White King on  h1  it is premature to play  10...d5?!  due to  11.cxd5  cxd5  12.Bg5!  and Black's centre is under heavy pressure as seen in Tal - Spassky, Montreal 1979.  Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }
11. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.9%. The first chapter is devoted to this continuation which is the most popular after 10... Nbd7. As you can see, we've started with the most popular line for White - 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 - and now we dig into the most popular 11. Bg5. This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then do we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ... d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ... Qxb2 but also ... Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually, he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Na4 { This is less popular and I think it is less ambitious. } 12... Qc7
{ 12...Qa5  is also possible - maybe White will blunder the Bishop!  13.Bf4  a6!?  would be my recommendation with the point that  14.Bxd6?  is wrong due to  14...c5!  and the White Knight has no good retreats.   12...Qa5  13.Bf4  a6  14.Nc3  is better but after  14...Ne5  Black has usual counterplay. }
13. Qd2 Nc5
{ Black shouldn't be afraid of getting the pawns doubled, because we will get an eternal control over the d4-square and we can use the queenside pawn majority with a pawn storm starting with ... a5. }
14. Nc3 a5
{ We have a very similar position to these that you will see in the next lines. Black's plan is to combine moves such as ... Nfd7, ... Be5 and maybe ... a4 followed by ... Qa5. For more details of this plan check out the next variations. }

7. O-O

When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King.

It was obvious that a new approach for me is necessary. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move. We immediately force White into playing a pawn structure that he may not be familiar with. Normally, White would definitely be prepared for 7. Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved.

One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3
{ 9.Bf3?!  is not a good option due to  9...Nbd7  and  the f3-Bishop might be a target to some ...Ne5 jumps. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 56.6%. This is our move ! If you checked out my King's Indian attack course for White you can see some resemblance. Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d7 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black was to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although it has a very high drawish tendency and I don't find it too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5. }
10... Nbd7
{ White's score - 60%.   Before we dive into the lines, I just want to mention that you may be misguided by database statistics in the  10...Nh5?!  line. At first glance, it is a great line for Black, but after a forcing sequence  11.g4!  Nf6   11...Qf6?!  doesn't help due to  12.Nf5  and White is much better  12.Bf4  h5  13.Nf5!  gxf5  14.gxf5  and even engines claim that White is much better  ! I strongly recommend avoiding this variation and sticking to my recommendation.   Also, note that with the White King on  h1  it is premature to play  10...d5?!  due to  11.cxd5  cxd5  12.Bg5!  and Black's centre is under heavy pressure as seen in Tal - Spassky, Montreal 1979.  Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }
11. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.9%. The first chapter is devoted to this continuation which is the most popular after 10... Nbd7. As you can see, we've started with the most popular line for White - 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 - and now we dig into the most popular 11. Bg5. This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ...d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ...Qxb2 but also ...Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Nb3
{ This is a ten times more popular approach than 12. Na4. White defends against both threats while creating a threat on his own - Qxd6. }
12... a5
{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ...a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Qxd6
{ This is the variation that I've seen many times in my online blitz games. I hope that your opponents will play this because it hands over the initiative to Black. }
13... a4 14. Qa3
{ This is extremely rare but it contains one trap. I met this in a blitz game, and of course, I've fallen directly into this trap! }
14... h6 { We should kick the Bishop from its active spot first. } 15. Bh4 Bf8
{ And only now we play ... Bf8 attacking the Queen and forcing White to play the following move. }
16. c5 { And this is the moment where we need to be extremely careful. } 16...
Qa7
{ This is the best move. We want to play a combination of ... g5 and take on c5 with a minor piece. Black is  (much)  better in all lines.   It was not too late to follow my steps and go for  16...Nxc5??  17.Nxc5  Bxc5  18.Nxa4!  and it is Black who has to resign - which I did after a few moves. }

Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }
11. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.9%. The first chapter is devoted to this continuation which is the most popular after 10... Nbd7. As you can see, we've started with the most popular line for White - 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 - and now we dig into the most popular 11. Bg5. This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ...d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ...Qxb2 but also ...Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Nb3
{ This is a ten times more popular approach than 12. Na4. White defends against both threats while creating a threat on his own - Qxd6. }
12... a5
{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ...a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Na4 Qb4
{ A similar line to the one that we've seen a move earlier, but now, Black should play more aggressively than to passively retreat to c7. After either Nc1, Nd2 or Nd4 we will play ... Nc5. }
14. Nc1 Nc5
{ If you are not into the Queen sacrifice - shame on you ! - that will appear in the 14... Nc5 line,   then  14...d5  is an interesting alternative.  15.Nd3  Qe7!  16.cxd5  cxd5  17.Nf2  h6  18.Bh4  g5  19.Bg3  Nh5!  with equal chances. }
15. Nd3
{ At first glance, it looks like White gives up the a4-Knight for free, but actually, things are far from simple. }
15... Qxa4 { We have to accept the gift. } 16. b3
{ And now we see the point. If we play Qa3, the Queen will be lost after Bc1. So we have to sell our Queen for the highest price possible ! }
16... Nxb3
{ In Eljanov - Bologan, CRO-chT 2010 a weaker  16...Nfxe4  was played. Now a series of forcing moves start. }
17. axb3 Qxa1 18. Qxa1 Nxe4 19. Qc1 Nxg5 20. Qxg5 Rxe2 21. Qd8+ Bf8
{ Objectively, this position should be evaluated as dynamically equal, but from a practical point of view I would prefer to play it with the Black pieces. A Rook, Bishop and two pawns is more than enough material for the Queen and also, Black doesn't have any looming weaknesses. Our main plan is to play ... a4 and after bxa4 Ra2! followed by Ra2xa4 and the c8-Bishop is free to move. }

7. O-O
{ White safeguards the King and is ready for a fight  ! Usually Black plays here  7...Nc6  and after  8.d5  Ne7  a critical position with a ton of theory appears. If your opponent castles on move 7, you can be more than sure that he has something prepared and doesn't mind playing these race-type-of positions.  When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King. The problem is that when I started improving, I found these positions to be very crazy and complicated. I started to dislike situations when only one tempo could decide the game.

{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move.

Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved. We will learn plans, ideas and implement them into our games. That's it ! One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3

Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d7 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black was to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although it has a very high drawish tendency and I don't find it too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5. }

13... a4
{ Very often we will use this pawn as a hook into our opponent's queenside. }
14. Be3 Qd8
{ White's score 57.6%. This is the best square, from which the Black Queen may choose from joining the kingside or the queenside later. }
15. Nd4 Nc5
{ A critical position has appeared. White has a nice clamp on the centre and Black's pawn break ... d5 is stopped for good. White can also strengthen the position with moves such as Rad1 and Rfe1 but it is quite hard to formulate an obvious plan for our opponent. If White ever touches the b-pawn we will take with the a-pawn and enjoy the opened a-file. Playing f3- f4 seems also very unlikely due to Black's pressure on the e-file. As you can see, it is quite hard to see what to do with both sides. That means that we will start a little hide and seek game, in which the side with more patience and experience will remain victorious ! Black's basic plan in this position is to play ... Nfd7 followed by ... Be5 and in some cases ... Qh4 or ... Qa5. }
16. Rab1 { This was played 9 times. White's idea is to play for a quick b4. }
16... Nfd7
{ Black implements the usual plan of regrouping the Knight and opening up the g7-Bishop. }
17. b4 axb3 18. axb3 Ra3
{ As a result of White's plan we can use the a-file and start active operations on the queenside. }
19. b4
{ Otherwise, White would need to ponder Black's option of taking on d4 followed by grabbing the b3-pawn. }
19... Ne6
{ Black threatens ... Rxc3 followed by ... Qf6 and ... c5 winning ! That's why I love the King's Indian Defence, you have a normal position and tactics appear out of the blue. }
20. Rb3 Rxb3 21. Nxb3 Qe7
{ Just defending the pawn and preparing to play ...Be5 next. } 22. Rd1 Be5
{ Black securely defends the d6-pawn and may prepare ... f5. Yes, I said don't touch the f-pawn, but this position is one of the exceptions. }
23. f4
{ This may look very strong for White, but in fact, Black has a fair share of chances. }
23... Bxc3 { An unstereotypical approach but tactics work for us very well. }
24. Qxc3 g5
{ Destroying White's centre. Our opponent has to be alert not to be worse. After a potential  25.f5  we have  25...Nf4  and we claim the e5-square for the other Knight.   On the other hand, after  25.fxg5  Nxg5  White is forced to play  26.Bxg5  due to Black's pressure on the e-pawn. }

This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ...d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ...Qxb2 but also ...Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Nb3
{ This is a ten times more popular approach than 12. Na4. White defends against both threats while creating a threat on his own - Qxd6. }
12... a5
{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ...a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Qd2
{ White finishes development, defends the b2-pawn and connects the Rooks. This continuation is around 10 times more popular than all of the other moves combined. }
13... a4
{ Very often we will use this pawn as a hook into our opponent's queenside. }
14. Be3 Qd8
{ White's score 57.6%. This is the best square, from which the Black Queen may choose from joining the kingside or the queenside later. }
15. Nd4 Nc5
{ A critical position has appeared. White has a nice clamp on the centre and Black's pawn break ...d5 is stopped for good. White can also strengthen the position with moves such as Rad1 and Rfe1 but it is quite hard to formulate an obvious plan for our opponent. If White ever touches the b-pawn we will take with the a-pawn and enjoy the opened a-file. Playing f3- f4 seems also very unlikely due to Black's pressure on the e-file. As you can see, it is quite hard to see what to do with both sides. That means that we will start a little hide and seek game, in which the side with more patience and experience will remain victorious ! Black's basic plan in this position is to play ...Nfd7 followed by ...Be5 and in some cases ...Qh4 or ...Qa5. }
16. b4 { I think that this continuation shouldn't pose Black any problems. }
16... axb3 17. axb3 Rxa1 18. Rxa1 Nh5
{ Threatening ... Bxd4 followed by ... Nxb3. Also, if White isn't careful, he may experience problems after ... Be5 and ... Qh4. Suddenly, the White King may become a target ! }
19. Bd1 f5
{ Once again we see that the ... f5 break can be efficient, but ONLY when everything is ready. We follow a game Smith - Shimanov, Rilton Cup 2010. }
20. b4
{ 20.exf5  is not a good option for White due to  20...Qe7  21.Bg1  Qh4  22.Bf2  Ng3+!  23.Kg1   23.Bxg3?!  is even worse due to  23...Qxd4  24.Qxd4  Bxd4  25.Rc1  Bxf5  and Black is much better.  23...Qxh2+!  surprise surprise  !  24.Kxh2  Nf1+  25.Kg1  Nxd2  with an advantage for Black.  You may wonder why I marked this line as a clickable variation instead of going for a trainable line ?! A reason for that is that this is not an opening line that you MUST memorize, more like a middlegame theme that I want to SHOW you. There will be a lot of 'blue' lines as this one, but my idea is to present you with a fistful of ideas, plans and tactical/strategic themes. }
20... Ne6
{ With chances for both sides. Black may consider ideas such as ...Be5 followed by ...Qh4, or just play ...Qf6 - in every case striking where White is the weakest - on the dark squares ! This is the hidden consequence of White's 9. f3! Even in the middlegame and in the endgame White will very often feel the pain of the whole dark-squared complex being weakened. }

4... d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2
{ White's last two moves are characteristic to the so-called Classical Variation.

White will most probably castle kingside, but there are some options of delaying that manouver. }
6... e5
{ This is a standard way of challenging the strong centre. Black is done going for a slow approach and starts attacking White's pawn wall. The other options would be 6... Na6, 6... Nbd7, 6... c5 or 6... Bg4 but none of them is a theme of this repertoire. Note that this is a first critical position both for White and Black. White has many options, but in the first theoretical chapters, we will focus on the most popular move which is... }
7. O-O
{ White safeguards the King and is ready for a fight  ! Usually Black plays here  7...Nc6  and after  8.d5  Ne7  a critical position with a ton of theory appears. If your opponent castles on move 7, you can be more than sure that he has something prepared and doesn't mind playing these race-type-of positions.  When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King. The problem is that when I started improving, I found these positions to be very crazy and complicated. I started to dislike situations when only one tempo could decide the game. It was obvious that a new approach for me is necessary. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move. We immediately force White into playing a pawn structure that he may not be familiar with. Normally, White would definitely be prepared for 7. Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved. We will learn plans, ideas and implement them into our games. That's it ! One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3
{ 9.Bf3?!  is not a good option due to  9...Nbd7  and  the f3-Bishop might be a target to some ...Ne5 jumps. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 56.6%. This is our move ! If you checked out my King's Indian attack course for White you can see some resemblance. Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d7 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black was to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although it has a very high drawish tendency and I don't find it too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5. }
10... Nbd7
{ White's score - 60%.   Before we dive into the lines, I just want to mention that you may be misguided by database statistics in the  10...Nh5?!  line. At first glance, it is a great line for Black, but after a forcing sequence  11.g4!  Nf6   11...Qf6?!  doesn't help due to  12.Nf5  and White is much better  12.Bf4  h5  13.Nf5!  gxf5  14.gxf5  and even engines claim that White is much better  ! I strongly recommend avoiding this variation and sticking to my recommendation.   Also, note that with the White King on  h1  it is premature to play  10...d5?!  due to  11.cxd5  cxd5  12.Bg5!  and Black's centre is under heavy pressure as seen in Tal - Spassky, Montreal 1979.  Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }

16. Rfd1
{ This is the most popular continuation for White. White brings the Rook into the semi-open d-file, while claiming that the other Rook will have some important duties on the queenside.  16.Rad1  will lead to a similar position after  16...Nfd7  17.Rfe1  Be5  . }
16... Nfd7
{ I am sure you are aware of what Black's ideas are ! Next comes ... Be5. } 17.
Rab1
{ This is a more direct approach than 17. Bf1. White prepares b2 - b4.   17.Nc2  doesn't change much after  17...Be5  with mutual chances. }
17... Qa5
{ I like this move which is a novelty. Black anticipates b2 - b4 and plans to take on b3 and put the Queen on b4 blocking White's queenside play !   The other possible continuation for Black is a more popular  17...Be5  but it leads to a slightly inferior endgame after  18.f4  Bg7  19.Bf3  Nf6  20.Nxc6  Nfxe4  21.Nxe4  Nxe4  22.Bxe4  Qc7  23.Qxd6  Qxd6  24.Rxd6  Rxe4  25.Rd8+  Bf8  26.Bc5  bxc6  27.Rxf8+   27.Bxf8  Bb7=  27...Kg7  28.Rd8  Bb7  .  It is a slightly worse position for Black but should be easily holdable. My suggested novelty 17... Qa5 keeps things more complex. Also, please don't be afraid of such long variations ! I just want to show you different middlegame possibilities for both sides. }
18. b4
{ The most forcing continuation. 18. Nc2 is a standard continuation safeguarding the b4-square before proceeding with the queenside expansion, but it doesn't lead to problems for Black.   18.Nc2  Be5  is a normal move after which White may play  19.Bd4  Ne6!  inviting White to take the Bishop with  20.Bxe5  dxe5  . A possible continuation may be  21.b4  axb3  22.axb3  Qc7  23.b4  Rd8  24.Qe3  Ndf8  with equal chances.  Black managed to get rid of a backward d6-pawn and can look into the future with confidence. A possible plan for Black would be to play... h5 - h4 and plant the Knight on f4 - once again playing on the dark squares. White, on the other hand, doesn't have too many active possibilities and the e2-Bishop may become useless - blocked by its own pawns. }
18... axb3 19. axb3 Qb4
{ This was Black's idea ! The queenside is blocked for a moment and we will continue with ...Nf8 - e6 pressurizing White's centre. }
20. Qc2 Nf8
{ That's it. The Knight had nothing valuable to do on d7 so it relocates itself to e6. }
21. Bf1 Nfe6 22. Nxe6
{ 22.Nde2  is another option. Black should play actively with  22...Ra3  23.Nb5!?   23.Na2  Qa5  and White has nothing better than  24.Nc3  Qb4=  23...Rxb3   If you are into crazy territories, then  23...cxb5!?  may be for you. You need to sacrifice the Queen after  24.Bd2  Qxb3  25.Rxb3  Rxb3  26.Bc3  Rxc3  27.Nxc3  b4  28.Nd5  Bd7  and the b-pawn is very strong. Also, if White isn't careful he may run into ...  Ba4  . White has to be better here, but in a practical game, it may be very unpleasant for our opponent.  24.Nxd6  Rd8= }
22... Bxe6 23. Bd2 { Forcing the Black Queen to move back. } 23... Qb6 24. b4
Nd7
{ Ok, White managed to expand on the queenside, but now the c4-square may become a problem. Also, it may not be visible from here, but the 3rd rank is a juicy target for our Rook ! }
25. Bf4 Ra3 { That's what I meant when I wrote about the juicy 3rd rank ! } 26.
Ne2 Be5 { We may increase pressure with ... Rea8 or ... Qa6. } *

The same thing happens in the Najdorf Sicilian - if White goes for Be2 followed by O-O we call it the Classical Variation. White will most probably castle kingside, but there are some options of delaying that manouver. }
6... e5
{ This is a standard way of challenging the strong centre. Black is done going for a slow approach and starts attacking White's pawn wall. The other options would be 6... Na6, 6... Nbd7, 6... c5 or 6... Bg4 but none of them is a theme of this repertoire. Note that this is a first critical position both for White and Black. White has many options, but in the first theoretical chapters, we will focus on the most popular move which is... }
7. O-O
{ White safeguards the King and is ready for a fight  ! Usually Black plays here  7...Nc6  and after  8.d5  Ne7  a critical position with a ton of theory appears. If your opponent castles on move 7, you can be more than sure that he has something prepared and doesn't mind playing these race-type-of positions.  When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King. The problem is that when I started improving, I found these positions to be very crazy and complicated. I started to dislike situations when only one tempo could decide the game. It was obvious that a new approach for me is necessary. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move. We immediately force White into playing a pawn structure that he may not be familiar with. Normally, White would definitely be prepared for 7. Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved. We will learn plans, ideas and implement them into our games. That's it ! One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3
{ 9.Bf3?!  is not a good option due to  9...Nbd7  and  the f3-Bishop might be a target to some ...Ne5 jumps. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 56.6%. This is our move ! If you checked out my King's Indian attack course for White you can see some resemblance. Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d7 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black was to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although it has a very high drawish tendency and I don't find it too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5. }
10... Nbd7
{ White's score - 60%.   Before we dive into the lines, I just want to mention that you may be misguided by database statistics in the  10...Nh5?!  line. At first glance, it is a great line for Black, but after a forcing sequence  11.g4!  Nf6   11...Qf6?!  doesn't help due to  12.Nf5  and White is much better  12.Bf4  h5  13.Nf5!  gxf5  14.gxf5  and even engines claim that White is much better  ! I strongly recommend avoiding this variation and sticking to my recommendation.   Also, note that with the White King on  h1  it is premature to play  10...d5?!  due to  11.cxd5  cxd5  12.Bg5!  and Black's centre is under heavy pressure as seen in Tal - Spassky, Montreal 1979.  Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }
11. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.9%. The first chapter is devoted to this continuation which is the most popular after 10... Nbd7. As you can see, we've started with the most popular line for White - 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 - and now we dig into the most popular 11. Bg5. This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ...d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ...Qxb2 but also ...Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Nb3
{ This is a ten times more popular approach than 12. Na4. White defends against both threats while creating a threat on his own - Qxd6. }
12... a5
{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ...a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Qd2
{ White finishes development, defends the b2-pawn and connects the Rooks. This continuation is around 10 times more popular than all of the other moves combined. }
13... a4
{ Very often we will use this pawn as a hook into our opponent's queenside. }
14. Be3 Qd8
{ White's score 57.6%. This is the best square, from which the Black Queen may choose from joining the kingside or the queenside later. }
15. Nd4 Nc5
{ A critical position has appeared. White has a nice clamp on the centre and Black's pawn break ...d5 is stopped for good. White can also strengthen the position with moves such as Rad1 and Rfe1 but it is quite hard to formulate an obvious plan for our opponent. If White ever touches the b-pawn we will take with the a-pawn and enjoy the opened a-file. Playing f3- f4 seems also very unlikely due to Black's pressure on the e-file. As you can see, it is quite hard to see what to do with both sides. That means that we will start a little hide and seek game, in which the side with more patience and experience will remain victorious ! Black's basic plan in this position is to play ...Nfd7 followed by ...Be5 and in some cases ...Qh4 or ...Qa5. }
16. Rfd1
{ This is the most popular continuation for White. White brings the Rook into the semi-open d-file, while claiming that the other Rook will have some important duties on the queenside.  16.Rad1  will lead to a similar position after  16...Nfd7  17.Rfe1  Be5  . }
16... Nfd7
{ I am sure you are aware of what Black's ideas are ! Next comes ... Be5. } 17.
Bf1
{ The most popular move hiding the Bishop from Black's e8-Rook scope. This is kind of a deep prophylactic move that world champions Tigran Petrosian or Anatoly Karpov were famous for ! }
17... Be5
{ Once again this plan that can be usually played on autopilot. The only exception was a 17. Rab1 line. }
18. Rab1 Qa5
{ It seems unlikely that the Queen will do anything on the kingside, so we use it on the queenside. I think that we could safely end the theoretical lines here, but I've decided to analyse a few options and add some material to your learning experience. }
19. Qc2
{ This was played by Khalifman against Kokarev in Russian Team Championship 2009. I don't get the idea of this move though, as it runs into one of the standard plans for Black ! }
19... Na6
{ Planning ... Nb4 and ... Nc5 next when White will be forced to play a2 - a3 sooner or later. That would be a big achievement for Black since the hole on b3 would be a weakness for White. }
20. Qxa4 { This looks like the only test of Black's idea. } 20... Qxa4 21. Nxa4
Nb4
{ Black gets back a sacrificed pawn. One possible scenario would be  22.b3  Nxa2  23.Rd2  Nb4  24.Nc2  Nxc2  25.Rxc2  f5!  26.exf5  Nf8  27.Bd3  Bxf5  28.Bxf5  gxf5  with mutual chances.  Yes, we have slightly weakened our pawn structure, but we have very active pieces and we will play ... Ne6 next. }

White has many options, but in the first theoretical chapters, we will focus on the most popular move which is... }
7. O-O
{ White safeguards the King and is ready for a fight  ! Usually Black plays here  7...Nc6  and after  8.d5  Ne7  a critical position with a ton of theory appears. If your opponent castles on move 7, you can be more than sure that he has something prepared and doesn't mind playing these race-type-of positions.  When I started my KID journey I had a huge fondness for these positions and I always liked to go for an all-out attack on the White King. The problem is that when I started improving, I found these positions to be very crazy and complicated. I started to dislike situations when only one tempo could decide the game. It was obvious that a new approach for me is necessary. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 58. 2%. Personally, I would attach an exclamation mark, but it would be an exaggeration. However, I wouldn't underestimate the value of this move. We immediately force White into playing a pawn structure that he may not be familiar with. Normally, White would definitely be prepared for 7. Nc6 8. d5 as I've already mentioned, but here, after 7... exd4, positions will be of a different type. There will be no races, no King's attacks, no heavy theory involved. We will learn plans, ideas and implement them into our games. That's it ! One hint that I can give you when browsing and learning the first chapters about the Classical Variation - don't touch the f-pawn ! Of course, sometimes there will be some exceptions, but let's make GM Ben Finegold proud and associate 'f' with forget about it. }
8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Black puts the Rook on the newly opened file. White doesn't have much of a choice but to defend the e4-pawn with f2 - f3 and that will weaken the dark squares in our opponent's camp as well as strip the King from some pawn protection. }
9. f3
{ 9.Bf3?!  is not a good option due to  9...Nbd7  and  the f3-Bishop might be a target to some ...Ne5 jumps. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 56.6%. This is our move ! If you checked out my King's Indian attack course for White you can see some resemblance. Black's basic plan is to prepare ... d7 - d5 under the right circumstances and whenever the centre liquidates, there are going to be two important factors left: a   White's weakened position with the pawn on f3; b   Black's Bishop on g7 would be much stronger than it's opponent on c1. In other words, if Black was to move, we would go ... d5! and claim the advantage. Also, I want to inform you that I will attach percentages from the Chessbase Online Database to show you what is White's score from different opening positions.   I will just briefly mention that  9...Nc6  is an interesting line for Black, although it has a very high drawish tendency and I don't find it too appealing. }
10. Kh1
{ White's score - 60%. By far the most popular move to which the first three theoretical chapters are dedicated. White safeguards the King avoiding any problems on the g1 - a7 diagonal. Such tries as 10. Be3, 10. Nc2 or 10. Bg5 will be discussed in the chapter 5. }
10... Nbd7
{ White's score - 60%.   Before we dive into the lines, I just want to mention that you may be misguided by database statistics in the  10...Nh5?!  line. At first glance, it is a great line for Black, but after a forcing sequence  11.g4!  Nf6   11...Qf6?!  doesn't help due to  12.Nf5  and White is much better  12.Bf4  h5  13.Nf5!  gxf5  14.gxf5  and even engines claim that White is much better  ! I strongly recommend avoiding this variation and sticking to my recommendation.   Also, note that with the White King on  h1  it is premature to play  10...d5?!  due to  11.cxd5  cxd5  12.Bg5!  and Black's centre is under heavy pressure as seen in Tal - Spassky, Montreal 1979.  Back to 10... Nbd7! Black just develops a piece and in some cases prepares ... Nb6 and ... d5. We also wait to see what White's plan is and we will adapt our plans according to our opponent's moves. }
11. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.9%. The first chapter is devoted to this continuation which is the most popular after 10... Nbd7. As you can see, we've started with the most popular line for White - 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 - and now we dig into the most popular 11. Bg5. This is the approach that I wanted to go for - firstly, we analyse the most popular continuations for our opponent, and only then we go through some minor lines. I think that by structuring our work that exact way you can benefit the most from learning important plans and ideas for both sides that appear in the mainline. Note that with the White Bishop on g5 we should abandon plans connected with ...d5 as it is very unlikely that we will be able to implement them. Instead of that, we will target White's weak spots on the queenside. Also, we get a position with all pieces still on the board, which means that we have a lot of room to outplay our opponent. Black's position is full of hidden dynamism, and every inaccuracy may be lethal for White. }
11... Qb6
{ White's score - 59.9%. Not only threatening ...Qxb2 but also ...Nxe4 with a discovered attack on the White Knight on d4! White has to react somehow and usually he moves one of the Knights. }
12. Nb3
{ This is a ten times more popular approach than 12. Na4. White defends against both threats while creating a threat on his own - Qxd6. }
12... a5
{ White's score - 59.5%. A strong move preparing ...a4 and indirectly threatening the b2-pawn. Note that the weakness of the d6-pawn is apparent. Usually, in the King's Indian Defence, we find different tactical or strategic resources to defend the d-pawn. }
13. Qd2
{ White finishes development, defends the b2-pawn and connects the Rooks. This continuation is around 10 times more popular than all of the other moves combined. }
13... a4
{ Very often we will use this pawn as a hook into our opponent's queenside. }
14. Be3 Qd8
{ White's score 57.6%. This is the best square, from which the Black Queen may choose from joining the kingside or the queenside later. }
15. Nd4 Nc5
{ A critical position has appeared. White has a nice clamp on the centre and Black's pawn break ...d5 is stopped for good. White can also strengthen the position with moves such as Rad1 and Rfe1 but it is quite hard to formulate an obvious plan for our opponent. If White ever touches the b-pawn we will take with the a-pawn and enjoy the opened a-file. Playing f3- f4 seems also very unlikely due to Black's pressure on the e-file. As you can see, it is quite hard to see what to do with both sides. That means that we will start a little hide and seek game, in which the side with more patience and experience will remain victorious ! Black's basic plan in this position is to play ...Nfd7 followed by ...Be5 and in some cases ...Qh4 or ...Qa5. }
16. Rfd1
{ This is the most popular continuation for White. White brings the Rook into the semi-open d-file, while claiming that the other Rook will have some important duties on the queenside.  16.Rad1  will lead to a similar position after  16...Nfd7  17.Rfe1  Be5  . }

12. Bxd6 { White's score - 58.8%. } 12... Qf6

13. Nc2 { White's score - 43.8%. This should be pretty harmless for Black. }
13... Nf4 14. c5
{ 14. Rf2 is the strongest option and will be analysed next.   Also, note that  14.Bxf4?!  Qxf4  is dubious for White.  Black enjoys full compensation for a sacrificed pawn. Such ideas as ...Nc5 + ...a5 followed by ...f5 or ...Be5 followed by mating threats should give us excellent practical chances. Going back to 14. c5?! it is a bad move which is just a tactical miscalculation. Black immediately gets the upper hand with a nice shot ! }
14... Nxc5 { This is what White missed ! } 15. e5 Rxe5

17. Qd8+ Bf8 { Note that Black threatens ... Bh3! } 18. Qd2 Nxe2 19. Rae1
{ The only move to hold the balance. If  19.Qxe2?!  then  19...Qxe2  20.Nxe2  Bg7  and Black is better. }
19... Be6 20. Rxe2 Qf6

19. Bxe5 Qxe5
{ We have good compensation for a sacrificed pawn. Our main threat is to play ... f5 followed by ... fxe4 opening up the position for our Bishops. Black would need to find a computer-like 20. g3 to keep any chances for the advantage. We would have two choices:   The first one would be to regain the pawn by  20.g3  ...  Bxe3  21.Qxe3  Bxc4  22.Rad1  Be6  with a slightly better position for White.   However, I would recommend playing  20.g3  Rad8!?  keeping the tension. Now after  21.Rad1  Rxd2  22.Rxd2  Qa5  Black has compensation.   After  20.g3  Rad8  21.f4  Black also gets dynamic play after  21...Rxd2  22.Qxd2  Qa5  23.Rd1  Bf8  with compensation.  I don't claim that Black is fully equal and that equality has been reached - no. I think that an honest evaluation would be that in the engine's match, White would be a slight favourite, but in practical play, Black's chances shouldn't be underestimated. Also, 20. g3 has never been played in practice so I would sleep well. And don't forget one thing ! You play the King's Indian, you give up the centre to attack it later, and to have many winning chances with Black you have to sacrifice something. That means that from time to time you will land in these += positions - that is the cost of playing for a win with Black. For me, it is a cost that I've never had any problems with. }

{ A strong novelty by GM Milos Pavlovic from his book 'New ideas in the King's Indian'. I consider this to be the only saving grace for Black, so I am forced to borrow some of his analysis and back it up with my own research. A funny thing is that 6 games reached that position - 5 correspondence games and one over the board game - mine xD Also, the result of that game, Gbyl - Plichta, POL-chT 2018 rapid is wrong - it was a draw. One important thing that I want to tell you is that there are a lot of different lines possible from now, but the chance of getting one in over the board competition is small. I was the chosen one, but that's punishment for digging in such lines. So it would be a waste of your time to have 30 crazy computer-like lines as trainables. That's why I split the knowledge into two parts - the one that you've already acquainted and the one that I publish as informational middlegame guidance in the next variation ! Because we finish trainable variations for this chapter, there is a small rule of thumb for you: After 17. Qc2 and 17. Nd2 play 17... b5! while after 17. Rc1 prepare it with 17... Rd8 and only play ... b5 next. Now you are ready to rock and roll ! }

Planting the Bishop on e6 before pushing the a-pawn.  21.Bc4  Bxc4  22.Qxc4  Red8  ...a4 comes next.  23.Rfc1  a4  24.Nc5  Rd2=+  With some limp moves White got a worse position. }

We only need to remember not to allow Ra7+ Kf6?? with e5+ Kf5 Rf7# being an embarrassing finish.  35.Nh5+  Ke5  36.Ra7  a3⇆  White needs to defend accurately to save this position. }

{ It is very hard for White to make any improvements. I would go even further and claim that it is hard for White to make moves. We can improve our position with moves such as ...Kg7 and ...h4. Even the engine gives 0.08. So this type of position is like THE WORST case scenario for Black, which is not that bad I think. I wouldn't mind playing something like this over the board. Also, remember a very important thing. I added this middlegame guidance only to show you different plans and ideas and assure you that there is nothing to be really afraid of. Initially, I thought that only White has fun in this line, while in reality, White has to be as careful as Black not to overextend and be quickly punished. This is the only chapter in the whole repertoire, where I was forced to use such Stockfish-like measures to make my course work. I apologise for those of you that got scared with the number of variations. This was the only chapter that required that. There will be only 9. Nf4 in the main Samisch chapter that will require computer-like precision, but our opponents would need to show it too. And I doubt they will. }

{ White's score - 0.5/2. This is my recommendation. I believe that from the whole 11. Be3 complex, you will get the most playable and the soundest positions here, after 11... Nb6. Let me mention two of the most popular continuations:   11...a6?!  was for a long time considered to be the best line for Black and it is a line that I played until I started working on this course.  12.Nc2  Ne5  13.f4  Neg4  14.Bg1  h5  15.Bf3  Be6  16.Qd3!  spoils all fun for Black. I spent a few hours trying to make the whole line work, but it just doesn't.  16...b5   16...Qe7?!  is a strange recommendation by Pavlovic, but White is hugely on top after  17.Nd4  17.Rfd1!  and Black is just worse in all lines, for example,  17...Bh6  18.cxb5  axb5   18...Bxf4?!  19.Qf1!  Be5  20.bxc6  is much better for White.  19.Qxd6  Qxd6  20.Rxd6  Bxf4  21.Rxc6  and White is just better everywhere. I tried many moves to prove Black's compensation and maybe someday there will be some correspondence game to prove that Black is OK, but for me, now in 2019 Black is far from ok.   Also,  11...d5?!  is premature due to  12.cxd5  Nxd5   12...cxd5  doesn't help either after  13.Ndb5!  13.exd5  Rxe3  14.dxc6  with an advantage for White.  So Black's idea of playing 11...

He even stated once that he managed to buy a flat thanks to his opponents who dared to play the king's Indian Defence against him. It is true, he was very successful with his positional approach. White's main idea is to close the centre avoiding any ...exd4 lines. White will usually play Bg5 next and try to limit Black's activity to minimum. }
7... a5

Two minor options for White are   8.a3  Nh5  with good chances for Black on the kingside   but not  8...Na6?  9.b4!  using the pin on the a-file   and  8.g3  Na6  9.Nh4  Nc5  10.f3  Bh3  when Black has somewhat better chances. }

{ White's score - 54.4%. This move which was proposed by GM Zviagintsev leads to positions similar to those that will be analysed thoroughly in the 15th chapter about the 5. h3 O-O 6. Nf3 lines. White prepares g4 in some cases while taking the g4-square under firm control. After White plays g4 and we eventually go for ...f5 White may take twice on f5 and enjoy the e4-square for his pieces. }

Let's see some lines:  13.Bxd8  Nxc3  14.Qe1   14.Bxc7?  is much worse due to  14...Nxd1  15.Rfxd1  Ra6  with an advantage for Black.  14...Rfxd8  15.Nb1  - the only move to get an advantage.   15.f3  allows  15...f5  16.Bd1  Rf8  17.Bc2  e4!  18.fxe4  fxe4  19.h3  Nd3  20.Rxf8+  Rxf8  21.Bxd3  exd3  22.Kh1  Ne2  23.Rd1  Nc3  24.Ra1  Ne2=  15...Nxe2+  16.Qxe2  e4  17.Na3   17.Nd2  Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  with mutual chances.  17...Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  .  Black's main idea is ...f5 - f4. This is a crazy position and a crazy line that I don't recommend as a mainline, but it would be useful to have it as a surprise weapon. }
12. Kh1
{ White will probably play Kh1 anyway so he prefers to do it immediately. }
12... Nh7 { We plan to play ...h5 followed by ... Bf6. } 13. a3 h5
{ Note that we threaten ...g5! followed by ...h4 trapping the White Bishop. Also, a word or two about the right timing of ...a4. Normally, I would prefer to include this move when White committed himself to Rb1. With the Rook on a1 it is less clear because Black can play b4 and the a3-pawn is securely defended. }
14. f3 Bf6
{ This is my favourite idea in the Petrosian system. We want to exchange the dark-squared Bishops and proceed with the dark square strategy with moves such as ...h4 and ...Nf6 - h5 - f4. You will see more guidance in the middlegame section of this chapter. }
15. Bf2 h4 16. b3
{ 16.Rb1?!  allows  16...a4!  with a very good position for Black. } 16... Bg5

He even stated once that he managed to buy a flat thanks to his opponents who dared to play the king's Indian Defence against him. It is true, he was very successful with his positional approach. White's main idea is to close the centre avoiding any ...exd4 lines. White will usually play Bg5 next and try to limit Black's activity to minimum. }
7... a5
{ White's score - 50.3%. Black immediately grabs some space on the queenside and will play ...Na6, ...Bd7 and ...Qe8 limiting White's activity on the queenside. Only then will Black proceed with the kingside counterplay. }
8. Bg5
{ White's score - 54.4%. The most popular move characteristic for the Petrosian System. White's main idea is to play Nd2 next with perfect harmony. His Knights will prepare queenside attack with b3 + a3 + b4 followed by eventual c5. The Bishop can later go back to e3 if necessary. That means that Black will kick the Bishop immediately before it can safely go back to e3. }
8... h6

9. Bh4

I won't dig deeply into details, but White clears the c4-square for the Knight and his compensation will be too big to handle in a practical game. The score after 14. c5 is 3/3 for White, so I decided to abandon this line and go for a more classical 9... Na6 instead. }

{ White's score - 51.3%. In this chapter we will take a look at the system for White named after the 9th world chess champion, Tigran Petrosian. He even stated once that he managed to buy a flat thanks to his opponents who dared to play the king's Indian Defence against him. It is true, he was very successful with his positional approach. White's main idea is to close the centre avoiding any ...exd4 lines. White will usually play Bg5 next and try to limit Black's activity to minimum. }
7... a5
{ White's score - 50.3%. Black immediately grabs some space on the queenside and will play ...Na6, ...Bd7 and ...Qe8 limiting White's activity on the queenside. Only then will Black proceed with the kingside counterplay. }
8. Bg5
{ White's score - 54.4%. The most popular move characteristic for the Petrosian System. White's main idea is to play Nd2 next with perfect harmony. His Knights will prepare queenside attack with b3 + a3 + b4 followed by eventual c5. The Bishop can later go back to e3 if necessary. That means that Black will kick the Bishop immediately before it can safely go back to e3. }
8... h6
{ White's score - 53.6%. Immediately challenging the Bishop. Now, White has to answer the question about the Bishop's placement. }
9. Bh4
{ White's score - 53.8%. This is a thematic move for the Petrosian system. Black maintains the pin on the h4 - d8 diagonal and prepares Nd2 next. }
9... Na6
{ A standard plan for Black. We will play ...Bd7 and ...Qe8 next stopping White's queenside initiative for the moment.   One line that I really wanted to make work is  9...g5!?  10.Bg3  Nh5  but after  11.h4!  Nxg3  12.fxg3  g4  13.Nd2  h5  White has a veeery unpleasant  14.c5!!  in-store.  I won't dig deeply into details, but White clears the c4-square for the Knight and his compensation will be too big to handle in a practical game. The score after 14. c5 is 3/3 for White, so I decided to abandon this line and go for a more classical 9... Na6 instead. }
10. Nd2
{ A standard regrouping for White. The Knight will support White's queenside play, while the e2-Bishop controls g4 and h5, so White doesn't have to worry about ...Nh5 or ...Ng4 any more.   10.O-O  Bd7  11.Nd2  Qe8  transposes to the mainline with 10. Nd2. }

{ It is also possible to start with 10... Qe8 but it will lead to the same thing most of the time, while after 10... Bd7 we will have one additional option. }
11. O-O
{ A standard reaction. White castles and prepares b3 + a3 followed by Rb1 and b4 grabbing space on the queenside. }
11... Qe8
{ White's score - 51.8%. This is the critical position of the whole Petrosian system. White will try to build up the attack on the queenside with b3 + a3 + Rb1 and b4 + c5 etc. On the other hand, Black will play ...Nh7 followed by ...h5 and an interesting but rare ...Bf6!? trying to exchange the dark-squared Bishops.   There is a crazy option available for Black that I'd like to mention.  11...Nc5  looks like a normal move, but after  12.b3  Black can uncork a maverick-like  12...Nfxe4!?!?  sacrificing the Queen. Let's see some lines:  13.Bxd8  Nxc3  14.Qe1   14.Bxc7?  is much worse due to  14...Nxd1  15.Rfxd1  Ra6  with an advantage for Black.  14...Rfxd8  15.Nb1  - the only move to get an advantage.   15.f3  allows  15...f5  16.Bd1  Rf8  17.Bc2  e4!  18.fxe4  fxe4  19.h3  Nd3  20.Rxf8+  Rxf8  21.Bxd3  exd3  22.Kh1  Ne2  23.Rd1  Nc3  24.Ra1  Ne2=  15...Nxe2+  16.Qxe2  e4  17.Na3   17.Nd2  Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  with mutual chances.  17...Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  .  Black's main idea is ...f5 - f4. This is a crazy position and a crazy line that I don't recommend as a mainline, but it would be useful to have it as a surprise weapon. }

12... Nh7

The fact that it is exactly 13 times less popular makes it a great surprising weapon ! Black's basic plan is to exchange the dark-squared Bishops and play on the dark squares next. }

17. g3
{ I think that avoiding the exchange of dark-squared Bishops is strategically justified, but all in all it weakens the kingside and is a dubious plan. }

{ White's score - 62.2%.   In this chapter we will take a look at the line named after the Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, who played  7.Be3  22 times through his career. White wants to provoke Black into transposing to the main KID lines with  7...Nc6?!  but after  8.d5  Ne7  9.Nd2!  White found the perfect set-up for his minor pieces. You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.  However, it doesn't disturb us at all, because we will take on d4 as fast as possible.   One more line that I want to mention is  7...c6!?  It is quite smart because we want to lure White into  8.O-O   8.Qd2  exd4  9.Nxd4  Re8  10.f3  d5  transposes to the 10. Qd2 line of this chapter  8...exd4  9.Nxd4   9.Bxd4!?  is possible though  Re8  10.f3  d5!  which scores highly for Black.   The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.  Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the 7... c6 move order might be a good start. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 60.5%. This is our main idea in many lines of the Classical King's Indian Defence. It is an efficient and practical approach because most of the time we will get the same pawn structure and we will be more familiar with its nuances than our opponent. The other positive aspect is that the number of lines drastically decrease, which is always a good sign.  Objectively, I don't even think that 7... exd4 is any worse   than  7...Ng4  which is a mainline for Black.  Also, I can share a practical tip. In the Classical system with 6.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3
{ White's score - 62.2%.   In this chapter we will take a look at the line named after the Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, who played  7.Be3  22 times through his career. White wants to provoke Black into transposing to the main KID lines with  7...Nc6?!  but after  8.d5  Ne7  9.Nd2!  White found the perfect set-up for his minor pieces. You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.  However, it doesn't disturb us at all, because we will take on d4 as fast as possible.   One more line that I want to mention is  7...c6!?  It is quite smart because we want to lure White into  8.O-O   8.Qd2  exd4  9.Nxd4  Re8  10.f3  d5   transposes to the  10.Qd2  line of this chapter  8...exd4  9.Nxd4   9.Bxd4!?  is possible though  Re8  10.f3  d5!  which scores highly for Black.   The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.   Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the  7...c6  move order might be a good start. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 60.5%. This is our main idea in many lines of the Classical King's Indian Defence. It is an efficient and practical approach because most of the time we will get the same pawn structure and we will be more familiar with its nuances than our opponent. The other positive aspect is that the number of lines drastically decrease, which is always a good sign.   Objectively, I don't even think that  7...exd4  is any worse   than  7...Ng4  which is a mainline for Black.  Also, I can share a practical tip. In the Classical system with 6. Be2, whenever you have a chance to take on d4 on move 7 - do it ! }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { The same development scheme as in the 7. O-O line. } 9. f3 c6
{ The same plan as in the 7. O-O exd4 lines. } 10. Bf2
{ White's score - 61.2%. This is the most popular move. White removes the Bishop from e3 so it won't run into any ... Rxe3 ideas in the future. }
10... d5 11. exd5 cxd5 12. O-O
{ 12.c5  Nc6  13.O-O  will lead to the same thing. } 12... Nc6 13. c5
{ White's score - 59.6%. This is White's idea. He eliminates tension from the centre and creates a 3 vs 2 pawn majority on the queenside. A position with an isolated d-pawn appeared and usually, the side with such a pawn has dynamic possibilities. White has weak squares on the kingside and in the centre - especially f4 and e3, but also the d4-square can be very important. If Black succeeds in forcing White to take on c6, then the pawn on d5 won't be weak any more and becomes a strong passed pawn instead. Additionally, an open b-file combined with the strong Bishop on g7 pressurizing b2 might be problematic for White.   13.Nxc6?!  is wrong. White shouldn't strengthen our centre for free.  13...bxc6  14.cxd5  Nxd5  15.Nxd5  Qxd5  16.Qxd5  cxd5=  .  With so active pieces it is only Black who can be better, although with accurate play from White it should be equal. }
13... Bf8
{ White's score - 53.8%.   This is a modern treatment. An old mainline goes  13...Nh5  14.Qd2  Be5  15.g3  Ng7  ,  but I think that 13... Bf8 is more dynamic and more interesting  (.)  Black immediately threatens to take on c5 and forces White to do something about it. Normally, White should avoid taking on c6 as I've mentioned and he will either put the King in the corner, play Bb5 or retreat the Knight from d4 to b3. }
14. Bb5 { White increases pressure on the Knight. } 14... Bd7 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16.
b4
{ This is a dangerous idea in 13... Nh5 or 13... Re5, but Black doesn't have any problems in the 13... Bf8 line. Phew, good for us. }
16... a5 17. a3 axb4 18. axb4 Rxa1 19. Qxa1 Nh5
{ As usual, this is a way to activate our pieces. The Knight heads to f4 while the Bishop has done its job on f8 and will be relocated to g7. Note that ... Ng7 - e6 is also a typical plan for Black to put more pressure on d4. }
20. Nce2
{ 20.Re1?!  was played in the game Iotov - Illescas Cordoba, Olympiad 2014 but it is dubious due to  20...Nf4!  and Black is very active. }
20... Qa8 21. Re1 Ng7
{ This is a thematic idea. Black plans ...Ne6 followed by ...Bg7 with full pressure on the d4-square. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3
{ White's score - 62.2%.   In this chapter we will take a look at the line named after the Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, who played  7.Be3  22 times through his career. White wants to provoke Black into transposing to the main KID lines with  7...Nc6?!  but after  8.d5  Ne7  9.Nd2!  White found the perfect set-up for his minor pieces. You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.  However, it doesn't disturb us at all, because we will take on d4 as fast as possible.   One more line that I want to mention is  7...c6!?  It is quite smart because we want to lure White into  8.O-O   8.Qd2  exd4  9.Nxd4  Re8  10.f3  d5   transposes to the  10.Qd2  line of this chapter  8...exd4  9.Nxd4   9.Bxd4!?  is possible though  Re8  10.f3  d5!  which scores highly for Black.   The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.   Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the  7...c6  move order might be a good start. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 60.5%. This is our main idea in many lines of the Classical King's Indian Defence. It is an efficient and practical approach because most of the time we will get the same pawn structure and we will be more familiar with its nuances than our opponent. The other positive aspect is that the number of lines drastically decrease, which is always a good sign.   Objectively, I don't even think that  7...exd4  is any worse   than  7...Ng4  which is a mainline for Black.  Also, I can share a practical tip. In the Classical system with 6. Be2, whenever you have a chance to take on d4 on move 7 - do it ! }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { The same development scheme as in the 7. O-O line. } 9. f3 c6
{ The same plan as in the 7. O-O exd4 lines. } 10. Bf2
{ White's score - 61.2%. This is the most popular move. White removes the Bishop from e3 so it won't run into any ...Rxe5 ideas in the future. }
10... d5 11. exd5 cxd5 12. O-O
{ 12.c5  Nc6  13.O-O  will lead to the same thing. } 12... Nc6 13. c5
{ White's score - 59.6%. This is White's idea. He eliminates tension from the centre and creates a 3 vs 2 pawn majority on the queenside. A position with an isolated d-pawn appeared and usually, the side with such a pawn has dynamic possibilities. White has weak squares on the kingside and in the centre - especially f4 and e3, but also the d4-square can be very important. If Black succeeds in forcing White to take on c6, then the pawn on d5 won't be weak any more and becomes a strong passed pawn instead. Additionally, an open b-file combined with the strong Bishop on g7 pressurizing b2 might be problematic for White.   13.Nxc6?!  is wrong. White shouldn't strengthen our centre for free.  13...bxc6  14.cxd5  Nxd5  15.Nxd5  Qxd5  16.Qxd5  cxd5=  .  With so active pieces it is only Black who can be better, although with accurate play from White it should be equal. }
13... Bf8
{ White's score - 53.8%.   This is a modern treatment. An old mainline goes  13...Nh5  14.Qd2  Be5  15.g3  Ng7  ,   but I think that  13...Bf8  is more dynamic and more interesting.  Black immediately threatens to take on c5 and forces White to do something about it. Normally, White should avoid taking on c6 as I've mentioned and he will either put the King in the corner, play Bb5 or retreat the Knight from d4 to b3. }
14. Nb3
{ White creates a positional threat of playing Bb5 followed by Bh4 and the d5-pawn would be in a precarious situation. }
14... a6
{ Defending against Bb5 is the simplest. The disadvantage is that the b6-square is available for the White Knight, but it is not a big problem. }
15. Na4 Nh5 { Preparing a thematic ...Nf4. } 16. Qd2 Qf6 17. Nb6
{ This move forks the Rook and the pawn and requires accuracy from us. } 17...
Nf4 { This counterattacking move HAS TO be played. } 18. Bd1
{ The best and the safest move. Alternatives don't impress:   18.Rfe1?!  Qg5!   18.Rae1?!  Qg5!   18.Nxd5??  Nxd5  19.Qxd5  Rxe2 }
18... Qg5 { This is the simplest. } 19. Bg3
{ I include  19.g3  in the comments, because  19...Nh3+  is an obvious reply, after which we take on  d2  , take on  f2  and Black is at least equal.  Note that 19. g4 is the same.   The text move looks very tempting but it doesn't work for tactical reasons! }
19... Bxc5+ { This amazing shot works for tactical reasons. } 20. Nxc5
{ 20.Kh1  Be3  is necessary but Black is winning anyway. } 20... Nh3+
{ Bye-bye Mrs Queen. } *

You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.  However, it doesn't disturb us at all, because we will take on d4 as fast as possible.   One more line that I want to mention is  7...c6!?  It is quite smart because we want to lure White into  8.O-O   8.Qd2  exd4  9.Nxd4  Re8  10.f3  d5   transposes to the  10.Qd2  line of this chapter  8...exd4  9.Nxd4   9.Bxd4!?  is possible though  Re8  10.f3  d5!  which scores highly for Black.   The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.   Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the  7...c6  move order might be a good start. }

Black immediately threatens to take on c5 and forces White to do something about it. Normally, White should avoid taking on c6 as I've mentioned and he will either put the King in the corner, play Bb5 or retreat the Knight from d4 to b3. }

Bxc3, and planning ... Be5, ... Qf6 etc. with good play on the kingside.   Back to  20.Bd3  , which is White's best try for an advantage. White would really love to see  20...Nh5?  and in this case, it is too slow due to  21.Rae1  ,  and White exploits the fact that the Bishop doesn't block the e-file as in the 20. Be2 variation. }
20... Nd7
{ But this move guarantees Black a good game. We plan ... Ne5 next, hitting the Bishop. If the Bishop abandons the f1 - a6 diagonal, we might jump to c4. If the White Bishop abandons the b1 - h7 diagonal, we will continue with ... Bf5.  Now a little note about these repertoire clashes with the other author's. I think we shouldn't go berserk and force us to analyze everything to the point where it is either a draw or an advantage for the other side. The point of Sam's line against the KID was to offer you a decent practical line, and Shankland did an excellent job. My job is slightly easier because I just look for equality since we play with the Black pieces and I can also base my analysis on the already existing course. So knowing that Sam did an excellent job, let's maybe assume that the author of this course also did his best to give you a good line that imbalances the game against the Gligoric! }

Nc3 may be reached via different move orders, such as 3. Nc3 and only Nf3 later, or even 1. Nf3, 1. g3 etc. All in all, we will probably land in this position sooner or later. White developed his forces harmoniously, strengthened his King's position and will try to squeeze every active try from us. This is a completely different approach to the one seen in the previous chapters. White doesn't want to occupy the centre as fast as possible, but he focuses on stopping our active operations. This variation is also a recommendation of GM Boris Avrukh, so it definitely has to be taken seriously. }
7... e5
{ White's score - 56.7%. This is my recommended line for Black. Actually, I had the biggest difficulties in deciding on one line against the Fianchetto system, because I saw drawbacks everywhere. For example, the line that I normally play which is 6... Nbd7 7... e5 8... exd4 doesn't guarantee Black equal chances and it requires a lot of experience to handle these positions well. The 7... e5 line was quite popular in the 60s and 70s, and it has been gradually repelled by other systems. Only a few years ago we experienced the 2nd boost of popularity of this variation. A reason for that is that after 8. d5 Black can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8... Nb8 is the best move for Black and you can see the details by going through this chapter. }

{ White's score - 54.6%. In this chapter, we will take a look at one of the most popular lines for White, which is the Fianchetto system. Firstly, I want to mention that we will take a look at the mainline first, and only then we will check out some of White's alternatives in the next chapter. The position after 7. Nc3 may be reached via different move orders, such as 3. Nc3 and only Nf3 later, or even 1. Nf3, 1. g3 etc. All in all, we will probably land in this position sooner or later. White developed his forces harmoniously, strengthened his King's position and will try to squeeze every active try from us. This is a completely different approach to the one seen in the previous chapters. White doesn't want to occupy the centre as fast as possible, but he focuses on stopping our active operations.

{ White's score - 56.7%. This is my recommended line for Black. Actually, I had the biggest difficulties in deciding on one line against the Fianchetto system, because I saw drawbacks everywhere.

The 7... e5 line was quite popular in the 60s and 70s, and it has been gradually repelled by other systems. Only a few years ago we experienced the 2nd boost of popularity of this variation. A reason for that is that after 8. d5 Black can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8...

A reason for that is that after 8. d5 Black can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8... Nb8 is the best move for Black and you can see the details by going through this chapter. }
8. d5
{ White's score - 58.4%. The most popular and the most natural move for White. White gains space and wins a tempo on the attacked Knight. The disadvantage is that now, the g2-Bishop's scope has been blocked by the d-pawn and White reduced tension in the centre. }
8... Nb8
{ White's score - 54.4%.   This is a more modern treatment of the position which resurrected the whole line. It was considered for a long time that after  8...Ne7  Black has some issues, especially connected to the fact that  (the Knight on e7 stands badly.)

9. e4
{ This position can also be reached via the  9.Ne1  a5  10.Nd3  Na6  11.e4  Nd7  move order.  White just grabs space in the centre and will most probably regroup with Ne1 - d3. }

10... Na6
{ White's score - 48.8%. This is the best square for the Knight. Note that in virtually every line we play the same moves, which is great because we always know what to do in practice. }

{ Usually, two minor pieces are better than the Rook and the pawn in the middlegame. However, in endgames, it is slightly different. A more important factor is the activity of the pieces and weaknesses. If the minor pieces have weaknesses to attack, they will be good. In this position, Black doesn't have any real weaknesses and White's pieces are not too active. We can easily play this position for a win by pushing central pawns and activating the Rooks. Note that it will be hard for White to find decent jobs for all of his minor pieces. }

{ Played in around 90% of games that reached this point.   11.Qc2  b5  will transpose to one of the upcoming lines.   11.a4  gives Black a typical counterplay after  11...e5  with ... Bg6 to come. }
11... b5 12. Qc2
{ The most popular move. White connects the Rooks and will continue with either Rab1 or Rae1 followed by e4. }
12... e5
{ This should be already known. Firstly, we will take a look at all lines where White ignores the pawn and then we switch to 13. dxe6. }
13. dxe6 { Back to the en passant lines ! } 13... Bxe6 14. cxb5
{ White has to release the tension, because there was no good way of defending c4. }
14... axb5
{ I would say that this is the tabiya of the whole line. The pawn structure is non-standard and it would be nice to define some plans. White's plans are pretty simple - put the Rook on d1 and then go for Nde4 or Nce4 pressurizing our centre. Our main plan is to play ... d5 and White has to do everything to prevent it ! The other ideas are ... b4 and ... Bf5. }
15. Nce4 { Played in more games than all of the other moves combined. } 15...
Bf5
{ My favourite move. Black will play ... Re8 and maybe even ... c4 creating some plan on the light squares. }
16. Nxf6+ { The most obvious move. } 16... Bxf6 17. Ne4
{ 17.Bxf6  Qxf6  transposes to 16. Bxf6. } 17... Bxb2 18. Qxb2 Bxe4 19. Bxe4
Qe7 20. Bg2 Rb6
{ Black is ready to play ... Nc6 followed by ... b4 ... Rd8 with great play. }

{ In this and the next chapter, we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be3 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }

6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }

Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Ng3
{ White's score - 41.7%. This is the 2nd most popular move in this position and it is usually a choice of players who are not prepared for 8... Na5. Good for us, because Black is in excellent shape after the next move. }
9... b5

10... axb5 11. Bxb5

{ Surprise surprise ! Now we see that the Knight on a5 not only pressurizes c4, but it also threatens this trick ! Let me tell you that there are 8 x 2000+ 6 x 2300+ and 2 x 2500 players including 3 grandmasters that fell into this ! I can add that in my online games I caught countless players with this trap. Also, this pattern with ... Nb3 is not so common in tactic puzzles so sooner or later, someone will fall for this when you play this line ! }

{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }

6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6...

For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }

White doesn't have a way to defend against multiple threats. One line is  20.Nc6  but Black has an extremely strong  20...Nd7  as a response with a serious advantage. }

16. h5 e5 17. dxe5 Bxe5
{ Taking with a pawn would be an awful move after which White would be much better/winning. We can't close the Bishop and hope to survive. The g7-Bishop is one of the most important attacking pieces in these lines and one should go to jail for burying it with ...dxe5. }
18. hxg6 fxg6

19. c5
{ 19.Nd5  Nxd5  20.cxd5  Bd7=+  Black strengthened the centre and will attack on the queenside next.  ...Rb8  is our most probable next move. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. O-O-O { This is the only way of sharpening the position. } 10... Nd7
{ It is a typical way of handling the position. Black prepares both ...e5 and ...c6 before taking on c4.   Note that  10... c6!?11.h4  h5  is also OK  and it will transposes directly to 10. h4 h5 11. O-O-O c6 lines of this chapter. }
11. h4
{ Virtually the only move for White. Remember what I said about the crucial importance of one tempo ?! White has to start the attack as fast as possible. }
11... Nb6
{ This is the best line for Black. White has to play a series of the only moves to stay in the game. }
12. b3 { White has to sacrifice a pawn and stop ... Nxc4. } 12... bxc4 13. Na4
{ Once again the only move. I think it is pretty unlikely that an unprepared opponent would find it over the board. }
13... Nxa4 14. Qxa5
{ This was the point of White's play.  14.bxa4??  would be a horrible move due to  14...c3  15.Qxc3  c5∓  and Black delivers the attack first. }
14... Nb6
{ This is a critical position for the 10. O-O-O line. White has three different choices. }
15. h5
{ White will have to suffer for a while before reaching a draw in the end in this line. }
15... cxb3 16. axb3 Rb8
{ The whole line connected with 16... e5 led to a draw by repetition with best play fro both sides. But the text move is a more ambitious way of challenging White. If our opponent wanted to risk his life playing this aggressive line, we can as well risk a little more to fight for a big fish. We just make a useful move and will continue with either ... e6 ... e5 or even ... Bd7. }
17. hxg6 fxg6
{ This has to be remembered.   17...hxg6??  18.Nh5!  is extremely unpleasant.  After the text move, we will usually continue with ... Qe8 and/or ... e5. We are still a pawn up and I don't see any obvious compensation for White. }

My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }

{ Now we switch to some forced moves for Black. A pawn push h4 - h5 has to be stopped here ! It allows White to strike at the h5-pawn, but we will hold the balance with accurate play. }
11. O-O-O
{ Castling long is also a critical option. I would even consider it as a more critical one than 11. g4 which will be subject of our analysis soon after this line. White's idea is to play g4 next and it is necessary for us to understand what is going on. It is obvious that we will sacrifice a piece on g4 because otherwise we would be mated. That means that we know our next move. So our job, for now, is to find a useful move that will help us create counter-chances. }
11... Rb8
{ It is not obvious at first sight but this is the only move for Black to keep decent chances. It was possible to find this by a process of elimination. Let's see:   11...c6?!  doesn't work well due to  12.g4  Bxg4  13.fxg4  Nxg4  14.Ng2!  with a big advantage for White.   11...Nxc4?!  is also dubious due to  12.Bxc4  bxc4  13.g4  Bxg4   13...Nxg4  also doesn't work after  14.fxg4  Bxg4  15.Rdg1!  followed by Rxg4 and h5 is crushing  14.fxg4  Nxg4  15.Rdg1!  followed by Rxg1 and h5 as in the line above. }

{ Any other move would allow ... dxe5 while taking on b5 is too risky. It would allow us to speed up our attack on the queenside due to the newly opened b-file and a tempo won on ... c6. }
14... Qe8 { Securing the light squares. We will look at one forced sequence. }
15. Bd3 Bxe6

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5
{ Now we switch to some only moves for Black. A pawn push h4 - h5 has to be stopped here ! It allows White to strike at the h5-pawn, but we will hold the balance with accurate play. }
11. O-O-O
{ Castling long is also a critical option. I would even consider it as a more critical one than 11. g4 which will be subject of our analysis soon after this line. White's idea is to play g4 next and it is necessary for us to understand what is going on. It is obvious that we will sacrifice a piece on g4 because otherwise we would be mated. That means that we know our next move. So our job, for now, is to find a useful move that will help us create counter-chances. }
11... Rb8
{ It is not obvious at first sight but this is the only move for Black to keep decent chances. It was possible to find this by a process of elimination. Let's see:   11...c6?!  doesn't work well due to  12.g4  Bxg4  13.fxg4  Nxg4  14.Ng2!  with a big advantage for White.   11...Nxc4?!  is also dubious due to  12.Bxc4  bxc4  13.g4  Bxg4   13...Nxg4  also doesn't work after  14.fxg4  Bxg4  15.Rdg1!  followed by Rxg4 and h5 is crushing  14.fxg4  Nxg4  15.Rdg1!  followed by Rxg1 and h5 as in the line above  (.) }
12. e5 { It is not dangerous without the inclusion of cxb5. } 12... dxe5 13.
dxe5 Qxd2+ 14. Bxd2 Nd7
{ Black shouldn't have too many problems, for example: } 15. e6 Ne5

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5
{ Now we switch to some only moves for Black. A pawn push h4 - h5 has to be stopped here ! It allows White to strike at the h5-pawn, but we will hold the balance with accurate play. }
11. O-O-O
{ Castling long is also a critical option. I would even consider it as a more critical one than 11. g4 which will be subject of our analysis soon after this line. White's idea is to play g4 next and it is necessary for us to understand what is going on. It is obvious that we will sacrifice a piece on g4 because otherwise we would be mated. That means that we know our next move. So our job, for now, is to find a useful move that will help us create counter-chances. }
11... Rb8
{ It is not obvious at the first sight but this is the only move for Black to keep decent chances. It was possible to find this by a process of elimination. Let's see:   1.11...  c6?!  doesn't work well due to  12.g4  Bxg4  13.fxg4  Nxg4  14.Ng2!  with a big advantage for White.   11...Nxc4?!  is also dubious due to  12.Bxc4  bxc4  13.g4  Bxg4   13...Nxg4  also doesn't work after  14.fxg4  Bxg4  15.Rdg1!  (followed by Rxg4 and h5 is crushing)  14.fxg4  Nxg4  15.Rdg1!  (followed by Rxg1 and h5 as in the line above)  (.) }
12. g4
{ This is the only consistent move. Both 12. cxb5 and 12. e5 were analysed, so now it is time to stick to the critical attacking plan for White. }
12... Bxg4
{ It is a necessity to sacrifice the Bishop. You will see more of this theme while further learning this chapter. }
13. fxg4 Nxg4 14. Rg1
{ It is the most dangerous move threatening to take on g4 followed by h5. }
14... Nxc4
{ We have to enter razor-sharp complications, but they don't favour White too much. }
15. Bxc4 bxc4
{ Black's plan is to play ...c6 followed by ... Qa5 with a serious queenside initiative. White has to react quickly. }
16. Rxg4 { This is critical. } 16... hxg4 17. h5
{ The attack can be parried by the accurate sequence. } 17... e5
{ One of the basic strategic rules states that whenever the opponent attacks us on the wing we have to counter-attack in the centre or on the opposite wing. }
18. dxe5 { This is necessary. Any of the Knight's moves would allow ... gxh5. }
18... Bxe5
{ Once again we see this theme of keeping the Bishop active.  18...dxe5??  would lead to a disaster after  19.Qh2  . }
19. Rg1 Qh4
{ White has two main options now. I decided not to make them trainable because the probability of getting this position over the board is close to 0. A hint - under any circumstances don't try to memorize the lines that happen now. It is only a waste of your memory for a position that will never appear on the board.   20.Qd1  Bxf4  21.Bxf4  Qf2  preparing ... gxh5  22.Bd2  gxh5  23.Rh1  Qf3  The Queen's exchange would ease Black's task significantly.  24.Qe1  Rbe8  Stopping Nd5 ideas by pressurizing e4  25.Rxh5  f6  stopping Rg5  26.Rh2  Rf7  preparing to run with the King in case of Qh4  27.Qh4  Kf8  28.Nd5  Qf1+  29.Kc2  Qd3+  30.Kc1  Qf1+  31.Be1  Rh7  32.Qxh7  Qxe1+  33.Kc2  Qxe4+  34.Qxe4  Rxe4  This endgame should be harmless for Black.  35.Rf2   35.Nxf6  g3!  36.Rh8+  Kf7  27.Nxe4  g2  38.Ng5+  Kg7  39.Nf3  Kxh8  35...g3  36.Rxf6+  Kg7  37.Rf3  Re2+  38.Kc3  g2  39.Rg3+  Kf7  40.Kxc4  c6  41.Nc3  Rxb2=  .   The other line goes  20.hxg6  g3  21.gxf7+  Rxf7  22.Ng6  Bxc3  23.Nxh4   23.Qxc3  Qh2=  preparing to trap the Knight with ... Kh7  23...Bxd2+  24.Bxd2  Rf2  25.Rxg3+  Kf7+=  White is slightly better but Black should easily hold this endgame by bringing the other Rook to play by either the g or h file. }

Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5

14... Nc4
{ 14...e5!?  is also interesting but I think that the text move is simpler and good enough for a good game for Black. }
15. Bxc4 bxc4
{ We want to play ... e6 or ... c6 to strengthen control over the centre. Note that White doesn't have any sensible plan and his King will be weak forever. }
16. d5 c5 17. dxc6 e6

{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }

Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7.

But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5

{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play.

White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5
{ Now we switch to some only moves for Black. A pawn push h4 - h5 has to be stopped here ! It allows White to strike at the h5-pawn, but we will hold the balance with accurate play. }
11. g4
{ The most dangerous move played in 5 out of 7 games that reached this position. }
11... Bxg4
{ Once again we see this theme of sacrificing a piece for two pawns. } 12. fxg4
Nxg4 13. O-O-O { Played in the only game that reached this position. } 13... b4
{ This move secures us an ongoing queenside initiative. } 14. Ncd5
{ The only real try for anything. } 14... c6
{ Sacrificing one more pawn to open lines. } 15. Nxh5
{ This is the sharpest move and the one that requires precision from both sides. }
15... cxd5 16. Nxg7 Kxg7 17. c5
{ White has to close the centre.  17.h5  Rh8  would lead to a position with mutual chances. }
17... Qd7 { Black will play ...Qa4 next. } 18. exd5 Qa4 19. b3 Nxb3+
{ A similar theme. } 20. axb3 Qa1+ 21. Kc2 Qa2+ 22. Kd3 Qxb3+ 23. Ke2 Qxd5 24.
Rg1 Nxe3 25. Qxe3 dxc5
{ With a wild position where both sides have their chances. I think we can start breathing normally again because this was the last line with 9. Nf4. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nc1
{ White's score - 47.1%. This is a more popular move than all of the other 3 tries combined. White plays in style of the usual Samisch with 8... Rb8. Our opponent will either kick our Knight with b4 next or play a more reliable Nb3. }
9... Nd7
{ White's score - 46.7%.   This is the only line where we don't play for a quick  ...b5  . Note that  9...b5  just gives up the pawn since  10.cxb5  axb5  11.Bxb5  Nb3??  (doesn't work because the b3-square is protected by the Knight on c1.)  By playing 9... Nd7 Black prepares ...c5. }
10. Be2
{ White's score - 46.3%. Black has a good game after this developing move. }
10... c5
{ A standard idea in the 9. Nc1 lines. We will see more of it in the future. Our typical plan is to take on d4 followed by ...Ne5. }
11. d5
{ White tries to get a Benoni-type position but Black is perfectly coordinated for a thematic break. }
11... b5 12. cxb5 Nb6
{ This is already excellent for Black. We use the Knight on a5 by winning a tempo by threatening ... Nc4. }
13. b3 e6
{ It is necessary to strike as fast as possible. If White is allowed to coordinate he will be OK. }
14. Rb1

Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6

8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nc1
{ White's score - 47.1%. This is a more popular move than all of the other 3 tries combined. White plays in style of the usual Samisch with 8... Rb8. Our opponent will either kick our Knight with b4 next or play a more reliable Nb3. }
9... Nd7
{ White's score - 46.7%.   This is the only line where we don't play for a quick  ...b5  . Note that  9...b5  just gives up the pawn since  10.cxb5  axb5  11.Bxb5  Nb3??  (doesn't work because the b3-square is protected by the Knight on c1.)  By playing 9... Nd7 Black prepares ...c5. }
10. b4
{ White's score - 41.1%. This is a common guest in tournament practice. If you go for the 8... Na5 line you will meet 10. b4 sooner or later. White wins even more space but he is seriously behind in development. We will try to use this and strike at White's centre. }
10... Nc6 11. Rb1 e5

Nb3 f5

14. Nxd4
{ This is the only sensible way forward.   14.Bd3  Qh4+  15.Bf2  Qh5!  is very good for Black.  White can't really castle due to ... f4. }
14... exd4 15. Bxd4
{ So Black sacrificed a pawn and now let's try to understand where lies our compensation. We are still ahead in development. White is two tempi from castling which gives us some attacking chances. Also, both the long diagonal and the e and f files are opened for our pieces. }
15... Qh4+ { Harassment continues! White has two sensible option now. } 16. Bf2
{ This is what I would expect to see in practice. } 16... Qf6
{ White has only one move now. } 17. Rc1
{ Anything else allows a combination of ... a5 and ... fxe4 with a crushing initiative. }
17... a5 18. b5
{ Keeping the a-file closed, but handing over the c5-square to Black. } 18...
Nc5
{ The problem for White is that the Knight can't be tolerated and has to be eliminated. }
19. Bxc5 dxc5
{ Black has eternal control over the dark squares. If you are in doubt bout this position, just flip the board. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bg5
{ White's score - 58.4%. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at a system named after the legendary grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable. With this method you will be guaranteed to focus on what is most important without wasting your precious time on lines that aren't primary. }
6... Na6
{ White's score - 52.6%. I like this move a lot, because both 6... c5 and 6... h6 lead to positions typical for a Benoni.  Before I will explain what is the purpose of   6...Na6   I will briefly mention that  6...e5?  is a mistake that occurred too many times. White would get an almost winning position after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  and now both  9.Nd5   or  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  10.Nd5  By playing 6... Na6 we prepare ideas connected with ...e5 since the plan seen in the 6... e5? line above isn't that effective due to Black's extra option of ...Rd6 in the end. It is possible because the c5-square is secured by the a6-Knight ! }
7. Nf3
{ White's score - 52.8%. This is the 2nd most popular move. Note that this position often occurs via the 6. Be2 Na6 7. Bg5 move order. White doesn't do anything extraordinary and just develops a piece. }
7... h6
{ It is useful to know the destiny of the dark-squared Bishop. Generally, White now chooses between h4 e3 and f4. }

{ 11...Kh7  has been almost universally played, and it is a normal move that gives Black good chances for a balanced game. It was also my original recommendation.  However, the text move forces White to part with the dark-squared Bishop leaving Black with great compensation. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bg5
{ White's score - 58.4%. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at a system named after the legendary grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable. With this method you will be guaranteed to focus on what is most important without wasting your precious time on lines that aren't primary. }
6... Na6
{ White's score - 52.6%. I like this move a lot, because both 6... c5 and 6... h6 lead to positions typical for a Benoni.  Before I will explain what is the purpose of   6...Na6   I will briefly mention that  6...e5?  is a mistake that occurred too many times. White would get an almost winning position after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  and now both  9.Nd5   or  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  10.Nd5  By playing 6... Na6 we prepare ideas connected with ...e5 since the plan seen in the 6... e5? line above isn't that effective due to Black's extra option of ...Rd6 in the end. It is possible because the c5-square is secured by the a6-Knight ! }
7. Nf3
{ White's score - 52.8%. This is the 2nd most popular move. Note that this position often occurs via the 6. Be2 Na6 7. Bg5 move order. White doesn't do anything extraordinary and just develops a piece. }
7... h6
{ It is useful to know the destiny of the dark-squared Bishop. Generally, White now chooses between h4 e3 and f4. }
8. Be3 Ng4
{ I like to play this before White decides to stop it with something like 9. h3. We will play ... e5 next. }
9. Bc1 e5 10. O-O
{ By far the most popular move.  10.d5  occurred only a few times. Black can play  10...f5  with good counterplay.   If  10.h3  then  10...exd4!  We will reach a position similar to the one seen in chapters devoted to the Classical System.  11.Nxd4  Nf6  followed by ... Nc5 and ... Re8. White will have to play f3 sooner or later and f3 combines quite badly with h3 because many dark squares are weakened. }
10... exd4
{ I am not a fan of positions after  10...c6  11.d5  .  By playing 10... exd4 we will get a well-known pawn structure and I think Black's chances won't be worse at all. }
11. Nxd4 Qf6
{ It is necessary to create some dynamic tension. Retreating with the Knight would be too cooperative. }
12. Nb3 Qh4
{ What ? Why ? Didn't we just put the Queen on f6 and now we move it to h4? It is true, we lost a tempo but we have a very good reason for that. White's Knight is usually misplaced on b3 and can very often be a target to ... a5 - a4. }
13. Bf4 Be5 14. Bxe5 dxe5 15. h3 Nf6
{ Black does very well strategically because we managed to exchange the dark-squared Bishops and some of the dark squares are weak for White - especially d4. }
16. Nd2 { The pawn on e4 has to be defended. } 16... Rd8
{ It is a tricky move because Black threatens ... Bxh3 gxh3 Qg5+ picking up the d2-Knight ! }
17. Nd5
{ The other move is  17.Qc1  c6   but not  17...Bxh3??  18.Nf3±  18.Nf3  Qf4  19.Qxf4  exf4  with equality.  In these types of endgames, the White light-squared Bishop is very often useless while Black's Knights can hop here and there to create threats. }
17... Nxd5 { No matter what White recaptures with ... c6 comes next. } 18. cxd5
c6
{ It is important to play it right away since otherwise, White would be able to play Rc1 and our pawn break would be hard to carry through. }
19. Re1 { Played in two games that reached this position. } 19... cxd5 20. Nf3
{ 20.Bxa6  bxa6  21.Nf3  Qf6  22.exd5  Rb8  23.b3  Rb5  24.Rxe5  Be6=  Black has doubled pawns on the queenside but it is compensated by having a Bishop in an open position. }
20... Qf6 21. exd5 e4 22. Nd2 Bf5

{ 23.Bxa6  is harmless due to  23...bxa6  24.Nxe4  Bxe4  25.Rxe4  Qxb2=  A text move looks strong because it seems to force Black to give up the e4-pawn but we have some resources. }

A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games.

{ White's score - 58.4%. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at a system named after the legendary grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable.

6... Na6
{ White's score - 52.6%. I like this move a lot, because both 6... c5 and 6... h6 lead to positions typical for a Benoni.  Before I will explain what is the purpose of   6...Na6   I will briefly mention that  6...e5?  is a mistake that occurred too many times. White would get an almost winning position after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  and now both  9.Nd5   or  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  10.Nd5  By playing 6... Na6 we prepare ideas connected with ...e5 since the plan seen in the 6... e5? line above isn't that effective due to Black's extra option of ...Rd6 in the end.

Bf3
{ Defending the pawn with the Bishop is the most popular continuation. Another positive aspect is that the Bishop frees the e2-square for the Knight.   10.Qc2  Moving the Queen for the 2nd time is not something that should lead to any kind of trouble for Black.  10...a5  with good counterplay. }
10... a5

Nxh5 { The only move for the advantage. } 12. Bxh5 gxh5

13. Be3 b6
{ This is not a big change, but quite a significant one.   My suggested line  13...f5?!  also offers Black an advantage, but gives White the option of playing  14.Bxc5  and muddying the waters.  The text move prepares to have ... bxc5 as a reply and only then we will play ... f5. As I've said, not a big change, but it changes the character of a game a little. }

{ White has a very nice positional idea in mind. Our opponent will try to show us that our pawn moves on the queenside created a lot of holes. White will play Na2 - b4 next and the Knight on b4 is very strong. We can't stop that plan so it is better to create a strong plan on our own. }

Na5
{ The Knight is very well placed here. It might have looked pretty on c5, but it wasn't doing anything valuable there. From a5 it stops b3 and can jump to c4 in many variations. }
18. Qe2 Nh5
{ ... Nc4 won't run away from us - and in fact, might not be that strong due to Bd3. }
19. Bd3 Rb8
{ Strengthening b5 and preparing either ... Nf4 or ... f5 with good kingside counterplay. On the other hand, White doesn't have any active possibilities so he has to wait for us to do anything. I think this is already a depressing position for White - he didn't do anything wrong and now is left without any active plan. }

{ If White manages to activate the dark-squared Bishop he will have great chances. The problem for our opponent is that there is no simple way of doing this. Without the c3-pawn White would have excellent chances because the Bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal would be a monster. That means that we rarely want to take the c3-pawn when having a chance. Our next move is ... b6 solidifying the pawn structure. }

{ White's score - 55.8%. So, here we are, in the Four Pawns Attack world ! If I would need to name a variation that is the most aggressive and in which White goes for the bare-knuckle boxing approach - here you go. White's central advantage is overwhelming for the moment and we have to do something about it. }

11. Qc2
{ White decides to keep the Knight on f3 and defend the pawn with the Queen. Initially, I thought that this position will be relatively easy to play for Black but I managed to found two pitfalls.   11...Qe7?!  is the 2nd most popular move that scores very well for Black but I doubt that Black can equalize after  12.Re1  Nxe4  13.Bd3  f5  14.Nxe4  fxe4  15.Rxe4  Qf8  16.Rxe8  Qxe8  17.Bd2  Nb6  Re1+=  I dislike this.   11...c4?!  12.Bxc4  Nc5  13.e5!

13. a4 Rb8

14. Kh1

{ This is the type of novelty that spoils one's preparations  ! In all games that reached this position only  15...dxe5?!  16.Nxc4  have been played with more than good results for White. Black's compensation for the sacrificed piece will be tremendous. }
16. exf6 Nxf6 17. axb5 axb5
{ We will play ... Bf5 and ... b4 with total domination. Black will for sure win the d5-pawn and White's pieces are horribly uncoordinated. My engine gives a modest advantage for Black.   If White plays  18.Nde4  we have to reply with  18...Bf5!  to keep the advantage but this is the only thing that you need to know. }

{ White's score - 55.8%. So, here we are, in the Four Pawns Attack world ! If I would need to name a variation that is the most aggressive and in which White goes for the bare-knuckle boxing approach - here you go. White's central advantage is overwhelming for the moment and we have to do something about it. }
5... O-O
{ Some sources give 5... c5!? as a better move because it is supposed to avoid the 7. dxc5 line. I think there is no point in avoiding it since I believe I have managed to find an excellent continuation for Black in the sequence mentioned above. }

Nbd7 is also a good option for Black. I played the Four Pawns Attack for a long time and I can honestly tell you that I've never had any line prepared against 9...

That means that the Classical is the line that you will meet the most, then Samisch etc. In this chapter, we will take a look ta White's system of development with h3 instead of Be2. }
5... O-O 6. h3
{ White's score - 57.5%. This variation has many different names. I've met the Bagirov line or the Makogonov line or even just the h3 King's Indian while polish GM Michal Krasenkow is considered to be one of the world's leading experts. White's basic idea is to meet ...e5 with d5 and be ready to play g4 next stopping Black's ...f5. This is a very positional idea that puts more effort into stopping Black's plans than implementing White's own ideas. I recommend paying serious attention to this chapter. You won't see this line too often, but you need to be aware that White manages to win games without Black firing a single shot. }

We should play  8...Na6  9.Be3  Nd7  but I don't like  10.a3!  and  10...Ndc5?  would be wrong due to  11.b4!  and White is significantly better.

I've met the Bagirov line or the Makogonov line or even just the h3 King's Indian while polish GM Michal Krasenkow is considered to be one of the world's leading experts. White's basic idea is to meet ...e5 with d5 and be ready to play g4 next stopping Black's ...f5. This is a very positional idea that puts more effort into stopping Black's plans than implementing White's own ideas. I recommend paying serious attention to this chapter. You won't see this line too often, but you need to be aware that White manages to win games without Black firing a single shot. }

7... Nh5
{ White's score - 54.8%.   It is necessary to play this move right away. If we start with  7...a5  which is similar to the Petrosian system, then White can play  8.g4  and we can't proceed with our usual kingside counterplay. We should play  8...Na6  9.Be3  Nd7  but I don't like  10.a3!  and  10...Ndc5?  would be wrong due to  11.b4!  and White is significantly better.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. h3
{ In this chapter we will take a look at White's two possibilities after this move. One of them is to develop the Bishop to e3 and the other one is to develop the Bishop to g5. Both of these systems have some venom and if you don't do your homework on how to play against them you might get tricked quickly. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 59%. A less aggressive system than 6. Bg5 but it is also quite poisonous. Let me just mention that it was played several times by Anatoly Karpov ! }
6... e5
{ White's score - 61.1%. I prefer to play in a pure King's Indian style whenever possible. We will go for ...c5 after 6. Bg5 but it is mainly due to the fact that we just can't play ...e5 without preparations there. }
7. d5
{ White's score - 61.5%.   7.Nf3?!  exd4!  leads to a bad version of that pawn structure for White. You for sure know the plans from the first chapters of the course.   7.dxe5  is also completely harmless since the White Bishop  is already on e3 so moving it further to g5 would cost a valuable tempo. }
7... Na6
{ White's score - 55.8%. It is my preference for Black over 8... a5 that is too slow in my opinion. }
8. Bd3
{ White's score - 56.3%.   8.Nf3  Nh5  transposes to the previous chapter.  By playing 8. Bd3 White doesn't do anything extraordinary and just prioritizes development. }
8... Nd7

9. a3
{ Our opponent tries to bury our Knight live with b4. We can't allow that ! }
9... Nac5

11. b4 Nxe4 12. Bxe4
{ Taking with the Bishop is a typical idea planning to maintain a strong Knight on e4. }
12... fxe4 13. Nxe4 Nf6

14. Nxf6+ Qxf6 15. Ne2 a5

16. O-O { What else?! } 16... Qh4

17. Ng3 Bxh3 { White just can't capture the Bishop! } 18. gxh3 Qxh3

{ White's score - 63.9%. Unlike in the 6. Be3 line we will go for the Benoni approach. The reason for that is quite simple.   6...e5??  loses to  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Nd5± }
7. d5 e6 { White's score - 60.7%. } 8. Bd3
{ Virtually the only approach for White. } 8... exd5 9. exd5
{ White's score - 55.1%. This is a more typical capture favoured by specialists of this line, including GM Mihai Suba. }
9... Nbd7
{ White's score - 49.7%. Preparing to put the Knight on e5 is the soundest plan for Black.   After  10...Re8+  White is in time to reach his desired setup with  11.Nge2  . }
10. Nf3
{ Now,  10.Nge2?!  is dubious due to  10...Ne5  and Black will grab White's light-squared Bishop. }
10... Re8+
{ With the White Knight on f3 it is much more appealing for me to play this. }
11. Kf1
{ The most popular move. White loses castling rights but he has a space advantage and a solid centre. We need to react actively because otherwise, we would risk finding ourselves in a position without counterplay. }
11... Ne5
{ I think that we should focus on activating our pieces before White consolidates. }
12. Nxe5 Rxe5
{ White has two options here - either he will play Qd2 trying to consolidate or will look for adventures with Bf4. }
13. Qd2 b5 14. Nxb5 { 14.cxb5  a6  also with full compensation or Black. }
14... Ne4 15. Bxe4 Rxg5

5... h6
{ White's score - 53.1%. Immediately challenging the Bishop is the most critical. White has to make a decision about the Bishop's future.   I think that  5...O-O  is slightly inaccurate since White can play either  6.Qd2   or  6.f4  (in both cases with lines that we should avoid.) }

After that, there came a phase of 'nothing works' and I desperately tried to find a good line for Black. In one line we sacrificed a pawn but with insufficient compensation. In the other, White was strategically better. In the third one, Black was objectively fine but White had a strong attack. So I started to go into the panic mode thinking that I can't make this line work. So I spend a few hours on the line that you will probably never encounter but if one wants the course to be done well, then sometimes some digging in Stockfish has to be done. Let's proceed !

6... a6
{ White's score - 47.2%. There are plenty of different setups that are decent for Black but I think we can go for this slightly unusual approach. We will play ... c6 and ... b5 next preparing a typical counterplay in style of the King's Indian Attack. }
7. O-O c6
{ White's score - 48.4%.   The line that I really wanted to make work is  7...c5  8.d5  b5!  which perfectly fine for Black.   The problem is that White can play  7...c5  8.dxc5!  dxc5  9.e5  and White is slightly better. }
8. a4
{ The most popular way of dealing with Black's setup. ... b5 is not an option anymore but we can do something else.   8.f3  b5  9.Be3  Nbd7  is exactly what Black wants.  We will play ... e5 and ...

5... O-O 6. Ng3
{ As I've mentioned  6.f3  leads to the Samisch after  6...Nc6   or even  6...a6  (White will decide on the next move where to put the dark-squared Bishop transposing either to the 11th or 12th chapter.) }
6... h5
{ White's score - 51.7%.   Even in this rare lines I like to fight for the initiative from the start  ! Another interesting line was to play the Benko style with  6...a6!?  7.Be2  c5  8.d5  b5  with a good version of the Benko. Normally, White never puts the Knight on g3 in this pawn structure.  By playing ... h5 we want to push the h-pawn up the board. And I don't mean push it up to h4, no. We will push the pawn up to h3! }
7. Be2 a5
{ This is a small change compared to the original lines.   I recommended going  7...h4  which is a nice practical weapon, but after  8.Nf1  h3  White has  9.gxh3!  and I couldn't make everything work!  7... a5 is a nice preparatory move.

5. Be2 O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 56.1%. This line has become popular nowadays. White doesn't commit to Nf3 and keeps the option of launching both g and h pawns. Let me warn you - unlike 6. g4 or 6. h4 this is a serious and dangerous system ! }
6... Nc6

Note that White overextended his position in the centre and we will try to strike with ... e6 or ... c6 next. This is exactly what compensates for our loss of time. }

13. cxb5 { 13.g5?  b4!  Black is on a verge of victory. } 13... Bb7
{ We see the other point of ... b5 - Black freed the b7-square for the Bishop. Amazing chess ! }
14. Qc2
{ 14.Qb3  Nf7  is weaker.  White's centre is under pressure and we can consider two plans: ... d5 or ... Nd7 - c5. }
14... d5 15. O-O-O
{ Castling queenside might be White's best option. Our opponent might delay g5 for as long as possible, and we have to react accurately. }
15... dxe4
{ We should open up the centre to gain counterplay. Also, g5 is not too appealing now because we would have ... Nf5 as a response. }
16. Bc4 { 16.g5?  Nf5!  17.gxf6  Qxf6  is bad for White. } 16... Nd5 17. Nxe4
c6 { We need to open up the queenside. } 18. Nc5

18... cxb5 19. Nxb7 Qb6 20. Bxd5 Rac8 21. Bxe6+ { 21.Bc3?!  exd5  is weaker. }

3... Bg7 4. Nbd2 O-O

6... Nc6

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6
{ In the last two chapters we will take a look at White's different setups on move 2 or 3. Here, we start by taking a look at 2. Nf3 lines where White doesn't go for any of the previously analysed lines. We will see some fianchetto lines, Londons, Torres, Colles etc. None of these lines is threatening for Black but they require some basic knowledge about which setup to choose. }
3. Nc3
{ White's score - 51.3%. The so-called Barry Attack. White prepares to grab the centre with e4. }
3... d5
{ This is a must if you want to stay within the King's Indian territory. If you are fine with the Pirc then you may play  3...d6  but it allows  4.e4  . }
4. Bf4 Bg7
{ White has two options now, either to go for Qd2 followed by an attack on the kingside or e3 followed by Be2 and a more modest play. }
5. Qd2 O-O
{ White's score - 46.9%.   Black can also play  5...Ne4  but I don't like to spoil my pawns which can be targetted later. A specific variation that I would like to avoid is  6.Nxe4  dxe4  7.Ne5  Nd7  8.Nxd7  Qxd7  9.e3  O-O  10.Qb4!  played by a specialist of the Barry Attack - GM Mark Hebden. }
6. Bh6
{ White's plan is to go for h4 - h5 and try to checkmate our King. We have to act fast ! }
6... c6
{ Preparing to bring the Queen to the queenside while strengthening the centre. }
7. Bxg7 Kxg7 8. Ne5
{ Going for the attack is a typical plan for White in the Barry. I think that something more modest like  8.e3  would be a better try for White. Black can play  8...Nbd7  9.Bd3  Re8  preparing ... e5 with good chances. }
8... Nbd7 9. f4 Ne8
{ Preparing ... Nd6 followed by ... f6 kicking the Knight while sometimes a combination of ... Nd6 and ... Nf6 may be useful to plant the Knight on e4. That being said, Black has a bunch of other interesting moves, such as 9... b5, 9... Nxe5 or 9... Ne4. }

7. Bg5 { 7.Be5  f6  and we will manage to grab the precious Bishop. } 7... c6

{ This is important  ! We need to play this since  9...g5?!  runs into  10.Ne5!  +=   By playing  9...Nd7  we take control over the e5-square and prepare to play  ...g5  next. }
10. Nd2 g5
{ A non-standard but very interesting concept. We will damage the kingside pawn structure or even sacrifice a pawn to get an active counterplay. }
11. Bxg5 { 11.Bxh5  gxh4  Black will play ... e5 next with full compensation. }
11... hxg5 12. Bxh5 e5
{ We will play ... f5 next followed by a pawn avalanche on the kingside. At first glance it may look like White can easily parry our threats but even engines like this approach claiming full compensation for Black. We should also add that Black's play will be much easier. }

3. d5 b5
{ This is Black's idea. We don't waste any time and claim space on the queenside. Normally, in 2. c4 or 2. Nf3 lines it would require some preparation to force through this move. }
4. Bg2 d6
{ White's score - 40.1%. We will play ... g6 ... Bg7 ... O-O next with good queenside counterplay. If White ever goes for a4 we will sidestep the pawn with ... b4. It may weaken the c4-square but we can play ... Nbd7 - b6 to challenge the c4-Knight. Note that one should not be afraid of e2 - e4 - e5, as we can take with ... dxe5 and after d5 - d6 opening up the long diagonal, we can follow up with ... e4. }

We get a position from the Benko Gambit where White decided to put the Bishop on f4 - as I've mentioned - strange.  4...bxc4  is the simplest. After  5.Nc3  d6  6.e4  g6  7.Bxc4  Bg7  followed by ... O-O ... Nd7 and ... Rb8 Black has good counter chances. }

{ White is deprived of the c3-square for the Knight and our plan is to play ... e6 and ... Bb7. This is already quite unpleasant for White. }

{ We've seen the nightmare scenario for White, now it's time to see a nightmare scenario for Black. We are deprived of any counterplay and White's Knight is an excellent piece on e4. On the other hand, our Bishop is a spectator and Black has to defend passively for the rest of the game. }

{ One more pitfall to avoid is not to let White get this piece formation. White's minor pieces are perfect and our opponent will play a3 + b4 + c5 followed by Nc4 blasting the queenside open. We have to avoid it by starting with ... h6 instead of ... Na6 as you can check in the #6 Chapter - Petrosian System. }

20. f4 Bg7
{ So White managed to push both b and f pawns up the board and grab some space but there are some merits of this approach. The e4-pawn is a target for Black's pieces and the b3-pawn may be weak too. A great success of our strategy of keeping our head low but striking at the appropriate moment. }

{ White has to be careful about this position. The seemingly strong centre may become weak at any moment. }
25. b4
{ Usually when someone starts playing this line with Black, pawn pushes like b4 and f4 may scare that person. This game is a perfect example of two sides of these pawn pushes. Yes, they win space for White but didn't White have a space advantage all the time ?! I think that White's pawns on the 4th rank are targets for Black. }

{ Before we start analysing the game, let me tell you who Leonid Yurtaev was. Do you remember this Queen sacrifice on move 14 ? Leonid Yurtaev was the man who played it for the first time. He was one of the most creative King's Indian practitioners. A person who truly loved chess and he was exceptionally good at researching opening lines and ideas - before the computer age of course ! He was a coach of such players as Thatchiev and Inarkiev. Unfortunately, Leonid passed away a few years ago. In this game, he was unfortunately on the other side of the brilliancy - but that is a price one has to pay. As the saying goes: 'Live by the sword, die by the sword.' }

{ We've followed the main line of the Fianchetto System chapter. The position is one of the unbalanced ones. Black has a pair of Bishops and chances to attack the White King. On the other hand, White has a more compact pawn structure and the e4-square for the Knight. }
20. Ne4 Qg6
{ Black threatens ...Bg4 forcing White to weaken the position with f3. That would lead to a big positional advantage because the White Bishop would be blocked and the c1-h6 diagonal would be juicy for our Bishop. }

{ But this is suicidal on White's part. It was necessary to open up the h-file instead of the f-file.   23.hxg3  Bxf1  24.Rxf1  This was necessary. What is amazing is that the engine gives 0.00 in many lines showing the idea of Bh5 Qf5 Bg4 Qg6 with a repetition. The best chance for Black would be the following line.  h6  25.Bh5  Qh7  26.Kg2  a4  27.Rh1  White has full compensation with Bg4 - e6 coming next.

{ I would prefer to exchange Rooks to avoid any b4 nonsense. Remember the last game ? I told you that when you have a Rook and your opponent has two of them it is not recommended to exchange the lonely Rook.

{ When Geert told me that I should consider doing a Quickstarter Guide I asked him how it should look like. He told me that I should put there around 10% of my course, there should be the most critical lines and it should be doable to learn it within a few hours. I think a Quickstarter Guide is a great idea, but then I thought: What if someone has only 15 minutes? Or what if you have an important game incoming and you want to check the most critical positions without really learning them. Just like reading a book, look at the key 20 - 30 positions with a brief commentary and be ready to kill the opponent.  That's why this chapter was created. It is my original idea and it contains 29 best of the best lines from the whole course. The most critical lines, positions that have to be remembered. So here you go, it should be just a revision of the material that you've studied. Enjoy! }

{ In this chapter, I will share some of my favourite King's Indian games that I've played throughout my chess career. This game was held in the last round of the tournament Kowalewo Pomorskie 2008. I played quite badly throughout the whole tournament, but this last round win compensated me for all the inconvenience. }
1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nc6 7. d4 Bf5
{ The first serious line that I've learned against the Fianchetto System. Black usually combines ...Ne4 with ...e5. }
8. d5 Na5 9. Nd2 c6
{ I found this line in the book 'Secrets of Opening Preparation' by Mark Dvoretsky. There was a game Jussupow - Gulko analysed and they claimed that this way of attacking White's centre is the most effective. }
10. e4
{ Nowadays, when the engines are much stronger it is quite obvious that White can get the upper hand with the following sequence:  10.b4!  Nxc4  11.Nxc4  Nxd5  12.Nxd5  Bxa1  13.Bh6  Bg7  14.Bxg7  Kxg7  15.Nde3  and White has to be better. That's why we play 7... e5 instead! }
10... Bg4 { It is useful to provoke f3. } 11. f3 Bd7
{ Black should be happy with the provocation of e4 and f3. Not only the Bishop on g2 is blocked but also we have the g1-a7 diagonal available for our Queen. }
12. Qe2 { 12.b4?  Qb6+ } 12... cxd5
{ Opening up the centre because White lags in development. Black already took over the initiative. }
13. exd5
{ It was necessary to get rid of the c4-pawn. Now, it will be a target. } 13...
Rc8
{ There is no easy way for White to finish development. Black's plan is to play ...e6 opening up the centre even further. }

[Result "*"]

{ This game is from the tournament where I managed to beat my first 2200+ player in a classical game. I had this mental blockade that whenever I faced someone rated 2200+ I just couldn't win a game. I had many draws but a victory was missing. In the first round I managed to beat a 2350 player so I was playing the whole tournament with confidence and imagination. }

Rb8
{ 8...Na5  This is a recommended move that was analysed thoroughly in the 11th chapter. }
9. O-O-O b5 10. Bh6
{ I knew that my opponent would play this line so I decided to switch on my engine - in 2009 the best one was Rybka - and try to find something. This is a special game for me because it was my deepest opening preparation in that time, and what is more important - it worked ! }
10... bxc4 11. h4 Nh5
{ Back in 2009, the engine showed this as the best move. Now, 10 years later, after a few seconds, Stockfish gives 11... Nb4 as much stronger.   11...Nb4!  12.Ng3  Bxh6  13.Qxh6  c5∓  This was a way to go. Black's attack on the queenside is faster. One point is the following line:  14.d5  Nxa2+  15.Nxa2  Qa5  16.Bxc4  Qa4∓ }
12. Bxg7 Kxg7 13. g4
{ This is what I anticipated. It looks like White's initiative is crushing and I thought there was a big chance that my opponent would fall into my preparation. 13. Kb1 preparing g4 was much stronger. }
13... Nb4
{ This is the whole point. Black threatens ...Nd3+ followed by problems on b2. }
14. gxh5 Nd3+ 15. Kb1 Rxb2+ 16. Qxb2 Nxb2 17. Kxb2 c6
{ Materially speaking White isn't doing that bad but his King is weaker than mine and I still have three pieces and a strong centre as a good starting point for the attack.   17...e6  That being said, starting with ...e6 was better because it discourages Bh3 and prepares ...d5 followed by a well-timed ...c5. }
18. Bh3 e6
{ I decided that if I need to keep attacking I need to leave some pieces on the board. The problem is that the light-squared Bishop is behind a wall of pawns now. }
19. Bg2 d5 20. f4 Qa5 { Bringing the Queen towards the White King. } 21. Bf3
Rd8
{ A complete waste of time ...Bd7 followed by ...Rb8 was much stronger. I had some ideas connected with ...c5 in mind but I think they don't work well. }
22. hxg6 hxg6 23. h5 c5
{ At least I knew that it was necessary to open some lines to activate my pieces. }
24. h6+
{ This is a big mistake on my opponent's part. White's attack is stopped now since he closed the h-file. }
24... Kh8 25. exd5 exd5
{ After this one Black is already winning. The point is that the b1-h7 diagonal is available for my Bishop and also, Black rocks in the centre. }
26. Nxd5
{ 26.dxc5  Qb4+  27.Ka1  d4-+  Black doesn't threaten to take on c3 but he plans to play ...d3 followed by ...Be6 and White doesn't have any sensible plan. }
26... Bf5 27. Rh2 Rb8+ 28. Ka1 Qd2
{ One of these moves that I am proud of finding. Note that if the Rook on h2 would be defended, I would be completely lost due to Nec3 and the Queen would be trapped ! A big threat now is ...Qb2 and the Queen is taboo due to ...Rb1 mate. A funny thing - it was the third 2300+ player that I managed to beat in this tournament. So you can see that these psychical blockades are sometimes tough to get rid of, but when you finally manage to do that, you start playing with inspiration. }

35... Bxc3 36. Rxc3 Rg7
{ Suddenly, for the first time in the whole game, White is on defence ! What I find funny is that this is the 36th move and this is my first threat in the whole game - and Black is better ! }
37. Kh3
{ 37.Kg1!  It was necessary to find this tactical defence.  Nf6   37...Rxg4?  This would be unacceptable.  38.Nd4±  38.Nh2=+  Black is only slightly better. }
37... Nf6 { Reinforcing the threat and White is in serious trouble now. } 38.

{ White is lost now. My opponent miscalculated under pressure.   38.Nh2  was the only chance.  Rcf7∓  Black is much better but there is no clear way of getting the scalp of White's King. }

{ White's score - 51.3%. In this chapter we will take a look at the system for White named after the 9th world chess champion, Tigran Petrosian. He even stated once that he managed to buy a flat thanks to his opponents who dared to play the king's Indian Defence against him. It is true, he was very successful with his positional approach. White's main idea is to close the centre avoiding any ...exd4 lines. White will usually play Bg5 next and try to limit Black's activity to minimum. }
7... a5
{ White's score - 50.3%. Black immediately grabs some space on the queenside and will play ...Na6, ...Bd7 and ...Qe8 limiting White's activity on the queenside. Only then will Black proceed with the kingside counterplay. }
8. h3
{ White's score - 54.4%. This move which was proposed by GM Zviagintsev leads to positions similar to those that will be analysed thoroughly in the 15th chapter about the 5. h3 O-O 6. Nf3 lines. White prepares g4 in some cases while taking the g4-square under firm control. After White plays g4 and we eventually go for ...f5 White may take twice on f5 and enjoy the e4-square for his pieces. }
8... Na6
{ Definitely the most popular move. This is the standard square for the Black Knight in these systems. Another option for Black is  8.Nh5!?  . }
9. Bg5
{ White's score - 59.7%. The most popular line for White which is a kind of Petrosian-h3 hybrid. }
9... Qe8 { breaking the pin and preparing ...Nd7 followed by ...f5. } 10. Nd2
{ This continuation was kind of abandoned after the game Legky - Shirov, FRA-chT 1995. Still, from time to time White plays like this. }
10... Nd7
{ It was also possible to play 10... Kh8 but I am not a big fan of this plan without White playing g4. If g4 would be played, then White's dark squares would be weakened and it would make more sense to go for the dark-squared Bishop's exchange. 10... Nd7 prepares ...f5 and ...Ndc5 is usually a good idea for Black. }

{ Stopping b4 because now the Rook is defended by the Knight. } 13. b3 Bh6
{ The Bishop wasn't too active on g7, so we regroup it to the more active diagonal. }
14. Rb1 Nc5 15. b4
{ 15.O-O  is a more modern treatment, but Black can play a rare  15...c6  with the idea of taking on d5 and playing ... Bd7 and ...Rc8 next. }
15... axb4 16. axb4 Nca4
{ Black's pieces are quite active all over the board. } 17. Nb5 Qe7
{ Improving on Shirov's game. Black prepares ether ...c6 or ...c5. } 18. Nb3
{ This inaccurate move was played in both games that reached this position. }
18... c6 19. dxc6 bxc6 20. Qxd6 Qf7
{ Black is much better in all lines. One point is that whenever the Knight moves from b5 we can play ...Nc3 with a dominant position. Basically, White is busted here. }

8. Bg5
{ White's score - 54.4%. The most popular move characteristic for the Petrosian System. White's main idea is to play Nd2 next with perfect harmony. His Knights will prepare queenside attack with b3 + a3 + b4 followed by eventual c5. The Bishop can later go back to e3 if necessary. That means that Black will kick the Bishop immediately before it can safely go back to e3. }
8... h6
{ White's score - 53.6%. Immediately challenging the Bishop. Now, White has to answer the question about the Bishop's placement. }
9. Bh4
{ White's score - 53.8%. This is a thematic move for the Petrosian system. Black maintains the pin on the h4 - d8 diagonal and prepares Nd2 next. }
9... Na6
{ A standard plan for Black. We will play ...Bd7 and ...Qe8 next stopping White's queenside initiative for the moment.   One line that I really wanted to make work is  9...g5!?  10.Bg3  Nh5  but after  11.h4!  Nxg3  12.fxg3  g4  13.Nd2  h5  White has a veeery unpleasant  14.c5!!  in-store.  I won't dig deeply into details, but White clears the c4-square for the Knight and his compensation will be too big to handle in a practical game. The score after 14. c5 is 3/3 for White, so I decided to abandon this line and go for a more classical 9... Na6 instead. }
10. Nd2
{ A standard regrouping for White. The Knight will support White's queenside play, while the e2-Bishop controls g4 and h5, so White doesn't have to worry about ...Nh5 or ...Ng4 any more.   10.O-O  Bd7  11.Nd2  Qe8  transposes to the mainline with 10. Nd2. }
10... Bd7
{ It is also possible to start with 10... Qe8 but it will lead to the same thing most of the time, while after 10... Bd7 we will have one additional option. }
11. O-O
{ A standard reaction. White castles and prepares b3 + a3 followed by Rb1 and b4 grabbing space on the queenside. }
11... Qe8
{ White's score - 51.8%. This is the critical position of the whole Petrosian system. White will try to build up the attack on the queenside with b3 + a3 + Rb1 and b4 + c5 etc. On the other hand, Black will play ...Nh7 followed by ...h5 and an interesting but rare ...Bf6!? trying to exchange the dark-squared Bishops.   There is a crazy option available for Black that I'd like to mention.  11...Nc5  looks like a normal move, but after  12.b3  Black can uncork a maverick-like  12...Nfxe4!?!?  sacrificing the Queen. Let's see some lines:  13.Bxd8  Nxc3  14.Qe1   14.Bxc7?  is much worse due to  14...Nxd1  15.Rfxd1  Ra6  with an advantage for Black.  14...Rfxd8  15.Nb1  - the only move to get an advantage.   15.f3  allows  15...f5  16.Bd1  Rf8  17.Bc2  e4!  18.fxe4  fxe4  19.h3  Nd3  20.Rxf8+  Rxf8  21.Bxd3  exd3  22.Kh1  Ne2  23.Rd1  Nc3  24.Ra1  Ne2=  15...Nxe2+  16.Qxe2  e4  17.Na3   17.Nd2  Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  with mutual chances.  17...Bxa1  18.Rxa1  Re8  .  Black's main idea is ...f5 - f4. This is a crazy position and a crazy line that I don't recommend as a mainline, but it would be useful to have it as a surprise weapon. }
12. b3 { The most popular continuation preparing further queenside expansion. }
12... Nh7
{ You probably are already familiar with this plan. I will repeat though ! We want to play ...h5 threatening to trap the Bishop with ...g5. After White defends with f3, we will play ...Bf6 trying to exchange the dark-squared Bishops.   Note that the immediate  12...h5?!  would be less accurate due to  13.Bg5!  Nh7  14.Be3!  and White achieves perfect coordination. These small details make all the difference. }
13. a3 h5 { Threatening ...g5 trapping the Bishop. } 14. f3 Bf6
{ White's score - 47%. Out of 731 games, only 50 went with 14... Bf6. The most popular move is 14... Bh6 with a ton of theory. I don't think that 14... Bf6 is in any way inferior to 14... Bh6. The fact that it is exactly 13 times less popular makes it a great surprising weapon ! Black's basic plan is to exchange the dark-squared Bishops and play on the dark squares next. }
15. Bf2 { Almost all games continued like this. } 15... Qe7
{ Before playing .. .h4 Black improves the Queen. Our main idea now won't be ...h4 but ...Bh4! insisting on the Bishop's exchange. }
16. Rb1 { White makes his standard preparatory moves. We can expect b4 next. }
16... Bh4
{ This is the best plan for Black. Note that  16...Bg5?!  would be inaccurate due to  17.b4!  axb4  18.axb4  h4  19.c5  dxc5  20.b5  Nb4  21.Nc4  with a great initiative for White. It would be very impractical to allow that.  White has a few options now. He can ignore our Bishop on h4 and proceed with b4, he can take on h4 or he can avoid the exchange with g3. We will look at these moves now. }
17. Bxh4 Qxh4 18. b4 axb4 19. axb4 Qg5
{ It would be much worse to go for  19...c5?!  because our Queen is too far from the queenside.  20.dxc6  bxc6  21.b5!  would highlight that Black shouldn't rush with ...c5. By playing 19... Qg5 Black threatens ...Qe3+ so White has to react. }
20. Qc2 h4
{ Black has a typical initiative on the kingside. Manouvers such as ...Nf6 - h5 - f4 or ... h3 shouldn't be a surprise. }
21. c5
{ The only disadvantage of having the Queen on the kingside is that we allow the thematic c5-break, but it is not a problem here. }
21... h3 22. g3 dxc5 { The pawn has to be captured. } 23. Bxa6 bxa6 24. bxc5

You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.

White's pieces are still not fully coordinated and the c-pawn is undefended for a moment. }
13... Rxe3

14. Qxe3 Qf8
{ This is an important link in our chain. We threaten ... Ng4 with problems on d4 while also staring at the c5-pawn. Black's compensation is not tactical but positional. That means that we don't have to throw everything including the kitchen sink at our opponent. Also, if White takes on c6, then after ... bxc6 we can slowly improve our position with moves such as ...

The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.   Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the  7...c6  move order might be a good start. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 60.5%. This is our main idea in many lines of the Classical King's Indian Defence. It is an efficient and practical approach because most of the time we will get the same pawn structure and we will be more familiar with its nuances than our opponent. The other positive aspect is that the number of lines drastically decrease, which is always a good sign.   Objectively, I don't even think that  7...exd4  is any worse   than  7...Ng4  which is a mainline for Black.  Also, I can share a practical tip. In the Classical system with 6. Be2, whenever you have a chance to take on d4 on move 7 - do it ! }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { The same development scheme as in the 7. O-O line. } 9. f3 c6
{ The same plan as in the 7. O-O exd4 lines. } 10. Bf2
{ White's score - 61.2%. This is the most popular move. White removes the Bishop from e3 so it won't run into any ...Rxe5 ideas in the future. }
10... d5 11. exd5 cxd5 12. O-O
{ 12.c5  Nc6  13.O-O  will lead to the same thing. } 12... Nc6 13. c5
{ White's score - 59.6%. This is White's idea. He eliminates tension from the centre and creates a 3 vs 2 pawn majority on the queenside. A position with an isolated d-pawn appeared and usually, the side with such a pawn has dynamic possibilities. White has weak squares on the kingside and in the centre - especially f4 and e3, but also the d4-square can be very important. If Black succeeds in forcing White to take on c6, then the pawn on d5 won't be weak any more and becomes a strong passed pawn instead. Additionally, an open b-file combined with the strong Bishop on g7 pressurizing b2 might be problematic for White.   13.Nxc6?!  is wrong. White shouldn't strengthen our centre for free.  13...bxc6  14.cxd5  Nxd5  15.Nxd5  Qxd5  16.Qxd5  cxd5=  .  With so active pieces it is only Black who can be better, although with accurate play from White it should be equal. }
13... Bf8
{ White's score - 53.8%.   This is a modern treatment. An old mainline goes  13...Nh5  14.Qd2  Be5  15.g3  Ng7  ,   but I think that  13...Bf8  is more dynamic and more interesting.  Black immediately threatens to take on c5 and forces White to do something about it. Normally, White should avoid taking on c6 as I've mentioned and he will either put the King in the corner, play Bb5 or retreat the Knight from d4 to b3. }
14. Kh1
{ This is the main move for White. He tactically defends against the hanging c-pawn, as  14...Bxc5??  runs into  15.Nxc6  and Black loses. }
14... Bd7
{ White made a useful move with Kh1 without revealing his plans, so we do the same. We develop the Bishop and wait !   I will repeat that  14...Bxc5??  loses to  15.Nxc6  . }
15. Qd2
{ I think that only this move enables White to fight for anything. It is important to finish development with Black and avoid jumping around. }
15... Rc8
{ Black improves the Rook and threatens to take on c5 with the Bishop, because after a typical Nxc6 we would be able to take back with the Rook and protect the Bishop on c5! }
16. Nxc6
{ Almost exclusively played. As you could see, both 16. Nb3 and 16. Nc2 are harmless for Black. }
16... bxc6
{ We will end the theoretical discussion here. For more guideline about middlegame, you can click next and acquaint yourself with different plans for both sides. }

For example, the line that I normally play which is 6... Nbd7 7... e5 8... exd4 doesn't guarantee Black equal chances and it requires a lot of experience to handle these positions well. The 7... e5 line was quite popular in the 60s and 70s, and it has been gradually repelled by other systems. Only a few years ago we experienced the 2nd boost of popularity of this variation. A reason for that is that after 8. d5 Black can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8...

Nc3 may be reached via different move orders, such as 3. Nc3 and only Nf3 later, or even 1. Nf3, 1. g3 etc. All in all, we will probably land in this position sooner or later. White developed his forces harmoniously, strengthened his King's position and will try to squeeze every active try from us. This is a completely different approach to the one seen in the previous chapters. White doesn't want to occupy the centre as fast as possible, but he focuses on stopping our active operations. This variation is also a recommendation of GM Boris Avrukh, so it definitely has to be taken seriously. }
7... e5
{ White's score - 56.7%. This is my recommended line for Black. Actually, I had the biggest difficulties in deciding on one line against the Fianchetto system, because I saw drawbacks everywhere. For example, the line that I normally play which is 6... Nbd7 7... e5 8... exd4 doesn't guarantee Black equal chances and it requires a lot of experience to handle these positions well. The 7... e5 line was quite popular in the 60s and 70s, and it has been gradually repelled by other systems. Only a few years ago we experienced the 2nd boost of popularity of this variation. A reason for that is that after 8. d5 Black can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8... Nb8 is the best move for Black and you can see the details by going through this chapter. }
8. e3
{ White's score - 51.5%. White just solidifies the centre, but it is too passive to play for an advantage. }
8... Bf5 9. b3
{ White plans a double fianchetto, but we have multiple ways of getting a good game. }
9... Re8
{ Just bringing another piece into the game and planning to play ... e4. } 10.
Bb2
{ 10.d5  Nb8  is similar to the positions that we will discuss later in this chapter. }
10... e4 { Playing in style of the King's Indian Attack. } 11. Nd2
{ 11.Ne1  h5  with great attacking chances for Black. } 11... Nb4
{ Our main plan is to play ... c6 and ... d5 followed by planting the Knight on d3. }
12. a3
{ This is the only line that stops our plans, but tactics work for Black ideally - as usual in the KID. }
12... Nd3 13. Ndxe4 Nxb2 14. Nxf6+ Bxf6 15. Qd2 Nxc4 16. bxc4 c6
{ Black has a pair of Bishops while White got a semi-open b-file. Chances are balanced. }

8. d5
{ White's score - 58.4%. The most popular and the most natural move for White. White gains space and wins a tempo on the attacked Knight. The disadvantage is that now, the g2-Bishop's scope has been blocked by the d-pawn and White reduced tension in the centre. }

9... a5
{ Before putting the Knight on a6 we gain some space and secure the c5-square. The position resembles the Petrosian Variation from the 6th chapter. }
10. Ne1

10... Na6
{ White's score - 48.8%. This is the best square for the Knight. Note that in virtually every line we play the same moves, which is great because we always know what to do in practice. }
11. Nd3 Nd7
{ The Knight obstructed f-pawn's route to ...f5. Also, Black prepares ...Ndc5.   That being said,  11...Nb4!?  is an interesting alternative trying to exchange the strong Knight on  d3  12.Nxb4   After  12.Ne2  we can repeat the position with  12...Na6  .  12...axb4  with mutual chances.

12... exf4 13. gxf4
{ Taking with the Bishop would weaken the e5-square too much   13.Bxf4  Nb4  and Black is slightly better due to a firm control over the e5-square. }
13... f5
{ Destroying White's centre - a common theme in the King's Indian Defence. }
14. exf5 Rxf5
{ White's pawn structure has been weakened. Also, we threaten ... Nb6 with a deadly attack on the c4-pawn. }

{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Ng3
{ White's score - 41.7%. This is the 2nd most popular move in this position and it is usually a choice of players who are not prepared for 8... Na5. Good for us, because Black is in excellent shape after the next move. }
9... b5
{ Black's score - 41.8%. This move is a crucial link of our plan. We open up the lines on the queenside while attacking the c4-pawn. }
10. Bh6
{ This is virtually the only move not to be worse for White. We need to be slightly careful because White's attack is usually strong and shouldn't be underestimated. }
10... c6
{ It is a much stronger option to strengthen the centre than going for material gains. I don't fully trust  10...Nxc4  11.Bxc4  bxc4  12.O-O-O  . }
11. h4 { White has to go for the attack. } 11... Bxh6
{ Our idea is to force the White Queen into h6 so we will be able to attack the centre next. }
12. Qxh6 e5
{ Once again, it is very important to create tension in the centre before capturing on c4.   I wouldn't be surprised if after  12...Nxc4  13.Bxc4  bxc4  14.O-O-O  White's attack would be too strong to parry. }
13. d5
{ 13.O-O-O  exd4  14.Rxd4  Qe7  with a sharp position with chances for both sides.  (Our main ideas are ...Qe5 and... b4)  (.) }
13... Nxc4 { Finally, we can capture the pawn. } 14. Bxc4 bxc4 15. dxc6 Be6
{ Developing the Bishop and preparing ...Rc8. } 16. h5
{ Note that  16.Nf1  preparing Ne3 + g4 with a strong attack  is countered nicely with  16...Nh5!  and it is not easy for White to build the attack. }
16... Rc8
{ Since White prepares queenside castling, we need to create threats on the queenside but firstly, we have to eliminate the pawn on c6. }
17. O-O-O
{ A critical approach. Something like  17.hxg6?!  fxg6=+  would only help Black. }
17... Rxc6 18. Nf1 Rc7
{ The Rook will be useful on the 7th rank in the case of hxg6 from White. } 19.
Ne3 Rb7 { Starting the queenside counterplay. } 20. g4
{ This is a critical position. If White is allowed to play Rd2 - h2 followed by g5 and hxg6, it would be very hard for Black to defend. }
20... Kh8
{ Anticipating g5 by freeing the g8-square for the Knight ! Also, we threaten ... Ng8 and the White Queen is trapped ! }
21. Qg5 { Watch out ! White threatens Rxd6! } 21... Ng8 22. Qxd8 Rxd8
{ With the Queens exchanged, Black's concerns about the attack on the King should be gone. We are a pawn up, but White's pieces are active and he should have decent compensation. I would evaluate this position as dynamically balanced and both sides have their chances. Black's main idea is to improve the position by playing ... Ne7 and bringing the King to the centre. }

Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
{ In this and the next chapter we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nf4
{ White's score - 59.6%. This line is one of the strangest in the whole course. White's idea is crystal clear - play h4 - h5 and checkmate us on the kingside. Why is the line strange ? Firstly, it happened in only 26 games making it only the 3rd most popular move after 9. Nc1 and 9. Ng3. Secondly, if I would need to point out the line, from the whole repertoire that requires the most precision, it would be this line. One tempo can decide the game in both directions, therefore surgical accuracy will be necessary. There are no shortcuts with this variation - good memorization or engine-like calculations are the only things that can guide you well through the jungle of variations. A good sign is that when the memorization process is finished, your chances of seizing the initiative will be significant. In the end, I will tell you that I don't recall ever meeting 9. Nf4 - even in online blitz. }
9... b5
{ This is the only move to generate sufficient counterplay. Trust me, everything else fails. A good sing is that ...b5 is a part of our plan anyway. }
10. h4
{ The most dangerous line. White reveals his barbaric intentions. To warn you - not scare - I turned on the engine and handed over a move for White making a 0 move for Black. My engine immediately gave + 1.70 after 11. h5 and I believe it would be much higher if I leave Stockfish running for slightly more time. }
10... h5
{ Now we switch to some forced moves for Black. A pawn push h4 - h5 has to be stopped here ! It allows White to strike at the h5-pawn, but we will hold the balance with accurate play. }
11. O-O-O
{ Castling long is also a critical option. I would even consider it as a more critical one than 11. g4 which will be subject of our analysis soon after this line. White's idea is to play g4 next and it is necessary for us to understand what is going on. It is obvious that we will sacrifice a piece on g4 because otherwise we would be mated. That means that we know our next move. So our job, for now, is to find a useful move that will help us create counter-chances. }
11... Rb8
{ It is not obvious at first sight but this is the only move for Black to keep decent chances. It was possible to find this by a process of elimination. Let's see:   11...c6?!  doesn't work well due to  12.g4  Bxg4  13.fxg4  Nxg4  14.Ng2!  with a big advantage for White.   11...Nxc4?!  is also dubious due to  12.Bxc4  bxc4  13.g4  Bxg4   13...Nxg4  also doesn't work after  14.fxg4  Bxg4  15.Rdg1!  followed by Rxg4 and h5 is crushing  14.fxg4  Nxg4  15.Rdg1!  followed by Rxg1 and h5 as in the line above. }
12. cxb5
{ It is a typical engine move which is quite unlikely to be played by a human, so I won't devote too much time to this one. }
12... axb5 13. e5
{ White abandoned the kingside attack and tries to play e6 weakening Black's light squares on the kingside. }
13... Nh7
{ I think that this is the most accurate move. On  e8  the Knight would be passive, while  13...Nd7  runs into  14.e6  . }
14. e6
{ Any other move would allow ... dxe5 while taking on b5 is too risky. It would allow us to speed up our attack on the queenside due to the newly opened b-file and a tempo won on ... c6. }
14... Qe8 { Securing the light squares. We will look at one forced sequence. }
15. Bd3
{ 15.g4  hxg4  and White's attack is not that strong with the kingside defended by more Black's pieces and after  16.h5  we will play  16...g5!  closing the h-file. }
15... Nf6
{ This is an important move to remember. We want to play either ... Bxe6 or ... Nc4. }
16. exf7+ Rxf7
{ It is an exchange sacrifice but Black will have excellent chances. ... b4 followed by ... e5 is our main threat }
17. Bxg6 Nc4 18. Qe2
{ 18.Bxf7+?  would be wrong due to  18...Qxf7+  with ... b4 to come next and Black's queenside initiative can't be stopped. }
18... Nxe3 19. Qxe3 Bh6
{ Black threatens ... b4 followed by ... e5. Let's end the trainable line here and see some scenarios.   20.g3  White has to bolster the Knight  20...b4  21.Ne4  Nd5  22.Qd3   22.Bxf7+  is very risky due to  22...Qxf7  23.Qe2  Nxf4  24.gxf4  Qxa2  and White has to find two forced moves  25.Ng5  Bf5  26.Qxe7  and he somehow holds.  22...Bxf4+  23.gxf4  Qc6+  24.Kb1  Rg7  ... b3 is next while ... Nxf4 is also dangerous. }

{ The only move for White. } 14... Ne5
{ I think that White has to be very precise to defend against multiple threats. }
15. Qc2 dxc5
{ Opening up lines in the centre before White safeguards the King. Also, this move stops O-O-O. }
16. cxb5 Nf3+ 17. Kf2 Nd4

Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the next chapter. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ...b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options. }
9. Nc1
{ White's score - 47.1%. This is a more popular move than all of the other 3 tries combined. White plays in style of the usual Samisch with 8... Rb8. Our opponent will either kick our Knight with b4 next or play a more reliable Nb3. }
9... Nd7
{ White's score - 46.7%.   This is the only line where we don't play for a quick  ...b5  . Note that  9...b5  just gives up the pawn since  10.cxb5  axb5  11.Bxb5  Nb3??  (doesn't work because the b3-square is protected by the Knight on c1.)  By playing 9... Nd7 Black prepares ...c5. }
10. Nb3
{ White's score - 54%. I consider it to be the strongest option for White, therefore we should consider it as our mainline. White challenges our Knight and will rely on the strong pawn centre. }
10... Nxb3 { I prefer this over  10...c5  . } 11. axb3 e5
{ 11...c5  12.d5  would lead to a Benoni-type-of position which I prefer to avoid. We play the KID  ! }

{ If we want to avoid the repetition with  Bg5 - h6 - g5   it is possible to play for a win with  13...Nf6  14.Bd3  Bd7  with mutual chances. }
14. Bh6 Bg7 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 16. exf5 gxf5

White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be2 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play.

White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable.

White would get an almost winning position after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  and now both  9.Nd5   or  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  10.Nd5  By playing 6...

12. O-O c6
{ A typical move taking control over the d5-square. My general understanding of the King's Indian is that whenever Black reached a similar pawn structure he is at least equal. The only scenario when White might be on top is when he plays for a quick c5 and plants the Knight on c4, but it is very unlikely to work most of the time. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bg5
{ White's score - 58.4%. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at a system named after the legendary grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable. With this method you will be guaranteed to focus on what is most important without wasting your precious time on lines that aren't primary. }
6... Na6
{ White's score - 52.6%. I like this move a lot, because both 6... c5 and 6... h6 lead to positions typical for a Benoni.  Before I will explain what is the purpose of   6...Na6   I will briefly mention that  6...e5?  is a mistake that occurred too many times. White would get an almost winning position after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  and now both  9.Nd5   or  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  10.Nd5  By playing 6... Na6 we prepare ideas connected with ...e5 since the plan seen in the 6... e5? line above isn't that effective due to Black's extra option of ...Rd6 in the end. It is possible because the c5-square is secured by the a6-Knight ! }
7. Qd2
{ White's score - 50.8%. This is a more popular move than all of the other tries combined. White doesn't reveal his plans yet and makes a useful developing move. }
7... e5
{ White's score - 50.5%. Having the c5-square under control we can go for this one. The point is that in all of the exchange lines we will have ...Rd6 as a response to Bg5. }
8. d5
{ Played in more than 90% games. This is a typical Averbakh move closing the centre and trying to eliminate counterplay. }
8... Qe8
{ White's score - 40.8%. This is a standard move in these types of closed positions in the Averbakh system. Black prepares ...Nh5 or in some cases ...Nfd7. }
9. Bd3
{ White's score - 51.6%. Moving the Bishop for the 2nd time in the opening is a clear sign that something went wrong. On the other hand, the position is relatively closed and if White managed to consolidate with Nge2 and O-O he may be better. }
9... Nh5 10. Nge2
{ It is necessary to stop ...Nf4.   10.f3?!  Nf4  with a very good position for Black. }
10... f5 11. exf5
{ This is not a popular move but it requires a precise reaction from us. }
11... e4
{ 11...gxf5?  would be wrong due to  12.O-O-O  and White is much better.  (We should expect g4 to come next and our King starts looking suspicious)  (.) }
12. Nxe4
{ 12.Bc2  12.Bxf5  13.O-O  Nb4  14.Ba4  Qe5  with mutual chances.  (Black's basic idea is to plant the Knight on d3.) }
12... Bxf5 13. f3 Bxe4
{ It is necessary to create counterplay before White castles. } 14. Bxe4 Nc5
15. Bc2 Qe5 { Centralizing the Queen and preparing ... Rae8 next. } 16. O-O

9. Bd1
{ White's score - 57.5%. By far the most popular move regrouping the Bishop to c2 from where it will defend the e4-pawn while simultaneously freeing the e2-square for the Knight. Note that 9. Nf3 would transpose to the 8. Nf3 line. }
9... c6
{ White's score - 46.3%. Since White prepares Bc2 as a response to ... Nc5 it is better to switch to this continuation. Not only we prepare to take on d5 but in some cases might even consider ...b5. }
10. f3
{ This is a less popular continuation than 10. Nge2 but I think it has some venom. }
10... b5
{ I don't like to take on d5 in this scenario and also, ... Nh5 ideas are less clear with the pawn already on c6. By playing ... b5 which is a novelty we put immediate pressure on White's centre and use the fact that White has to spend two more moves to castle. }
11. dxc6 bxc4 12. Qxd6 Be6
{ White won a pawn but he is behind in development. All lines work well for Black but some memorization will be necessary. }
13. Ba4
{ This computer-like move might be the most problematic if you don't know what to do.   13.Nge2  allows  13...Qb8!  14.Qxb8  Raxb8  with mutual chances. It is not easy for White to keep the extra pawn without full compensation for Black.  We man ponder ideas such as ... Rfc8 or ... Nc5. }
13... Rd8 14. Qa3 Rd3
{ Freeing the 8th rank for the Queen and pinning the Knight. } 15. Bc2 Qxc6
{ The point of Black's previous play. We sacrifice an exchange but will get excellent practical compensation. }
16. Bxd3 cxd3
{ Two of Black's basic ideas are ... Rb8 and ... Qb6 White has to walk a tightrope not to fall into trouble. }
17. Rd1
{ 17.Nh3  allows  17...Qb6  and if White wants to castle he has to go for  18.Nf2  but after  18...Nb4!  Black wins the exchange back. Going for  19.O-O  is White's only option to survive and after  19...Nc2  position is close to equal. }
17... Rb8 { Threatening ... Nb4 with unpleasant threats to the White King. }
18. Rxd3
{ Eliminating the pawn is a must as it cramped White and now Nge2 will be possible. }
18... Nc5 19. Rd2 Bc4
{ Black is an exchange and a pawn down but Black has great compensation. The White King is forced to stay in the centre - at least for the moment. Let's see two possible scenarios. }
20. Nge2
{ 20.Bxf6  Bxf6  21.Nd5  Bg5  and White may be weak on the dark squares too. }
20... Bf8 { Threatening ... Nd3. } 21. Qa5
{ Of course  21.O-O ??  loses to  21...Ncxe4∓ } 21... Nd3+ 22. Rxd3 Bxd3

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4
{ White's score - 55.8%. So, here we are, in the Four Pawns Attack world ! If I would need to name a variation that is the most aggressive and in which White goes for the bare-knuckle boxing approach - here you go. White's central advantage is overwhelming for the moment and we have to do something about it. }
5... O-O
{ Some sources give 5... c5!? as a better move because it is supposed to avoid the 7. dxc5 line. I think there is no point in avoiding it since I believe I have managed to find an excellent continuation for Black in the sequence mentioned above. }
6. Nf3
{ White's score - 55.4%.   6.Be2  doesn't have any independent value and play will transpose to one of the mainlines after  6...c5  . }
6... c5
{ White's score - 54.5%. I played 6... Na6 for years but I started disliking it more and more recently. }
7. d5
{ White's score - 54%. Grabbing space is the most popular plan for White. }
7... e6
{ White's score - 52.3%. We will get a position similar to the Modern Benoni but don't worry, this variation is not especially threatening when you know what to do. }
8. Be2 { White's score - 52.7%. } 8... exd5 9. cxd5
{ White's score - 53.1%. Capturing with the c-pawn leads to the Modern Benoni positions. }
9... Nbd7
{ White's score - 45.5%. As I've already mentioned, I like to go for original ideas whenever given a chance. Two more popular options are 9.. .Re8 and 9... Bg4 but I think that 9... Nbd7 is also a good option for Black. I played the Four Pawns Attack for a long time and I can honestly tell you that I've never had any line prepared against 9... Nbd7 and I would probably have problems figuring out what is the best option for White. }
10. O-O
{ White's score - 48.2%. The most popular move just safeguarding the King. }
10... Re8
{ White's score - 47.3%. An automatic move attacking the e4-pawn and forcing White to make a decision about it. }
11. Qc2
{ White decides to keep the Knight on f3 and defend the pawn with the Queen. }
11... Qc7
{ Initially, I thought that this position will be relatively easy to play for Black but I managed to found two pitfalls.   11...Qe7?!  is the 2nd most popular move that scores very well for Black but I doubt that Black can equalize after  12.Re1  Nxe4  13.Bd3  f5  14.Nxe4  fxe4  15.Rxe4  Qf8  16.Rxe8  Qxe8  17.Bd2  Nb6  Re1+=  I dislike this.   11...c4?!  12.Bxc4  Nc5  13.e5!  Bf5  14.Qd1  dxe5  15.fxe5  Ng4  16.e6  fxe6  17.h3  Ne5  18.Nxe5  Bxe5  19.Bf4  Bxf4  20.Rxf4+=  Add to that the fact that the most popular continuation for Black which is 11... a6 scores 70% for White and it was obvious that some research has to be done. The text move prepares ... c4. }
12. Nd2 { Played in both games that reached this position. } 12... a6
{ I think it is useful to include ... a6 and a4. Our plan is, of course, ... b5. }
13. a4 Rb8
{ Black threatens something like ... c4 and if White takes then ... b5 - b4 etc. A funny thing is that we've transposed to positions from the 11... a6 line but we managed to avoid some of the other lines with our move 11... Qc7 move order. }
14. a5 { White decides to stop ... b5 but we can play it anyway ! } 14... b5
15. axb6 Nxb6
{ Black has a nasty threat ... Nfxd5! exd5 Bxc3! and ... Rxe2 next ! } 16. Bf3
{ White should strengthen the centre. Some other options may look appealing but are in fact quite bad, for example:   16.Nc4?  Nxc4  17.Bxc4  Rb4  18.Qd3  Nxe4!  19.Nxe4  Bf5  20.Re1  Bd4+  21.Kh1  Rxe4  22.Rxe4  Bxe4  23.Qxe4  Rxc4∓  It was a quite forced line that didn't require too much commentary. It shows how easily White's position may collapse. }
16... Ng4
{ Threatening both ... Ne3 and ... Bd4+ thus White's response is forced. } 17.
Bxg4 Bxg4
{ Black has a pair of Bishops now and there is only one way for White to muddy the waters. }
18. f5
{ 18.Rxa6  would be too cooperative after  18...Bc8  19.Ra1  f5  with a big initiative for Black. }
18... Qe7 { Preparing both ... gxf5 and ... Bd4+ } 19. h3
{ Trying to win the Black Bishop is critical. } 19... Bd4+ { ... Qh4 is next. }
20. Kh1 Qh4 21. Qd3 gxf5 22. Rxa6 Kh8
{ Black has many dynamic options. One funny line is to play ... Qh5 threatening ... Nxd5! which works for Black in all lines ! If White takes with the e-pawn then we have ... Re3 while taking with the Knight allows ... exd5 in both cases winning. White has to do something to defend against this threat but it is not so simple to suggest something for our opponent.   To demonstrate what I mean I will make two stupid moves for White. So  23.Ra1?  Qh5!  24.Ra6  Nxd5!  25.exd5   25.Nxd5  Be2  -+  25...Re3  -+  The whole line is possible due to ... Qh5 covering the e2-square. }

{ Around 3 times less popular than Kf1. White will be able to castle on the next move. The disadvantage is that the Bishop has to go back from its active position. }
11... Nh5
{ I prefer this over 11... Bh6...Nh5 is a typical move in Benoni positions. We prepare to start some initiative on the kingside with moves such as ...Ne5 or ...Nf4/...Ng3 which are our threats if White isn't careful. }
12. O-O Ne5
{ We exchange some pieces and move our army towards the White King. Also, the c8-Bishop is opened now. }
13. Nxe5 Rxe5
{ I like this recapture the most. However, there is an alternative:   13...Bxe5!?  14.Qd2  h6!  preparing ...g5.  White should be careful and not go into  15.Bxh6   15.Rfe1=  is better  15...Bxh3  16.gxh3  Qh4  with a much better position for Black.  Our three basic ideas are ... Qxh3 ... Nf4 or ... Bf4.  Going back to 13... Rxe5, we want to play ... Qh4 and develop the Bishop - probably to d7 followed by bringing the queenside Rook into the game. }
14. Re1 Bd7
{ We can play ... Qh4 or ... f5 next with good attacking chances on the kingside. Let's see a sample line. }
15. g4
{ This looks the most critical.   15.Ne4  allows  15...Qf8  with a complicated position. Note that  16.g4??  is very bad due to  16...f5!  and Black is on a verge of victory. }
15... Qh4
{ If we have to retreat, White would be much better. Fortunately, complications work very well for Black. }
16. Qf3 Nf6
{ There is nothing better so we have to go back. Still, our active pieces and White's weakened kingside give us good chances. }
17. Bf4 Rxe1+ 18. Rxe1 Re8 19. Rxe8+ Nxe8
{ White has more space but his kingside is weakened. I'd say that Black may be marginally worse but in a practical game, I wouldn't expect too many problems. Our main ideas are connected with ... Bd4 and ... h5 trying to create weaknesses around White's King. }

5. Bg5
{ White's score - 54.6%. This is only the 8th popular move for White. Our opponent doesn't do anything extraordinary, just develops the Bishop and waits. If we castle now, then after Be2 f3 or h3 play may transpose to respectively the Averbakh, the Samisch or the previous chapter. I think we can punish White right here, right now without allowing him to transpose to one of these openings. }
5... h6
{ White's score - 53.1%. Immediately challenging the Bishop is the most critical. White has to make a decision about the Bishop's future.   I think that  5...O-O  is slightly inaccurate since White can play either  6.Qd2   or  6.f4  (in both cases with lines that we should avoid.) }
6. Bh4
{ This is the most popular continuation. White maintains the Bishop on the h4 - d8 diagonal but now the dark squares on the queenside and in the centre are less protected. }
6... c5

Qd2 g5 9. Bg3 Nh5
{ We see an obvious disadvantage of placing the Bishop on h4 and later on g3. We will grab the Bishop with the Knight when the time is right. The disadvantage is that we have weakened the kingside. That means that the position is dynamically balanced and I think that we should always strive for such imbalances to plan for a win with Black. }

5. Bg5

The point of 8... f5 is that after White plays this trick of responding ... g5 with Nd2 we will retreat to f6 and have a strong pawn chain on the kingside.

2... c5
{ White's score - 39.8%. This is the most sensible option for Black. It would be logical to play  2...g6  but after  3.Nc3  suddenly we are tricked into an unfamiliar territory of the Jobava London System.   If we, however, try to play  2...d5  then White may change plans and strive for  3.e3  and now we are tricked from our anti-London system.  Be careful ! The text move leads to some original positions, but if you want to stay faithful to the previous lines, then we need to play 2... c5. }
3. e3
{ The most common continuation for White. White's basic plan is to build a kind of pyramid with c3 and then Nd2 with usual London-like play. We want to avoid that ! }
3... Nd5
{ White's score - 29.9%. I think that this is a very interesting continuation that is both underestimated and neglected in the literature. There are different ways of playing that give Black a good position but I like the text move.   Trying to transpose into normal London lines with  3...g6  is tempting but I don't like  4.c3  Bg7  5.Nd2  O-O  6.dxc5  . }

{ White's score - 62.2%.   In this chapter we will take a look at the line named after the Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, who played  7.Be3  22 times through his career. White wants to provoke Black into transposing to the main KID lines with  7...Nc6?!  but after  8.d5  Ne7  9.Nd2!  White found the perfect set-up for his minor pieces. You should probably be aware that we can't allow that shuffle for White - the same positional trap was seen a few times in the previous chapter about the Petrosian system.  However, it doesn't disturb us at all, because we will take on d4 as fast as possible.   One more line that I want to mention is  7...c6!?  It is quite smart because we want to lure White into  8.O-O   8.Qd2  exd4  9.Nxd4  Re8  10.f3  d5   transposes to the  10.Qd2  line of this chapter  8...exd4  9.Nxd4   9.Bxd4!?  is possible though  Re8  10.f3  d5!  which scores highly for Black.   The problem is that after  7...c6!?  White has  8.d5  and I failed to find a decent line for us.   Still, if you want to experiment a little, then the  7...c6  move order might be a good start. }
7... exd4
{ White's score - 60.5%. This is our main idea in many lines of the Classical King's Indian Defence. It is an efficient and practical approach because most of the time we will get the same pawn structure and we will be more familiar with its nuances than our opponent. The other positive aspect is that the number of lines drastically decrease, which is always a good sign.   Objectively, I don't even think that  7...exd4  is any worse   than  7...Ng4  which is a mainline for Black.  Also, I can share a practical tip. In the Classical system with 6. Be2, whenever you have a chance to take on d4 on move 7 - do it ! }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { The same development scheme as in the 7. O-O line. } 9. f3 c6
{ The same plan as in the 7. O-O exd4 lines. } 10. Qd2
{ White's score - 55%. It is also a natural move for White, but it was practically repelled from tournament practice after the Karpov - Kasparov World Championship matches. Kasparov stated that 10. Qd2 doesn't give White any advantage.   Note that  10.O-O  d5  transposes to the line #7 with  7. O-O exd4 8. Nxd4 Re8 9. f3 c6 10. Be3 d5 move order. }
10... d5 { It shouldn't surprise anyone that we go for this thematic break. }
11. exd5
{ White's idea will be to push c4 - c5 after castling.   11.cxd5?!  is weaker because it lets Black liquidate in the centre, therefore leaving us with somewhat superior chances. }
11... cxd5 12. O-O
{ 12.c5?!  is premature due to  12...Bf8!  and it is quite tricky for White to save the c-pawn without any concessions. }
12... Nc6 13. c5
{ White's score 60.6%. This is White's basic concept in the whole chapter. White has a 3 vs 2 pawn majority on the queenside and will try to slowly make progress there. Also, now there is no tension in the centre and the d5-pawn is isolated. However, things are far from simple. White's pieces are still not fully coordinated and the c-pawn is undefended for a moment. }
13... Rxe3
{ This was Kasparov's main idea when he faced Karpov's 10. Qd2. Some work to rehabilitate the line for White has been done, but there is no simple way for White to get any advantage.   That being said,  13...Bf8!?  playing in style of the mainline that will be analysed later is also possible. }
14. Qxe3 Qf8
{ This is an important link in our chain. We threaten ... Ng4 with problems on d4 while also staring at the c5-pawn. Black's compensation is not tactical but positional. That means that we don't have to throw everything including the kitchen sink at our opponent. Also, if White takes on c6, then after ... bxc6 we can slowly improve our position with moves such as ... Rb8 - b4.   Note that the immediate  14...Ng4??  would fail to  15.Nxc6!  . }
15. Nxc6
{ The most popular move removing the Knight from any problems on d4 while defending the c5-pawn at the same time. }

{ White's score - 54.6%. In this chapter, we will take a look at one of the most popular lines for White, which is the Fianchetto system. Firstly, I want to mention that we will take a look at the mainline first, and only then we will check out some of White's alternatives in the next chapter. The position after 7. Nc3 may be reached via different move orders, such as 3. Nc3 and only Nf3 later, or even 1. Nf3, 1. g3 etc. All in all, we will probably land in this position sooner or later. White developed his forces harmoniously, strengthened his King's position and will try to squeeze every active try from us. This is a completely different approach to the one seen in the previous chapters. White doesn't want to occupy the centre as fast as possible, but he focuses on stopping our active operations. This variation is also a recommendation of GM Boris Avrukh, so it definitely has to be taken seriously. }
7... e5
{ White's score - 56.7%. This is my recommended line for Black. Actually, I had the biggest difficulties in deciding on one line against the Fianchetto system, because I saw drawbacks everywhere. For example, the line that I normally play which is 6... Nbd7 7... e5 8... exd4 doesn't guarantee Black equal chances and it requires a lot of experience to handle these positions well. The 7... e5 line was quite popular in the 60s and 70s, and it has been gradually repelled by other systems. Only a few years ago we experienced the 2nd boost of popularity of this variation. A reason for that is that after 8. d5 Black can play 8... Nb8! instead of an old 8...Ne7 which experienced a lot of problems. 8... Nb8 is the best move for Black and you can see the details by going through this chapter. }
8. dxe5
{ White's score - 55.4%. This way of playing is what Avrukh recommends in his great repertoire. That should indicate that Black doesn't have too many problems in the mainline after 8. d5. }
8... Nxe5
{ White's score - 58.4%. I believe that this is the simplest recapture for Black. After  8...dxe5  there is a lot of theory knowledge necessary to handle resulting positions }
9. Nxe5 { Almost exclusively played. } 9... dxe5 10. Qxd8
{ The main option for White. He will usually play Bg5 next and try to put pressure on our position. }
10... Rxd8 11. Bg5
{ White has a lot of threats such as Bxf6 + Nd5, or Nd5 or Nb5. There is one smart move that defends against all of them. }
11... Rd4
{ White's score - 53%.   It may look strange, but it is a necessity for us.  11...Rd7  is also possible, but I think that it is too complicated and probably worse than  11...Rd4  . }
12. Rad1
{ Both  12.Rac1  c6   and  12.Rfd1  c6  are similar and don't have too much independent value. }
12... c6
{ Black is completely fine. We can proceed with the plan of developing the Bishop to e6 and rerouting the other one to f8. }
13. Be3
{ 13. b3 would transpose to the main variation with 12. b3 which is analysed in the main course  (lines #9 - #11 of this chapter.) }
13... Rxd1 14. Rxd1 Be6 15. b3 Bf8
{ Black's score from this position is 6.5/11 which indicates that it should be easier to play with the Black pieces in practice. Our main plan should be to play either ... Ng4 or ... Nd7 and follow it up by ... f5 and ... e4 shutting White's light-squared Bishop. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
{ In this and the next chapter, we will take a look at a system of playing for White named after the German grandmaster Friedrich Samisch. It may look strange that White places a pawn on f3 blocking this square for the Knight but things are far from simple. White will play either Be3 or Bg5, follow it up by Qd2 and Nge2 and then he may decide what type of position will be played. Normally, White plays for Be3 + Nge2 + Qd2 followed by h4 and an attack on the kingside. More modern treatment is to play Nc1 or Rc1 instead of h4 with a more positional play. However, the system that I recommend avoids playing into White's hands and we will reach an original position very soon. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ White's score - 54.5%. This is the continuation that we will pay attention to in this chapter. }
6... Nc6
{ White's score - 52%.   Nowadays,  6...c5  is considered to be the best move which is proven both by statistics and theoretical discussions. However, I see at least two disadvantages of this approach:  1. White can go for 7. dxc5 and grab the pawn. Black has excellent compensation for the pawn, but when you are higher rated, White may find some ways of drying the position quite quickly. 2. Even after either 7. d5 or 7. Nge2, the positions will be more typical for the Benoni Defence not for the King's Indian, which is not to everyone's taste. That's why we go for 6... Nc6 which is a typical move for the King's Indian Defence. No Benonis ! }
7. Nge2
{ White's score - 55%. All of White's alternatives on move 7 and 8 will be analysed in the chapter #12 of the main course. }
7... a6
{ White's score - 53.7%. The most popular move for Black. It is useful to prepare ... b5 + it is a waiting move waiting for White to show his hand. }
8. Qd2 { This is virtually the only move played in this position. } 8... Na5
{ White's score - 46.5%. As I've mentioned earlier, White will decide what to do hoping for 8... Rb8 after which many options such as 9. Nc1 9. Rc1 9. h4 9. are possible. But we are not that cooperative ! We need to stop our opponent's ideas forcing him into unknown territories as fast as possible. This is the idea of 8... Na5 - White can't play his normal moves on autopilot. Also, if his usual plan is to play h4 with the attack on the kingside, he will be disappointed here. There is only the 9. Nf4 line where White can try to attack, but complications are not unfavourable for Black and we can score many quick victories against the unprepared opponent. For now, we attack the c4-pawn and White has to do something about it. There are 4 options for our opponent: 9. Nc1 is the most popular and will be analysed in this line. 9. Nf4 is a very rare move but it is also one of the most dangerous ones and I briefly mention it in this line. However, I recommend spending your time to learn the lines resulting after 9. Nf4 by heart, since it is one of these lines that require precise handling. 9. b3 is the least popular move and you can just play 9... b5 with a good game. }
9. Nc1
{ White's score - 47.1%. This is a more popular move than all of the other 3 tries combined. White plays in style of the usual Samisch with 8... Rb8. Our opponent will either kick our Knight with b4 next or play a more reliable Nb3. }
9... Nd7
{ White's score - 46.7%.  This is the only line where we don't play for a quick ... b5.   Note that  9...b5  just gives up the pawn since  10.cxb5  axb5  11.Bxb5  Nb3??  doesn't work because the b3-square is protected by the Knight on c1.  By playing 9... Nd7 Black prepares ... c5. }
10. b4
{ White's score - 41.1%. This is a common guest in tournament practice. If you go for the 8... Na5 line you will meet 10. b4 sooner or later. White wins even more space but he is seriously behind in development. We will try to use this and strike at White's centre. }
10... Nc6 11. Rb1 e5
{ I think this is the right way of attacking White's centre. The other way of doing it  11...f5  isn't accurate here due to  12.exf5  gxf5  13.d5  Nce5  14.f4  Ng6  15.Be2  e5  16.dxe6  Nf6  17.O-O  Bxe6  18.Nb3+=  . }
12. d5 Nd4 { White has to challenge the Knight with either N1e2 or Nb3. } 13.

{ This is a less popular but in my opinion a more reliable move.   13.N1e2  a5!  gives Black a great game. }

{ White's score - 58.4%. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at a system named after the legendary grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. White's plan is quite simple - he knows that we want to play actively and strive for complications, therefore he tries to stop our activity first, and only then implement his own active ideas. A note about the structure of this chapter. The Averbakh System is not a popular line nowadays and you will face it in less than 10% of your games. Therefore, I decided to mark as trainable the lines that are popular or required to memorize. If I think that some line has a less of importance, then I turn it into clickable.

Before I will explain what is the purpose of   6...Na6   I will briefly mention that  6...e5?  is a mistake that occurred too many times. White would get an almost winning position after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  and now both  9.Nd5   or  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  10.Nd5  By playing 6...

6... e5
{ White's score - 61.1%. I prefer to play in a pure King's Indian style whenever possible. We will go for ... c5 after 6. Bg5 but it is mainly due to the fact that we just can't play ... e5 without preparations there. }
7. d5
{ White's score - 61.5%.   7.Nf3?!  exd4!  leads to a bad version of that pawn structure for White. You for sure know the plans from the first chapters of the course.   7.dxe5  is also completely harmless since the White Bishop  is already on e3 so moving it further to g5 would cost a valuable tempo. }

If we castle now, then after Be2, f3 or h3 play may transpose to respectively the Averbakh, the Samisch or the previous chapter. I think we can punish White right here, right now without allowing our villain to transpose to one of these openings. }
5... h6
{ White's score - 53.1%. Immediately challenging the Bishop is the most critical. White has to make a decision about the Bishop's future.   I think that  5...O-O  is slightly inaccurate since White can play either  6.Qd2   or  6.f4  (in both cases with lines that we should avoid.) }

Another interesting line was to play the Benko style with  6...a6!?  7.Be2  c5  8.d5  b5  with a good version of the Benko. Normally, White never puts the Knight on g3 in this pawn structure.  By playing ... h5 we want to push the h-pawn up the board. And I don't mean push it up to h4, no. We will push the pawn up to h3! }
