1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3
{ 2.c4  b6 !?  After I realized I wanted to be getting Queen's Indian in most cases, I finally arrived at this interesting solution. What is the point ? Black hopes to see 3.Nf3 on the board, when he gets his dear Queen's Indian. How do we deal with 3. g3 and 3.Nc3, though ?   2...e6  It would be great to play this move with the idea to get QID after 3. Nf3 b6. However,   3.Nc3  and   3.g3  are both very serious and theoretically challenging continuations.  3.g3   3.Nc3  Bb7  Now 4. Nf3 transposes to the QID, while after 4. f3 and 4. Qc2 we arrive at some relatively unexplored, yet very exciting positions where Black has no theoretical problems.   3.f3 !  This is the most challenging possibility from the theoretical perspective, where White can fight for a tiny edge. But, I believe, the new ideas which I have found give us more than enough counter chances, both objectively and practically.  3...Bb7  This is the benefit of our move order: White simply cannot play the Catalan ! He'll be forced to go 4. Nf3, when we just transpose to the Queen's Indian. }
2... e6 3. c4 b6
{ I have always thought very fondly of Queen's Indian and always thought this was one of Black's most fascinating choices after 3. Nf3. The reason is quite simple: even though Black seemingly has a variety of choices after 3. Nf3, they all have some downsides. For example, the Queen's Gambit Declined is very solid, yet it is rather passive, and it's difficult to play for a win. On the other hand, such defenses as Ragozin and Vienna are a lot more fighting, but there are too many forced lines, and often you pay with a loss for your forgetfulness. On the other hand, QID is solid enough to give you a lot of reliability and confidence and is very sound objectively. At the same time, I think it provides a lot of winning chances as in most variations - at least if Black chooses to ! - it is possible to keep most pieces on the board and get a complex strategic fight. At the same time, I feel that the positions are rather based on understanding as opposed to concrete sharp lines, at least in most cases. This, in my opinion, is another very appealing feature of this opening. So, all in all, I have decided to build this repertoire around Queen's Indian. However, you might raise your brows with a surprise as you are reading this: how can we build the repertoire around this defense, if White can also go 3. Nc3 or 3. g3 ? That, indeed, is a very valid concern. I wanted this repertoire to be very sound and reliable, but also practical and not too theoretically heavy, so I immediately knew I had no desire to show you hundreds of variations in the Nimzo and Catalan. What would our solution be, in that case? After 3. g3 Bb7! there is no Catalan, while after 3. Nc3 Bb7 we arrive at the very unexplored, exciting, and fighting positions, where we are doing great both practically and theoretically. The only objective concern is 3. f3, so I would like to encourage you to take the chapter that covers this move very seriously. Yet, I believe, Black obtains a satisfactory position even if White plays absolutely perfectly. However, playing perfectly is not something White is likely to do: for example, the most critical position after some 7-8 moves was encountered in 10 games only or so! This means the White players ARE going to be caught off-guard and will be out of book soon. I would also like to say that not only 1. d4 2. c4, but also the 1. d4 sidelines, such as London, Trompowsky, Torre, Veresov, etc are covered in great detail. Besides this, 1. Nf3 and 1. c4 are also covered - 1. c4, to be honest, is a real delight to see based on this repertoire, as we are cutting off an immense amount of dangerous options White would have if we were to play Nimzo as our main weapon of choice. This repertoire is based on some very heavy research. I have used the MegaBase 2020 and the Correspondence Database 2020 as sources of reference. For analysis, I have used Stockfish, Lc0, and Fat Fritz, the most powerful engines out there, ran on some potent distant servers. I have also made sure to consult some reputable sources that the White players may base their game on and make sure I have suggested ways to neutralize the authors' recommendations. Some of the titles I have used - and, hopefully, neutralized ! - are:  1 Grandmaster Repertoire 2B - Dynamic Systems by Boris Avrukh, 2019;  2 Grandmaster Repertoire 2 - 1. d4 volume 2 by Boris Avrukh, 2010;  3 Practical White Repertoire with 1. d4 and 2. c4, Vol. 3: The Nimzo-Indian and Other Defences by Alexei Kornev, 2014;  4 Keep It Simple 1. d4: A Solid and Straightforward Chess Opening Repertoire for White by Christof Sielecki, 2019;  5 Winning With the Modern London System: A Complete Opening Repertoire for White against 1. d4 d5 by Nikola Sedlak, 2016;  6 Playing the Trompowsky by Richard Pert, 2013.  There are many other sources as well, but these are the most notable ones. Besides the theoretical part, this repertoire also includes model games which will show you typical ideas in various types of positions. I am a firm believer that one should not concentrate on the opening moves only, as after the opening there is always a middlegame and it's crucial to understand how to handle the arising positions. Fortunately, our repertoire is very logical, but the model games would make your journey with it even more enjoyable. To make things even better, there is also a chapter called 'Quickstarter', where I have carefully chosen the most important variations that you absolutely need to study. This is not to say that you can ignore the rest of the repertoire, rather allow the most anxious and excited of you to get your hands dirty with this repertoire as quickly as possible! Some of you might use this as a full repertoire, while some, who already know what to do in Nimzo and Catalan, might just learn the Queen's Indian, 1. Nf3, 1. c4, and the 1. d4 sidelines. Or some, might want to add these fun 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 !? lines to their existing Nimzo/Catalan repertoires for Black! Anyway, I have put a tremendous amount of effort and love into this project and I hope that this repertoire will become a lifelong friend of yours on your chess journey and that the variations and explanations presented will not only help you feel more confident in the opening but will also improve your general chess understanding! }

Nc3 is definitely the main move and after 7...Ne4 White has many possibilities that we will analyze - the classical 8. Qc2, the modern 8. Bd2 and some other, less dangerous options. However, there are other possibilities available to White on 7th move: 7. Re1 !? is a tricky move, which delays the development of White's queenside knight - White claims that it is hard for us to come up with a useful move of our own. However, we do have a good answer to this. 7. d5 !? is a very interesting gambit, which was invented by Lev Polugaevsky back in the day and used by Alphazero in its recent famous matches. This can be a scary move to face unless you are prepared, but we will be - in fact, Black's play is pretty straightforward there. Let us go over all of the possibilities one by one ! }
7. Re1
{ A very interesting modern idea. People realized that it is hard to aspire for an advantage in the main line with 7. Nc3, so they started trying to make a semi-waiting move. As it is not easy to understand, I will again follow Kramnik's footsteps - not for the sake of just copying what he does, but simply because his moves and ideas are so amazingly good ! }
7... Qc8

{ Now it does not make sense for White to wait anymore, so he finally develops the knight. }
8... Ne4 9. Bd2 d6 10. Qc2 Nxd2
{ Now to recapture with the queen is not very logical - White just moved it. On the other hand, after the knight recapture we are also comfortable, for example. }
11. Nxd2 Bxg2 12. Kxg2 Nd7 { Black simply gets the knight in the game. } 13. e4
Qb7
{ Now the typical plan can involve ...a7-a6, ...b6-b5, followed by ...bxc4, ...Rab8 with a lot of interesting play on the queenside.  Besides that, it's also possible to hinder the White center with the timely ...c7-c5! followed by the play on the dark squares, such as ...Bf6, installing the bishop on the long diagonal. }

{ Adjusting the position of our queen. I cannot see how Re1 helps White. I would even say this is a harmful move in some regards, as White's typical plan would normally be f2-f4, and here the rook cannot support this pawn advance. This is very similar to the lines we see in the annotations to Gelfand-Kramnik, a game that begins with 7.Nc3, 8.Bd2. }

7. Nc3 { The main move and definitely the most dangerous one. } 7... Ne4
{ This is the most classical reply for Black and the safest one. Our idea is to trade the knights. Why do we do that ? Because at the moment, White has more space, and it is well-known, that the side with less space benefits from trades. Secondly, we are taking the e4-square under firm control, making it very difficult for White to ever play e2-e4, which is one of his main aspirations in this position. Also, we are creating a positional threat of Nxc3, which will spoil White's queenside structure and will make his pawns very vulnerable in the long run. }
8. Qc2
{ This is the classical reply. White will spend some time by moving the queen, but he hopes to eventually gain control over the e4-square and he also prevents us from spoiling his structure. }
8... Nxc3 9. Qxc3 d6
{ Actually, I feel that other, more popular continuations - 9... c5 and 9... f5, are also perfectly acceptable for Black. But I simply like Vladimir Kramnik's play too much, so I could not help but base my suggestion on his game from the Olympiad of 2018 - apparently, since it was a team competition, he had also approached his opening choice very seriously. White has several continuations here - 10. b3, 10. Qc2 and some other moves. But, since positions are not forcing, you will rather need to rely on typical plans rather than concrete sequences of moves, so I suggest that we concentrate on ideas behind the moves and do not attempt to cover every single possible move in every position. }
10. Rd1
{ This move was suggested by Sielecki in his 1. d4 repertoire for White. This is not a theoretical problem, but Sielecki's approach and goals were not related to posing theoretical problems - in his great work, he rather attempted to present solutions for White, where it would be easy for him to play. Well, it is also easy to play for us :  I would say you follow ideas that are similar to the main games that we analyze in this chapter, but also I would provide you with a few concrete moves. }
10... Nd7
{ I feel this is more logical and in the spirit of our plan, rather than Sielecki's 10...Bf6. Now, if White tries to prepare e4, we just prevent it. If he develops, so do we. Either way, we are doing great. }
11. b3 Qe8
{ A great prophylactical novelty by Leela. The idea for White is seen after 11...f5. So we are preparing this move.   11...f5  12.Qe3  and Black suddenly experiences problems with the e6-pawn. }
12. Bb2 f5 13. Qe3 Bf6
{ Now nothing is hanging, so Black gets a great position. I really love our bishops, as they control the center really well. On the next moves, we can play Be4, then e6-e5, for example. Black's play is already easier. }

11. d5
{ White is trying to shut down our bishop. However, it will soon find itself some nice spot on another diagonal. I feel that White's plan is pretty risky strategically, as he lets us seize more space in the center, which can hurt him in the long run. }
11... e5 { Now Black gets more space in the center. } 12. e4 Bc8
{ A good positional move. The bishop has nothing to do on b7, so Kramnik relocates it. }
13. Qe2 Na6 14. exf5 Bxf5
{ Somehow White got outplayed. His position is not a disaster yet, it is just slightly worse. However, Black's advantage is rather stable and it is very pleasant to play with the Black pieces. Our advantage is mostly based on the strong e5-pawn, which controls a lot of space. Also, White's light squares, such as e4 and d3, are pretty weak. And another important factor is his g2-bishop, which is not very useful at the moment. }
15. Nd2 Nc5 16. Ne4 a5
{ Both sides improve their pieces slowly, and now Kramnik takes space on the queenside, preventing any b2-b4 ideas. However, I think, it could also be interesting to instead go 16...Qe8, activating the queen, coming with it to g6. But, objectively, both moves are very good and lead to a comfortable position! }
17. Nxc5 bxc5

18. Bd2 a4 { Grabbing more space and fixing the b2-pawn as a weakness. } 19.
Be4 Bg5
{ Would have lead to a steady advantage in the position with heavy pieces. Actually, while this pawn structure arose from our favourite Queen's Indian, it is also very typical of other openings, such as KID. It is known that Black is more comfortable thanks to the semi-open f-file and the pressure he can create over it. White is solid, but usually very passive. }
20. Bxf5 Rxf5 21. Qe4 Rf7

8. Bd2
{ This is a very interesting move that lately became very trendy. White's idea is simple: he wants to reach a similar position to the one after 8. Qc2, but he hopes to get his bishop on c3, not the queen. Then he hopes he would find some better use for the queen. Also, White claims he is not afraid of getting his bishop traded for our knight, as it was not specifically useful anyway. In fact, we need to play quite a few precise moves to get a comfortable position here. }

9. d5 { Now White locks the center, making our b7-bishop quite passive. } 9...
Nxd2
{ Black gains the bishop pair. Now both recaptures are equally popular among White players - overall, our ideas would be similar, but there will be some concrete differences. }
10. Qxd2
{ I do not consider this move precise. Why ? Well, the center will be closed. This means White needs to come up with some strategic plan, which will involve pawn play. 10. Nxd2 ! is much more logical in this regard, as it opens such possibilities as f2-f4, for example. After the queen recapture, instead, we simply get some very comfortable development, while White cannot initiate any active play soon. }
10... e5 11. e4 Nd7 12. Ne1
{ The right plan - again, White prepares Nd3 followed by f2-f4. Here I really like the following idea, which was executed by several players, including Zahar Efimenko, my countryman. Throughout this course, you see for many times that I refer to Kramnik's game. In this regard, Efimenko's games are very interesting as well, as he was Kramnik's second for many years. }
12... Bg5
{ Black wants to activate his bishop. It can eventually retreat to h6, then Black will prepare f7-f5 by means of such moves as g7-g6, for example. And, we are more than happy to provoke White to play f2-f4 quickly. Let us see what happens if he does. }

{ Queen's Indian is a core of our repertoire, and this position is definitely one of the key tabiyas that you will be encountering. Please, make sure to spend a good amount of time on this position and the lines in this chapter ! Now, White has many continuations. 7. Nc3 is definitely the main move, and after 7..Ne4 White has many possibilities that we will analyze - the classical 8. Qc2, the modern 8. Bd2 and some other, less dangerous options. However, there are other possibilities available to White on 7th move: 7. Re1 !? is a tricky move, which delays development of White's queenside knight - White claims that it is hard for us to come up with a useful move of our own. However, we do have a good answer to this. 7. d5 !? is a very interesting gambit, which was invented by Lev Polugaevsky back in the day and used by Alphazero in its recent famous matches. This can be a scary move to face unless you are prepared, but we will be - in fact, Black's play is pretty straightforward there. Let us go over all of the possibilities one by one ! }
7. Nc3 { The main move and definitely the most dangerous one. } 7... Ne4
{ This is the most classical reply for Black and the safest one. Our idea is to trade the knights. Why do we do that ? Because at the moment, White has more space, and it is well-known, that the side with less space benefits from trades. Secondly, we are taking the e4-square under firm control, making it very difficult for White to ever play e2-e4, which is one of his main aspirations in this position. Also, we are creating a positional threat of Nxc3, which will spoil White's queenside structure and will make his pawns very vulnerable in the long run. }
8. Bd2
{ This is a very interesting move that lately became very trendy. White's idea is simple: he wants to reach a similar position to the one after 8. Qc2, but he hopes to get his bishop on c3, not the queen. Then he hopes he would find some better use for the queen. Also, White claims he is not afraid of getting his bishop traded for our knight, as it was not specifically useful anyway. In fact, we need to play quite a few precise moves to get a comfortable position here. }
8... d6
{ We make a useful waiting move, intending to just continue our development with Nd7 }
9. d5 { Now White locks the center, making our b7-bishop quite passive. } 9...
Nxd2
{ Black gains the bishop pair. Now both recaptures are equally popular among White players - overall, our ideas would be similar, but there will be some concrete differences. }
10. Qxd2
{ I do not consider this move precise. Why ? Well, the center will be closed. This means White needs to come up with some strategic plan, which will involve pawn play. 10. Nxd2 ! is much more logical in this regard, as it opens such possibilities as f2-f4, for example. After the queen recapture, instead, we simply get some very comfortable development, while White cannot initiate any active play soon. }
10... e5 11. e4 Nd7 12. Ne1
{ The right plan - again, White prepares Nd3 followed by f2-f4. Here I really like the following idea, which was executed by several players, including Zahar Efimenko, my countryman. Throughout this course, you see for many times that I refer to Kramnik's game. In this regard, Efimenko's games are very interesting as well, as he was Kramnik's second for many years. }
12... Bg5
{ Black wants to activate his bishop. It can eventually retreat to h6, then Black will prepare f7-f5 by means of such moves as g7-g6, for example. And, we are more than happy to provoke White to play f2-f4 quickly. Let us see what happens if he does. }
13. f4 Bh6 14. Nd3 { And here I would like to suggest a powerful novelty }
14... exf4 15. gxf4 Ne5 { Black attacks the c4-pawn and trades the knight. }
16. b3 f5
{ Initiating some mess in the center. Instead, other moves were possible too, but I feel we are definitely ready to take on the challenge. I really like our position here, as White's center is getting destroyed, and a lot of active possibilities are coming up for us - for example, Qh4, Rae8 and so on. }

7. d5
{ The fearsome Polugaevsky - AlphaZero gambit. Now we do need to know some precise lines, not just abstract ideas. The good news is that if we do, we get a good position : }
7... exd5
{ As an old chess joke goes, the best way of fighting the gambit is accepting it. }
8. Nh4
{ Now we start understanding the point of White's play. He gave up the central pawn, hoping to open his g2-bishop and recapture on d5 with his pawn. Also, White's knight is coming to f5, where it would be rather active. As we don't want to return the pawn, there is just one good move - 8..c6. Instead, 8. .Ne4 is also possible and is usually played by people who don't know theory, but leads to passive positions, so we would not make this move. }
8... c6 9. cxd5 Nxd5 10. Nf5 Nc7
{ Now Black intends to play d7-d5. That is why White has to play e2-e4: either right now, followed by Nc3, or he can start with Nc3, followed by e2-e4. The big beauty of this gambit from our perspective is that while the lines could look pretty long, they are rather forcing and White cannot really deviate, so it is barely possible for us to confuse anything. }
11. e4 d5 12. Nc3 Bf6
{ With this move, we prevent White from ever capturing our bishop. Now, the time has come for the first crossroads from White's pespective - he has two equally reasonable moves which we are going to analyze. }
13. Bf4 Nba6
{ Now 14. exd5 would tranpose to 13. exd5, but White has some independent ideas. For example, coming to d6 with the knight seems to be an attractive idea - at least, visually ! }
14. Nd6 Bc8
{ Now Black has a very strong threat which will be releaved if White is to waste a tempo. }
15. exd5 g5 { This is definitely a move to remember, now it gets very sharp. }
16. Nxc8 gxf4 17. d6 Rxc8 18. dxc7
{ Lets Black trade queens, that is why White includes the check on g4 - see the g2-g3 chapter. }
18... Qxd1 19. Raxd1 Rxc7
{ Black will be somewhat better as if White recaptures on f4, his structure will be ugly. Otherwise, what would he do? Also, our bishop on f6 is very powerful, while White's one on g2 is not really that dangerous. }

{ The fearsome Petrosian system. As many other opening variations named after the 9th World Champion, it carries a shadow of his positional style, aimed at the restriction of opponents' ideas, in the first place. This position is more commonly reached via the move order 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 !  (preventing ...Bb4)  Bb7 5. Nc3. I am analyzing it via a slightly different move order, so don't get confused - you can get it both ways. White's main idea is to stop ...Bb4, which pins the knight and makes it difficult for White to control the center. Later, his intentions will include d4-d5, which blocks the Black bishop on b7. This system, even though it doesn't look dangerous visually - how dangerous can the move a2-a3 be ?! - is, in my opinion, one of White's most dangerous weapons against Queen's Indian. Black has multiple sidelines, such as 5... g6, 5... Ne4 etc, but I don't think they give equality. However, if you are feeling adventurous, 5... g6 is definitely worth looking at. The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }
5... d5
{ Now White has many continuations, but it makes sense to concentrate on three main ones - 6. cxd5, 6. Bg5 and 6. Qc2. Other moves, such as 6. e3, are clearly innocuous. }
6. Bg5
{ Another logical move - White pins the knight and wants to keep the tension in the center for a while. }
6... Be7 7. e3
{ White has some other moves, like Qa4+ or Rc1, but the ideas will be very similar, and this is chapter is very-very large, I suggest that we don't overload ourselves with variations that don't need to be remembered precisely. }
7... O-O 8. Rc1 dxc4
{ This might seem to be a concession as we are helping White develop his bishop to c4 in one move, but to me this seems the easiest solution, as we are going to play ...Nbd7 and ...c7-c5 quickly. }
9. Bxc4 Nbd7 10. O-O c5
{ Black has achieved his goal - he developed comfortably and got rid of his only potential issue, the backward c7-pawn. }
11. Qe2 a6 { Planning ... b6-b5, which grabs space. } 12. a4
{ Otherwise ...b6-b5 simply gives Black the advantage. } 12... h6
{ Asking White where the bishop would go. } 13. Bh4
{ Now many approaches are possible - taking on d4 is good, playing ...Nh5 to trade the bishops is good, going ...Ne4 is fine. We, however, don't need more than one good plan, do we ? }
13... Nh5 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Rfd1 Nhf6
{ Black has a very powerful bishop that works well over the long-diagonal, his development is comfortable, too. The next moves can be ..♖fd8, followed by ...cxd4 at any moment when Black feels ready. The situation is pretty balanced and there is nothing we should be afraid of. }

This position is more commonly reached via the move order 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 !  (preventing ...Bb4)  Bb7 5. Nc3. I am analyzing it via a slightly different move order, so don't get confused - you can get it both ways. White's main idea is to stop ...Bb4, which pins the knight and makes it difficult for White to control the center. Later, his intentions will include d4-d5, which blocks the Black bishop on b7. This system, even though it doesn't look dangerous visually - how dangerous can the move a2-a3 be ?! - is, in my opinion, one of White's most dangerous weapons against Queen's Indian. Black has multiple sidelines, such as 5... g6, 5... Ne4 etc, but I don't think they give equality. However, if you are feeling adventurous, 5... g6 is definitely worth looking at. The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }
5... d5
{ Now White has many continuations, but it makes sense to concentrate on three main ones - 6. cxd5, 6. Bg5 and 6. Qc2. Other moves, such as 6. e3, are clearly innocuous. }
6. cxd5 { This is by all means the main move, and the most dangerous one. }
6... Nxd5
{ Now we arrive at another crossroads - besides 7. Qc2, 7. e3 is also very interesting - and perhaps, it is a more natural move, too, as White simply continues his development. }
7. Qc2
{ This move, aimed at the quick e2-e4, is considered to be White's most ambitious continuation - he is planning to get a full control over the center. }
7... Nxc3
{ This is a little subtlety. Here is the point: if Black simply developed with ...Be7, White could tranpose with e2-e4, but he could also go Bd2 !?, intending to later recapture on c3 with the bishop. There is no need to give White additional options, so we cut one of his ideas out by taking immediately. }
8. Qxc3
{ This is also a pretty interesting idea. White gives up on his plan related with e2-e4  (or it might have never been this specific player's plan !)  and instead he hopes to simply develop and play some roughly equal position. One of the things he can possibly hope to exploit and benefit from is our pawn on c7, which is a slightly weak and backward pawn. However, soon we will be able to play ...c7-c5, which will easily equalize the game. }
8... h6 { Stopping any Bg5 ideas. } 9. Bf4 Bd6
{ Now, White has several possibilities. It is important to look at a new structure that arises if White takes on d6. Besides that, other moves - such as 10. Bg3, don't pose any problems - we can continue in the same way as in many other similar lines. There is also an idea to go 10. Ne5, stopping the trade for now. This might result in another interesting structure, which however is rather dangerous for White. }
10. Bg3
{ White refrains from the trade, inviting Black to instead take on g3 himself. If Black does that, White gets a semi-open h-file for his rook and Black still keeps the slightly backward c7-pawn, he doesn't get to improve his structure, unlike in the variation when White takes on d6 himself. As I said earlier, the latter factor is not a problem as we can always play ...Nd7 and ...c7-c5, getting rid of the potentially weak pawn. It doesn't make sense for us to capture on g3 immediately, but we can definitely do that later. To begin with, we will just make a few developing moves, checking what White will do. }
10... O-O 11. e3 Nd7
{ This is how all the GM games, and games of the strong players overall, continued. Now, Bb5 has been the main move. Its goal is to put pressure on the d7-knight, thus making it more difficult for Black to achieve the ...c7-c5 break. However, as we will see, Black still gets to play this move without much trouble. White tried other moves as well, but I don't see how they can pose any problems. }
12. Be2
{ White can develop more passively, too. If you want to keep a bit more tension, I can recommend ...Nf6 followed by ...Ne4. However, I think another that another clear-cut route to equality can be reached in a simple way - again, we trade on g3 and go ...c7-c5. Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it ? }
12... Bxg3 13. hxg3 c5 14. O-O cxd4 15. Qxd4 Nf6
{ And Black reaches a perfectly safe, symmetrical position. In fact, I'm really loving our b7-bishop and I think it's quite possible to outplay the opponent, as there are still many ideas available that we can try out. }

11. e3
{ Now that White can quickly play Bb5, it is not desirable to take on e5 - we would need to spend the time retreating with the bishop, and White will quickly develop a strong initiative. However, this capture remains our strategic idea, so we prepare it by castling. }
11... O-O 12. Nc6
{ This seems to be a logical move, which makes use of the c6-square. However, no one had played this yet, which is surprising. We don't take, as White will get an edge, instead we get ready to kick this knight out soon. }

But, it's also possible to keep the queens on the board.   18...Qc6  This is another possibility, but as I show in the actual chapter, I like the trade on c3 even better. This move, however, keeps the position more complicated and is also perfectly playable.   18...Ne5  Is also possible, setting a fun trap.  19.Nc7 ??  Qc6  And White loses on the spot. }
19. Nxc3 Nf6
{ Black has an extra pawn on the queenside, which is very beneficial in the endgames, as it is easy to create a passed pawn. White's pawn majority in the center is definitely useful for grabbing space, but it is hard for him to create a passer. Black's next moves should be aimed at taking the d-file under control as well as at centralizing his king, so ...Rfd8  (the a8-rook can go somewhere else or stay on a8 for a while so that the a7-pawn never hangs)  and ...f8-e7 should be Black's next moves. The position is roughly equal. }

This circumstance makes it extremely easy for us to master the variation from Black's perspective, I believe. }
10... c5 11. O-O
{ Now that we have castled, it is time to think where the queenside pieces should go. Here two moves - ...Qc8 and ...Qc7 are equally popular. The first idea is pretty reasonable as well - the point is to trade the bishops with ...Ba6. Why is it good to trade ? Because White has more space, so each trade makes his space advantage less valuable. However, I think that the queen is placed more naturally on c7, as it doesn't prevent the rooks from getting developed easily. }
11... Qc7 12. Qe2

12... Rd8
{ I would like to explain the reasoning behind this move, especially because this move is way less popular than ...Nd7 and ...Nc6. In fact, it is pretty simple - I don't want to show our intentions yet regarding where the knight would go. For example, if it goes to d7 too early, White may try ideas like a4-a5, which is not possible with the knight on c6. Or, instead, if the knight goes to c6, the bishop on b7 would be obstructed and we would not be able to make use of the c-file. So I prefer to see what White does first, and only then I would develop my knight. At this point, we are at a crossroads, as White mostly goes Bb2, but sometimes he prefers Rd1 or Re1, not defining the position of his bishop yet.

But do go over the lines carefully to grasp all the ideas and explanations ! }
13. Rd1 Nd7
{ White is just getting his pieces in the game and we reply with the same thing. Now a lot of moves were tried, but I think there are just a few logical ideas - to either push a4-a5 to generate some queenside activity, or to play e4-e5, hoping for a kingside attack. }
14. a4 Rac8 { Black need not fear the a5-push, as we will see. } 15. g3

16. Bf4 Bd6 17. Bxd6 Qxd6
{ Black is about to take on d4 and go ...Rc3, using the open file. It is very important to bear in mind that the center is mostly useful when a lot of pieces are still on the board, so that opponents' pieces have very few squares and very little mobility. Here, instead, two pairs of pieces have been traded and White's center is more of a liability and concern. The structure is very typical of another opening - Semi-Tarrasch, which is one of the most popular top-level openings nowadays, so if you want to get a better feel for it, check some games in that opening, too ! For example, you can study Kramnik's games - not just because of opening or structure, but because most of his games are so deep and interesting. }

19. cxd4 Rc3 { Black acts according to the plan, he activates his rook. } 20.
axb6 axb6
{ think Black is completely fine, as White's center is under quite a bit of pressure. Of course, we have a slight weakness on b6, but attacking it would never be an easy task as White has to protect the e4-pawn and watch out for some possible surprises over the h1-a8 diagonal, which was weakened by g2-g3. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. e3
{ This is a very solid variation for White and a more dangerous one than it might seem right now after he makes his timid-looking 4th move. White simply intends to develop with Bd3, Nc3. Then, depending on what we do, he might try to push e3-e4, or possibly d4-d5, shutting down the Black bishop on b7. Positions with IQP are very typical of this variation, as often Black plays ...c7-c5 followed by ...cxd4, ...d7-d5. These positions happen to be rather interesting and double-edged, both sides definitely have a lot of chances. Possibly, typical structures after ...d7-d5 followed by c4xd5 exd5 can occur, which can also result in an IQP or hanging pawns. At the same time, White might choose the more timid approach, related with Bd3, b2-b3, Bb2, Nbd2 or something like this. The good news about this line is that we would barely ever need to memorize precise sequences of moves. Instead, understanding of typical maneuvres is what would prove crucial for having good results in these positions. Let us dive in ! }
4... e6
{ The most normal move. This position may also occur via 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3, for example. By the way, in this specific move order 4... g6 also looks pretty interesting and unexplored, this is an alternative possibility you might want to investigate yourself at some point. }
5. Bd3 d5
{ This is the first important detail to remember, in my opinion. Why is it so important to start with d7-d5 ? The reason is simple: we want to develop our bishop to the better square on d6, as opposed to the more passive position on e7. This will especially matter if White chooses to take on d5.  Now White faces an important choice - whether to trade on d5, or to just continue developing - he can castle, play Nc3, whatever. This may transpose, as White can decide to take later on, but it may also not - for example, if Black chooses to trade on c4 quickly. }
6. O-O
{ I don't think Black has any problems after the popular moves ...Bd6 or ...Nbd7. However, I prefer the more straightforward approach, which releases the tension in the center and does not allow White to wait infinitely and then take on d5 at the moment of his choosing. }
6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 a6
{ The positions somewhat remind of Queen's Gambit Accepted. Black's idea now will be to combine development of his kingside  (...Be7, ...O-O)  as well as expansion on the quenside by means of ...b6-b5, ...c7-c5. A few structures may occur here: White might invite some symmetrical structure - say, when Black plays c5, White will take on c5. Normally symmetrical positions are not extremely complex from the strategical perspective, what matters most is how pieces are placed, so we will make sure we get this structure under the right circumstances. Another thing White can do, which is more ambitious, is to try and gain some space in the center by preparing the e3-e4 push. Then the pawn will either stay on e4, just controlling a lot of space, or will go to e5 - White will weaken some squares, but will seize even more space on the kingside and will try to benefit from that spacial advantage to create attacking chances. As we will see, however, the last plan is not something easy to execute, as Black's counterplay comes very fast. }
8. Qe2
{ This has been the main move - White prepares the move Rd1. The rook will try to be quite annoying there as it creates an x-ray on our queen. However, as long as we are careful, it is not a problem. }
8... Nbd7 9. Rd1 c5
{ Now White faces a choice - whether to allow for ...b6-b5 at any moment when Black chooses to carry out this move, or stop it forever with a2-a4. }
10. Nc3
{ This is a normal developing move. However, now we use an opportunity to gain space on the queenside while also attacking the White pieces with tempi. }
10... b5 11. Bb3 Qc7
{ We would simply like to play ...Be7 and castle, then we can continue with ...Rfd8, ...Rac8, for example. White should not play passively here, as then we get to execute our plan very easily. That is why the two principled moves for him are 12. e4 as well as 12. d5. }
12. e4 { This is the better plan than d4-d5. } 12... cxd4 13. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Black simply continues his development. } 14. Be3 O-O
{ Now we reach some pretty balanced situation. White has more space thanks to the e4-pawn, this pawn somewhat restricts our pieces - namely, the knight on f6 and the bishop on b7. However, Black has a lot of good squares for his pieces on the queenside, thanks to the spatial advantage provided by the b5-pawn. For example, the queen has a nice comfortable spot on b6. The Black knight can go to e5 and then to c4 at some point if this is possible, or to c6 in order to trade the White d4-knight. Now I would just give a few more natural moves for both sides which would demonstrate how these ideas are applied in practice. }
15. f3
{ White protects the e4-pawn one more time, making sure no nasty surprises ever happen to him. }
15... Rfd8 { Black simply activates the rook. } 16. Qf2
{ Taking the g1-a7 diagonal under additional control. } 16... Qb6 17. Rac1 Ne5
18. Nf5 { Forcing the trade in this curious way. } 18... Bxe3 19. Qxe3 Qxe3+
20. Nxe3 g5
{ The last important move. Now we have an endgame on the board, where White could hope to eventually advance with f3-f4, e4-e5. This would be quite an uncomfortable situation for Black who would need to retreat and drive his pieces back to passive positions. With the precise ...g7-g5! move, however, we prevent this plan, while preparing to gain even more space ourselves - say, eventually, we can go for ...h7-h5, maybe ...♘g6-f4. The position is pretty balanced and complicated enough for both sides to have reasonable ambitions to play for a win. Our next moves can include ...♔f8-Ke7, centralizing the king and taking the d8-square under more control. Then the aforementioned play on the kingside might be something for us to consider. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. e3
{ This is a very solid variation for White and a more dangerous one than it might seem right now after he makes his timid-looking 4th move. White simply intends to develop with Bd3, Nc3. Then, depending on what we do, he might try to push e3-e4, or possibly d4-d5, shutting down the Black bishop on b7. Positions with IQP are very typical of this variation, as often Black plays ...c7-c5 followed by ...cxd4, ...d7-d5. These positions happen to be rather interesting and double-edged, both sides definitely have a lot of chances. Possibly, typical structures after ...d7-d5 followed by c4xd5 exd5 can occur, which can also result in an IQP or hanging pawns. At the same time, White might choose the more timid approach, related with Bd3, b2-b3, Bb2, Nbd2 or something like this. The good news about this line is that we would barely ever need to memorize precise sequences of moves. Instead, understanding of typical maneuvres is what would prove crucial for having good results in these positions. Let us dive in ! }
4... e6
{ The most normal move. This position may also occur via 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3, for example. By the way, in this specific move order 4... g6 also looks pretty interesting and unexplored, this is an alternative possibility you might want to investigate yourself at some point. }
5. Bd3 d5
{ This is the first important detail to remember, in my opinion. Why is it so important to start with d7-d5 ? The reason is simple: we want to develop our bishop to the better square on d6, as opposed to the more passive position on e7. This will especially matter if White chooses to take on d5.  Now White faces an important choice - whether to trade on d5, or to just continue developing - he can castle, play Nc3, whatever. This may transpose, as White can decide to take later on, but it may also not - for example, if Black chooses to trade on c4 quickly. }
6. O-O
{ I don't think Black has any problems after the popular moves ...Bd6 or ...Nbd7. However, I prefer the more straightforward approach, which releases the tension in the center and does not allow White to wait infinitely and then take on d5 at the moment of his choosing. }
6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 a6
{ The positions somewhat remind of Queen's Gambit Accepted. Black's idea now will be to combine development of his kingside  (...Be7, ...O-O)  as well as expansion on the quenside by means of ...b6-b5, ...c7-c5. A few structures may occur here: White might invite some symmetrical structure - say, when Black plays c5, White will take on c5. Normally symmetrical positions are not extremely complex from the strategical perspective, what matters most is how pieces are placed, so we will make sure we get this structure under the right circumstances. Another thing White can do, which is more ambitious, is to try and gain some space in the center by preparing the e3-e4 push. Then the pawn will either stay on e4, just controlling a lot of space, or will go to e5 - White will weaken some squares, but will seize even more space on the kingside and will try to benefit from that spacial advantage to create attacking chances. As we will see, however, the last plan is not something easy to execute, as Black's counterplay comes very fast. }
8. Nc3
{ If White simply develops, nothing stops us from carrying out the typical pawn advance on the queenside: ...b6-b5 followed by ...c7-c5. }
8... b5 9. Bb3 c5
{ White does not have many attractive options:Qe2 would steer the game into something very similar to 8. Qe2, while other moves, such as 10. h3 or 10. a3 don't make sense. However, White has an interesting idea here, which is, while not dangerous, tricky - I would like you to know the right reaction. }
10. e4
{ There is nothing dangerous about this move, but it is neccessary to know that the pawn should not be taken. }
10... cxd4
{ This calm move is the right solution. Black is about to trade down quite a lot of pieces, which would ensure him of a completely safe position. }
11. Nxd4 Nc6
{ Let us see a sample line. White can try different moves - Be3 or Nxc6, but there is no need to analyze each variation very deeply as we already know the ideas in this structure well, and there is no specific details to be worried about. }
12. Nxc6 Qxd1 13. Rxd1 Bxc6 14. f3 Bc5+ 15. Kf1 Ke7
{ Black is about to continue with ...Rhd8 with a completely equal position. The rooks will likely be all traded down the d-file. Later, we can try to make use of our space advantage on the queenside. Another idea might be to grab some space on the kingside with ... g7-g5  (of course, if this pawn is not hanging on g5 - now the bishop is on c1, so we cannot play this instantly)  , ...h7-h5, ...Nd7-e5. }

6... exd5 7. O-O Bd6 8. Nc3
{ This is White's most common choice. He gives up the idea of b3-Ba3 for the sake of simple and logical development and keeps many options open. }
8... O-O 9. b3 a6 10. Bb2 Nbd7
{ Black's typical moves now will be ...Qe7, ...Re8. An interesting nuance here is that sometimes White can play Bf5 to put additional pressure on Black, especially on the d7-knight. This can be very important when our pawn is on c5 and when there is tension in the center. That is why a move you might want to spend a tempo on is ...g7-g6, as it prevents White's idea of Bf5. There is no need to do it right now, but in a few moves this can be a helpful idea to carry out. }
11. Rc1 Qe7 12. Ne2
{ The knight is going to g3 and then to f5, or it can go to f4 to attack the d5-pawn. Also, White opens up the rook on c1, intending to possibly double up. Something you need to be very careful about is such ideas as Rc2 followed by Qc1, as then the exchange sacrifice Rxc7 ! might follow. Sometimes, such sacrifice simply destroys our whole queenside. So please make sure you evaluate its consequences if you choose to allow it, or you simply go ...Rc8 or ...c5 to stop it. }
12... Ne4
{ White tried about 10 different moves here - of course, we would not study them all. There is just one important thing to understand, I think: you can choose the plan with . ..c7-c5, but then your pawn should stay on g7. Instead, if you ever go ... g7-g6, playing ...c7-c5 is a dangerous idea, as dxc5 ! might follow, opening up the weakened long diagonal. If your pawn is already on g6, you can stick to such plans as ...f7-f5. This can also be combined with the idea I had mentioned before- ...a7-a5-a4, putting pressure over the a-file. Let us look at some sample moves. }
13. Qc2
{ What is White's idea ? Let us make some passive useless move to see the whole point. }
13... Rac8
{ As you know from the line with 13... h6, White is attacking c7. So Black defends it. }
14. Ng3 f5 { Defending the knight on e4. } 15. Qe2
{ The a6-pawn is hanging, so White maneuvres, attacks the pawn and intends to place his pieces differently. }
15... Ra8 16. Rc2
{ Another point of playing Qe2 is that this square is vacant now. So White doubles up, preparing Rfc1. }
16... g6 17. Rfc1 c6
{ I think this is the most solid choice. A very strong Ukrainian GM, who is a big Queen's Indian expert, played 17... c5, which is good, but somewhat scary as the long diagonal may dangerously open up. I think we can stophere - the position is definitely very nice here for Black. As I had said before, he can either concentrate on the kingside attack or play more solid with ...a6-a5-a4. It is also important to know that the exchange sacrifice mentioned above  (Rxc7 or Rxc6)  makes no sense here, as White would need to invade c7 with his queen to create threats and justify it. The rook on c6, instead, would be absolutely useless - White would just end up an exchange down. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. Bf4 e6
{ This system was introduced by the great Anthony Miles, who won several amazing games with it. While Black definitely has a few good ways of handling the position, it is important to understand that there is still quite some poison in White's setup and a few traps that we need to know and avoid. }
5. e3 Bb4+
{ I like this move the most: of course, it was possible to go Be7, which is another main line, but to give a check seems extremely natural because White just played Bf4 and e2-e3, which means his bishop cannot return and help White unpin. }
6. Nbd2
{ This interesting possibility seems to be the most natural move in the position. Unfortunately, it is difficult for the knight on d2 to control the center - for example, the square on d5. Thus, even if White would force our bishop away by a2-a3, losing a tempo would be well worth the concession we provoked, as White's knight is rather passive on d2. }
6... O-O 7. h3

14. Nc3 Nxc3 15. Qxc3 Nd7
{ Now we reach a slightly unusual situation, let's look at the position carefully. White has a pair of bishops and a target on d6, so it might appear as though he is better. However, if we look closely, we will see that the h2-bishop is nearly useless; it is easy to defend the d6 pawn; most importantly, White's kingside is absolutely ignored and undeveloped, and Black's b7-bishop makes it really difficult for White to develop his pieces! Our active ideas might include either ...a6-a5-a4, ...♘c5-Nb3, or a different type of play, like ...♖c8, ...b6-b5. In either case, we should be doing good because White has plenty of developmental issues. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. Qc2
{ This is definitely the critical test of our repertoire. White tries to quickly seize the center with e2-e4, which is especially reasonable as Black cannot put pressure on the White knight on c3 with Bb4, for example, as our pawn is still on e7. However, I believe that there is a way for Black to get a good, playable position with decent counterchances if he develops in the right way. Actually, top-players have tried many different moves in this very position as well as later, so there might be more than one good path, but I chose my suggestion, most importantly, because it is universal and works after any move order that White can try. }
4... d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nf3 e6
{ Just as in many modern openings, such as Gruenfeld and Semi-Tarrasch, Black lets White seize the center, hoping to later counterattack it. }

Nxc3 8. bxc3 Be7
{ Now, to my big surprise, it turned out that 9. Bb5+ was played for 71 times here, while 9. Bd3 was chosen for 20 times only. However, the moves simply transpose into each other very soon. Basically, the point of giving the check on b5 is trying to provoke c7-c6, which would make the b7-bishop inactive. However, then Black can play c6-c5, and the bishop would get active again ! So you should not worry about this too much. I would rather cover the main line via the order with 9. Bd3 as this move seems more logical to me. Instead, 9. Ba4 will be used as a deviation if White does not want to return to our main variation by retreating back to d3 with his bishop. }
9. Bb5+ c6
{ Now 10. Bd3, which was chosen universally, after 10... c5 transposes to the variation with 9. Bd3 c5. Here we will instead cover White's alternatives - Ba4 and Be2. Both moves do not look particularly dangerous or smart to me, but it is important to make sure we do cover them anyway. }

13. Be3 Nd7
{ We continue in the same fashion. It is also possible to develop the knight on c6, especially when the White bishop is not on b2, but I like it on d7: it keeps our b7-bishop active, it does not ever get hit by d4-d5, and can at some point come to f6 to attack the e4-pawn even more. }
14. Rac1 Rc8 15. Qd3 Nf6
{ Forcing White to defend with some ♘d2. Black's position is apparently easier to handle by this point. Again, I cannot think of a single reason, why White would like to have his bishop on e2 instead of d3. But, we needed to cover this option to be sure that our position is alright in this case, too. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. f3
{ This is a 'brother' of 3. f3, this move also happens to be rather decent. However, thanks to the presence of the white knight on c3, Black is able to generate counterplay more easily by swapping this knight, moving the white pawn from b2 to c3, and later attacking the white center with c7-c5. Let us see, how the game can develop. }
4... d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ So far things have been more or less forced - White always takes on d5. Now, however, he already has a choice. Here I have managed to easily neutralize the main continuation that White usually goes for. However, as I was exploring the alternatives, I realized White has a more dangerous idea at his disposal - he can play 6. Nxd5 !, preventing Black from taking on c3. This keeps White with the more solid center, and makes it more difficult for us to challenge his center. However, we still manage to generate sufficient counterplay, I believe. }
6. Nxd5
{ This is a rather dangerous move, even though in my opinion it is not an obvious continuation. In order to make such a move, White needs to understand the nuances of the structure when his pawn is on c3 very well, and he needs to realize that having this visually powerful and beautiful center is not neccessarily a good thing. }
6... Qxd5 7. e4
{ White takes the center. Now, we would again first concentrate on development. After some logical developing moves for both sides, we would start attacking the White center. }
7... Qd7 8. Be3 e6
{ Again White faces the same problem. The pawn on f3 is a nice asset which makes White's center better protected. However, this pawn makes it really difficult for White to develop his kingside pieces ! That is why the bishop needs to get developed first, then the white knight goes to e2. }
9. Bc4 c5
{ We are fully ready to make this move, there is no need to wait. However, the developing Be7 is possible, too. Now, White has a choice - whether to just continue developing with Ne2, or to spoil our structure by taking on c5. Instead, trying to push d4-d5 quickly is bad, as we will see in the variations: White is simply not ready and cannot justify such active play. }

12. Bxc5 Nxc5
{ Black can now take with the knight - he does not have any difficulties whatsoever, obviously. Let us evaluate such a position and understand what the ideas are. White had played f3-e4 - these pawns ensure him of spacial advantage. However, we have light-squared bishops on the board, which means that placing the pawns on the light squares can result in having a pretty bad bishop; it also weakens the dark squares - for example, d4 could be a great outpost for the black knight now. Objectively, I think, the position should be roughly balanced, but it is definitely possible to outplay the opponent from here. Let us make a few more logical moves }
13. Ne2 Ke7
{ There is no need to castle - at least short ! - as the king is perfectly safe in the center. It would be much easier to activate and centralize it from e7 rather than from g8. However, it was possible and not bad at all to castle long, too. }
14. Kf2 Rhd8 15. Ke3
{ Just as Rac1, for instance, this logical move keeps equality. White just has to watch out for this Na4-Nb2 idea. }
15... Rac8 16. Rac1 e5
{ Placing the pawn on the dark square, fixing White's pawns on the light squares, as well as ensuring us of always having the d4-outpost. The position is equal, but in practical play, Black is for a slight choice. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. f3
{ This is a 'brother' of 3. f3, this move also happens to be rather decent. However, thanks to the presence of the white knight on c3, Black is able to generate counterplay more easily by swapping this knight, moving the white pawn from b2 to c3, and later attacking the white center with c7-c5. Let us see, how the game can develop. }
4... d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ So far things have been more or less forced - White always takes on d5. Now, however, he already has a choice. Here I have managed to easily neutralize the main continuation that White usually goes for. However, as I was exploring the alternatives, I realized White has a more dangerous idea at his disposal - he can play 6. Nxd5 !, preventing Black from taking on c3. This keeps White with the more solid center, and makes it more difficult for us to challenge his center. However, we still manage to generate sufficient counterplay, I believe. }
6. Nxd5
{ This is a rather dangerous move, even though in my opinion it is not an obvious continuation. In order to make such a move, White needs to understand the nuances of the structure when his pawn is on c3 very well, and he needs to realize that having this visually powerful and beautiful center is not neccessarily a good thing. }
6... Qxd5 7. e4
{ White takes the center. Now, we would again first concentrate on development. After some logical developing moves for both sides, we would start attacking the White center. }
7... Qd7 8. Be3 e6
{ Again White faces the same problem. The pawn on f3 is a nice asset which makes White's center better protected. However, this pawn makes it really difficult for White to develop his kingside pieces ! That is why the bishop needs to get developed first, then the white knight goes to e2. }
9. Bc4 c5
{ We are fully ready to make this move, there is no need to wait. However, the developing Be7 is possible, too. Now, White has a choice - whether to just continue developing with Ne2, or to spoil our structure by taking on c5. Instead, trying to push d4-d5 quickly is bad, as we will see in the variations: White is simply not ready and cannot justify such active play. }
10. dxc5
{ White hurries to release the tension, hoping to exploit the isolated pawn on c5 that Black will now get. }
10... Bxc5 11. Bxc5 bxc5 12. Qxd7+ Nxd7
{ Let us stop here and look at the position. Of course, we now have three pawn islands as opposed to White's two - if that is not compensated by any activity, this is definitely a downside. However, Black can develop pretty fast: his king will go to e7, the knight will come to b6 or to e5. We have a semi-open b-file to create counterplay on: we can easily attack the b2-pawn. If White ever goes b2-b3, the typical plan would be a7-a5-a4, which would also create some pawn weaknesses for White and open up some files on the queenside. Importantly, White's pieces also are not placed well to attack the pawn: for example, his knight is far from d3 or b3, he cannot easily double on the c-file. Based on all these factors, we can definitely conclude Black should have a good position here. However, now we need to prove it with moves ! }
13. Ne2 Ke7 14. Kf2 Ne5 { We are first to create threats ! } 15. Bb3
{ Allows for a nasty check, now Black gets very active. } 15... Nd3+ 16. Ke3
Rhd8
{ Placing the pawn on the dark square, fixing White's pawns on the light squares, as well as ensuring us of always having the d4-outpost. The position is equal, but in practical play, Black is for a slight choice. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. f3
{ This is the most testing and challenging answer to our repertoire. Basically, it was only after finding a good reaction to this move that I realized I could make the whole repertoire work for Black. White's move is very straightforward - he simply intends to seize the whole center with e2-e4. Now, it is not so clear what Black should do. Actually, many superGMs tried several moves, such as 3... e6 or 3... Bb7, but 3... Nc6 is definitely the main move and the best one. Black prepares the e7-e5 break, that is why he needs to develop the knight on a slightly weird square. }
3... Nc6
{ Now White has several possible continuations. I believe that 4. Nc3, which is the main move, is the best option at White's disposal. However, two other moves - 4. d5 as well as 4. e4 - also lead to a highly interesting and complicated game, so they should also be checked carefully. }
4. d5
{ The second most popular continuation. Chasing the knight with a tempo while also gaining space seems like a good idea, doesn't it ? However, things are not so simple. As White pushes d4-d5, he weakens squares - for example, now the black bishop can come to c5, taking the weak g1-a7 diagonal under control and preventing White from castling. }
4... Ne5 5. e4 e6 6. Nc3 Bc5
{ These all were very natural moves. Actually, some really strong players have essayed other possiblities besides 6. ..Bc5, but to me it looks very natural to try and exploit the weak diagonal, that is why I choose this move. Now it is important to stop and think: if you were White, how would you develop and what would you do with your king ? In this regard, the plan Nh3-Nf2 looks very logical as it prepares castling. }
7. Nh3 O-O 8. Be2 Re8
{ Let us think about this position. Strategically, White is undoubtedly better as he has much more space. However, he is behind in development, so our task is to benefit from this fact. How will we do this ? Obviously, by opening the position up. ...Re8 is a move that will definitely prove useful as the center and the e-file specifically will inevitably open up very soon. }
9. f4
{ Another logical move, this is definitely the most ambitious attempt that White can go for. Now I came up with some really-really beautiful idea that I would love to introduce to you. }
9... Ng6 10. e5
{ White goes for it. However, if he doesn't, then playing f3-f4 a move earlier made no sense. }
10... exd5 11. cxd5 Bb7
{ Actually, Black could instead go Nh4, but as sacrificing a piece is good, I prefer to insist on the sacrifice. Now White has a choice - either to accept the sacrifice, or try to castle by playing Nf2. }
12. Nf2 Nxd5
{ Black has no intention of playing it safe. The massacre will arise on the board ! }
13. Nxd5 d6
{ Simply threatening to take on e5. Once we do, opponent's knight will hang. If he retreats, the f4-pawn will be hanging, too. }
14. O-O dxe5 15. Nc3 exf4 16. Qxd8 Raxd8
{ Black has three pawns for a piece, which are so powerful, that the White pieces are stuck on the first ranks and cannot get out. For example, look at the c1-bishop: how is White ever going to develop it? We can put even more pressure on White's position with such moves as ...♗d4, ...c7-c5. If the White bishop quits the f1-a6 diagonal, ...♗a6 will come handy as an improving move. White's position is disastrous. }

Qxf6
{ Black is very well coordinated and is ready to create more threats with ...Ba6, ...Re7 followed by ...Rae8, with ...Nh4 or ...Qh4+. White has to walk on a very thin line to survive. I will just give the best line for him, which saves his position - other moves are possible, but we cannot analyze 5-10 deviations on each move, so I would just reassure you that if he goes wrong, we will be nearly winning immediately. }
13. Nf2 Nxf4
{ We already have two pawns for a piece, so there is not much to worry about. Now the threat is ...Nxe2 followed by ...Ba6, winning a piece back. So White has no choice but to take. }
14. Bxf4 Bxf2+ 15. Kxf2 Qxf4+ 16. Bf3 Qe3+ { Now we simply force a perpetual. }
17. Kg3 Qg5+ 18. Kf2 Qe3+
{ In my opinion, this is a very flashy and exciting line. Both sides have be to accurate and careful, but in my opinion, it is much more enjoyable to be Black who is attacking and having all the fun, while being just a pawn down at most, techincally speaking  (he usually has two pawns for a piece)  . White can maintain the balance, but he has to be extremely precise, and usually defending is much more difficult than attacking. I feel that our play and all the moves that Black makes in this line are very natural and intuitive, so handling this variation should not be too difficult a task. }

{ The most critical continuation - White takes all the space he can, while not allowing for ...Nd4. }
5... Ne7 6. e4 Ng6 7. Be3
{ Now we reach a very interesting situation. To be honest, the whole idea of me creating this course was based on the question whether I would be able to find a good setup for Black here or not. The statistics might look fine for Black, but the position is very tricky - the position is pretty closed now, and White's spacial advantage might become a rather problematic thing for us unless we find some precise moves and clear plan how to develop our pieces and what to do. }
7... Bc5
{ Black immediately starts fighting for a very important diagonal. Now, in most games White chose to keep the tension with 8. Qd2. Sometimes, however, he chose to take on c5 - I do not have much faith in this move, but we will analyze it anyway, of course. The issue with taking is that Black now gets an open b-file, which is a clear improvement of his position }

{ White has several possibilities, but let us make a few logical moves that were made in most games that reached this position. }
10. Bd3 O-O 11. O-O-O
{ Castling long looks a bit suspicious when the opponent has an open b-file, but it is not so easy for Black to generate a lot of play there and to get a lot of pieces on the queenside. White dreams of playing something like h4-h5 or g3-f4, getting activity on the kingside. }
11... Rb8 12. Nge2
{ Here I have spent a significant amount of time to eventually come up with an interesting novelty. The only game that reached this position saw 12... c6, but this is not a good move. The right plan would be to prepare ...f7-f5. We could go ...Ne8 immediately, but it makes even more sense to first insert a nasty move, creating a threat. }
12... Nh4 { Attacking g2 and getting to control f5 with more pieces. } 13. Ng3
Ne8
{ ...f7-f5 is coming. The knight on h4 is surprisingly very well-placed. It would most likely get traded for the White pieces once we achieve ...f7-f5. If White would not take it on f5, it would come to d4 to become the strongest piece in the position, instead. We definitely have a lot of counterchances here. }

However, please, don't be concerned: only about 55 games reached the position after 6 moves, and 7. Be3 was chosen in 40 games, while 7. Nge2 ! was played in 8 games only. Eight games only in the entire history of chess, so I would not be concerned at all. In this position, I will analyze a few continuations for Black, and will show what are our traps, ideas and plans. While I think that with extremely precise play White can keep some advantage in these lines, he needs to play rather creatively and be alert to avoid our traps. Also, I believe, in the final position of the main variation, any sane player would much rather be Black, even if the computer believes that White can survive our attack. Thus, and also because this position is so rare, I would not be concerned at all. }
7... Bc5 8. h4
{ This was suggested by Boris Avrukh in his 1. d4 ! repertoire book. I agree that this is the best possibility at White's disposal. White is clearly wanting to push the pawn farher - to h5 with a tempo and then to h6. At this point, we have three reasonable continuations. We will analyze them all, so you can choose the type of position that you like best. It is important to know that Avrukh considers only 7... h6 and doesn't analyze other possibilities, which means any opponent, even the best-prepared one, will already be out of book by this point. Besides that, I would like to mention that White doesn't have many sensible moves, as the knight on e2 prevents him from developing his kingside pieces, while the c1-bishop cannot go to e3 anymore. Moving it to g5, on the other hand, does not make much sense as ...h7-h6 will always come handy. }
8... h6
{ This is the only continuation considered by Avrukh. The idea is to allow h4-h5 but stop h5-h6 ! Visually, White gets a very pleasant position. However, just as any KID-type position, this position is very resilient and hard to break. Let's take a look at what happens after a few natural moves. }

My engine at a huge depth keeps showing +0.3, but I think Black's play is extremely easy, while any single mistake by White will immediately lose the game or put him on the verge of the loss.

{ Now White has two moves - 7. Nfd2 or 7. Ng5, but the key question is this one: is White going to recapture the pawn with the knight or with the d3-pawn ? If White takes back with the knight, he would get a well-known pawn structure where he is simply worse, so taking with the pawn is the only reasonable strategic decision. However, it feels all these operations don't yield all that much, but cost a lot of time. More time than White should be spending here. }
7. Ng5 h6
{ The safest and simplest continuation. I would mention a very ambitious alternative 7... Nc6, which might be connected with ideas like ...h7-h5-h4, ...Qd7 followed by ...O-O-O etc. Feel free to investigate it ! }
8. Nxe4 Nxe4 9. dxe4 Qxd1 10. Rxd1 Nd7
{ Again, Black's setup is very harmonious, while White's bishop on g2 is far from being impressive, his pawn on e4 isn't too helpful, either. I would suggest that you attentively study several next moves of this lovely game where Black outplayed his opponent in a rather instructive way. }
11. a4
{ White is trying to get activity over the a-file, which Black could prevent with ...a7-a5, or ignore, like he did in the game. }
11... O-O-O 12. a5 Bc5
{ If instead 13.c3  (idea b2-b4)  then the d3-square is critically weakened: 13...Ne5 -+ }
13. Nc3 Ne5
{ On the one hand, Black is challenging White over the only open d-file, and at the same time he is about to create some direct threats with ...Ng4. Of course, he is much better at this point. }
14. axb6 axb6 15. h3 Nc6
{ The knight cannot come to g4 anymore, so it changes the route. Now d4 and b4 are the targets. }
16. Bd2 Rd7 { Black is calmly improving his position, planning to double up. }
17. Be1 Nd4 18. Rd2 Rhd8
{ Surprisingly, this is already simply lost for White, as ...Nf3 is the decisive threat. }
19. Kf1 Nb3 { Tactics serve strategic goals. } 20. Rxd7 Nxa1
{ If instead 21.Rxf7 then 21...Ba6+ 22.Kg1 Nxc2 23.Bf1 Bb7 winning a piece. }
21. Rxd8+ Kxd8
{ And Black soon won the c2-pawn and the game. A very impressive positional achievement !: 0-1  (52)  Sundararajan,K  (2458)  -Quesada Perez,Y  (2636)  Rockville 2013 }

Re1, when White tries to keep the pawn on d2 for a while, and KIA, which is characterized by a setup with White pawns on d3 and e4. The first option is rather challenging theoretically, even though we have a firm road to a safe position, while the second one is known to lead to numerous equal position where everything comes to the understanding of typical plans as opposed to the concrete knowledge. }
1... Nf6 2. g3
{ We will analyze only King's Indian Attack via this move order, even though obviously White can play c2-c4 later and tranpose to positions discussed via the move order with 2. c4. }
2... b6 3. Bg2 Bb7 4. O-O e6
{ Now 5. d4 or 5. c4 would tranpose to the positions studied either elsewhere in this chapter, or elsewhere in the repertoire, so let's concentrate on 5. d3 followed by e2-e4. }
5. d3 d5
{ Here the main move is, of course, 6. Nbd2, but White can play e2-e4 immediately, too. }
6. Nbd2 { This is the much better move - it calmly prepares e2-e4. } 6... c5 7.
e4 Be7
{ Now, White has a few choices. The main question is whether to close the center immediately with e4-e5, or whether to go Re1 first to see what Black does. To be honest, it doesn't make much of a difference as White will have to play Re1 anyway at some point to protect the e5-pawn and to liberate the f1-square for his knight. }
8. Re1 Nc6 9. c3 O-O 10. e5 Nd7 11. Nf1
{ This is White's typical plan, he wants to go h2-h4-h5, N1h2-g4, try to bring the queen to the kingside and eventually deliver some decisive sacrifice. However, I believe we are fast enough with our queenside counterplay to prevent this from happening. }
11... b5
{ Starting to advance the queenside pawns to grab space and to open up the position there. }
12. h4 a5 13. Bf4
{ A normal developing move, White also protects his e5-pawn one more time. }
13... b4 14. N1h2 a4
{ Black is threatening to go 15... a3, which would completely destroy White's queenside. That is why White has to make a decision right now, whether to concentrate on his own play and ignore our ideas, or to stop it. }
15. a3 { This has been the most common choice, and rightfully so. } 15... Na5
{ Now the b3-square is weak, so we are using it as an outpost for our knight. }
16. Ng4 Nb3 17. Rb1 Rc8
{ A slightly mysterious move, but it will be very useful if White ever opens up the c-file. Now Black's ideas will include ...Ba6, ...Qa5 to create even more pressure. I think our counterplay is faster than White's, for example }
18. Ng5 Qa5
{ The c3-pawn is threatened, defending it would cost time, let's see what happens if White goes all-in. }
19. h5 bxc3 20. bxc3 Qxc3 21. h6 g6
{ There is no attack, while the queenside had successfully collapsed. Black is nearly winning.  One big reason why you should not be scared at all is the fact that White does not have many pieces on the kingside.  For example, White's queen can never join the attack - and there can be no mate if the queen is not participating.  Also, there is no way how White can ever destroy our king's shelter. }

I know it may look strange to take with the pawn after my last annotation where I'm saying I didn't want to take with the pawn on the last move. However, now the circumstances are slightly different - White had traded a pair of knights, and his c3-knight could be an extremely annoying piece that would be putting pressure on d5 all the time !

4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4
{ White feels ready to fight for the center. He hopes that he would be able to protect the center and stabilize the position, then he would have a large advantage thanks to extra space and Black's bishop on b7, which would be an extremely passive piece. However, after deep analysis I understood that the arising positions are much easier for Black to handle. I, actually, don't like this move at all for White anymore ! }
5... exd4 6. Nxd4 Bb4
{ Of course, Black is not going to just develop passively, waiting for White to realize all of his ambitions. Now White always needs to watch out for ...Bxc3, which would make the queenside pawns incredibly weak. Apparently, there is no conclusion what move is best in this position, as several strong White players tried about 5-6 different continuations and a few more, which were never essayed, also make sense ! We will analyze the most reasonable moves. }
7. Ne2
{ This continuation is third most popular and it was tried by such good players as Ivan Saric and Nijat Abasov. Here I am happy to suggest an early novelty. }
7... f5
{ The pawn on e4 is already hanging, and Black also wants to simply continue his development with ....Nf6. Now it makes sense for White to either take, or to play a2-a3, clarifying the intentions of the bishop. I think ... f7-f5 is a very logical move because with Nde2 White made it very difficult for himself to castle - it will take him several more moves now. That is why it makes a lot of sense to open up the position ! }
8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. Nxc3 fxe4 10. Nxe4 Qh4 11. Nc3 O-O-O
{ And Black has a huge lead in development, he is simply much better. The next moves are likely to be ...Nf6, ...Rhe8, ...Nd4.  For example, it's hard to even develop the bishop as after }
12. Be2 Nd4 13. O-O Nf6
{ Black already has many attacking ideas and can take the bishop at any point, at least, depriving White of the bishop pair. }

We are not going to enter that line which gives White initiative, instead we will opt for something very rare and interesting. 3. Bxf6 is the positional path, but I firmly believe that Black has multiple ways to achieve a good position after that move. Other continuations also exist, for example 3. Nc3, championed by Rapport, or 3. e3 which is just a passive move. However, our focus should definitely mostly be on 3. d5 and 3. Bxf6, as other moves fail to impress. }

{ I don't believe much in White's compensation. However, we definitely have to dig deeper and understand how to finish our development in the safest way possible without giving White any way to exploit his lead in development and the somewhat exposed position of our queen. White's main move has been e2-e3, but he has other ideas as well, let us investigate them. }
8. f3
{ Trying to build a strong center with e2-e4. Black has many good continuations, for example a very safe one is to trade queens. }
8... Qd4 { The rook on a1 is also hanging so White doesn't have much choice. }
9. Qxd4 cxd4
{ The only bad news is that the d4-pawn is likely be lost now. However, we have simplified the position, and as you can see, White's structure is pretty horrible. Why so ? Because, for example, we have a semi-open c-file which we can use to attack his c-pawn. Besides that, we have amazing outposts on c5 and, possibly, c4 for our knight. So even if White easily got his pawn back, we would still keep a significant long-term advantage. }

{ White is tied up as his e4-pawn is weak, his knight on d2 cannot move, his queen on c2 is passive, Black has many more improving moves and White's extra pawn is not even impressive at all. I would definitely pick Black here. }

White pins the knight and prevents ...b7-b6 for now, which is especially important for our repertoire as we play Queen's Indian ! Now some moves like ...d7-d5 are possible and reasonable, but for example after 3... d5 4. c4 !? we end up in a fashionable variation that we don't play. It's important to understand that while all these sidelines, even though they contain their shair of poison and tricks, are sidelines for a reason. And, just as for other sidelines covered in this repertoire, I got a nice solution against this one, too : }
3... h6
{ I think it's very important to include this move, as it forces the White bishop off the c1-h6 diagonal, so it would never be able to return there and defend some important squares, pawns etc. }
4. Bh4

4... c5 5. e3 cxd4
{ There are less forcing solutions like 5... b6, but I prefer this one as it poses rather concrete problems in front of White. }
6. exd4 Qb6
{ That's the key point of our previous move: the b2-pawn is attacked and White has to make a decision, whether to defend it or to boldly sacrifice it. Again, in the best traditions of this repertoire, we ended up in a rare position after 6 moves - only 87 games reached it. 32 players went for 7. Nbd2, while 28 opted for 7. b3 and 19 for 7. Qc1. We will study all of these moves carefully. }
7. b3
{ I think that the only critical move, even though it carries risk for White as well, is 7. Nbd2. Instead, after this somewhat passive reply Black gets an amazing position very easily. }
7... g5 { We are immediately going after the bishop pair. } 8. Bg3 Ne4
{ Now the major threat is ...Bb4+, especially because White would not be able to use his dark-squared bishop to parry the check. That is why his only move is }

9... Nc6 { We are just geeting another piece in the game. } 10. Bd3 Nxg3 11.
hxg3
{ This looks like a normal position - we got the bishop pair, but slightly weakened our kingside. For example, 11... Bg7 would be a normal usual move that would keep the game balanced. However, I got us a much neater solution. }
11... g4
{ This move was already played in three games, and it is really strong. The idea is revealed after }
12. Nh4 Nxd4
{ It turns out our knight is untouchable, because if White were to take, after ...Qxd4 the a1-rook is trapped, and moves like Nd2 aren't possible as the d3-bishop would hang. }
13. Qxg4 { White gets the pawn back. } 13... Nc6 14. O-O Qc5
{ In some lines, our queen might come to g5 to offer a trade. However, most importantly, this move...creates a threat to the c3-pawn, and keeps the knight on b1 for a while ! }
15. Nf3
{ White's knight was on the edge of the board so it makes sense to return in closer to the center. }
15... Ne5 16. Nxe5 Qxe5
{ Now it's time to stop and evaluate the consequences of this slightly unusual trade. The way I understand the position is simple: we have a much better pawn structure and a pair of bishops; the dark-squared one would be very strong, especially if it comes to g7. Based on the previous factors I had mentioned, we can conclude that the queen trade is extremely beneficial for us, as our king cannot easily castle and because any endgame would be clearly better for us. Objectively, a queen trade is not easy to achieve, but trading other pieces also help to reduce the danger of having our king on e8 and to get as close as we can to the endgame. }

As a result, we will get two central pawns, while White will have pawns on the b and c-file.  Normally, it is considered that central pawns are way more useful in the middlegame, this is the reason why we can hope for a long-term advantage here. }

{ As I was creating this repertoire, I found it rather difficult to come up with a good setup against the London System. It is not because this system is so dangerous, or because Black needs to know very much. The reason was that our repertoire is based on Queen's Indian, which immediately cut me a lot of attractive setups, such as 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 !?, because I realized that White can instead start with 2. Nf3, when our only choices would be 2... e6 or 2... b6. Finally, I have decided to recommend the most solid system which enjoys a very good reputation among superGMs. Another big perk of my suggestion is that White, who has so many interesting move orders and ways to get London - by playing Nbd2 before c2-c3; by going c3 and Nd2 with the knight on f3 or without it, etc - would not be able to trick us with the move orders. He would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what are are playing ! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn.

3. e3 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nd2 d5 6. Bd3
{ This is one of the tricky move orders. It is good in a way, as it gives white an interesting idea discussed in this variation and prevents the move ...Nh5, which is the key move of our repertoire after 6. Nf3. White can actually avoid the lines after 6. Nf3 Nh5 with this move order to make us play some positions which normally arise after 6. Nf3 Bd6. However, if we play those positions, we will only play ones that are good for Black, while White's most dangerous possibilities will be eliminated ! }
6... Bd6 7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. f4
{ This is it ! That's why White was keeping the knight on g1 for so long: now the pawn comes to f4, White gets a much better control of the e5-square, prevents Black's idea ...e6-e5 and hopes to later install his knight on e5 easily. However, White is quite far from finishing his development, which is of course a factor Black will benefit from. The strategic factors - space advantage that White has and our bad bishop on c8 - make us look for concrete dynamic ideas. It also makes sense to play dynamically because we are better developed. That is why our next move is extremely logical. }
8... cxd4 { Fortunately, a good solution is well-known. } 9. cxd4 Bd7

{ The position is more or less balanced, however, I claim Black's small advantage as the square on e4 is a great outpost for his knight. Instead, White's knight can always be chased from e5 as our pawn is still on f7, so ...f7-f6 is a possibility. }

6... Nh5
{ This is a very interesting move, which has several big advantages compared with the main line 6... Bd6. First of all, this move is rather infrequent - it was played in 262 games, according to my database, while 6... Bd6 was tried for 4500 times ! Logically, chances are that the opponent would not know how to react well, or wouldn't know the arising positions deeply. For example, it is likely that many players would be following Sedlak's books on London, and while is is mentioning 6... Nh5 on three lines, but never considers 7... f6, which means people would be caught offguard. Secondly, in the main line White has many interesting possibilities. I was actually going to recommend the main variation at first, as I found plenty of fascinating ideas for Black there, but later I realized that this can be a much simpler solution, which will require less memorization from the readers. This is how the choice was made ! }
7. Bg5
{ The bishop was attacked and this is the only retreat that poses problems. }
7... f6 8. Bh4 g6
{ In this position, White has several reasonable options. The move favoured by most GMs has been 9. Bd3, but other ideas are also worth checking. }
9. Bd3 cxd4

10. cxd4 Bd6
{ In my opinion, this is a better square for the bishop than e7. Surprisingly, this position was encountered for 1 time only ! }
11. O-O O-O
{ Now it is time for White to think of a plan. Our natural moves seem to be ...Qe7, ...Bd7, ... Rac8 or ...Rae8 depending on what we want to do next. One of Black's ideas at some point could be to even play ...g6-g5, going for the bishop pair. However, of course, that's a highly committal move so we need to make sure it works. White can try to either play calmly on the queenside with Rc1, Nb3 etc, or consider e3-e4 !?, which makes a lot of sense as even though White gets an isolated pawn, it also gives White the access to our slighly weak pawn on e6. }
12. e4
{ A good idea overall, but perhaps the execution isn't perfect as we can get a pair of bishops again. }
12... g5 13. Nxg5 Nf4 14. Nxh7 Kxh7 15. exd5+ Nxd3 16. dxc6 Nf4
{ This position is really complicated, White has interesting compensation for the missing piece. However, Black is perfectly fine, White is not really creating any direct threats. For example, it is sensible to retreat with the knight either on g6 or to d5, then we can just go ...♔g7. I just wanted to give this line to make you extremely conscious about all the traps White has related with the h7-square and the h5-knight, but the chances of this line appearing on the board are pretty much non-existent. }

{ As I was creating this repertoire, I found it rather difficult to come up with a good setup against the London System. It is not because this system is so dangerous, or because Black needs to know very much. The reason was that our repertoire is based on Queen's Indian, which immediately cut me a lot of attractive setups, such as 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 !?, because I realized that White can instead start with 2. Nf3, when our only choices would be 2... e6 or 2... b6. Finally, I have decided to recommend the most solid system which enjoys a very good reputation among superGMs. Another big perk of my suggestion is that White, who has so many interesting move orders and ways to get London - by playing Nbd2 before c2-c3; by going c3 and Nd2 with the knight on f3 or without it, etc - would not be able to trick us with the move orders. He would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what are are playing ! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn. Besides that, this chapter is covering some remaining sidelines, such as Veresov/Jobava Attack and the system 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5. }
2... e6
{ It is also possible to start with 2... d5 or 2... c5, but I consider this move order the simplest one. }
3. e3 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nd2 d5 6. Ngf3
{ This is the main tabiya of London. White delayed the development of this knight for a while, but it doesn't make sense to keep it on g1 anymore. There is only one reason why White might want to do that, and it is covered in the line with 6. Bd3. }
6... Nh5
{ This is a very interesting move, which has several big advantages compared with the main line 6... Bd6. First of all, this move is rather infrequent - it was played in 262 games, according to my database, while 6... Bd6 was tried for 4500 times ! Logically, chances are that the opponent would not know how to react well, or wouldn't know the arising positions deeply. For example, it is likely that many players would be following Sedlak's books on London, and while is is mentioning 6... Nh5 on three lines, but never considers 7... f6, which means people would be caught offguard. Secondly, in the main line White has many interesting possibilities. I was actually going to recommend the main variation at first, as I found plenty of fascinating ideas for Black there, but later I realized that this can be a much simpler solution, which will require less memorization from the readers. This is how the choice was made ! }
7. Bg5
{ The bishop was attacked and this is the only retreat that poses problems. }
7... f6 8. Bh4 g6
{ In this position, White has several reasonable options. The move favoured by most GMs has been 9. Bd3, but other ideas are also worth checking. }
9. Bd3 cxd4
{ It's a pretty good moment to release the central tension as White cannot recapture with his e-pawn. }
10. cxd4 Bd6
{ In my opinion, this is a better square for the bishop than e7. Surprisingly, this position was encountered for 1 time only ! }
11. O-O O-O
{ Now it is time for White to think of a plan. Our natural moves seem to be ...Qe7, ...Bd7, ... Rac8 or ...Rae8 depending on what we want to do next. One of Black's ideas at some point could be to even play ...g6-g5, going for the bishop pair. However, of course, that's a highly committal move so we need to make sure it works. White can try to either play calmly on the queenside with Rc1, Nb3 etc, or consider e3-e4 !?, which makes a lot of sense as even though White gets an isolated pawn, it also gives White the access to our slighly weak pawn on e6. }
12. Rc1 Qe7
{ This is not just a developing move. This move also protects the...h7-pawn, which is rather important, as we will see shortly. }
13. Nb3 g5
{ The reason why it was so important to protect f7 is because now this direct line doesn't work for White. }
14. Bg3 Nxg3 15. hxg3
{ Now we could continue in a few ways, but I especially like this powerful positional solution }
15... g4 16. Nh4 f5
{ Now the knight on h4 is horrible as it has no moves. Black is simply better. }

{ Queen's Indian is a core of our repertoire, and this position is definitely one of the key tabiyas that you will be encountering. Please, make sure to spend a good amount of time on this position and the lines in this chapter ! Now, White has many continuations. 7.

However, there are other possibilities available to White on 7th move: 7. Re1 !? is a tricky move, which delays development of White's queenside knight - White claims that it is hard for us to come up with a useful move of our own. However, we do have a good answer to this. 7. d5 !? is a very interesting gambit, which was invented by Lev Polugaevsky back in the day and used by Alphazero in its recent famous matches. This can be a scary move to face unless you are prepared, but we will be - in fact, Black's play is pretty straightforward there. Let us go over all of the possibilities one by one ! }
7. Re1
{ A very interesting modern idea. People realized that it is hard to aspire for an advantage in the main line with 7. Nc3, so they started trying to make a semi-waiting move. As it is not easy to understand, I will again follow Kramnik's footsteps - not for the sake of just copying what he does, but simply because his moves are ideas are so amazingly good ! }

This can be a scary move to face unless you are prepared, but we will be - in fact, Black's play is pretty straightforward there. Let us go over all of the possibilities one by one ! }
7. Nc3 { The main move and definitely the most dangerous one. } 7... Ne4
{ This is the most classical reply for Black and the safest one. Our idea is to trade the knights. Why do we do that ? Because at the moment, White has more space, and it is well-known, that the side with less space benefits from trades. Secondly, we are taking the e4-square under firm control, making it very difficult for White to ever play e2-e4, which is one of his main aspirations in this position. Also, we are creating a positional threat of Nxc3, which will spoil White's queenside structure and will make his pawns very vulnerable in the long run. }
8. Nxe4
{ This is the move White uses when he wants to simplify the game - often, White plays this to make a draw versus a higher-rated opponent. However, it is not threatening as now we get to control the e4-square very well. }
8... Bxe4 9. Ne1 Bxg2 10. Nxg2 d5
{ This is the main move here, and definitely it is a very good one. However, as it leads to some rather equal positions and you might be facing this line while playing weaker opponents, consider the more complex approach - you can setup your pieces by means of Bf6, d7-d6, c7-c5, Nb8-c6. This is more risky, but it is definitely very playable and gives more winning chances. But, as a main repertoire suggestion, I choose the most solid and reliable move. }
11. Qa4
{ The only ambitious move - White keeps more tension in the center so far. }
11... dxc4
{ From the theoretical perspective, if we play for equality, this is easiest. We just liquidate the center, reaching an equal position. }
12. Qxc4 c5 13. dxc5 Bxc5
{ Then we follow with Nd7, Qe7, place the rooks on the open files. The position is absolutely equal. For example, this sample game shows that usually both sides go here when they have peaceful intentions. }
14. Be3 Nd7 15. Rfd1 Qe7 16. Bxc5 Nxc5 17. Ne3 Rfd8 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. Rd1
Rxd1+ 20. Nxd1
{ Everything just got logically traded over the open file and players shook hands. If this is not what you are looking for, please examine the alternative to d7-d5 that I mention earlier ! 1/2  (20)  Almasi,Z  (2695)  -Kryvoruchko,Y  (2695)  Tsaghkadzor 2015 }

However, we do have a good answer to this. 7. d5 !? is a very interesting gambit, which was invented by Lev Polugaevsky back in the day and used by Alphazero in its recent famous matches. This can be a scary move to face unless you are prepared, but we will be - in fact, Black's play is pretty straightforward there. Let us go over all of the possibilities one by one ! }
7. Nc3 { The main move and definitely the most dangerous one. } 7... Ne4
{ This is the most classical reply for Black and the safest one. Our idea is to trade the knights. Why do we do that ? Because at the moment, White has more space, and it is well-known, that the side with less space benefits from trades. Secondly, we are taking the e4-square under firm control, making it very difficult for White to ever play e2-e4, which is one of his main aspirations in this position. Also, we are creating a positional threat of Nxc3, which will spoil White's queenside structure and will make his pawns very vulnerable in the long run. }
8. Qc2
{ This is the classical reply. White will spend some time by moving the queen, but he hopes to eventually gain control over the e4-square and he also prevents us from spoiling his structure. }
8... Nxc3 9. Qxc3 d6
{ Actually, I feel that other, more popular continuations - 9... c5 and 9... f5, are also perfectly acceptable for Black. But I simply like Vladimir Kramnik's play too much, so I could not help but base my suggestion on his game from Olympiad - apparently, since it was a team competetion, he had also approached his opening choice very seriously. White has several continuations here - 10. b3, 10. Qc2 and some other moves. But, since positions are not forcing, since you will rather need to rely on typical plans rather than concrete sequences of moves, I suggest that we concentrate on ideas behind the moves and do not attempt to cover every single possible move in every position. }
10. Rd1
{ This move was suggested by Sielecki in his 1. d4 repertoire for White. This is not a theoretical problem, but Sielecki's approach and goals were not related with posing theoretical problems - in his great work, he rather attempted to present solutions for White, where it would be easy for him to play. Well, it is also easy to play for us :  I would say you follow ideas which are similar to the main games that we analyze in this chapter, but also I would provide you with a few concrete moves. }
10... Nd7
{ I feel this is more logical and in the spirit of our plan, rather than Sielecki's 10..Bf6. Now, if White tries to prepare e4, we just prevent it. If he develops, so do we. Either way, we are doing great. }
11. Qc2 f5 { Taking e4 under control. } 12. Ne1 Bxg2 13. Nxg2 Qe8
{ Now, the follow-up for us will include Qf7, Rae8, e6-e5 with a great position. }

This can be a scary move to face unless you are prepared, but we will be - in fact, Black's play is pretty straightforward there. Let us go over all of the possibilities one by one ! }
7. Nc3 { The main move and definitely the most dangerous one. } 7... Ne4
{ This is the most classical reply for Black and the safest one. Our idea is to trade the knights. Why do we do that ? Because at the moment, White has more space, and it is well-known, that the side with less space benefits from trades. Secondly, we are taking the e4-square under firm control, making it very difficult for White to ever play e2-e4, which is one of his main aspirations in this position. Also, we are creating a positional threat of Nxc3, which will spoil White's queenside structure and will make his pawns very vulnerable in the long run. }
8. Bd2
{ This is a very interesting move that lately became very trendy. White's idea is simple: he wants to reach a similar position to the one after 8. Qc2, but he hopes to get his bishop on c3, not the queen. Then he hopes he would find some better use for the queen. Also, White claims he is not afraid of getting his bishop traded for our knight, as it was not specifically useful anyway. In fact, we need to play quite a few precise moves to get a comfortable position here. }
8... Nxc3 9. Bxc3
{ Would be premature.   Now White intends to play d4-d5 ! 9..Bf6 prevents this, but makes it impossible for us to play f7-f5, fighting for the e4-square. 9... f5, instead, does allow for d4-d5. }

After the queen recapture, instead, we simply get some very comfortable development, while White cannot initiate any active play soon. }

And in fact, even if he did, things would not be that simple. The plan that appeals to me for us involves such moves as g7-g6, Bg7, Nc5, Re8 etc, acting in the classical modern style: we gave up the center, and now put a lot of pressure on it with our pieces. White can continue in many normal ways - say, Qf3 or Qc2, then we would follow this plan. While this is what he should do, I also want to show you why he cannot advance in the center instantly and how we should deal with such an attempt. }

Our next step should definitely be activation of the a6-knight by means of Nc5. Then we will active the f8-rook with Rfe8 or Rfd8, we can also offer a queen trade with Qd7 at some point.

20. Nxf7
{ The only threatening move that I can see here. It was played by a young Russian GM, who happens to be a very strong theoretician, Alexey Sarana. For some reason, his opponent did not want to take with the king, but I think this is easiest, as we force White's queen to go to a pretty bad square. }
20... Kxf7 21. Qh5+ Kg8 22. Bxe6+ Nxe6 23. Rxe6 d4 24. Rxc6 dxc3
{ Our king is somewhat weakened now, but on the other hand black's c3-pawn is very strong, so White should definitely be somewhat alarmed. Objectively the position remains equal, I would say, and complex enough for both sides to still have possibilities to outplay the opponent. I think this is a good theoretical outcome in a dangerous line - we are perfectly safe and we still have reasonable chances to win ! }

White, on the other hand, needs to understand that if we double our rooks, we will win some pawn, such as the f2-pawn or the h2-pawn. Also, if we ever play ...e4-e3 and White has to take, his king might end up cut over the second rank and nearly checkmated. Overall, the position is equal.

However, there are other possibilities available to White on 7th move: 7. Re1 !? is a tricky move, which delays development of White's queenside knight - White claims that it is hard for us to come up with a useful move of our own. However, we do have a good answer to this. 7. d5 !? is a very interesting gambit, which was invented by Lev Polugaevsky back in the day and used by Alphazero in its recent famous matches.

White's main idea is to stop ...Bb4, which pins the knight and makes it difficult for White to control the center. Later, his intentions will include d4-d5, which blocks the Black bishop on b7. This system, even though it doesn't look dangerous visually - how dangerous can the move a2-a3 be ?! - is, in my opinion, one of White's most dangerous weapons against Queen's Indian. Black has multiple sidelines, such as 5... g6, 5... Ne4 etc, but I don't think they give equality. However, if you are feeling adventurous, 5... g6 is definitely worth looking at. The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }
5... d5
{ Now White has many continuations, but it makes sense to concentrate on three main ones - 6. cxd5, 6. Bg5 and 6. Qc2. Other moves, such as 6. e3, are clearly innocuous. }
6. cxd5 { This is by all means the main move, and the most dangerous one. }
6... Nxd5
{ Now we arrive at another crossroads - besides 7. Qc2, 7. e3 is also very interesting - and perhaps, it is a more natural move, too, as White simply continues his development. }
7. e3
{ This is another major variation. Is it less popular than Qc2, but it is definitely a very logical way for White to continue. As I say in many lines starting after Qc2, these positions are mostly about plans and ideas as opposed to concrete knowledge, so the best way to master the variations is to simply read the annotations to the lines carefully, as many similar ideas apply in a lot of variations. I would even strongly suggest to start with the move 7. Qc2 and then return to 7. e3 as most ideas are already described in the annotations to the lines that arise there. }
7... g6
{ Is an interesting fighting alternative which became popular after the very famous game Kasparov-Kortchnoi, but I cannot prove full equality here, so this is something for you to investigate if you wish. }

The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }

As I say in many lines starting after Qc2, these positions are mostly about plans and ideas as opposed to concrete knowledge, so the best way to master the variations is to simply read the annotations to the lines carefully, as many similar ideas apply in a lot of variations. I would even strongly suggest to start with the move 7. Qc2 and then return to 7. e3 as most ideas are already described in the annotations to the lines that arise there. }

8. bxc3 Be7
{ Just as in many other lines, first we develop, then we will see what to do. White can go Bd3, but he mostly chooses to give a check on b5, provoke ...c7-c6 and then retreat to d3.

Now nothing will stop us from carrying out...c6-c5, which opens up the b7-bishop. I think Black's position is great here - we can later go ...Bc6 and ...Qb7, for example, then play ...Rfd8 and ...Rac8. There might be some other plans as well, for example if White takes on c5.

The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }
5... d5

7. Qc2
{ This move, aimed at the quick e2-e4, is considered to be White's most ambitious continuation - he is planning to get a full control over the center. }
7... Nxc3
{ This is a little subtlety. Here is the point: if Black simply developed with ...Be7, White could tranpose with e2-e4, but he could also go Bd2 !?, intending to later recapture on c3 with the bishop. There is no need to give White additional options, so we cut one of his ideas out by taking immediately. }
8. Qxc3
{ This is also a pretty interesting idea. White gives up on his plan related with e2-e4  (or it might have never been this specific player's plan !)  and instead he hopes to simply develop and play some roughly equal position. One of the things he can possibly hope to exploit and benefit from is our pawn on c7, which is a slightly weak and backward pawn. However, soon we will be able to play ...c7-c5, which will easily equalize the game. }
8... h6 { Stopping any Bg5 ideas. } 9. Bf4 Bd6

Bg3, don't pose any problems - we can continue in the same way as in many other similar lines. There is also an idea to go 10. Ne5, stopping the trade for now. This might result in another interesting structure, which however is rather dangerous for White. }

As I said earlier, the latter factor is not a problem as we can always play ...Nd7 and ...c7-c5, getting rid of the potentially weak pawn. It doesn't make sense for us to capture on g3 immediately, but we can definitely do that later. To begin with, we will just make a few developing moves, checking what White will do. }
10... O-O 11. e3 Nd7
{ This is how all the GM games, and games of the strong players overall, continued. Now, Bb5 has been the main move. Its goal is to put pressure on the d7-knight, thus making it more difficult for Black to achieve the ...c7-c5 break. However, as we will see, Black still gets to play this move without much trouble. White tried other moves as well, but I don't see how they can pose any problems. }
12. Be2
{ White can develop more passively, too. If you want to keep a bit more tension, I can recommend ...Nf6 followed by ...Ne4. However, I think another that another clear-cut route to equality can be reached in a simple way - again, we trade on g3 and go ...c7-c5. Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it ? }

{ Now White has many continuations, but it makes sense to concentrate on three main ones - 6. cxd5, 6. Bg5 and 6. Qc2. Other moves, such as 6. e3, are clearly innocuous. }
6. cxd5 { This is by all means the main move, and the most dangerous one. }
6... Nxd5
{ Now we arrive at another crossroads - besides 7. Qc2, 7. e3 is also very interesting - and perhaps, it is a more natural move, too, as White simply continues his development. }
7. Qc2
{ This move, aimed at the quick e2-e4, is considered to be White's most ambitious continuation - he is planning to get a full control over the center. }
7... Nxc3
{ This is a little subtlety. Here is the point: if Black simply developed with ...Be7, White could tranpose with e2-e4, but he could also go Bd2 !?, intending to later recapture on c3 with the bishop. There is no need to give White additional options, so we cut one of his ideas out by taking immediately. }
8. Qxc3
{ This is also a pretty interesting idea. White gives up on his plan related with e2-e4  (or it might have never been this specific player's plan !)  and instead he hopes to simply develop and play some roughly equal position. One of the things he can possibly hope to exploit and benefit from is our pawn on c7, which is a slightly weak and backward pawn. However, soon we will be able to play ...c7-c5, which will easily equalize the game. }
8... h6 { Stopping any Bg5 ideas. } 9. Bf4 Bd6
{ Now, White has several possibilities. It is important to look at a new structure that arises if White takes on d6. Besides that, other moves - such as 10. Bg3, don't pose any problems - we can continue in the same way as in many other similar lines. There is also an idea to go 10. Ne5, stopping the trade for now. This might result in another interesting structure, which however is rather dangerous for White. }
10. Bg3
{ White refrains from the trade, inviting Black to instead take on g3 himself. If Black does that, White gets a semi-open h-file for his rook and Black still keeps the slightly backward c7-pawn, he doesn't get to improve his structure, unlike in the variation when White takes on d6 himself. As I said earlier, the latter factor is not a problem as we can always play ...Nd7 and ...c7-c5, getting rid of the potentially weak pawn. It doesn't make sense for us to capture on g3 immediately, but we can definitely do that later. To begin with, we will just make a few developing moves, checking what White will do. }
10... O-O 11. e3 Nd7
{ This is how all the GM games, and games of the strong players overall, continued. Now, Bb5 has been the main move. Its goal is to put pressure on the d7-knight, thus making it more difficult for Black to achieve the ...c7-c5 break. However, as we will see, Black still gets to play this move without much trouble. White tried other moves as well, but I don't see how they can pose any problems. }
12. Bb5 Bxg3 13. hxg3 c5
{ This move was featured in one game only. Instead, GMs mostly went ...c7-c6, followed by ...c6-c5 later  (not always)  . However, I don't see any reasons why we wouldn't make this strategically desirable move immediately. The position is very new and unexplored, so many continuations are possible. We will consider a few most natural ones. }
14. Rd1 Rc8 15. dxc5 Rxc5
{ Black is not worried that his d7-knight is hanging, as he is counterattacking the queen. Now, no matter where the White queen retreats, we can play ...Rd5 !, dealing with White's annoying rook. The direct Rxd7 is the only interesting move, let's see how we react. }
16. Rxd7 { Now Black needs to know or find the only move. } 16... Qc8
{ Suddenly White has hard time protecting the b5-bishop, the first rank and the rook. }
17. Qb4 Rxb5 18. Qxb5 Bc6
{ And Black wins the rook back with a balanced game. A really cute line, in my opinion ! }

Black could also handle it slightly differently - for example, instead of taking on d4, he could keep a bit more tension with ...Rc8, but objectively things remain balanced anyway. If White trades queens, we place our rooks on the d and c-files and come to e7 with the king. If he doesn't, we put the queen on e7, centralize rooks and see what to do next. I feel the position is quite straightforward and understandable, there are no complicated strategic decisions to be made, both sides should just place the pieces in the center. }

I am analyzing it via a slightly different move order, so don't get confused - you can get it both ways. White's main idea is to stop ...Bb4, which pins the knight and makes it difficult for White to control the center. Later, his intentions will include d4-d5, which blocks the Black bishop on b7. This system, even though it doesn't look dangerous visually - how dangerous can the move a2-a3 be ?! - is, in my opinion, one of White's most dangerous weapons against Queen's Indian. Black has multiple sidelines, such as 5... g6, 5... Ne4 etc, but I don't think they give equality. However, if you are feeling adventurous, 5... g6 is definitely worth looking at. The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }
5... d5
{ Now White has many continuations, but it makes sense to concentrate on three main ones - 6. cxd5, 6. Bg5 and 6. Qc2. Other moves, such as 6. e3, are clearly innocuous. }
6. cxd5 { This is by all means the main move, and the most dangerous one. }
6... Nxd5
{ Now we arrive at another crossroads - besides 7. Qc2, 7. e3 is also very interesting - and perhaps, it is a more natural move, too, as White simply continues his development. }
7. Qc2
{ This move, aimed at the quick e2-e4, is considered to be White's most ambitious continuation - he is planning to get a full control over the center. }
7... Nxc3
{ This is a little subtlety. Here is the point: if Black simply developed with ...Be7, White could tranpose with e2-e4, but he could also go Bd2 !?, intending to later recapture on c3 with the bishop. There is no need to give White additional options, so we cut one of his ideas out by taking immediately. }
8. Qxc3
{ This is also a pretty interesting idea. White gives up on his plan related with e2-e4  (or it might have never been this specific player's plan !)  and instead he hopes to simply develop and play some roughly equal position. One of the things he can possibly hope to exploit and benefit from is our pawn on c7, which is a slightly weak and backward pawn. However, soon we will be able to play ...c7-c5, which will easily equalize the game. }
8... h6 { Stopping any Bg5 ideas. } 9. Bf4 Bd6
{ Now, White has several possibilities. It is important to look at a new structure that arises if White takes on d6. Besides that, other moves - such as 10. Bg3, don't pose any problems - we can continue in the same way as in many other similar lines. There is also an idea to go 10. Ne5, stopping the trade for now. This might result in another interesting structure, which however is rather dangerous for White. }
10. Ne5

10... Nd7

11. e3
{ Now that White can quickly play Bb5, it is not desirable to take on e5 - we would need to spend the time retreating with the bishop, and White will quickly develop a strong initiative. However, this capture remains our strategic idea, so we prepare it by castling. }
11... O-O 12. Nc6
{ This seems to be a logical move, which makes use of the c6-square. However, no one had played this yet, which is surprising. We don't take, as White will get an edge, instead we get ready to kick this knight out soon. }
12... Bxc6 13. Bxd6 { An important intermediate move } 13... cxd6 14. Qxc6
{ And White is somewhat better as our queenside is a bit weakened and his bishop is perfectly suited for capitalizing on this - say, it can come to a6 and take c8 under control, then White can use the c-file. His bishop isn't better than our knight in all such positions, but here what makes things bad is the position of our pawn on b6. }

Bg3, don't pose any problems - we can continue in the same way as in many other similar lines. There is also an idea to go 10. Ne5, stopping the trade for now. This might result in another interesting structure, which however is rather dangerous for White. }
10. Ne5
{ This move definitely looks ambitious - White keeps more pieces on the board. }
10... Nd7
{ Black, however, insists on trades. Now the main move is 11. f3, but I think it is simply a positional mistake. Instead, 11. e3 is the only other continuation that was tried. I feel that this is more sound, and the position remains within the frames of equality. }
11. e3
{ Now that White can quickly play Bb5, it is not desirable to take on e5 - we would need to spend the time retreating with the bishop, and White will quickly develop a strong initiative. However, this capture remains our strategic idea, so we prepare it by castling. }
11... O-O 12. Bb5
{ This has been the main move, but I really don't like it for White. } 12...
Nxe5 13. dxe5 Be7
{ As we had seen in some previous variations, the structure itself is highly disadvantageous for White, that is why his only bet can be on the activity. However, I think that while we may need to make a few passive moves, soon White's initiative will run out of steam and we will simply get a better endgame. }
14. Rd1 Qc8
{ Creating a positional threat of ...c7-c5, completely getting out of the pressure. }
15. Bd7 Qb8 16. Bc6 { White tries to keep Black stuck on the last ranks. }
16... Bc5 17. Bb5 Rd8 18. O-O Rd5
{ Intending to get the queen out of the way and to continue with ...Rad8. While White still may seem to have somewhat more active pieces, it is important to bear in mind that every trade makes us closer and closer to a clearly superior endgame, so we can tolerate that activity for a few more moves. There is no way how White can create any threats, so I think we are simply better here. Just trade, trade and win the endgame thanks to your extra queenside pawn ! }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. Nc3 e6 5. a3
{ The fearsome Petrosian system. As many other opening variations named after the 9th World Champion, it carries a shadow of his positional style, aimed at the restriction of opponents' ideas, in the first place. This position is more commonly reached via the move order 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 !  (preventing ...Bb4)  Bb7 5. Nc3. I am analyzing it via a slightly different move order, so don't get confused - you can get it both ways. White's main idea is to stop ...Bb4, which pins the knight and makes it difficult for White to control the center. Later, his intentions will include d4-d5, which blocks the Black bishop on b7. This system, even though it doesn't look dangerous visually - how dangerous can the move a2-a3 be ?! - is, in my opinion, one of White's most dangerous weapons against Queen's Indian. Black has multiple sidelines, such as 5... g6, 5... Ne4 etc, but I don't think they give equality. However, if you are feeling adventurous, 5... g6 is definitely worth looking at. The move 5... d7-d5 is Black's most solid reaction, as it prevents d4-d5 by White. We are likely to get a relatively open position, as either Black will take ...dxc4 or White will capture on d5, when Black would recapture with the piece in order not to block his b7-bishop. }
5... d5
{ Now White has many continuations, but it makes sense to concentrate on three main ones - 6. cxd5, 6. Bg5 and 6. Qc2. Other moves, such as 6. e3, are clearly innocuous. }
6. cxd5 { This is by all means the main move, and the most dangerous one. }
6... Nxd5
{ Now we arrive at another crossroads - besides 7. Qc2, 7. e3 is also very interesting - and perhaps, it is a more natural move, too, as White simply continues his development. }
7. Qc2
{ This move, aimed at the quick e2-e4, is considered to be White's most ambitious continuation - he is planning to get a full control over the center. }
7... Nxc3
{ This is a little subtlety. Here is the point: if Black simply developed with ...Be7, White could tranpose with e2-e4, but he could also go Bd2 !?, intending to later recapture on c3 with the bishop. There is no need to give White additional options, so we cut one of his ideas out by taking immediately. }
8. bxc3
{ The most consistent move - White wants to build a strong center, and he keeps the queen on c2, so that it can support e2-e4. }
8... Be7 9. e4
{ White takes the whole center. So far we are only interested in developing, but soon we will challenge his spacial accomplishments. }
9... O-O 10. Bd3
{ The good news about this variation, by the way, is that White doesn't have many alternatives to the moves he is currently making - say, it obviously makes no sense to develop the bishop to any square but d3. This circumstance makes it extremely easy for us to master the variation from Black's perspective, I believe. }
10... c5 11. O-O
{ Now that we have castled, it is time to think where the queenside pieces should go. Here two moves - ...Qc8 and ...Qc7 are equally popular. The first idea is pretty reasonable as well - the point is to trade the bishops with ...Ba6. Why is it good to trade ? Because White has more space, so each trade makes his space advantage less valuable. However, I think that the queen is placed more naturally on c7, as it doesn't prevent the rooks from getting developed easily. }
11... Qc7 12. Qe2
{ With his last move, Black created a positional threat of ... cxd4 cxd4 Qxc2, which would get us a position where White has no attacking chances anymore, while his center is a huge liability. That is why White removes the queen to another good square. }
12... Rd8
{ I would like to explain the reasoning behind this move, especially because this move is way less popular than ...Nd7 and ...Nc6. In fact, it is pretty simple - I don't want to show our intentions yet regarding where the knight would go. For example, if it goes to d7 too early, White may try ideas like a4-a5, which is not possible with the knight on c6. Or, instead, if the knight goes to c6, the bishop on b7 would be obstructed and we would not be able to make use of the c-file. So I prefer to see what White does first, and only then I would develop my knight. At this point, we are at a crossroads, as White mostly goes Bb2, but sometimes he prefers Rd1 or Re1, not defining the position of his bishop yet. Again, the position is rather about understanding of typical plans and patterns as opposed to the knowledge of specific variations, so don't feel obliged to learn everything move by move. But do go over the lines carefully to grasp all the ideas and explanations ! }
13. Rd1 Nd7
{ White is just getting his pieces in the game and we reply with the same thing. Now a lot of moves were tried, but I think there are just a few logical ideas - to either push a4-a5 to generate some queenside activity, or to play e4-e5, hoping for a kingside attack. }
14. a4 Rac8 { Black need not fear the a5-push, as we will see. } 15. g3
{ Some people tried this move, which prepares Bf4. It is just another reasonable way to develop, which however has a potential danger for White as the h1-a8 diagonal is becoming weaker. }
15... h6
{ I like this move, which can be useful in the future as White's pieces cannot go to g5 anymore. For example, there are no more ideas like Ng5 followed by Qh5. }
16. Bf4 Bd6 17. Bxd6 Qxd6
{ Black is about to take on d4 and go ...Rc3, using the open file. It is very important to bear in mind that the center is mostly useful when a lot of pieces are still on the board, so that opponents' pieces have very few squares and very little mobility. Here, instead, two pairs of pieces have been traded and White's center is more of a liability and concern. The structure is very typical of another opening - Semi-Tarrasch, which is one of the most popular top-level openings nowadays, so if you want to get a better feel for it, check some games in that opening, too ! For example, you can study Kramnik's games - not just because of opening or structure, but because most of his games are so deep and interesting. }
18. a5 { It makes sense to continue what White started with a3-a4. } 18... cxd4
19. cxd4 Rc3 { Black acts according to the plan, he activates his rook. } 20.
axb6 axb6
{ I think Black is completely fine, as White's center is under quite a bit of pressure. Of course, we have a slight weakness on b6, but attacking it would never be an easy task as White has to protect the e4-pawn and watch out for some possible surprises over the h1-a8 diagonal, which was weakened by g2-g3. }

7. Nc3 d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. b3 Nbd7 10. Bb2 a6
{ These were all natural moves, and here Black plays ...a6 to prepare ...Bd6 and not run into Nb5. First of all, if he gets to play ...Bd6, he will need to spend another tempo. Secondly, right now he does not control the e5-square well enough and White can try to exploit it by playing Ne5 followed by f2-f4 ! By simply going ...d7-d5 and ...Bd6 immediately, we get a much better version of this variation. }

5. Bd3 d5
{ This is the first important detail to remember, in my opinion. Why is it so important to start with d7-d5 ? The reason is simple: we want to develop our bishop to the better square on d6, as opposed to the more passive position on e7. This will especially matter if White chooses to take on d5.  Now White faces an important choice - whether to trade on d5, or to just continue developing - he can castle, play Nc3, whatever. This may transpose, as White can decide to take later on, but it may also not - for example, if Black chooses to trade on c4 quickly. }
6. O-O

6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 a6

Black's idea now will be to combine development of his kingside  (...Be7, ...O-O)  as well as expansion on the quenside by means of ...b6-b5, ...c7-c5. A few structures may occur here: White might invite some symmetrical structure - say, when Black plays c5, White will take on c5. Normally symmetrical positions are not extremely complex from the strategical perspective, what matters most is how pieces are placed, so we will make sure we get this structure under the right circumstances. Another thing White can do, which is more ambitious, is to try and gain some space in the center by preparing the e3-e4 push. Then the pawn will either stay on e4, just controlling a lot of space, or will go to e5 - White will weaken some squares, but will seize even more space on the kingside and will try to benefit from that spacial advantage to create attacking chances. As we will see, however, the last plan is not something easy to execute, as Black's counterplay comes very fast. }

16. Nxf8 Rxf8
{ If it was an endgame, White could have a decent shot at some advantage as he got a rook and two pawns for two pieces. However, in the middlegame the pieces are much more important, and the White rooks don't have too many open files. For example, one of the important factors is the weakness created by a2-a4: Black can now go ...a6-a5 !, followed by ...Nc5 ! - the knight would be placed great on c5. Then our bishop can go to a6, the knight can continue its route by coming to d3, etc. I definitely believe that it is easier to play with Black here. }

{ This has been the main move - White prepares the move Rd1. The rook will try to be quite annoying there as it creates an x-ray on our queen. However, as long as we are careful, it is not a problem. }
8... Nbd7 9. Rd1 c5
{ Now White faces a choice - whether to allow for ...b6-b5 at any moment when Black chooses to carry out this move, or stop it forever with a2-a4. }
10. a4
{ White prevents ...b6-b5. The only problem with this move is that is costs White time. The time that he might not have now for the e3-e4 plan, for example. Another disadvantage of a2-a4 is that now the b4-square is weakened, so Black can hope to use it as an outpost in the future. }

exd5 13. Nxd5 Nxd5 14. Bxd5 Bxd5 15. Rxd5 O-O
{ Followed by ...Nf6, Rfd8. Black, who has a pawn majority on the queenside, cannot have problems here - in the endgame his extra queenside pawn would matter a lot, while in the middlegame White does not seem able to generate any kingside activity. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. e3
{ This is a very solid variation for White and a more dangerous one than it might seem right now after he makes his timid-looking 4th move. White simply intends to develop with Bd3, Nc3. Then, depending on what we do, he might try to push e3-e4, or possibly d4-d5, shutting down the Black bishop on b7. Positions with IQP are very typical of this variation, as often Black plays ...c7-c5 followed by ...cxd4, ...d7-d5. These positions happen to be rather interesting and double-edged, both sides definitely have a lot of chances. Possibly, typical structures after ...d7-d5 followed by c4xd5 exd5 can occur, which can also result in an IQP or hanging pawns. At the same time, White might choose the more timid approach, related with Bd3, b2-b3, Bb2, Nbd2 or something like this. The good news about this line is that we would barely ever need to memorize precise sequences of moves. Instead, understanding of typical maneuvres is what would prove crucial for having good results in these positions. Let us dive in ! }
4... e6
{ The most normal move. This position may also occur via 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3, for example. By the way, in this specific move order 4... g6 also looks pretty interesting and unexplored, this is an alternative possibility you might want to investigate yourself at some point. }
5. Bd3 d5
{ This is the first important detail to remember, in my opinion. Why is it so important to start with d7-d5 ? The reason is simple: we want to develop our bishop to the better square on d6, as opposed to the more passive position on e7. This will especially matter if White chooses to take on d5.  Now White faces an important choice - whether to trade on d5, or to just continue developing - he can castle, play Nc3, whatever. This may transpose, as White can decide to take later on, but it may also not - for example, if Black chooses to trade on c4 quickly. }
6. O-O
{ I don't think Black has any problems after the popular moves ...Bd6 or ...Nbd7. However, I prefer the more straightforward approach, which releases the tension in the center and does not allow White to wait infinitely and then take on d5 at the moment of his choosing. }
6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 a6
{ The positions somewhat remind of Queen's Gambit Accepted. Black's idea now will be to combine development of his kingside  (...Be7, ...O-O)  as well as expansion on the quenside by means of ...b6-b5, ...c7-c5. A few structures may occur here: White might invite some symmetrical structure - say, when Black plays c5, White will take on c5. Normally symmetrical positions are not extremely complex from the strategical perspective, what matters most is how pieces are placed, so we will make sure we get this structure under the right circumstances. Another thing White can do, which is more ambitious, is to try and gain some space in the center by preparing the e3-e4 push. Then the pawn will either stay on e4, just controlling a lot of space, or will go to e5 - White will weaken some squares, but will seize even more space on the kingside and will try to benefit from that spacial advantage to create attacking chances. As we will see, however, the last plan is not something easy to execute, as Black's counterplay comes very fast. }

10. dxc5
{ This is a typical harmless move. Now we will really some pretty symmetrical position, where of course, we have no worries. }
10... Bxc5 11. a3 b5 12. Bd3 O-O 13. b4 Bd6
{ I like this active square better than the more passive one on e7. Black can now continue with ...Qe7, ...Nd7-b6-d5. However, this move was not played much. The only reason why it is the case is because it looks like White has some tactics up his sleeve...Does it work ? Let's see ! }
14. Bb2 Nb6 15. Nbd2 Qe7
{ The position is simply equal. I think the most logical thing that is about to follow is the massive trades over the c-file as well as the d-file - say, after Rac1 Rac8 Rxc8 etc. Then you will need to play an simplified equal middlegame/early endgame and show your strength and chess understanding : }

Also, Black can even consider kingside play - for example, his initiative on the kingside can appear and develop after such moves as ...Ne5, then the knights would get traded, then ...Rf7-Raf8 could be a reasonable plan. We could try to trade the dark-squared bishops with ...Bf4 at some point and put pressure on the e4-pawn. It is important to keep in mind that it would never be a good idea for White to play f2-f3 as all the dark squares, such as f4, g3 etc would become a lot weaker.

8... Nbd7 9. Rd1 c5
{ Now White faces a choice - whether to allow for ...b6-b5 at any moment when Black chooses to carry out this move, or stop it forever with a2-a4. }
10. Nc3
{ This is a normal developing move. However, now we use an opportunity to gain space on the queenside while also attacking the White pieces with tempi. }
10... b5 11. Bb3 Qc7
{ We would simply lke to play ...Be7 and castle, then we can continue with ...Rfd8, ...Rac8, for example. White should not play passively here, as then we get to execute our plan very easily. That is why the two principled moves for him are 12. e4 as well as 12. d5. }
12. e4 { This is the better plan than d4-d5. } 12... cxd4 13. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Black simply continues his development. } 14. Be3 O-O
{ Now we reach some pretty balanced situation. White has more space thanks to the e4-pawn, this pawn somewhat restricts our pieces - namely, the knight on f6 and the bishop on b7. However, Black has a lot of good squares for his pieces on the queenside, thanks to the spatial advantage provided by the b5-pawn. For example, the queen has a nice comfortable spot on b6. The Black knight can go to e5 and then to c4 at some point if this is possible, or to c6 in order to trade the White d4-knight. Now I would just give a few more natural moves for both sides which would demonstrate how these ideas are applied in practice. }
15. f3
{ White protects the e4-pawn one more time, making sure no nasty surprises ever happen to him. }
15... Rfd8 { Black simply activates the rook. } 16. Qf2
{ Taking the g1-a7 diagonal under additional control. } 16... Qb6 17. Rac1 Ne5
18. Nf5 { Forcing the trade in this curious way. } 18... Bxe3 19. Qxe3 Qxe3+
20. Nxe3 g5
{ The last important move. Now we have an endgame on the board, where White could hope to eventually advance with f3-f4, e4-e5. This would be quite an uncomfortable situation for Black who would need to retreat and drive his pieces back to passive positions. With the precise ...g7-g5 ! move, however, we prevent this plan, while preparing to gain even more space ourselves - say, eventually we can go for ...h7-h5, maybe ...Ng6-f4. The position is pretty balanced and complicated enough for both sides to have reasonable ambitions to play for a win. Our next moves can include ...Kf8-Ke7, centralizing the king and taking the d8-square under more control. Then the aforementioned play on the kingside might be something for us to consider. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. e3
{ This is a very solid variation for White and a more dangerous one than it might seem right now after he makes his timid-looking 4th move. White simply intends to develop with Bd3, Nc3. Then, depending on what we do, he might try to push e3-e4, or possibly d4-d5, shutting down the Black bishop on b7. Positions with IQP are very typical of this variation, as often Black plays ...c7-c5 followed by ...cxd4, ...d7-d5. These positions happen to be rather interesting and double-edged, both sides definitely have a lot of chances. Possibly, typical structures after ...d7-d5 followed by c4xd5 exd5 can occur, which can also result in an IQP or hanging pawns. At the same time, White might choose the more timid approach, related with Bd3, b2-b3, Bb2, Nbd2 or something like this. The good news about this line is that we would barely ever need to memorize precise sequences of moves. Instead, understanding of typical maneuvres is what would prove crucial for having good results in these positions. Let us dive in ! }
4... e6
{ The most normal move. This position may also occur via 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3, for example. By the way, in this specific move order 4... g6 also looks pretty interesting and unexplored, this is an alternative possibility you might want to investigate yourself at some point. }
5. Bd3 d5
{ This is the first important detail to remember, in my opinion. Why is it so important to start with d7-d5 ? The reason is simple: we want to develop our bishop to the better square on d6, as opposed to the more passive position on e7. This will especially matter if White chooses to take on d5.  Now White faces an important choice - whether to trade on d5, or to just continue developing - he can castle, play Nc3, whatever. This may transpose, as White can decide to take later on, but it may also not - for example, if Black chooses to trade on c4 quickly. }
6. cxd5
{ This is another interesting structure for us to learn and understand. Normally, White has several plans here: 1  Trying to install the knight on e5 and launch a kingside attack by means of such moves as f2-f4, Qf3-Qh3, Rf3, g2-g4-g5 etc. 2  Trade the dark-squared bishops with b3-Ba3, as his dark-squared bishop is locked inside the pawn chain. 3  This is usually connected with the second plan - White can try to put pressure on Black's hanging pawns on the d and c-files. So far, we don't have hanging pawns, but it is highly likely that we will after the eventual ...c7-c5 which can be met by dxc5. }
6... exd5 7. b3
{ This is an interesting move which is aimed at the quick bishop trade - as we know, White is often interested in swaping the dark-squared bishops. I believe Black can simply allow for a trade, but considering that the White king is still on e1, it makes sense to disrupt White's coordination by means of }
7... Bb4+ { The point is revealed after } 8. Nbd2
{ Now the White bishop cannot go to a3 as the knight is not protecting that square anymore. We simply continue our development. }
8... Nbd7 9. O-O Bd6 10. Bb2 Qe7
{ This is by no means a forced position, so several ways of playing are possible for each side on each move. I would like to mention a few things Black can aim to achieve: 1  Castle and install the knight on e4. Then, ...f7-f5 can often be a good idea if you want to play on the kingside. 2  If you want to reach a very tense position, it is worth playing ...c7-c5. First we castle, then go ...c5, Rac8, ...Rfd8, ... Ne4 and keep the tension in the center - both sides will have rich chances. 3  Another typical thing which Black can do when White has a pawn on b3 is ... a7-a5-a4. This can be a very annoying pawn advance as bxa4 spoils White's structure, while otherwise Black can keep the tension and release it whenever he wants - say, if White moves the rook from the a-file, letting Black invade. }
11. Qe2 a6
{ This is another detail I would like to show to you. It is possible to do without a6, but then Ba6 ! would be an interesting idea. Several squares in our camp, such as c6, are pretty weak, so White would like to trade its defender. With this move, we stop this idea. Later we would pursue ours. }
12. Rac1 O-O 13. Rfd1 Ne4
{ We obtained an interesting complex position, full of pieces, where both sides have a lot of winning chances. Yet, I think now it is easier to play with Black, as we can choose between the plan with ...f7-f5 and the one with ...c7-c5. Unless we do something, White would find it hard to create any play himself. }

Something you need to be very careful about is such ideas as Rc2 followed by Qc1, as then the exchange sacrifice Rxc7 ! might follow. Sometimes, such sacrifice simply destroys our whole queenside.

Instead, if you ever go ... g7-g6, playing ...c7-c5 is a dangerous idea, as dxc5 ! might follow, opening up the weakened long diagonal.

Normally, White has several plans here: 1  Trying to install the knight on e5 and launch a kingside attack by means of such moves as f2-f4, Qf3-Qh3, Rf3, g2-g4-g5 etc. 2  Trade the dark-squared bishops with b3-Ba3, as his dark-squared bishop is locked inside the pawn chain. 3  This is usually connected with the second plan - White can try to put pressure on Black's hanging pawns on the d and c-files. So far, we don't have hanging pawns, but it is highly likely that we will after the eventual ...c7-c5 which can be met by dxc5. }
6... exd5 7. O-O Bd6 8. Nc3
{ This is White's most common choice. He gives up the idea of b3-Ba3 for the sake of simple and logical development and keeps many options open. }
8... O-O 9. b3 a6 10. Bb2 Nbd7
{ Black's typical moves now will be ...Qe7, ...Re8. An interesting nuance here is that sometimes White can play Bf5 to put additional pressure on Black, especially on the d7-knight. This can be very important when our pawn is on c5 and when there is tension in the center. That is why a move you might want to spend a tempo on is ...g7-g6, as it prevents White's idea of Bf5. There is no need to do it right now, but in a few moves this can be a helpful idea to carry out. }
11. Rc1 Qe7 12. Ne2
{ The knight is going to g3 and then to f5, or it can go to f4 to attack the d5-pawn. Also, White opens up the rook on c1, intending to possibly double up. Something you need to be very careful about is such ideas as Rc2 followed by Qc1, as then the exchange sacrifice Rxc7 ! might follow. Sometimes, such sacrifice simply destroys our whole queenside. So please make sure you evaluate its consequences if you choose to allow it, or you simply go ...Rc8 or ...c5 to stop it. }
12... Ne4
{ White tried about 10 different moves here - of course, we would not study them all. There is just one important thing to understand, I think: you can choose the plan with . ..c7-c5, but then your pawn should stay on g7. Instead, if you ever go ... g7-g6, playing ...c7-c5 is a dangerous idea, as dxc5 ! might follow, opening up the weakened long diagonal. If your pawn is already on g6, you can stick to such plans as ...f7-f5. This can also be combined with the idea I had mentioned before- ...a7-a5-a4, putting pressure over the a-file. Let us look at some sample moves. }
13. Qc2
{ What is White's idea ? Let us make some passive useless move to see the whole point. }
13... Rac8
{ As you know from the line with 13... h6, White is attacking c7. So Black defends it. }
14. Ng3 f5 { Defending the knight on e4. } 15. Qe2
{ The a6-pawn is hanging, so White maneuvres, attacks the pawn and intends to place his pieces differently. }
15... b5
{ Is an interesting alternative - Black weakens his queenside, but he pretends that it doesn't matter as he will play ...g7-g5 and will go all-in on the kingside. This is actually a pretty interesting plan ! However, it is not the most solid one, so for the repertoire purposes I will be recomending ...Ra8. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. e3
{ This is a very solid variation for White and a more dangerous one than it might seem right now after he makes his timid-looking 4th move. White simply intends to develop with Bd3, Nc3. Then, depending on what we do, he might try to push e3-e4, or possibly d4-d5, shutting down the Black bishop on b7. Positions with IQP are very typical of this variation, as often Black plays ...c7-c5 followed by ...cxd4, ...d7-d5. These positions happen to be rather interesting and double-edged, both sides definitely have a lot of chances. Possibly, typical structures after ...d7-d5 followed by c4xd5 exd5 can occur, which can also result in an IQP or hanging pawns. At the same time, White might choose the more timid approach, related with Bd3, b2-b3, Bb2, Nbd2 or something like this. The good news about this line is that we would barely ever need to memorize precise sequences of moves. Instead, understanding of typical maneuvres is what would prove crucial for having good results in these positions. Let us dive in ! }
4... e6
{ The most normal move. This position may also occur via 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3, for example. By the way, in this specific move order 4... g6 also looks pretty interesting and unexplored, this is an alternative possibility you might want to investigate yourself at some point. }
5. Bd3 d5
{ This is the first important detail to remember, in my opinion. Why is it so important to start with d7-d5 ? The reason is simple: we want to develop our bishop to the better square on d6, as opposed to the more passive position on e7. This will especially matter if White chooses to take on d5.  Now White faces an important choice - whether to trade on d5, or to just continue developing - he can castle, play Nc3, whatever. This may transpose, as White can decide to take later on, but it may also not - for example, if Black chooses to trade on c4 quickly. }
6. cxd5
{ This is another interesting structure for us to learn and understand. Normally, White has several plans here: 1  Trying to install the knight on e5 and launch a kingside attack by means of such moves as f2-f4, Qf3-Qh3, Rf3, g2-g4-g5 etc. 2  Trade the dark-squared bishops with b3-Ba3, as his dark-squared bishop is locked inside the pawn chain. 3  This is usually connected with the second plan - White can try to put pressure on Black's hanging pawns on the d and c-files. So far, we don't have hanging pawns, but it is highly likely that we will after the eventual ...c7-c5 which can be met by dxc5. }

{ The a6-pawn is hanging, so White maneuvres, attacks the pawn and intends to place his pieces differently. }
15... Ra8 16. Rc2
{ Another point of playing Qe2 is that this square is vacant now. So White doubles up, preparing Rfc1. }
16... g6 17. Rfc1 c6
{ I think this is the most solid choice. A very strong Ukrainian GM, who is a big Queen's Indian expert, played 17... c5, which is good, but somewhat scary as the long diagonal may dangerously open up. I think we can stophere - the position is definitely very nice here for Black. As I had said before, he can either concentrate on the kingside attack or play more solid with ...a6-a5-a4. It is also important to know that the exchange sacrifice mentioned above  (Rxc7 or Rxc6)  makes no sense here, as White would need to invade c7 with his queen to create threats and justify it. The rook on c6, instead, would be absolutely useless - White would just end up an exchange down. }

{ So far both sides were just making logical moves and finishing their development. This is definitely one of the critical positions of our repertoire, as 3. Nc3 followed by 4. Qc2 is its most critical test. We have somewhat less space, White has the beautiful pawn center. However, we also have some positional pluses: for example, a queenside majority, which would become more important than the white center once we approach the endgame. Also, White's center will become less of an asset and more of a liability once some pieces are gone. That is why it is so important to make the following move for us. }
14... Bb4
{ The idea is to offer a trade with Bc3 ! As I had mentioned earlier, trading would be beneficial for us, because we have less space and our positional assets would become more important as we trade. I think that this position is roughly equal. White should perhaps allow for a trade and just keep making reasonable positional moves. For example, Bb1 looks decent, maybe intending Qd3 at some point. I suggest that we do not analyze reasonable positional play any further, as both sides have so many continuations and neither is critical - let us say, White can play Bb1, or a3, or h3, or Rc1, whatever he wants. But I did want to show you one line from here - it is important, as it demonstrates that White cannot break through directly in the center here, which means that our position is safe for sure. }

12... Qe7 13. O-O dxc6
{ The computer says that Black is absolutely winning, but I would not give such an evaluation - this is still a complicated position with all the pieces on the board, things can turn out differently. However, obviously Black's advantage is huge. He will simply develop the bishop, put the other rook on d8. White needs to watch out for ideas like ...Nh4-Nf5, for example. The pawns on f4 and c4 horribly weaken all the key squares and diagonals - for example, the h1-a8 diagonal is very weak, so is the square on e3. }

4... Ne5 5. e4 e6 6. Nc3 Bc5
{ These all were very natural moves. Actually, some really strong players have essayed other possiblities besides 6. ..Bc5, but to me it looks very natural to try and exploit the weak diagonal, that is why I choose this move. Now it is important to stop and think: if you were White, how would you develop and what would you do with your king ? In this regard, the plan Nh3-Nf2 looks very logical as it prepares castling. }
7. Nh3 O-O 8. Be2 Re8
{ Let us think about this position. Strategically, White is undoubtedly better as he has much more space. However, he is behind in development, so our task is to benefit from this fact. How will we do this ? Obviously, by opening the position up. ...Re8 is a move that will definitely prove useful as the center and the e-file specifically will inevitably open up very soon. }
9. f4
{ Another logical move, this is definitely the most ambitious attempt that White can go for. Now I came up with some really-really beautiful idea that I would love to introduce to you. }
9... Ng6 10. e5
{ White goes for it. However, if he doesn't, then playing f3-f4 a move earlier made no sense. }
10... exd5 11. cxd5 Bb7
{ Actually, Black could instead go Nh4, but as sacrificing a piece is good, I prefer to insist on the sacrifice. Now White has a choice - either to accept the sacrifice, or try to castle by playing Nf2. }
12. exf6 { Now White has to be brave and has to accept the sacrifice. } 12...
Qxf6
{ Black is very well coordinated and is ready to create more threats with ...Ba6, ...Re7 followed by ...Rae8, with ...Nh4 or ...Qh4+. White has to walk on a very thin line to survive. I will just give the best line for him, which saves his position - other moves are possible, but we cannot analyze 5-10 deviations on each move, so I would just reassure you that if he goes wrong, we will be nearly winning immediately. }
13. Nf2 Nxf4
{ We already have two pawns for a piece, so there is not much to worry about. Now the threat is ...Nxe2 followed by ...Ba6, winning a piece back. So White has no choice but to take. }
14. Bxf4 Bxf2+ 15. Kxf2 Qxf4+ 16. Bf3 Qe3+ { Now we simply force a perpetual. }
17. Kg3 Qg5+ 18. Kf2 Qe3+
{ In my opinion, this is a very flashy and exciting line. Both sides have be to accurate and careful, but in my opinion, it is much more enjoyable to be Black who is attacking and having all the fun, while being just a pawn down at most, techincally speaking  (he usually has two pawns for a piece)  . White can maintain the balance, but he has to be extremely precise, and usually defending is much more difficult than attacking. I feel that our play and all the moves that Black makes in this line are very natural and intuitive, so handling this variation should not be too difficult a task. }

{ This is the most testing and challenging answer to our repertoire. Basically, it was only after finding a good reaction to this move that I realized I could make the whole repertoire work for Black. White's move is very straightforward - he simply intends to seize the whole center with e2-e4. Now, it is not so clear what Black should do. Actually, many superGMs tried several moves, such as 3... e6 or 3... Bb7, but 3... Nc6 is definitely the main move and the best one. Black prepares the e7-e5 break, that is why he needs to develop the knight on a slightly weird square. }
3... Nc6
{ Now White has several possible continuations. I believe that 4. Nc3, which is the main move, is the best option at White's disposal. However, two other moves - 4. d5 as well as 4. e4 - also lead to a highly interesting and complicated game, so they should also be checked carefully. }
4. e4
{ This is possible, but just compare this line with 4. Nc3 and 5. d5 - it is almost the same thing, but instead of going to e7, our knight gets to jump to the fabulous square on d4 ! Of course, this must be a much worse version for White, compared with 4. Nc3 }
4... e5 5. d5 Nd4 6. Nc3
{ Now it is possible to develop with the simple ...Bc5, ...O-O. After these logical moves, we can try ...Nh5, going for some rapid kingside attack, followed by ...Qh4 etc. Or we can choose to play more positionally - say, we can push ...c7-c5, making the knight on d4 a rock-solid piece. This is by no means a critical line so I will give just one variation. }
6... Bc5 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Nge2 Nh5
{ Leads to an initiative for Black, as ...Qh4 is about to come with a strong effect and White is unable to castle. This feels very shaky for the first player. }

{ Reaching the typical Nimzo-like blocked position, where White bishops are not particularly impressive, while Black enjoys prospects of a better endgame thanks to White's weak queenside pawns. He will simply play ...d7-d6, ...Nd7-c5 and eventually .. .f7-f5 with a very nice game. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. f3
{ This is the most testing and challenging answer to our repertoire. Basically, it was only after finding a good reaction to this move that I realized I could make the whole repertoire work for Black. White's move is very straightforward - he simply intends to seize the whole center with e2-e4. Now, it is not so clear what Black should do. Actually, many superGMs tried several moves, such as 3... e6 or 3... Bb7, but 3... Nc6 is definitely the main move and the best one. Black prepares the e7-e5 break, that is why he needs to develop the knight on a slightly weird square. }
3... Nc6
{ Now White has several possible continuations. I believe that 4. Nc3, which is the main move, is the best option at White's disposal. However, two other moves - 4. d5 as well as 4. e4 - also lead to a highly interesting and complicated game, so they should also be checked carefully. }
4. Nc3 e5 5. d5
{ The most critical continuation - White takes all the space he can, while not allowing for ...Nd4. }
5... Ne7 6. e4 Ng6 7. Be3
{ Now we reach a very interesting situation. To be honest, the whole idea of me creating this course was based on the question whether I would be able to find a good setup for Black here or not. The statistics might look fine for Black, but the position is very tricky - the position is pretty closed now, and White's spacial advantage might become a rather problematic thing for us unless we find some precise moves and clear plan how to develop our pieces and what to do. }
7... Bc5
{ Black immediately starts fighting for a very important diagonal. Now, in most games White chose to keep the tension with 8. Qd2. Sometimes, however, he chose to take on c5 - I do not have much faith in this move, but we will analyze it anyway, of course. The issue with taking is that Black now gets an open b-file, which is a clear improvement of his position }
8. Qd2 d6 9. O-O-O
{ This is the position that most games have reached. I think it is important to understand what our plan would look like - apparently, as strong GMs made many different moves, such as ...Bd7, ...Bxe3, ...h6, ...h5, ....a6 - they had very different opinions on what Black's plan should look like. I think that we need to either opt for ...f7-f5, or try to get chances on the queenside. It is likely that the dark-squared bishops will get traded - we could even trade now, if we wanted ! - so c5 would become a vacant square. I think that our knight would look great there, because either we would support it with ...a7-a5 and then we would use it to control the e4-square as well as d3, which are very important squares in the White camp, or often we would simply put it on c5 without ...a7-a5, as playing b2-b4 looks very dangerous for White. Based on this logic, you would understand my next move. }
9... Nd7 10. Bd3 Bxe3 11. Qxe3 Nc5
{ We have reached some pretty normal position. Now our plan is to castle and to prepare ...f7-f5. White can part with the bishop  (we are not forced to take it, just in case !)  , or can retreat. To be honest, the character of the position would not change much, so I would not overload you with too many additional variations here, let us just follow what happens after a few sensible moves by both sides. }
12. Bc2 O-O 13. Nge2 a5
{ Black is ready to push ...f7-f5. White can react differently, I will try to show you a few different maneuvres that we have at our disposal here, depending on what White does. }
14. g4 h6
{ With the idea of ...Qg5. Indeed, White managed to stop the ...f7-f5 break, but he placed too many pawns on the light squares and if the queens are ever traded, he will get a clearly inferior endgame, which is an excellent piece of news for Black. }

While I think that with extremely precise play White can keep some advantage in these lines, he needs to play rather creatively and be alert to avoid our traps.

{ This was suggested by Boris Avrukh in his 1. d4 ! repertoire book. I agree that this is the best possibility at White's disposal. White is clearly wanting to push the pawn farher - to h5 with a tempo and then to h6. At this point, we have three reasonable continuations. We will analyze them all, so you can choose the type of position that you like best. It is important to know that Avrukh considers only 7... h6 and doesn't analyze other possibilities, which means any opponent, even the best-prepared one, will already be out of book by this point. Besides that, I would like to mention that White doesn't have many sensible moves, as the knight on e2 prevents him from developing his kingside pieces, while the c1-bishop cannot go to e3 anymore. Moving it to g5, on the other hand, does not make much sense as ...h7-h6 will always come handy. }

{ The computer is stubbornly claiming that White is better. I am not qualified to disagree with the engine from the objective perspective - of course, if I tried to defend Black's cause, the computer would beat me. However, look at this position with human eyes ! As I am looking at it, I keep thinking that things are very murky. White's h4-pawn is extremely weak, his f-pawns provide us with an outpost on f6 for our pieces. Interestingly, our king will be perfectly safe on f8. What should White's plan be, if we want to describe it in words ? I can hardly answer, as playing on the queenside will weaken the White king, while the kingside play is barely possible because of White's bad pawn structure. Again, the engine is able to find some precise moves and ideas that question our setup, but in a practical game I would think our chances are not slim at all. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. f3
{ This is a 'brother' of 3. f3, this move also happens to be rather decent. However, thanks to the presence of the white knight on c3, Black is able to generate counterplay more easily by swapping this knight, moving the white pawn from b2 to c3, and later attacking the white center with c7-c5. Let us see, how the game can develop. }
4... d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ So far things have been more or less forced - White always takes on d5. Now, however, he already has a choice. Here I have managed to easily neutralize the main continuation that White usually goes for. However, as I was exploring the alternatives, I realized White has a more dangerous idea at his disposal - he can play 6. Nxd5 !, preventing Black from taking on c3. This keeps White with the more solid center, and makes it more difficult for us to challenge his center. However, we still manage to generate sufficient counterplay, I believe. }
6. Nxd5
{ This is a rather dangerous move, even though in my opinion it is not an obvious continuation. In order to make such a move, White needs to understand the nuances of the structure when his pawn is on c3 very well, and he needs to realize that having this visually powerful and beautiful center is not neccessarily a good thing. }
6... Qxd5 7. e4
{ White takes the center. Now, we would again first concentrate on development. After some logical developing moves for both sides, we would start attacking the White center. }
7... Qd7 8. Be3 e6
{ Again White faces the same problem. The pawn on f3 is a nice asset which makes White's center better protected. However, this pawn makes it really difficult for White to develop his kingside pieces ! That is why the bishop needs to get developed first, then the white knight goes to e2. }
9. Bc4 c5
{ We are fully ready to make this move, there is no need to wait. However, the developing Be7 is possible, too. Now, White has a choice - whether to just continue developing with Ne2, or to spoil our structure by taking on c5. Instead, trying to push d4-d5 quickly is bad, as we will see in the variations: White is simply not ready and cannot justify such active play. }
10. d5 b5

11. Bb3 { Is even worse as it lets Black gain even more tempi } 11... c4 12.
Bc2 exd5 13. exd5
{ And here comes the critical moment. Somehow if we take on d5, White will be able to castle long quickly and get a decent compensation. However, in the long run his pawn is incredibly weak and for sure will be eventually lost. This is why it is so important not to be greedy and to instead concentrate on development for now. }

However, Black can develop pretty fast: his king will go to e7, the knight will come to b6 or to e5. We have a semi-open b-file to create counterplay on: we can easily attack the b2-pawn. If White ever goes b2-b3, the typical plan would be a7-a5-a4, which would also create some pawn weaknesses for White and open up some files on the queenside. Importantly, White's pieces also are not placed well to attack the pawn: for example, his knight is far from d3 or b3, he cannot easily double on the c-file. Based on all these factors, we can definitely conclude Black should have a good position here. However, now we need to prove it with moves ! }
13. Ne2 Ke7 14. Kf2 Ne5 { We are first to create threats ! } 15. Rac1 Rhd8
{ Now White cannot play Rhd1 as it would hang his bishop; ...Rd2 is a big idea for us. White definitely does not have the time to enjoy his better structure. }
16. Ke3 { The only good move I can think of. } 16... Rd6
{ Intending to simply double up. It is hard for me to say what White should do here, as moving his bishop allows for ...Rd3, for example. Playing f3-f4 is not good because of either Ng4+, of because Black can take the bishop and then benefit from White's weakened structure. }
17. Rc3
{ I really like this deep move. White is taking additional care of the d3-square and preparing Rhc1, doubling up on the c-file, hoping to eventually attack and win the c5-pawn. }
17... Rad8 18. Rhc1 f5
{ Now we have multiple threats - starting with the simple ...fxe4 fxe4 Ng4+, for example. The position is roughly balanced - Black has to keep in mind that if he plays passively, the weak c5-pawn might become a bit of an issue, while White has to be precise in order not to run into some devastating attack or some nasty check/fork, whatever. }

{ Black is about to finish his development and then play c7-c5, undermining the White center. Here I would like you to stop for a moment and look at the position, because there is something surprising and fascinating about it. At the first glance, White's center looks very impressive. But, if you have the White pieces here, once you try to come up with a move, you realize that it is not so easy to understand how to set up your pieces ! The main reason for this problem is the pawn on f3 - the knight cannot come there. That is why White's most likely setup would involve something like Bd3 and Ne2. However, the knight is not placed actively on e2, it would not have many squares to go to and it would only play a defensive role, protecting the d4-pawn. The white d3-bishop would not be a very active piece as well. Black, on the other hand, gets to counterattack the White center easily, which provides him with easy play and sufficient counterchances. I suggest that we rather concentrate on ideas as opposed to specific move orders. In this position, White's very main move by far has been 8. Be3. Of course, he can also keep the bishop on the initial square for a while, but our setup will be the same regardless. }

{ Black can continue with normal developing moves from here: the queen can go to c7 or d7, the rooks will most likely come to c8 and d8. On the other hand, it is not so easy to determine what White should do. To me these positions resemble Grunfeld a lot, and a very typical move I can think of for White is Rc1 - the idea is to prepare for the eventual opening of the c-file. Besides that, White also gets ready to retreat to b1 with the bishop, if it is ever attacked, as we will see in the line. However, we should also study what happens if White tries some attacking play - say, f3-f4 followed by some f4-f5. This only weakens White's position, but we still need to understand how to react correctly. }
12. f4
{ White might be tempted to get some play over the f-file. Indeed, pushing the f-pawn may look like a logical plan. However, if you think about it, it turns out Black has no weaknesses on the kingside. On the other hand, by pushing the f-pawn White does create some weaknesses for himself - for example, the e4-pawn becomes much more vulnerable. It is no surprise that Black can simply keep pursuing his plan, based on the queenside play, for now, and ignore White's naive attacking attempts. }
12... cxd4 13. cxd4 Rc8
{ Now White should rather switch to defense on the queenside. In that case, he would be only a tiny bit worse. Instead, going all-in with f4-f5 results in even more serious problems: }
14. f5 exf5 15. Rxf5 Nb4
{ The e4-pawn is very weak now, White cannot keep both his center and his important light-squared bishop. }
16. Bb1
{ The only way White can preserve the bishop, but now the rook on a1 must feel rather bad. }
16... Qc7
{ The next move will be Nc2, forcing the bishop trade and exposing the tremendous weakness of the e4-pawn and of the h1-a8 diagonal overall. Our b7-bishop comes pretty handy. Black is clearly better. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. f3
{ This is a 'brother' of 3. f3, this move also happens to be rather decent. However, thanks to the presence of the white knight on c3, Black is able to generate counterplay more easily by swapping this knight, moving the white pawn from b2 to c3, and later attacking the white center with c7-c5. Let us see, how the game can develop. }
4... d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ So far things have been more or less forced - White always takes on d5. Now, however, he already has a choice. Here I have managed to easily neutralize the main continuation that White usually goes for. However, as I was exploring the alternatives, I realized White has a more dangerous idea at his disposal - he can play 6. Nxd5 !, preventing Black from taking on c3. This keeps White with the more solid center, and makes it more difficult for us to challenge his center. However, we still manage to generate sufficient counterplay, I believe. }
6. e4
{ This is the main move by far, but here we achieve a good position fairly easily. }
6... Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6
{ Black is about to finish his development and then play c7-c5, undermining the White center. Here I would like you to stop for a moment and look at the position, because there is something surprising and fascinating about it. At the first glance, White's center looks very impressive. But, if you have the White pieces here, once you try to come up with a move, you realize that it is not so easy to understand how to set up your pieces ! The main reason for this problem is the pawn on f3 - the knight cannot come there. That is why White's most likely setup would involve something like Bd3 and Ne2. However, the knight is not placed actively on e2, it would not have many squares to go to and it would only play a defensive role, protecting the d4-pawn. The white d3-bishop would not be a very active piece as well. Black, on the other hand, gets to counterattack the White center easily, which provides him with easy play and sufficient counterchances. I suggest that we rather concentrate on ideas as opposed to specific move orders. In this position, White's very main move by far has been 8. Be3. Of course, he can also keep the bishop on the initial square for a while, but our setup will be the same regardless. }

14. Bb1
{ This is a reasonable move, especially after Rc1. White understands the bishop will not be too active for now, but at least it would never get hit by some pawn push or attacked by the black piece. }
14... Rc8 { We simply occupy the only open file. } 15. Qd2
{ If White ignores the knight for now and simply keeps making developing moves - like Qd2, which connects the rooks - we can do the same. }
15... Qd7
{ Black connects his rooks with this move, too. I would recommend that you read annotations to 15. a3 to better understand what our plan is, where the pieces go and whether we are happy to trade or not. White can try different moves here, but the character of the game remains the same. }
16. Rxc8 Rxc8 17. Rc1 Rxc1+ 18. Qxc1 Ba6
{ As it typically happens in this structure, if White attempts to trade pieces and simplify, Black ends up with advantage. He is ready to either trade queens or keep them for now - for example, our queen can go to such nice spots as b5 or a4. Again, annotations to the line with 15. a3 are extensive enough, they explain all the plans and ideas we have, so please check those out. All those guidelines apply to this position, too, just as any similar one. }

Nc6
{ Also looks great for Black. Now our plan can consist of following moves: Qd8-d6, Rf8-d8 or Rf8-c8, Nc6-a5, Bb7-a6. All of our pieces will be very active, while White still has issues to resolve: for example, his knight on e2 is inactive, but cannot be easily improved, as it has to defend the d4-pawn. The bishop on b1 is not doing much, either. As I keep reminding during the entire course, in this structure exchanges favour Black, as he has an extra pawn on the queenside - once we trade many pieces, the role of the outside passed pawn on the queenside will become more and more significant. And it is very likely that the heavy pieces will get traded soon over the c-file. Aiming for trades is another clear plan you can try to pursue from here. }

1. Nf3
{ Of course, we will stick with our Queen's Indian setups against 1. Nf3 and 1. c4, too. In this chapter, we will analyze two fairly dangerous setups which White may try: Anti-QID with 6. Re1, when White tries to keep the pawn on d2 for a while, and KIA, which is characterized by a setup with White pawns on d3 and e4. The first option is rather challenging theoretically, even though we have a firm road to a safe position, while the second one is known to lead to numerous equal position where everything comes to the understanding of typical plans as opposed to the concrete knowledge. }
1... Nf6 2. g3
{ We will analyze only King's Indian Attack via this move order, even though obviously White can play c2-c4 later and tranpose to positions discussed via the move order with 2. c4. }
2... b6 3. Bg2 Bb7 4. O-O e6
{ Now 5. d4 or 5. c4 would tranpose to the positions studied either elsewhere in this chapter, or elsewhere in the repertoire, so let's concentrate on 5. d3 followed by e2-e4. }
5. d3 d5
{ Here the main move is, of course, 6. Nbd2, but White can play e2-e4 immediately, too. }
6. e4
{ I cannot say I am a bit fan of this move for White, as it is likely to result to the positions far less complicated strategically than the ones with delayed e2-e4. }
6... dxe4
{ Now White has two moves - 7. Nfd2 or 7. Ng5, but the key question is this one: is White going to recapture the pawn with the knight or with the d3-pawn ? If White takes back with the knight, he would get a well-known pawn structure where he is simply worse, so taking with the pawn is the only reasonable strategic decision. However, it feels all these operations don't yield all that much, but cost a lot of time. More time than White should be spending here. }
7. Nfd2 h5
{ There were many other sane continuations available, while this one is nearly a novelty - it was played once only by a 1700-rated player. The White knight went quite far from the kingside, so Black is starting an attack, or at least is scaring White. And, even if the queens get traded, the idea of opening up the h-file would still remain very reasonable from our perspective, so this is a very multifunctional move. Now White can get his pawn back or try to stop us with 8. h4, which is what he did in the only game that saw this move. }
8. Nxe4 Nxe4
{ Instead ,...Nc6 again keeps more tension, but there is nothing wrong with going to the better endgame. }
9. Bxe4 Bxe4 10. dxe4 Nc6
{ Now playing Qxd8 is not so attractive as it helps Black develop, while avoiding the trade is a scary decision because ...h5-h4, ...Qf6, ...O-O-O are the very simple attacking moves that will put White under a lot of pressure. Whatever White does, he would struggle a lot. }

{ A somewhat ugly move, but it deals with the threat efficiently. That's all that matters. }
16. Bf4 Bc6
{ We need to play ...Nd7 or ...Na6 and we don't want his rook on d7, so this move is needed. Now we arrive at some interesting unexplored position, where the engine claims that White has compensation, but I would much rather be Black. White's initiative is never going to grow too much, at best he would be able to get his pawn back, that's it. Our next moves can be ...Na6, ...Kf8  (in order to protect the bishop)  , ... Rad8. Conclusion: 6. Re1 is a very interesting variation, and if Black is not careful, White often gets an impressive center or a dangerous passed pawn on the d-file. However, I think that Black has several good options, one of them being the somewhat mysterious move 11... Re8, which doesn't define the position of our knight yet. Also, it stops d4-d5, which is one of White's main ideas. I think that if we know the game Wei Yi - Eljanov and boldly follow my suggested improvement, when we simply win White's central pawn and make a few precise moves after that, Black should be perfectly fine and can think of more than mere equality. }

1. c4 b6

As our task is to get into our repertoire vs 1. d4 and not somewhere else  (for example, we don't want to play Nimzo Indian or Anti-Nimzo Indian)  , this is the only move that allows us to stay within our repertoire. The good news is that we will need to learn only very few lines here as most work has already been done in the chapters devoted to 1. d4 and 1. Nf3 ! }
2. Nc3 Bb7 3. e4 e5
{ This is pretty much the only independent position that White can get with 1. c4 against our repertoire. In my opinion, this shows how rewarding and well-built our repertoire is ! With his last move, Black fights for the center, stops d2-d4. This is exactly the moment when we reach interesting crossroads. White has several exciting possibilities. By the way, I would highly recommend that you study games of Georg Meier, as he is a big expert with Black in this position. So if you want to expand your knowledge, definitely take a look at what he does here, he knows his way around very well ! }

1. c4 b6
{ I understand that it might seem weird to award the first move with an exclamation mark or to give extensive explanations after it, but in this case it is very appropriate. Basically, 1. Nf3 and 1. c4 are the moves often used by 1. d4 players as possibly beneficial move orders that allow to cut some Black's possibilities or give an opportunity to trick Black into some variation he doesn't play with a cunning move order. As our task is to get into our repertoire vs 1. d4 and not somewhere else  (for example, we don't want to play Nimzo Indian or Anti-Nimzo Indian)  , this is the only move that allows us to stay within our repertoire. The good news is that we will need to learn only very few lines here as most work has already been done in the chapters devoted to 1. d4 and 1. Nf3 ! }
2. Nc3 Bb7 3. e4 e5
{ This is pretty much the only independent position that White can get with 1. c4 against our repertoire. In my opinion, this shows how rewarding and well-built our repertoire is ! With his last move, Black fights for the center, stops d2-d4. This is exactly the moment when we reach interesting crossroads. White has several exciting possibilities. By the way, I would highly recommend that you study games of Georg Meier, as he is a big expert with Black in this position. So if you want to expand your knowledge, definitely take a look at what he does here, he knows his way around very well ! }
4. f4
{ This might look funny and premature, but in fact, this is a very dangerous continuation. Basically, White is trying a thing similar to King's Gambit, with the only difference that White made moves c2-c4 and Nc3, while Black played ...b7-b6 and ...Bb7. As we can see, the bishop on b7 is not particularly useful yet, so conceptually White's idea makes a ton of sense. }
4... exf4 5. Nf3 g5
{ White was going to take the center with d2-d4, so we defend the f4-pawn in advance and prepare ...g5-g4. }
6. d4
{ To my big surprise, this move, which is the only logical and consistent continuation of White's previous play, is a novelty ! }
6... g4
{ This is the most forcing path. Now White has a choice between a roughly balanced endgame and a highly ambitious, yet very risky, piece sacrifice. }
7. Ne5 { This is the line that would lead to the endgame quickly. } 7... Qh4+
8. g3 fxg3 9. Qxg4 Qxg4 10. Nxg4
{ Now Black is a pawn up, but White has a strong center and a slight lead in development. That is why it's wise not to take on h2, but to concentrate on the rapid development instead. }
10... Nc6 11. d5 Nd4 { Now ...Nc2 is an obvious threat. } 12. Kd2
{ Here Black has a nice choice between two good moves - ...f7-f5 and ...h7-h5. I think, however, that having one nice solution is good enough : }
12... f5 13. exf5 Nxf5 14. Bd3 Nge7
{ Black is going to castle long and White has to stop it. } 15. Nf6+ Kf7
{ It is best to sacrifice the pawn in order to coordinate our pieces well. }
16. Nxd7 g2 17. Rg1 Bh6+ 18. Kd1 Bg7
{ The knight on d7 is trapped ! However, White can escape with it by taking on g2, then sacrificing an exchange on g7 to get the e5-square. I was very excited about the analysis of this fascinating position and realized we went somewhat too deeply, as the position after 4  (!)  moves is already extremely rare. Well, that should make you ready for any kind of surprises, now hopefully you understand very well where our pieces should go in this variation and what the typical positional ideas and tactical patterns are. }

4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Be2 { White is simply developing - this makes a lot of sense. }
5... Bc5 6. O-O
{ This is a logical calm move, but I don't think it poses as many problems as 6. Nxe5, as now Black can easily develop his pieces to great positions. Please, bear in mind that even though White grabbed space, he also generously gave us an outpost on d4 which we would happily use soon. }
6... d6 7. a3
{ To play b2-b4 is natural, especially because the c5-bishop is pretty short on squares. }
7... a5 { Of course, we stop White's idea. } 8. d3 Nge7 9. Rb1 O-O
{ Now many continuations make sense, but it's a very rare position so we will only analyze White's main one. Our key idea, as the pawn structure and the position of the knight on e7 strongly suggest, is to push ...f7-f5. Besides that, it would also be nice to occupy the d4-square with our knight. }

1. c4 b6
{ I understand that it might seem weird to award the first move with an exclamation mark or to give extensive explanations after it, but in this case it is very appropriate. Basically, 1. Nf3 and 1. c4 are the moves often used by 1. d4 players as possibly beneficial move orders that allow to cut some Black's possibilities or give an opportunity to trick Black into some variation he doesn't play with a cunning move order. As our task is to get into our repertoire vs 1. d4 and not somewhere else  (for example, we don't want to play Nimzo Indian or Anti-Nimzo Indian)  , this is the only move that allows us to stay within our repertoire. The good news is that we will need to learn only very few lines here as most work has already been done in the chapters devoted to 1. d4 and 1. Nf3 ! }
2. Nc3 Bb7 3. e4 e5
{ This is pretty much the only independent position that White can get with 1. c4 against our repertoire. In my opinion, this shows how rewarding and well-built our repertoire is ! With his last move, Black fights for the center, stops d2-d4. This is exactly the moment when we reach interesting crossroads. White has several exciting possibilities. By the way, I would highly recommend that you study games of Georg Meier, as he is a big expert with Black in this position. So if you want to expand your knowledge, definitely take a look at what he does here, he knows his way around very well ! }
4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4
{ White feels ready to fight for the center. He hopes that he would be able to protect the center and stabilize the position, then he would have a large advantage thanks to extra space and Black's bishop on b7, which would be an extremely passive piece. However, after deep analysis I understood that the arising positions are much easier for Black to handle. I, actually, don't like this move at all for White anymore ! }
5... exd4 6. Nxd4 Bb4
{ Of course, Black is not going to just develop passively, waiting for White to realize all of his ambitions. Now White always needs to watch out for ...Bxc3, which would make the queenside pawns incredibly weak. Apparently, there is no conclusion what move is best in this position, as several strong White players tried about 5-6 different continuations and a few more, which were never essayed, also make sense ! We will analyze the most reasonable moves. }
7. Be3
{ This is another popular possibility. Again, we aim for the same type of position, where we give up the b4-bishop for the knight and spoil White's structure. I would say here it's a better version for White than after 7. Nxc6, because there is a pair of knights on the board. It is favourable exactly for White to have these knights, as his position is bad strategically, which means he needs to look for dynamic options and ideas - having more pieces helps achieve this goal. }
7... Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Nge7
{ I prefer to have my knight here, as on f6 it can get either pinned with Bg5, or kicked with e4-e5 at some point. The position is very fresh, only two games reached this position, so it's somewhat difficult to predict what White would do, so let's analyze the most natural continuation. }
9. Be2
{ This was played once, and here I want to suggest a very logical improvement 0-1  (39)  Melaugh,S  (2207)  -Tarun,K  (2320)  Dublin 2020 }
9... Nxd4 10. cxd4 Bxe4
{ That's why taking on d4 is so good - because White has to recapture with the bishop, unless he wants to lose a pawn, and thus has no way to improve his pawn structure. Now Black is simply a pawn up. White might have some compensation, as he has got a pair of bishops, but this is clearly not enough. }

{ As I said earlier, it is highly beneficial for us to trade pieces as White's attacking potential diminishes with every single trade.

{ The pawn on e4 is already hanging, and Black also wants to simply continue his development with ....Nf6. Now it makes sense for White to either take, or to play a2-a3, clarifying the intentions of the bishop. I think ... f7-f5 is a very logical move because with Nde2 White made it very difficult for himself to castle - it will take him several more moves now. That is why it makes a lot of sense to open up the position ! }
8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. Nxc3 fxe4 10. Be2
{ White has to be ready to play a pawn up for a while. } 10... Nf6 11. O-O Ne5
{ Our next moves will be ...Qe7, ...d6, ...O-O. It is not easy at all for White to get his pawn back ! The engine thinks White has compensation, but from the human perspective this is very debatable, to put it mildly. }

1. c4 b6
{ I understand that it might seem weird to award the first move with an exclamation mark or to give extensive explanations after it, but in this case it is very appropriate. Basically, 1. Nf3 and 1. c4 are the moves often used by 1. d4 players as possibly beneficial move orders that allow to cut some Black's possibilities or give an opportunity to trick Black into some variation he doesn't play with a cunning move order. As our task is to get into our repertoire vs 1. d4 and not somewhere else  (for example, we don't want to play Nimzo Indian or Anti-Nimzo Indian)  , this is the only move that allows us to stay within our repertoire. The good news is that we will need to learn only very few lines here as most work has already been done in the chapters devoted to 1. d4 and 1. Nf3 ! }
2. Nc3 Bb7 3. e4 e5
{ This is pretty much the only independent position that White can get with 1. c4 against our repertoire. In my opinion, this shows how rewarding and well-built our repertoire is ! With his last move, Black fights for the center, stops d2-d4. This is exactly the moment when we reach interesting crossroads. White has several exciting possibilities. By the way, I would highly recommend that you study games of Georg Meier, as he is a big expert with Black in this position. So if you want to expand your knowledge, definitely take a look at what he does here, he knows his way around very well ! }
4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4
{ White feels ready to fight for the center. He hopes that he would be able to protect the center and stabilize the position, then he would have a large advantage thanks to extra space and Black's bishop on b7, which would be an extremely passive piece. However, after deep analysis I understood that the arising positions are much easier for Black to handle. I, actually, don't like this move at all for White anymore ! }
5... exd4 6. Nxd4 Bb4
{ Of course, Black is not going to just develop passively, waiting for White to realize all of his ambitions. Now White always needs to watch out for ...Bxc3, which would make the queenside pawns incredibly weak. Apparently, there is no conclusion what move is best in this position, as several strong White players tried about 5-6 different continuations and a few more, which were never essayed, also make sense ! We will analyze the most reasonable moves. }
7. Be2
{ Another logical move - White just wants to finish his development. There is no wonder we again follow our logical path of spoiling the opponent's structure. However, now I think there is an even better way for us to do that ! }
7... Bxc3+
{ Is a very good move as well. If you want to keep things simple, you can just continue this way ! }

I would not say that White's position is already falling apart, but he has no active ideas at all and simply needs to wait until we decide to do something active. I would hate to be White here ! }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 c5
{ I feel that this is a very challenging way to meet the Trompowsky. Please, fasten your seatbelts as the arising positions are extremely murky and fun to play. I would ironically add, that in my opinion, Black is having more fun :  I feel that the only real test of 2... c5 is 3. d5 when White is willing to offer a pawn sacrifice after 3... Qb6 4. Nc3 ! We are not going to enter that line which gives White initiative, instead, we will opt for something very rare and interesting. 3. Bxf6 is the positional path, but I firmly believe that Black has multiple ways to achieve a good position after that move. Other continuations also exist, for example, 3. Nc3, championed by Rapport, and 3. e3 which is just a passive move. However, our focus should definitely mostly be on 3. d5 and 3. Bxf6, as other moves fail to impress. }

e6 5. Nf3 Bxc5 6. e3 d5
{ This is just a normal playable position, where Black's kingside is slightly weakened but he has the pair of bishops in return. Both sides will simply make normal moves now and there is no need to know anything specific. For example, a logical way of development for both would be }
7. Be2 Nc6 8. O-O O-O
{ White does not have any attackers on the kingside and will never get them there. Besides that, he already gave up his potentially dangerous dark-squared bishop. That is why Black need not fear to castle - his king is perfectly safe there. }
9. c4
{ Now most GM games continued with the solid 9... dxc4, but 9... d4 is a more interesting approach if you want a fight. I will show the most solid option, though. }
9... dxc4 10. Qc2 f5 11. Qxc4 Qb6 12. Nc3 Qb4
{ All these moves were not forced, but definitely were logical. Now Black offers a queen trade, which would be very beneficial as his bishop pair will prove to be very strong in the endgame. The position is roughly balanced, I would say, even though it's complex enough for any side to hope to outplay the opponent. }

6. g3
{ This is the more reserved way of handling the position with White. Instead of grabbing space with 6. c4, he plans to put his pawn on c3 to restrict the g7-bishop. This makes sense, now an interesting playable position arises. The good and bad news about Tromposky from White's perspective is that there is plenty of such positions, and Black has a pretty large choice, typically. It can be good news for people who prefer to avoid theoretical battles, but in my opinion, it is also bad news as there's no advantage in any of these lines, and it is normally Black who dictates what type of position will arise, so White just has to be ready for a complicated game without theory each time. From Black's perspective I find this situation rather appealing, because of a few reasons: 1  We don't need to remember long concrete lines 2  The positions are complicated enough, there is plenty of chances to outplay the opponent and win the game. The pieces are not getting traded quickly. }

{ Then we can bring the queen all the way back to g7, castle and fear nothing. I am a big fan of winning pawns whenever there is no concrete threats, specific reasons not to or some clear positional compensation. The engine might be able to somehow handle this with White and prove compensation, but most human players will find it much easier to be Black in this situation - he faces no threats, develops and just intends to simplify and win with his extra pawn. }

{ Now there are a few ideas which I would like to show you. } 9. Qc2
{ This is the main move, and the one that Vitiugov made. Fortunately, Black has may possible answers, but I would again be recommending this structure where we provoke White to take dxe6 fxe6 and get this pawn mass in the center. }
9... Nf6 10. Bd3 e5
{ This is much more forcing that 10... e7-e6 as it creates a positional threat of ...e5-e4. }
11. dxe6 fxe6
{ Please, read my comments to the lines after 9. Nf3 as the most important thing is not some concrete moves, but the pawn structure, and I describe there a lot of ideas and plans that Black has at his disposal. }

The fact that we cannot castle is not a problem at all because of a few reasons. The most important one is that a few pairs of pieces have been traded, which means White will not be able to create an attack. Secondly, White has many weaknesses of his own - the absense of the b2-pawn as well as position of his f-pawn tells, so if White isn't careful, we might get an attack ourselves as well, which might force White to look for a queen trade soon. Our position is fine and we have an extra pawn, so Black is simply better. }

{ As I was creating this repertoire, I found it rather difficult to come up with a good setup against the London System. It is not because this system is so dangerous, or because Black needs to know very much. The reason was that our repertoire is based on Queen's Indian, which immediately cut me a lot of attractive setups, such as 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 !?, because I realized that White can instead start with 2. Nf3, when our only choices would be 2... e6 or 2... b6. Finally, I have decided to recommend the most solid system which enjoys a very good reputation among superGMs. Another big perk of my suggestion is that White, who has so many interesting move orders and ways to get London - by playing Nbd2 before c2-c3; by going c3 and Nd2 with the knight on f3 or without it, etc - would not be able to trick us with the move orders. He would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what are are playing ! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn. Besides that, this chapter is covering some remaining sidelines, such as Veresov/Jobava Attack and the system 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5. }

White can actually avoid the lines after 6. Nf3 Nh5 with this move order to make us play some positions which normally arise after 6. Nf3 Bd6. However, if we play those positions, we will only play ones that are good for Black, while White's most dangerous possibilities will be eliminated ! }
6... Bd6 7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. Ngf3
{ This tranposes to one of the innocuous variations of the main London. The point here is that we can play e6-e5 easily, getting the space advantage and opening up our c8-bishop, which could be potentially bad. }

White's knight, on the other hand, is stuck on h7. There is no need to analyze further or to determine if it's already a winning position for Black or just a large advantage. Apparently, we would be very happy to get here. }

{ And then ...Nxb2 wins the queen back, leaving us with an extra piece. } *

{ As I was creating this repertoire, I found it rather difficult to come up with a good setup against the London System. It is not because this system is so dangerous, or because Black needs to know very much. The reason was that our repertoire is based on Queen's Indian, which immediately cut me a lot of attractive setups, such as 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 !?, because I realized that White can instead start with 2. Nf3, when our only choices would be 2... e6 or 2... b6. Finally, I have decided to recommend the most solid system which enjoys a very good reputation among superGMs. Another big perk of my suggestion is that White, who has so many interesting move orders and ways to get London - by playing Nbd2 before c2-c3; by going c3 and Nd2 with the knight on f3 or without it, etc - would not be able to trick us with the move orders. He would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what are are playing ! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn.

6... Nh5
{ This is a very interesting move, which has several big advantages compared with the main line 6... Bd6. First of all, this move is rather infrequent - it was played in 262 games, according to my database, while 6... Bd6 was tried for 4500 times ! Logically, chances are that the opponent would not know how to react well, or wouldn't know the arising positions deeply. For example, it is likely that many players would be following Sedlak's books on London, and while is is mentioning 6... Nh5 on three lines, but never considers 7... f6, which means people would be caught offguard. Secondly, in the main line White has many interesting possibilities. I was actually going to recommend the main variation at first, as I found plenty of fascinating ideas for Black there, but later I realized that this can be a much simpler solution, which will require less memorization from the readers. This is how the choice was made ! }

White would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what we are playing! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn. Besides that, this chapter is covering some remaining sidelines, such as Veresov/Jobava Attack and the system 1. d4 ♘f6 2. ♘f3 e6 3. ♗g5. }

6... Nh5
{ This is a very interesting move, which has several big advantages compared with the main line 6... Bd6. First of all, this move is rather infrequent - it was played in 262 games, according to my database, while 6... Bd6 was tried for 4500 times ! Logically, chances are that the opponent would not know how to react well, or wouldn't know the arising positions deeply. For example, it is likely that many players would be following Sedlak's books on London, and while is is mentioning 6... Nh5 on three lines, but never considers 7... f6, which means people would be caught offguard. Secondly, in the main line White has many interesting possibilities. I was actually going to recommend the main variation at first, as I found plenty of fascinating ideas for Black there, but later I realized that this can be a much simpler solution, which will require less memorization from the readers. This is how the choice was made ! }

On the other hand, it is not clear at all what White should do about his king, as it definitely cannot go to the kingside, while castling long is also scary since Black already has an open b-file and a rook on it. Also, it's worth mentioning that Black's rooks are already working, while White's are not, and if he doesn't castle  (as I said earlier, to castle is difficult for White)  then he wouldn't be able to connect the rooks. }

{ As I was creating this repertoire, I found it rather difficult to come up with a good setup against the London System. It is not because this system is so dangerous, or because Black needs to know very much. The reason was that our repertoire is based on Queen's Indian, which immediately cut me a lot of attractive setups, such as 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 !?, because I realized that White can instead start with 2. Nf3, when our only choices would be 2... e6 or 2... b6. Finally, I have decided to recommend the most solid system which enjoys a very good reputation among superGMs. Another big perk of my suggestion is that White, who has so many interesting move orders and ways to get London - by playing Nbd2 before c2-c3; by going c3 and Nd2 with the knight on f3 or without it, etc - would not be able to trick us with the move orders. He would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what are are playing ! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn.

For example, it is sensible to retreat with the knight either on g6 or to d5, then we can just go ...Kg7. I just wanted to give this line to make you extremely conscious about all the traps White has related with the h7-square and the h5-knight, but the chances of this line appearing on the board are pretty much non-existent. }

Finally, I have decided to recommend the most solid system which enjoys a very good reputation among superGMs. Another big perk of my suggestion is that White, who has so many interesting move orders and ways to get London - by playing Nbd2 before c2-c3; by going c3 and Nd2 with the knight on f3 or without it, etc - would not be able to trick us with the move orders. He would absolutely have to get the main tabiya of London, which is exactly what are are playing ! This way our repertoire is very accessible and easy to understand and learn.

6... Nh5
{ This is a very interesting move, which has several big advantages compared with the main line 6... Bd6. First of all, this move is rather infrequent - it was played in 262 games, according to my database, while 6... Bd6 was tried for 4500 times ! Logically, chances are that the opponent would not know how to react well, or wouldn't know the arising positions deeply. For example, it is likely that many players would be following Sedlak's books on London, and while is is mentioning 6... Nh5 on three lines, but never considers 7... f6, which means people would be caught offguard. Secondly, in the main line White has many interesting possibilities.

White pins the knight and prevents ...b7-b6 for now, which is especially important for our repertoire as we play Queen's Indian ! Now some moves like ...d7-d5 are possible and reasonable, but for example after 3... d5 4. c4 !? we end up in a fashionable variation that we don't play. It's important to understand that while all these sidelines, even though they contain their shair of poison and tricks, are sidelines for a reason. And, just as for other sidelines covered in this repertoire, I got a nice solution against this one, too : }
3... h6
{ I think it's very important to include this move, as it forces the White bishop off the c1-h6 diagonal, so it would never be able to return there and defend some important squares, pawns etc. }
4. Bxf6 Qxf6 5. e4
{ White gave up the bishop to build the center. If you have some experience with one of the Trompowsky lines  (not recommended in this repertoire)  , you will immediately recognize the similarity. That position arises after 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 e6 3. e4 h6 4. Bxf6 Qxf6. However, in that position White keeps the knight on g1 as he wants to eventually push f2-f4 !, grabbing a lot of space. Logically, if we have a line which was already fine for us in an ever better version, we should be doing great. }
5... d5
{ I like the idea of going for the French structure as we have a pair of bishops; besides that, in French Black often struggles because he is lacking space, which is less of a problem here as one pair of pieces just got traded. }

{ This is how many games go, and here I really like the following new idea }
9... g5
{ To my big surprise, this is a novelty, which is weird as it's a rather common theme in French. The point is simple - we want to attack the d4-pawn which is protected by the f3-knight only, so we are advancing the g-pawn to kick the knight away from d4. It might sound slightly overoptimistic and naive, but I think that this strong move simply makes this variation absolutely uninteresting and unplayable from White's perspective. }

{ I give the exclamation mark as it might look pretty risky to take the second pawn. However, there are not many threats yet that we need to be afraid of, it is just important now to drive the queen back and concentrate on the safety of our king and development. }
11. O-O d5
{ The idea is simple - we just want to go ...Be7, then ...Qa3-Qd6 or ...Qa5-Qc7 and keep our extra pawns. That is why White, who has a significant lead in development, should try to open the position up. }
12. c4 Be7 13. cxd5 Qxd5 14. Be4 Qd7
{ The last subtlety. The nuance of retreating to d7 instead of d8 is that now we are threatening to take on d4 while not running into Qa4+. There is no obvious way how to continue the attack/initiative/aggressive play with White, so we are just ahead in material with a pretty safe position. Of course, our king is not that great, so I wouldn't overestimate the size of our advantage, but I don't see anything White can do here to pose short and long-term problems. For example, going ...Kf8-g7 soon might be a good idea, then we will regroup our pieces with ...Nb4-Nd5, maybe ...b6-Bb7. }

What is the idea ? Well, since after 2. c4 b6 White is not able to play the Catalan anymore, which is the main weapon of many White players - that's a really lovely feature of our repertoire, by the way ! - they try to get to their favorite positions by starting with 2. g3. However, this move has many disadvantages. Black has not defined yet how he would develop, so he has huge flexibility now. I believe that 2... d5 followed by 3... Bf5 is a very good setup as well, for example. However, finally, I have decided to recommend 2...c5. The reason is very simple: the Benoni structures with the pawn on g3 are not specifically challenging for Black anyway, and now White gets these structures in a pretty bad version: he might not be able to play c2-c4, for example. Our choice would require very little memorization while arising positions are rather easy to handle - in my opinion, this is a perfect scenario for the repertoire purposes. }

3... cxd4 4. cxd4 d5
{ Now some of you might wonder, why am I recommending the Exchange Slav type of position, where White is a tempo up after all in a symmetrical position. Well, the reason is very simple: in this type of positions, the bishop is horribly placed on g2/g7, instead it should rather go to d3/d6. That is why, when White had already committed to g2-g3, it is a great idea for us to go for this structure. The position is by no means forcing, but a reasonable line can run as following: }
5. Bg2 Nc6 6. Nc3 Bf5 7. Nf3 e6 8. O-O Be7
{ I would not be able to answer the question, why did White's bishop go to g2. It is really inactive there. Black's one is rather beautiful on f5, on the other hand. Also, it is worth noting, that while we could play 8... h6, for example, to secure bishop's safety, we should not be worried about Nh4 ideas anyway. }
9. Nh4 Be4 10. f3 Bg6 11. Nxg6 hxg6
{ White did get the bishop pair, but he had to weaken his position in return. Now, you would obviously think that Black would look for some attacking chances on the kingside. While this might be true, it is also important to know that we have a different idea as well - to simply play Qb6 and put a lot of pressure on White's d4-pawn as well as on the one on b2. White's position seems very inconvenient and uncomfortable to me here, even though it might be alright objectively. }

The reason is very simple: the Benoni structures with the pawn on g3 are not specifically challenging for Black anyway, and now White gets these structures in a pretty bad version: he might not be able to play c2-c4, for example. Our choice would require very little memorization, while arising positions are rather easy to handle - in my opinion, this is a perfect scenario for the repertoire purposes. }
2... c5
{ Challenging the center instantly. Now White has some choice - he can continue with d5, or Nf3, or even something passive like c3. However, of course, only 3. d5 can be an ambitious choice. }
3. d5 b5
{ This is a fantastic version of the Benoni structures for Black. He manages to get b7-b5 in quickly and grab space on the queenside, while not facing any consequences over the long diagonal. Now, in most cases White continues his development with Bg2, but we would also study a2-a4. I suggest that we do it on move 5, as it is played more often then, and in fact, the position is all about understanding, not specific move-order related details. }
4. Bg2 d6
{ While overall this line is very good and comfortable for Black, this is the nuance he should rather know. The natural move Bb7 is possible, but it is better to keep the bishop on the initial square for a while: sometimes it can go to a6, which means we do not lose any time, or sometimes it can turn out it belongs to the h3-c8 diagonal. }
5. a4
{ Sometimes White tries to create some tension on the queenside and force Black to play b4. Later, he can try to close the whole queenside with eventual c2-c4 to finally switch the direction of the game towards the center and the kingside. }
5... b4 6. c4 g6
{ We do not need to react to what White does. Instead, our goal should be quick development followed by the eventual e7-e6, which is a very reasonable plan, because center is the only place where we can open up the game. }
7. b3
{ Now let us make a few reasonable moves for both sides and then discuss the arising position. }
7... Bg7 8. Bb2 O-O 9. Nd2 Bb7 { Preparing e7-e6 ! } 10. Ngf3
{ These moves were natural, even though not forced. Now the Black bishop goes to b7 to help Black execute e7-e6 and generate some pressure over the long diagonal. }
10... e6 { We are ready to open up the game. } 11. dxe6
{ White has to take, as he is not ready to support the center with e2-e4. }
11... fxe6 12. O-O Qe7
{ Black is ready to continue his development with, for instance, Nbd7. Then he can place the rooks in the center, think of d6-d5. On the other hand, it is not so clear what White's plan is. The position remains rich and provides both sides with winning chances, and from the theoretical perspective we are doing great - so we can stop here. }

What is the idea ? Well, since after 2. c4 b6 White is not able to play the Catalan anymore, which is the main weapon of many White players - that's a really lovely feature of our repertoire, by the way ! - they try to get to their favourite positions by starting with 2. g3.

{ As I say in annotations to 5. e4 followed by 6. Ne2, that option is the most popular one. Instead, people do not really play the natural 5. Nf3. However, I still wanted to cover it, as it seems like a very natural way of development for White. }
5... g6 6. O-O Bg7
{ Now White has several moves - a2-a4, c2-c4 etc. However, he mostly prefers 7. Re1. Actually, you can simply follow the explanations and logic behind annotations to the main line with 5. e4 6. Ne2 and you will be perfectly fine, but I still wanted to provide another illustrative variation. }
7. Re1 O-O 8. e4 Nbd7 9. a4 b4 10. Nbd2 a5
{ This is how most games developed. Now it is logical for White to plant the knight on the c4-outpost. }
11. Nc4 Ba6 { We challenge the knight instantly. } 12. Bf1
{ And here you need to know of two ideas. First of all, it is important to understand that you can trade opponent's knight with Nb6, as your a5-pawn is not hanging after that move - actually, this is your simplest continuation. However, another positional idea worth knowing about is Ng4 !, followed by Ne5 - this prepares some trades and extends the scope of the g7-bishop. I highly recommend that you learn this concept. }
12... Nb6 { Now White should rather take on b6, as } 13. Nxa5 Bxf1
{ Loses. Either White takes on f1 and loses his knight on a5, or after } 14.
Nc6 Qd7 15. Rxf1 e6
{ White will find out that his c6-knight is..trapped ! Black will simply take on d5 twice now and will eventually win the White knight ! In my opinion, this is a rather beautiful idea to know about ! }

Our team was doing well, all the players were apparently in a very decent shape while the team spirit wasn't hurting our chances either. A win in the match would qualify our team to the Final Four, the most prestigious event in the US Collegiate Chess. Obviously, as I had the Black pieces against a higher-rated player, I was not going to go all-in. Instead, the idea was to play solid and reliable chess and take my chances if the opponent ever overpushes. }

{ We have seen the previous moves in the theoretical section, where we are concentrating on 13. f4. Instead, opponent's last move was new to me and made me think. However, the good news about these positions is that they are rather intuitive, and once you acquaint yourself with the typical ideas, it is pretty easy to play regardless of whether you know the theory or not.   13.f4  This is what we analyze in the theoretical chapter, the main idea being  Bh6  14.Nd3  exf4  15.gxf4  Ne5 !  The c4-pawn is hanging and the bishop on h6 proves extremely useful.  16.b3  f5 !  17.exf5  Rxf5  And the White center is falling apart. }

14... Nc5 15. Nxc5 bxc5
{ Now we get an interesting structure, which we are facing in quite a few places in this repertoire. I believe that it's a very beneficial one for Black as he gets a semi-open b-file and ideas related with the pressure on the b2-pawn. If White plays b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4 often proves rather annoying. Another boon of our position is the bishop pair and such ideas as ...g7-g6, ...f7-f5 etc. }
16. a4
{ Having taken about 20 minutes to make this move, my opponent comes up with an interesting, even though arguable dubious, plan. He wants to push a4-a5-a6, fixing the pawn on a7 as a weakness. If, instead, I go ...a7-a5, the b5-square would be weak. And the last, but not the least important idea of his is to meet ...a7-a6 with Rfb1 and b2-b4, opening up the lines on the queenside. This makes sense in a way, but it also does not, because White's plan is very slow and Black should definitely be able to organize counterplay on some other part of the board. }

17. a5 Rb8 18. Rfb1

18... Qg5
{ 18...a6  There is no need to play into his plans, as now after  19.Na2  f5  20.b4  cxb4  21.Nxb4  White's knight is getting active. Nc6 is a threat. Besides that, c4-c5 followed by Nxa6 could be another irritating idea to worry about, too. }

{ We are discussing these positions in depth in the theoretical chapter, but I would just like to repeat a few important points. This is the most classical reply for Black and the safest one. Our idea is to trade the knights. Why do we do that ? Because at the moment, White has more space, and it is well-known, that the side with less space benefits from trades. Secondly, we are taking the e4-square under firm control, making it very difficult for White to ever play e2-e4, which is one of his main aspirations in this position. Also, we are creating a positional threat of xc3, which will spoil White's queenside structure and will make his pawns very vulnerable in the long run. }
8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. Qxc3 d6
{ Actually, I feel that other, more popular continuations - 9... c5 and 9... f5, are also perfectly acceptable for Black. But I simply like Vladimir Kramnik's play too much, so I could not help but base my suggestion on his game from Olympiad - apparently, since it was a team competetion, he had also approached his opening choice very seriously. White has several continuations here - 10. b3, 10. c2 and some other moves. But, since positions are not forcing, since you will rather need to rely on typical plans rather than concrete sequences of moves, I suggest that we concentrate on ideas behind the moves and do not attempt to cover every single possible move in every position. }
10. Qc2 f5
{ A typical method to take the e4-square under control for Black. Now, White either tries to lock our bishop with d4-d5, or offers the bishop trade. }
11. d5
{ White is trying to shut down our bishop. However, it will soon find itself some nice spot on another diagonal. I feel that White's plan is pretty risky strategically, as he lets us seize more space in the center, which can hurt him in the long run. }
11... e5 { Now Black gets more space in the center. } 12. e4 Bc8
{ A good positional move. The bishop has nothing to do on b7, so Kramnik relocates it. }
13. Qe2 Na6 14. exf5 Bxf5
{ Somehow White got outplayed. His position is not a disaster yet, it is just slightly worse. However, Black's advantage is rather stable and it is very pleasant to play with the Black pieces. Our advantage is mostly based on the strong e5-pawn, which controls a lot of space. Also, White's light squares, such as e4 and d3, are pretty weak. And another important factor is his g2-bishop, which is not very useful at the moment. }
15. Nd2 Nc5 16. Ne4 a5
{ Both sides improve their pieces slowly, and now Kramnik takes space on the queenside, preventing any b2-b4 ideas. However, I think, it could be better to instead go 16..e8, activating the queen, coming with it to g6. }
17. Nxc5 bxc5
{ White opens up the b-file for us. His position is clearly somewhat worse now, yet it is rather solid. }
18. Bd2 a4 19. Be4 g6
{ Probably, this is the only inaccuracy I can point out from Kramnik's play. Now, White equalizes and eventually holds.   19...Bg5 !  This is my novelty suggested in the theoretical chapter which would have lead to a steady advantage in the position with heavy pieces. Actually, while this pawn structure arose from our favourite Queen's Indian, it is also very typical of other openings, such as KID. It is known that Black is more comfortable thanks to the semi-open f-file and the pressure he can create over it. White is solid, but usually very passive.  20.Bxf5  Rxf5  21.Qe4  Rf7  And White would have to defend patiently for many more moves, because we have ideas both on the kingside and over the f-file as well as on the queenside over the b-file. The strong a4-pawn makes the b2-pawn a target, while the position of the White pawn on g2 makes the f3-square a nice outpost for our major pieces on the kingside. }
20. b4 { White gets rid of his potentially weak pawn. } 20... axb3 21. axb3 Rb8
22. Rab1 Bg5 23. Bxf5 gxf5
{ I don't like this decision as now Black ends up with a weakness on f5.   23...Rxf5 =  Would have been equal or maybe even a tiny bit more pleasant for Black if White traded the bishops as the b3-pawn is still weak. White, instead, should play Bc3 and later push b3-b4, equalizing. }
24. f4 exf4 25. Bxf4 Qf6 26. Bxg5 Qxg5 27. Rf4

{ This is the safest defense: by trading a pair of rooks, Black makes sure White won't ever have enough forces left to attack either the f5-pawn or the Black king. }

13. Re1 Nd7 14. d5

So, the only solution is to sacrifice the queen.  19.Rxe5  Rxd5  20.Rxd5  Now White has plenty of pieces for the queen, but all these pieces are highly disorganized and uncoordinated, so our position is great. For instance  c4 !  21.Be2  Bxc3  22.Rb1  Bg7  ⇆  Black's powerful c-pawn will give White a hard time. The position remains balanced, but I feel it's very easy to play with Black. }

There is no way this position is safe for us, at least in a practical game, so let's not be greedy and let's prefer the natural bishop retreat, instead.  18.f4 !  Bxf4  19.Bxf4  Qxf4  20.c4  ∞  White's central pawns are nice, but Black is a pawn up. His position is absolutely safe, so I like Black here. }
17... h6 18. Ne4 Be5 19. Bxh6
{ I think this move isn't sound objectively, but at least it creates practical chances. Otherwise, White would have just lost the d5-pawn and his position would have eventually collapsed. }
19... Rxd5
{ Le Quang Liem enters a forcing line which leaves him with a clear advantage instead of getting in the slightly murky complications which would have arisen if he took the piece.   19...gxh6  20.Qxh6  Bxd5  -+  Would have been another sound way to defend. }
20. Bc4 gxh6 21. Bxd5 Bxd5 22. Ng3 Ng6
{ It is pretty obviousy that White has no way of keeping this attack going, as Black's minor pieces are dominating the position. }
23. Nf5 Be6 24. Nxh6+ Kg7 25. Nf5+ Bxf5
{ A few more precise moves allowed Black to get rid of White's last attacking hope, his knight. Now Black is totally winning and soon the game was over. }
26. Qxf5 Bxc3 27. Qf3 Bxe1 28. Qxa8 Qe5 29. Ra2 c4
{ Black is converting very conveniently - he is just about to queen the c-pawn ! }
30. Kf1 Bc3 31. g3 Bb2 32. Qc6 c3
{ The a2-rook is trapped, so Black is basically two pieces up, soon it was over : }
33. Qc4 Qc5 34. Qb3 Qd4 35. f4 Ne7 36. Qb5 c2
{ The pawn is promoting so White called it a day. I don't want to make an impression as though some weak player just mishandled it as White. Instead, a very strong GM with a lifelong experience in 1. d4 and a great positional understanding had the White pieces. Apparently, he believed White could afford an agression that fierce on the kingside, and this is what your opponents can do as well ! So, it makes tons of sense to see how strong players neutralize such unprepared attacking attempts. 0-1  (36)  Kazhgaleyev,M  (2570)  -Le,Q  (2739)  Ashkhabad 2017 }

{ 9.Bb5+  c6  10.Bd3  c5  Is just a transposition, as shown in the theoretical part. }
9... c5 10. O-O O-O
{ This is a HIGHLY typical mistake I don't want you to make. Please, pay an extreme amount of attention to the move order ! Fortunately for Black - and fortunately for you if you ever blunder this - White is likely not to notice the refutation. This is exactly what happened in the game. So, while we should not use this game as something to memorize and to rely on from the theoretical perspective, we can make great use of it in order to: 1  pay attention to the trap; 2  learn Black's typical ideas used to outplay White in this structure.   10...cxd4 !  Is the right move order, as shown in the theoretical part. }
11. Bb2
{ 11.d5 !  Would have been the punishment for Black's careless move order. I am explaining this in the theoretical part, but just to show the main problem:  exd5  12.exd5  Qxd5 ?   12...Bxd5  13.Bxh7+  Kh8  14.Qf5 !  The queen is coming to h3, delivering Black a lot of trouble.  13.Bxh7+  Kh8  14.Re1  Be4 is a threat, White is getting an incredibly powerful initiative. }
11... Qc8
{ Now Black is safe again. We play this position in a somewhat different way, but it's interesting to get an additional insight regarding Black's ideas in these structures.   11...cxd4  Transposes to the theoretical chapter. }
12. Qe2 Ba6
{ The more trades, the better for Black, as he is the one with less space. At this point, White should have just played Rad1 or something, but apparently he fell in a very common psychological trap, which makes weaker players trade pieces with the stronger ones, as they think it increases their chances to draw the game. Not always, not at all ! If the trades objectively benefit Black, White should avoid them ! }
13. Bxa6 Qxa6 14. Qxa6 Nxa6
{ Now Black is slightly better, I think, because White's center is more of a liability while Black enjoys an extra pawn on the queenside and nice pressure over the d and c-files. }
15. Rfd1 Rfd8 16. a3 Bf6 17. Kf1 Rac8 18. Rac1 Nb8
{ Please note how Black is regrouping his pieces. The rooks and the bishops are now occupying great positions, putting pressure on the White center. Now the time has come to bring this time to c6 ! }
19. a4 Nc6 20. dxc5 bxc5 21. Ba3 Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 c4
{ Now the d3-square as well as the one on b3 are nice targets for the Black knight. Somehow it also feels that the c3-pawn is weaker than the one on c4, as Black's bishop is keeping the c3-one under attack. }
23. Bc5
{ White makes a very bad decision which puts him on the verge of a collapse.   23.Nd2 !  Would have maintained the roughly equal position. Black can either trade with . ..Bxc3 Nxc4, or keep the tension with moves like ...Na5 or ...Na5. }
23... Bxc3 24. Rc1 Na5
{ 24...Bb2 !  Would have also been very strong, as after  25.Rxc4  Na5  there is a big problem over the c-file: the White rook has no squares.  26.Rb4 !   26.Rc2 ?  Ba3 !  And White loses material.  26...Ba3  27.Rb5  Bxc5  28.Rxa5  Bb6  ∓  Black has a fantastic bishop which is a lot superior to the knight. Besides that, his rook is coming to the 2nd rank: White is in a lot of trouble ! }
25. Bxa7 Bb2 26. Rc2 c3
{ This is also a terrible outcome for White, whose a-pawn is not too useful, while Black's c-pawn is extremely dangerous. The positions of the White pieces couldn't be worse, just look at that a7-bishop or at the c2-rook ! }
27. Ne1 Nc4 28. Nd3 Na3 29. Re2 c2 30. Be3 c1=Q+ 31. Bxc1 Bxc1
{ This is just an extra piece. White still has some slight hopes thanks to the a-pawn and because Black's pieces are now rather misplaced, but this should be lost with careful play, obviously. }
32. Ra2 Rc3 33. Ke2 Bg5 34. a5 Be7 35. Rb2 Bf8
{ 35...Rc2+ !  Would have been the easiest.  36.Rxc2  Nxc2  37.Kd2  Na3  38.Kc3  Nb5+  39.Kc4  Nc7  -+  This is the key detail: White's king cannot go any further ! }
36. a6 Rc6 { 36...Nc4 !  Was essential to keep the advantage. } 37. a7
{ Now White should be able to hold ! } 37... Ra6 38. Rb7 f6 39. Kd2
{ White misses her golden chance and now Black finally converts the extra piece.   39.Nf4 !  The threat is Nxe6, obviously. Black suddenly even has to be careful to draw !  Nb5 !   39...e5 ?  40.Ne6 !  And suddenly it's nearly over as there's no defense to Rb8 ! White is just dominating the position while being a piece down, this is crazy.  40.Rxb5  Rxa7  41.Nxe6  ±  White will be pushing for a long time ! }
39... Nc4+ 40. Kc3 Nd6 41. Rd7 Rxa7
{ The pawn is gone, so are White's chances. } 42. Rxa7 Nb5+ 43. Kc4 Nxa7
{ This game was definitely quite messy in the end, but it should not spoil our impression and learning experience that we can get from the middlegame decisions and from the pawn structure in question. As we saw for one more time, trades in this structure normally favour Black as he has less space and because White's chances are connected with the kingside initiative/attack, which becomes impossible to get when the pieces get off the board. On the other hand, Black's chances are normally best used in the endgame because once the pieces get traded, White's center becomes a liability and because Black has an extra pawn on the queenside, which is a large asset for any endgame position, as White has a hard time dealing with an outside passed pawn if it ever appears. }

{ We are discussing the opening details and nuances in the theoretical part, but I believe there are a few crucial things that should be kept in mind so I would quote my own words from the theoretical chapter here and later. 'Again, Black's setup is very harmonious, while White's bishop on g2 is far from being impressive, his pawn on e4 isn't too helpful, either.' I feel that while the position might still be balanced objectively, it's a lot harder to handle it with White as he has to make several important decisions which are not easy at all. For example, if White plays Nc3, the knight might end up misplaced and Black might eventually get to d4 with his knight or some other piece. On the other hand, c2-c3 weakens the d3-square. Now, where should the White bishop go ? And so on, and so forth. As we will see, White had to solve all these problems in this game as well and apparently he didn't manage to do that. I believe that his next move is already a serious mistake as it wastes time, weakens his position and doesn't achieve anything. }
11. a4
{ White is trying to get activity over the a-file, which Black could prevent with ...a7-a5, or ignore, like he did in the game.   11.Be3  It would be better to just develop the pieces before committing to any plan, but after  O-O-O  12.Nd2  Be7  It is not clear at all what White should be doing next. We can play ...g7-g5, ...h7-h5 to grab space on the kingside and possibly to even get some initiative ! Or we can consider the bishop trade with ...Bc5 at some point, trying to get our knight to that square and put pressure on the e4-pawn. The b7-bishop is active while the g2-one is passive, so apparently, Black's play is a lot easier. }
11... O-O-O 12. a5 Bc5 13. Nc3 Ne5
{ On the one hand, Black is challenging White over the only open d-file, and at the same time he is about to create some direct threats with ...g4. Of course, he is much better at this point. }
14. axb6 axb6 15. h3
{ 15.Kf1  Would have been more resilient, but after  Rxd1+  16.Nxd1  Rd8  17.Nc3 ?   17.Be3 !  Be7  18.Ke2  f5 !?  Intending ...Nc4, ...Bf6 etc would also be very annoying for White to meet.  17...Ng4  ∓  White faces the same problems. }
15... Nc6
{ The knight cannot come to g4 anymore, so it changes the route. Now d4 and b4 are the targets. }
16. Bd2 Rd7 { Black is calmly improving his position, planning to double up. }
17. Be1 Nd4 18. Rd2 Rhd8
{ Surprisingly, this is already simply lost for White, as ...f3 is the decisive threat. }
19. Kf1 Nb3 { Tactics serve strategic goals. } 20. Rxd7 Nxa1 21. Rxd8+ Kxd8
{ Black is inevitably winning the c2-pawn, but I wanted to show you the rest of the game as it's important to be able to use your advantage well, and the Black player in this game is definitely a great example to learn from ! }
22. Na4 Ba6+ { Black forces the king to retreat all the way back. } 23. Kg1 Bf8
24. f4
{ 24.c3 ?  It wasn't possible to save the pawn this way as after  Bb5 !  White's knight has no moves and he needs to give up material anyway. }
24... Nxc2 25. Bf2 Nb4 26. Bf1 Bd3
{ Black doesn't mind the trade as long as it happens on his own terms ! } 27.
e5 Bc2 28. Nc3 Nd3

{ It was also possible to win by just playing ...Kb3, ...c4-c3 and so on, but why not win another pawn ? }

{ The White knight is trapped on the edge of the board, so White resigned. In my opinion, this game is an excellent display of Black's possibilities in this nearly symmetrical position. You don't need to be afraid of the equal, seemingly boring positions - it is always possible to win if you play better than the opponent, as long as there is at least one pawn left on the board ! }

1. Nf3
{ Of course, we will stick with our Queen's Indian setups against 1. Nf3 and 1. c4, too. In this chapter, we will analyze two fairly dangerous setups which White may try: Anti-QID with 6. Re1, when White tries to keep the pawn on d2 for a while, and KIA, which is characterized by a setup with White pawns on d3 and e4. The first option is rather challenging theoretically, even though we have a firm road to a safe position, while the second one is known to lead to numerous equal position where everything comes to the understanding of typical plans as opposed to the concrete knowledge. }
1... Nf6 2. c4 b6
{ It may seem funny to award the obvious second move with an exclamation mark, but it's very important not to get tricked by this move order. 2... e6 3. Nc3 ! will get us in the position we don't play, so we need to start with 2... b6. }
3. g3 Bb7 4. Bg2 e6 5. O-O Be7 6. Nc3 O-O
{ Here comes the moment of truth - White should either tranpose to the main lines with 7. d4, or play 7. Re1, which is a very interesting move - the point is to push e2-e4 quickly, while saving the time on d2-d4. Since the first option tranposes to the chapters on QID with g2-g3, we will consider only the second possibility here. }
7. Re1 d5 { Immediately fighting for the center and stopping e2-e4. } 8. cxd5
Nxd5
{ I believe that it is also good to capture with the pawn, but somehow I always liked White's chances in those complicated strategic positions. After our move, the character of the game will be much more straightforward. }
9. Nxd5 exd5
{ ...Bxd5 e4 ! gives White a chance to seize the center quickly. I know it may look strange to take with the pawn after my last annotation where I'm saying I didn't want to take with the pawn on the last move. However, now the circumstances are slightly different - White had traded a pair of knights, and his c3-knight could be an extremely annoying piece that would be putting pressure on d5 all the time. Now our plan is very simple - we want to go ... Nd7 and play ...c7-c5.   9...Bxd5  10.e4 !  This is something to avoid ! }
10. d4 Nd7 11. Bf4 c5 12. Rc1 Re8
{ Black may even consider ...c5-c4 at this point, intending to play on the queenside with ... b6-b5, ...a6-a5, ...b5-b4. This is exactly how the game between two strong players that reached this position continued. }
13. Qc2 c4
{ It was possible to maintain the tension with ...Rc8 or something like that, but the plan chosen by Bulmaga is rather ambitious, I really like it. }
14. Nd2 b5 15. e4
{ White doesn't want to just wait, so he is starting counterplay in the center. }
15... Nf8 16. e5 Qb6 17. Be3 Ne6 18. f4

24... Qxb7 25. Qxd4 Rad8 26. Qf2 Rd3
{ Black is obviously slighly better - White's king is rather weak and Black has the only open file. Besides Black's slight lack of fighting spirit in the end, I think it was an extremely well-played game by Irina Bulmaga ! }

1. c4 b6
{ I understand that it might seem weird to award the first move with an exclamation mark or to give extensive explanations after it, but in this case it is very appropriate. Basically, 1. Nf3 and 1. c4 are the moves often used by 1. d4 players as possibly beneficial move orders that allow to cut some Black's possibilities or give an opportunity to trick Black into some variation he doesn't play with a cunning move order. As our task is to get into our repertoire vs 1. d4 and not somewhere else  (for example, we don't want to play Nimzo Indian or Anti-Nimzo Indian)  , this is the only move that allows us to stay within our repertoire. The good news is that we will need to learn only very few lines here as most work has already been done in the chapters devoted to 1. d4 and 1. Nf3 ! }
2. Nc3 Bb7 3. e4 e5
{ This is pretty much the only independent position that White can get with 1. c4 against our repertoire. In my opinion, this shows how rewarding and well-built our repertoire is ! With his last move, Black fights for the center, stops d2-d4. This is exactly the moment when we reach interesting crossroads. White has several exciting possibilities. By the way, I would highly recommend that you study games of Georg Meier, as he is a big expert with Black in this position. So if you want to expand your knowledge, definitely take a look at what he does here, he knows his way around very well ! }
4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4
{ White feels ready to fight for the center. He hopes that he would be able to protect the center and stabilize the position, then he would have a large advantage thanks to extra space and Black's bishop on b7, which would be an extremely passive piece. However, after deep analysis I understood that the arising positions are much easier for Black to handle. I, actually, don't like this move at all for White anymore ! }
5... exd4 6. Nxd4 Bb4
{ Of course, Black is not going to just develop passively, waiting for White to realize all of his ambitions. Now White always needs to watch out for ...Bxc3, which would make the queenside pawns incredibly weak. Apparently, there is no conclusion what move is best in this position, as several strong White players tried about 5-6 different continuations and a few more, which were never essayed, also make sense ! We will analyze the most reasonable moves. }
7. Be2
{ Another logical move - White just wants to finish his development. There is no wonder we again follow our logical path of spoiling opponent's structure. However, now I think there is an even better way for us to do that. }
7... Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Qf6
{ This is the point. Black is offering a queen trade, which White cannot avoid, and he will still get to spoil White's structure. }
9. Be3
{ 9.Qxf6  Nxf6  →  There is no way for White to stop both Nxe4 and Bxc3. } 9...
Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Qxd4
{ Again, the same positional pattern. If White chooses to recapture with his pawn, he loses one on e4, while if he takes with the bishop, we get a very comfortable endgame. }
11. Bxd4 f6 12. f3
{ In my opinion, this is a positional mistake, as the arising endgame is clearly more pleasant for Black. }
12... d6
{ And Black went on to play a lovely positional game. I would highlight a few instructive moments. }
13. g4 h6 14. h4 Ne7 15. Kd2 Kf7 16. g5 hxg5 17. hxg5 c5 18. Be3 f5
{ Another great move ! Now White absolutely had to take on f5. What he did resulted in a horrible position, a nearly lost one, just in a few more moves. }
19. Rhf1 Rh4 20. a4 f4
{ Now Black's knight has an outpost on e5, and the fight is simply over - White's pawns are all weak and his bishops are useless. }
21. Bf2 Rh2 22. Kc2 Nc6 23. Rad1 Ke6 24. Rd2 Ne5 25. a5 Ba6 26. Bg1 Rxe2
