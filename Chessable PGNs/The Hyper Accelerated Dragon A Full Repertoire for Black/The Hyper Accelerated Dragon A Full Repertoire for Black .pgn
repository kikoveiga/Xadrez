{ @@HeaderStart@@Chapter 1: Introduction@@HeaderEnd@@ @@StartBlockQuote@@It simply isn’t an adventure worth telling if there aren’t any dragons.@@EndBlockQuote@@- J.R.R. Tolkien  My Favorite Sicilian  I was introduced to the Accelerated Dragon when I was ten years old, more than seventeen years ago. It was arguably my first ‘serious’ defense against 1.e4: prior to then I would develop my pieces in a manner my father and I called ‘P-Play’  (the ‘P’ deriving from our family name)  but which I later discovered is widely known as the Hippopotamus Defence. He and I were of similar strength at the time, and we studied the opening together from the then recently published, and now classic, Accelerated Dragons by IMs Donaldson and Silman.   What drew me to the opening initially was the abundance of cheapos I could set up for my opponents in the early stages of the game, which even experts and masters seemed unprepared for. The following was always one of my favorites:    1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  g6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Bg7  5.Nc3  Nc6  6.Be3  Nf6  7.Bc4  Qa5  8.Qd2?   8.0–0  8...Nxe4!  9.Nxc6   9.Nxe4  Qxd2+  10.Bxd2  Nxd4  ∓  9...Qxc3!!  10.Qxc3   10.bxc3  Nxd2  11.Bxd2  bxc6  ∓  10...Bxc3+  11.bxc3  bxc6  ∓   Beyond simple tricks like this one, I found that the positional themes of the opening were fairly easy to digest; for example, dark square control, central breakthrough  (especially …d7-d5)  , queenside expansion, as well as the typical favorable and unfavorable endgames which tend to arise. As I have matured as a player, my perspective on this opening has correspondingly transformed, but my respect and appreciation for its strength has only been enhanced. This book is an attempt to convey my current understanding and approach with black.   I have always felt that the Accelerated Dragon does not get its due respect among the Sicilians. Even its prodigal brother, the un-accelerated Dragon, had its time in the spotlight when it was used by Kasparov to twice defeat  (and twice draw)  Anand in their 1995 PCA World Championship match. Why then, has the Accelerated Dragon – the theoretically no worse off, and much safer of the two  (I like to think of it as the only Sicilian where Black needn’t worry about getting mated in 25 moves)  - historically been only an occasional guest in top events, and, unlike every other respectable Sicilian, never occupied the central battlefield of a World Championship match  (The only time it was played in a World Championship Match was Spassky-Petrosian 1969, Game 3.)  ?  Part of the discrepancy is a vestige of the old  (pre-1970s)  dogma that in the Sicilian, to avoid suffocation, Black must prevent White from obtaining a ‘clamp’ pawn center  (pawns on e4 and c4)  . Indeed, the Maroczy Bind   5.c4  has always been the bane of the Accelerated Dragon’s existence. However, while this attitude towards the Sicilian may have been justifiable half a century ago, Black has since demonstrated counterattacking prospects against the e4/c4 clamp in a variety of structures, as in the Hedgehog, Kalashnikov, Kan, Taimanov, and certainly no less in the Accelerated Dragon.  I suspect that computers have deterred many potential devotees away from the Accelerated Dragon. Computer evaluations in the main lines tend to fluctuate between +0.25 and +0.5, which plausibly leads to the rationale that playing the Accelerated Dragon instead of the Berlin or Marshall – where evaluations are closer to +0.15 – is like playing with a small handicap straight out of the opening. Things, however, are not so simple. Computers evaluate each position by objective features, without regard for subjective factors which are very often more important in tournament chess. Machines systematically ignore the value of, for example, being able to follow one of a small number of thematic plans, irrespective of what the opponent does, saving on clock time as well as risk of mishandling the position. This sort of human element is unaccounted for by the engine, resulting in an inflated estimation of White’s chances. In this regard, there are similarities between the Accelerated Dragon and the King’s Indian Defense – another opening notoriously bastardized by the engine. King’s Indian devotees are used to seeing +0.5 computer evaluations, but they are not discouraged because they recognize that there is a narrow margin of error for White, and to err is human. The same can be said for the Accelerated Dragon.     Fortunately, the tide of fashion is turning, and contemporary Accelerated Dragon experts like  (super)  Grandmasters Tiviakov, Mamedov, Iturrizaga, and Malakhov have demonstrated that this opening can be a reliable counter to 1.e4 even against top opposition. Recently, in fact, World Champion Magnus Carlsen upheld the Black side of a Maroczy to put a halt to Caruana’s 7-0 run in the 2014 Sinquefield Cup. I predict a bright future for this opening, for many reasons, but most of all because 1  The resulting positions are difficult for computers to properly assess- many ‘+=’ evaluations are more accurately ‘=’ but more importantly ‘easier to play for Black’, a factor which should not be underestimated especially considering the increasingly short time controls, and 2  There is plenty of unexplored terrain, which cannot be easily navigated by the positional dictums we are brought up with, because the Accelerated Dragon is a genuinely nonstandard opening. This means that there is a competitive advantage to those who work out its unusual nuances, unlike in, say, the Najdorf or Sveshnikov where it often feels like the strategic ideas are all well known, and only concrete novelties are yet to be discovered  (if it is unclear what I mean by this, I hope it isn’t by the end of the book!)  .  The Accelerated Dragon State of Mind  A friend of mine  (a strong IM)  recently commented to me that if he could be certain that his opponents wouldn’t play the Maroczy bind, he would always play the Accelerated Dragon instead of his usual  (un-accelerated, but I sometimes teasingly prefer ‘un-playable’)  Dragon, because White can’t play the critical Yugoslav Attack against the Accelerated Dragon  (despite this being lesson #1 of the Accelerated Dragon, a surprising number of masters have not gotten the memo)  . “However”, he continued, “in the Maroczy, Black is just playing for a draw, you can never win!” A loyal defender of my beloved pet opening, I insisted he had it all wrong, and that I welcome the Maroczy in must-win games with Black. “That’s really weird dude, you’re probably the only one” was his retort, but I think when it comes to the Accelerated Dragon, there’s a requisite state of mind needed in order to properly handle it - some players have had a conversion experience after catching a glimpse of its incredible power, while others haven’t. Plausibly as a result of this, from my experience there is a peculiar camaraderie among Accelerated Dragon practitioners. Whereas Najdorf ‘bros’ espouse a Darwinian angst that their novelty on move 25 in the Poisoned Pawn variation will be discovered, used, and rendered useless by their colleagues, I have found that Accelerated Dragon players enjoy discussing their ideas with each other. A personal anecdote of mine is fairly typical: in the final round of the 2013 US Masters tournament I was in a must-win ‘money game’ with Black against Cuban GM Abreu, and I noticed GM Rauf Mamedov  (a leading expert on the Black side of the Accelerated Dragon)  was taking an interest in the Maroczy Bind on my board. I won the game in a tense struggle, and afterwards when I was collecting my prize, Rauf kindly congratulated me on the win and took an interest in the 15…e6 line I played  (see Ch.3)  , which he said he hadn’t studied before. I told him I was not too happy with the more popular 15…Qb6, but he asserted that from his analysis Black has no problems there – “it’s equal” he said. His confident proclamation was just the nudge I needed to look closer into some of the lines I thought were undesirable for Black, and on closer inspection I realized  (unsurprisingly)  he was right!   While this elusive ‘state of mind’ is somewhat ineffable, and better grasped from experience than anything else  (if I am successful then the contents of this book will convey precisely this)  , I think it is helpful to think of the Maroczy as a close cousin of the Hedgehog. I understand the ‘philosophy’ of the Hedgehog in terms of how Mihai Suba describes it in his excellent Dynamic Chess Strategy. It is worth quoting him at length.  White’s position looks ideal. That’s the naked truth about it, but the ‘ideal’ has by definition one drawback – it cannot be improved. …In the early 1970s, the successes of Karpov and Andersson showed that  Hedgehog  positions are not only playable but offer as many winning chances as any other opening. This was in glaring conflict with classical strategy. White enjoys more space, better development  and  his position has no weaknesses. How is it possible that Black not only resists in these positions but sometimes wins? The only plausible answer lies in the hidden dynamics of the positions. After the opening, White’s position has all the qualities of a successful picture, but lacks concrete possibilities for improvement. Within our terminology, it is rigid  (not elastic)  . Black’s position, in contrast, ‘looks’ bad but has greater scope for improvement.  p.26   This description applies equally well to the Maroczy. In fact, you might say that the Accelerated Dragon  (specifically the Black side of the Maroczy)  ‘state of mind’ is, to borrow Suba’s phrase, an appreciation for the “hidden dynamic factors” in each position which compensate for the static deficiencies  (again, the best way to ‘sense’ these is by studying the opening – the variations in this book are meant to illustrate these factors)  . Moreover, as a long time Hedgehog player myself, I must say that in my opinion, Black has much more freedom in the Maroczy than in the Hedgehog; for instance, in the Hedgehog, it is usually unfavorable for Black to exchange queens, whereas in the Maroczy  (and the Accelerated Dragon more broadly)  , White often takes pains to avoid exchanging queens so as to not lose the initiative, and that is a liability which contributes to the “rigidity”  (another apt term of Suba’s)  of White’s position. Terms like ‘elastic’ and ‘counterattacking potential’ will be interspersed throughout this book – they are much more informative than reductive evaluations like ‘=’.   An Inclusive Opening  One of the remarkable things about the Accelerated Dragon is its appeal to players with vastly different styles. Compare Bent Larsen, the epitome of dynamic, offbeat, risky chess, with Sergei Tiviakov, who claimed in an interview recently that his style has been shaped most by Petrosian  (who was a great Accelerated Dragon devotee himself)  , Smyslov, and Karpov – both these players have championed the Accelerated Dragon as their main weapon against 1.e4 and yet their styles are in many ways polar opposites of each other! How can this be? I think the answer to this question is subtle and instructive. I think that when playing the Accelerated Dragon it ‘feels’ like you are playing White, not Black  (albeit in a hypermodern manner)  . What I mean is, in chess, White tends to be the one to control the tempo of the game – usually it is White who chooses whether to enter into an opposite side castling situation, or to exchange pieces early on and maneuver around in a simplified middlegame, or invoke the center as the locus of battle, ensuring king safety above all  (The only time it was played in a World Championship Match was Spassky-Petrosian 1969, Game 3.)  .  Furthermore, Black usually needs to play accurately to not end up slightly worse, or at least give the initiative to White. The situation is, to the well prepared Accelerated Dragon player, precisely the reverse: in the Maroczy, for example, there are half a dozen different ways for Black to develop, and players of diverse styles can choose the one which suits them best  (or vary their choice depending on practical considerations)  . Black controls the tempo and determines the character of the struggle, which is why it is so effective in must-win games. Furthermore, unlike in many 1…e5 openings, or in most other Sicilians like the Kan, Sveshnikov, or even the Najdorf, White’s choices are rather limited if he does not want to end up slightly worse out of the opening. In practice, White meets the Accelerated Dragon with either the Maroczy Bind or the 7.Bc4 variation; this is simply not so in the Najdorf where every single reasonable move is a viable candidate from the starting position of the Najdorf   6.h3  ,  6.Rg1  ,  6.g3  ,  6.f3  ,  6.Be3  ,  6.f4  ,  6.Be2  ,  6.Bc4  ,  6.Bg5  ,  6.a4  , and that is not even to mention variations therein  , and the margin for White error is far greater   for example  6.Be2  e5  7.Nf3!?  is a serious challenge to the Najdorf but  6.Be2  Bg7  7.Nf3?!  is just dubious against the Accelerated Dragon  .   The above may sound a little hyperbolic, and I would like to make it clear from the outset that I am not claiming that ‘Black is better’ in the Accelerated Dragon; to do so would be dishonest. My claim is a serious one: the character of the Accelerated Dragon is that of a White opening. In fact, the Accelerated Dragon reversed is a White opening, called the English, and is fashioned by most of the top players in the world, including Carlsen, Kramnik, Aronian, Anand, Giri, and others: the exact piece arrangement occurs with colors reversed  (and a tempo up)  after   1.c4  e5  2.g3  Nf6  3.Bg2  d5  4.cxd5  Nxd5  5.Nc3  , as well as   1.c4  c5  2.Nf3  Nf6  3.Nc3  d5  4.cxd5  Nxd5  5.g3  Nc6  6.Bg2  Nc7  7.O-O  e5  (reversed Maroczy)  . I have enjoyed playing this ‘reversed Accelerated Dragon’ with White as well.  In addition to being inclusive in the above sense, that it can suit players of diverse styles, and also that it can be a coherent complement to a 1.c4 repertoire with White, there are many interesting ways that the opening ‘fits’ with defenses against 1.d4/1.c4/1.Nf3, and can often directly transpose from them.   Symmetrical English:    1.Nf3  c5  2.c4  g6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Bg7  5.e4  Nc6   1.c4  c5  2.Nf3  g6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Bg7  5.e4  Nc6   King’s Indian:    1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3   5.f3  O-O  6.Be3  c5  7.Nge2  cxd4  8.Nxd4  Nc6  O-O  6.Be2  c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.Nxd4  Nc6   Benoni/Benko Gambit:    1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  3.Nf3  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nc6  5.Nc3  g6  6.e4   1.d4  Nf6  2.Nf3  g6  3.c4  c5  4.Nc3   4.d5  either 4...b5 or 4...e6  cxd4  5.Nxd4  Nc6  6.e4   Of course, there is no obligation on Accelerated Dragon players to deploy these defences in order to allow for transpositional possibilities – Tiviakov has been a lifelong Nimzo-Indian/Queen’s Indian devotee as a counterexample – but I have found it useful to play these systems in tandem myself.   One more point on the topic of move orders: since the Accelerated Dragon  (especially the Maroczy)  can come about from so many different move orders, I have taken some liberties with the games in this book to convert the initial moves to the 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 ‘Hyper-Accelerated Dragon’ move order we will be focusing on. I have done this, following a not uncommon practice, purely for didactic purposes - I don’t want readers happy with their 1.d4 defenses to be confused by transpositions from openings they don’t play.  About This Book  This book presents a repertoire for Black after   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  g6  – the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon. I am relatively lax about distinguishing between ‘Accelerated Dragon’   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  g6  and ‘Hyper-Accelerated Dragon’, and I use the two interchangeably unless to emphasize move order nuances, for example, “the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon avoids the Rossolimo”. However, this is not merely ‘a’ Hyper-Accelerated Dragon repertoire, it is my repertoire, and I present the material as such, from a first person perspective, making brazen use of my own games and offering personal anecdotes and opinions. This stylistic choice risks my coming across as presumptuous and at times even boastful, but my hope is rather that the conversational mode of presentation makes readers feel as though I am their tour guide through what might otherwise feel like an insurmountable labyrinth of variations. Further on the point of stylistic choices, I am regrettably not sufficiently skilled in writing without gender-specific pronouns, so please regard all generic references to ‘he’ as ‘s/he’  (or alternative)  and so on.         I provide as much information as I think is necessary for readers to play this opening with Black; however, this is absolutely not meant to be an anthology on the opening. I make no claim to cover every conceivable variation White can play. Any attempt at such, couched under the heading of a ‘complete repertoire’ would not only be misleading, but in this day and age obsolete. This is not to say that opening books are altogether obsolete; on the contrary, as inundated with information as we all are nowadays, it can be enormously helpful to have an author divulge opening secrets from their years of experience which would not easily be gathered from a database search.  What is obsolete is the attempt to thoroughly and comprehensively ‘prove equality’ with Black, and more importantly for our purposes it is antagonistic to the spirit of the Accelerated Dragon, which is that of an opening refusing to be evaluated on static grounds alone. As Jonathan Rowson instructs in his Seven Deadly Chess Sins, 'You need to assess not only the position as it stands but the position as it has changed and how it is likely to continue to change'.  p.75  So, I am not a big fan of evaluations like ‘=’ or ‘=+’ or ‘+=’  (though I capitulate to these at times)  because ‘=’ makes me think of a draw and ‘+=’ makes me feel like I ought to be satisfied with a draw as Black, when in reality Black can very much be optimistic about his position despite such evaluations, and that is why I prefer evaluations like 'counterplay' or 'mutual chances'.   If you encounter a variation not covered in this book, for example 1. e4 c5 2. Na3, my general prescription is this: find a database  (no excuses, they are free online)  , and search the position with an Accelerated Dragon player  (I gave you a list above)  as Black to see how they have chosen to play the position. Ideally you’ll find a model game that you can recall whenever you face the system; after all, when it comes to rare systems like 2.Na3 it is foolish to memorize concrete variations since you’ll never remember them anyway, but the key ideas of a model game you can. Even in the main lines of the Accelerated Dragon, don’t try to memorize the moves given in this book as if they are the ultimate truth. They aren’t. Your learning will be enhanced if you actively seek out novelties of your own, and try to understand how the various positional ideas for both sides fit together.   To make this book as valuable to the Petrosian-style  (risk-averse)  Accelerated Dragon player as to the Larsen-type  (risk-craving)  , I have recommended two systems against each of the 7.Bc4 and Maroczy Bind variations. I hope at least one of these suits you. For those among you who will embark on the risky course   ‘My System’ against  7.Bc4  and the Breyer Variation of the Maroczy  , may I caution you to do so with a realistic attitude towards the cost of risk-taking in chess. Human beings have evolved to be risk-averse animals; risk-taking inevitably increases the variability of outcomes – both good and bad. The mature risk taker does so mindfully, cognizant of their aims and justifications. This was the attitude of Bent Larsen. If you would like to play the Accelerated Dragon ambitiously, with a tolerance for risk, keep in mind the following description of Larsen, given by Reshevsky: “He is a firm believer in the value of surprise. Consequently, he often resorts to dubious variations in various openings. He also likes to complicate positions even though it may involve considerable risk. He has a great deal of confidence in his game and fears no one. His unique style has proven extremely effective against relatively weak opponents but has not been too successful against top-notchers.” Alas, this is the risk-taker’s predicament, but far from discouraging it, I am thankful for the risk-takers among you who resist the ‘genetic’ drift of our chess community towards timidity and results-oriented pragmatism.      I sincerely hope you find this to be an enjoyable and enriching experience.  Table of Contents  1. Introduction  2. Classical   Be2  Variation  3. 7. Bc4 Anti-Yugoslav Variation  4. 7.

{ In order to streamline and simplify the learning process for this book on Chessable, we have opted for a slightly modified format. The full book  (including all variations and comments)  is contained in Chessable within the 'read-only' variations at the beginning of each section. However, these 'read-only' variations serve as a reference rather than the primary learning tool. We have curated and picked the variations which we believe to be the most important lines for students to learn. These variations can be accessed by simply clicking 'Learn Next' within the Chessable interface.   In this book specifically, the author has provided two weapons against the 7.Bc4 variation as well as the Maroczy Bind variation. Chessable allows the user to learn either of these repertoire suggestions, or both. Note that if you want to learn only one though, it is recommended to pause the alternative suggestions.  Enjoy the book! }

{ We begin with the variation which epitomizes the Accelerated Dragon philosophy. In most defenses to 1.e4, White has the option of playing a 'Classical' variation by developing the light squared bishop to e2. This is particularly the case in Sicilians like the Najdorf, Scheveningen and Taimanov, but also in other defenses like the Pirc/Modern and Alekhine. In all these systems, the Classical Variation offers White serious chances to obtain an opening advantage, and the immortal games of past champions like Geller and Karpov provide textbook illustrations of successful 'Classical' 1.e4 play. In contrast, the Be2  (Classical)  variation against the ordinary, un-Accelerated Dragon is rather harmless for Black, the Yugoslav Attack being its critical test. As Accelerated Dragon players, we are in an even more favorable situation than ordinary Dragon players when it comes to the Classical variation, because we can choose to transpose to harmless variations of the Classical Dragon by opting for ...d7-d6 at opportune moments, and in some lines we can strike with ...d7-d5 directly, saving a full tempo compared with analogous lines in the Dragon. Despite the fact that this system offers White no advantage, it is still seen in about 15% of Accelerated Dragons  (the other 85% are nearly evenly distributed between the Maroczy and Bc4 variations)  , the bulk of which occur at the club level.  @@HeaderStart@@Contents@@HeaderEnd@@  1. 6.--   2. 6.Be3 Nf6 7.-- & 7...d5!?   3. 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Be2 0-0 8.--   4. 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 }

{ I follow Donaldson and Silman in referring to this system as the 'Anti-Yugoslav variation'. In their words, 'We call this system the Anti-Yugoslav because 7... Qa5 more or less forces White to castle kingside and thus avoids the dangers of the Yugoslav Attack in the Dragon.' This concession from White is not without compromise from Black. In his repertoire book on the White side of 1. e4, Negi points out the defects in Black's position: '...the queen on a5 is badly placed - it just gets in the way of Black's typical plans like ...Na5, or ...b5/...a5. Now ...b5 can always be met by a2-a3 without any worries. Black also has the typical plan of ... Nxd4 and . . .Bc6 available but if White avoids playing f2-f4, the positions after Nd5  (intending to meet ...Bxd5 with exd5)  seem quite pleasant for him. Moreover, it is not easy for Black to find a new square for the queen. Going to c7 will only encourage Bg5, with ideas of Bxf6 and Nd5, so the most common plan is ... Qh5. Although this may offer a few tactical tricks, it's hard to believe that the queen can be well placed there' I do not disagree with Negi - Black's queen usually does need to be relocated from a5, because the c6-Knight wants that square, and very often Black's maneuvers in this system are  (in his words)  'hard to believe'. That being said, the fact that White players will be incredulous towards Black's maneuvers is a positive feature of Black's strategy  (in this specific variation and more broadly in the Accelerated Dragon)  , not a reason to avoid this line. In my experience playing this system over the board for more than sixteen years, White players have real difficulty managing their position, because Black's Queen on a5 means that play neither resembles the Yugoslav Attack nor does it follow the usual paths in the Bc4/ O-O Dragon. White therefore must be extremely accurate in order to pose any problems whatsoever for Black, and more often than not White players are unprepared to do so. Black, in his favor, is usually confined to deciding between a few typical themes, and that makes his life much easier. Earlier in the book I mentioned that I was initially drawn to this system for its incredible 'cheapo potential', but to reassure the reader that this is a serious, safe, and reliable counter to 7. Bc4, I point out that Ivanchuk relied on this system at the highest stage when he employed it against Grischuk in the London Candidates, 2013   see  10.Nd5 !?  in the next chapter }
8. O-O
{ Conventional wisdom dictates that this is basically forced, but in my opinion 8. f3 is not to be underestimated either.   8.Qd2 ?  For White players who have never seen 7... Qa5, this blunder is not a rare occurrence.  Nxe4 !  9.Nxc6   9.Nxe4  Qxd2+  10.Nxd2  Nxd4  ∓  9...Qxc3 !!  ∓  I've had the pleasure of playing this over the board many times. Black is up at least a pawn in all variations.   8.Nb3 ?  Another frequent sighting when facing unprepared opposition.  Qb4 !  9.Bd3   9.Nd2  Apparently, according to Donaldson and Silman, this was an idea of the late GM Pilnik, who felt that White had enough compensation for a pawn. Plausible as it may have been at the time, modern computers demonstrate concretely that White just ends up suffering here - and being down material.  Qxb2  10.Nb5  Qe5  11.f4  Qb8  12.e5  Nxe5 !  13.fxe5  Qxe5  14.Nf1  Ng4 !  15.Qxg4  Qxa1+  16.Kf2  O-O  ∓  9...Nxe4 !  10.Bxe4  Bxc3+  11.bxc3  Qxe4  ∓   8.f3 !?  This move is highly underrated; for example, Donaldson and Silman, as well as Negi give the move a question mark.  Qb4 !  Black must not allow White to play Qd2 and O-O-O, establishing a Yugoslav setup. The 'Anti-Yugoslav variation' wouldn't be aptly named if it allowed this !  9.Ndb5 !  White takes advantage of Black's queen being on b4, and therefore the c7 square being vulnerable. This move has surprisingly been overlooked by other commentators.   9.Bb3 ?  Nxe4  10.Nxc6  Bxc3+  11.bxc3  Qxc3+  12.Ke2  dxc6  13.Qd4  Qxd4  14.Bxd4  Nf6  15.Rhe1  Rg8 !

If memory serves, it was Bent Larsen who claimed that in unusual positions the best moves are often unusual themselves. The following maneuever may appear unusual, but it will be a recurring theme in this book.  Ne8 !  Black's knight unblocks the g7 bishop and heads to d6, targeting the c4 square.  16.Na4  Nd6 !  17.Be3  Qb5  18.Qd5  Ba6 = }
8... O-O
{ By far the most popular move for White here is 9. Bb3, which will be the subject of the next few chapters. Here we consider alternatives for White. }
9. Nb3
{ This is a clever line: if Black continues 9... Qa5-d8, White intends to accept the loss of a tempo with Bc4-e2, because Black has lost two tempi with ...Qd8-a5-d8. Thus, a position from the Classical Dragon is reached a full tempo up for White. This was reason enough for Donaldson and Silman to attribute a '?' to 9. ..Qd8, but in my judgment the Classical Dragon is 'so equal' that even a tempo down, Black has no problems.   9.f3 ?!  Qc5  10.Bb3  If you ask a seasoned Accelerated Dragon player how many times the d4-knight is currently under attack, they will surely say 'three', never forgetting to include the g7-bishop, which can be uncovered with tempo.  Ng4 !  11.fxg4  Bxd4  12.Bxd4  Nxd4  13.Kh1  Qe5  14.Nd5  Nc6 =   9.Nd5  White cannot hope for an advantage by releasing the central tension so quickly.

9... Qd8
{ I recommend calling White out on their cleverness. If White plays the 7. Bc4 variation against the Accelerated Dragon   as opposed to  7.Be2  in the hope that they will be able to favorably transpose into a 7. Be2 line, then they probably don't have much experience with Be2 systems, so we should welcome this transposition. Besides, it is no more correct to say that Black is down a tempo in this line than it is to say that Black is up a tempo in the Classical line as compared to this one ! Retreating the queen to d8 is the simplest way for Black to handle the position; he intends to continue in the same fashion as I recommended in the Be2 chapter. It is worth mentioning that super GM Malakhov has adopted this move in more than one tournament game.   9...Qh5  I used to enjoy playing this when I was younger. It amazed me that Black's queen could get away with such tightrope acrobatics. Unfortunately I can't recommend this for anything other than, perhaps, blitz chess.  10.Be2  Qh4  11.f3  Nh5  12.Qd2   12.Bf2 ?!  One little inaccuracy from White and Black is back in business.

In this opening, though, what matters is the level of counterplay, not objective assessment. With White threatening Bg5xf6 and Nc3-d5, Black's counterplay is put on hold in order to defend further, and so compared to 9... Qd8 ! which genuinely offers equal chances, I assess this as slightly preferable for White.   10.f4  d6  11.Be2  a6  12.Qe1  Bg4  13.Bxg4  Nxg4  14.Nd5  Qd8   14...Qb8  15.c3  e6  16.Nb6  Nxe3  17.Qxe3  Qa7  18.Rad1  Rad8 =  15.Bb6  Qd7  16.Rd1  Nf6  17.Nxf6+  Bxf6  18.e5  +=  1-0  (62)  Wei Yi  (2641)  -Bu Xiangzhi  (2710)  Zhongshan CHN 2014 }

{ I am a little surprised that Negi didn't recommend this in his book. This rare move is extremely underrated, and has only been played by one 2500+ player - none other than Negi himself  (Negi-Khalifman 2007)  . The main upshot of this move from White's perspective is that it deters Black from his usual, comfortable course of ...Bd7-e8 and ...Nf6-d7, because White's f-file pressure can become overwhelming.   12.Qe2  Qh5 !   12...Be8  This is playable as well but 12...

{ The Anti-Yugoslav Variation   7...Qa5  seemed to me to be in trouble after Grischuk-Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013   recall Grischuk's  10.Nd5 !?  . In the summer of 2013 I had not yet discovered the equalizing 10... Qd8 ! novelty, and I found myself struggling to meet the 7. Bc4 variation. I searched the database for some guidance, but to no avail. At the time I was simultaneously a Taimanov Sicilian player as well, and at some point it occurred to me that nobody plays Bc4 against the Taimanov, presumably because its scope on c4 is stunted by the e6 pawn. This led to the idea of meeting the Bc4 variation with an eventual ... e7-e6, and transporting ideas from the Taimanov such as ...a6-...Qc7-...b5-... Bb7-...Nc6-a5   e5  , and even ... Nf6-e8-d6. The process of developing this system has been some of the most enjoyable chess research I have engaged in, and I am pleased to say it has resulted in a powerful and truly novel system. As the 'prime mover' of this project, my work is undoubtedly incomplete. There are reams of unexplored possibilities, and I encourage readers to attempt their own contributions. The following chapters are by no means the final - only the first - word on this system. }

{ From my experience playing this system over the last few years, most players, never having seen this system before, follow a safe course of castling kingside as White usually does in the 7. Bc4 system. However, in this particular system, White castling kingside leads to easy equality for Black, which I take to be a significant practical upshot of this system. We will postpone our discussion of White's queenside castling until the next chapter. }

It turns out that Black can contain White's kingside attack and solidify the center with ...e7-e6, and only then proceed with queenside and/or central counterplay. For his part, White must keep the attack going with urgency, because Black's queenside counterplay is just a few moves away, and it will come with devastating effect.  ...Rac8, ...Rfd8, ...

{ The character of the position demands that this be played. Timidity will not suffice; time is of the essence in the race to determine which of the flank attacks will succeed. My initial attitude towards this system was that I should delay ...e7-e6 for as long as possible, because I felt I would always have the option later on, and I thought there could be more useful attacking moves on the queenside such as 13... Na5  (which also guards the important d5-square)  . However, as I delved deeper into this variation, I realized that Black should keep the knight on c6 for a little longer to deter White's Be3-h6. The result is a rather peculiar middlegame 'standoff', where White cannot make progress with Be3-h6 until Black moves his knight from c6, but at the same time Black cannot make progress on the queenside until he does either.   13.Nxc6  This may look unnatural - and it is - but the 'computer move' which it is based on   14.Bd4 !  is not to be underestimated. Black's f6-knight is the MVP  (most valuable piece)  of his position, as without it, White's g2-g4xh5 would be decisive. Fortunately, the f6-knight is difficult to get at, as 13.

{ Like 13... Na5, this move also prevents White's g4-g5 followed by Nc3-d5, but by keeping the knight on c6, White's Be3-h6 is hindered. What follows is somewhat a game of 'cat and mouse' - White's main resource of Be3-h6 is unavailable at present, and it is difficult to see how to continue the attack without that. Black would welcome White's g4-g5, which locks up the kingside and directs Black's knight to d6 via e8. On the other hand, Black's queenside attack is stalled by the fact that he can't play ...Nc6-a5 without allowing Be3-h6. That being said, whereas White is at a loss for ways to improve his position, Black can place his rooks on the d-and-c  (or b-)  files and threaten both central counterplay and a queenside pawn storm.    13...Na5 ?!  14.Bh6 !  This is ultimately the problem with 13... Na5 - White gets to exchange Black's 'Dragon bishop'.

However, as Suba teaches in his book Dynamic Chess Strategy, 'initiative is a psychological advantage', so it is up to us as defenders to grant or deny this advantage to our opponents. The aggressor is not better simply by virtue of being on the offensive: White was the first to initiate action but if we defend well, he may quickly run out of steam and be left with no attack and static pawn weaknesses.

Not an easy move for humans to find because we tend to expect that the battle will be decided on the kingside. The logic of this move is clear: White threatens e4-e5, and Black cannot prevent this with 15... d6 for tactical reasons. Furthermore, White's pressure on the kingside is still felt, and eventually some sort of Nd4-f5 or gxh5 will be decisive.   15.Bxg7  This eases Black's task a little; there is no need to take on g7, as Black certainly couldn't allow White's queen to infiltrate by taking on h6  Kxg7  16.g5   16.Rhe1  Nxb3+  17.axb3  d6  +=  16...Ne8 !   16...Ng8 !?  17.Rhe1  b4   17...Ne7  18.f4  Rad8  19.f5  Kg8  Black's position is surprisingly resilient  18.Na4  e5  19.Ne2  Nxb3+  20.axb3  Rac8  21.Kb1  a5  22.c4  Bc6 =  17.Kb1  Rd8 !

{ Small 'refinement' moves like this are useful prophylaxis for when the position  (inevitably)  explodes.   14.a3  This is admittedly a 'computer move' - I can't imagine many humans will weaken their king position unprovoked. Nevertheless, it is instructive to see how Black builds up attacking potential.  Rfc8 !  In such positions it is notoriously difficult to decide which rook to put on a given file. Pal Benko is rumored to have joked that his method is as follows: think really hard, decide which rook would be the right choice, then play the other rook !

{ We are in unexplored territory here, so I can only guess what White's likely choice would be in an over-the-board situation. I suspect that the urge to 'do something' would be overwhelming, and White would be the first to cave in. These days we tend to think the onus is on White to initiate complications.

{ We have here the starting position of the Maroczy Bind, named after Hungarian master Geza Maroczy  (1870-1951)  . Maroczy was one of the best players in the world in the early 1900s, and was even set to play a World Championship match with Emanuel Lasker in 1906, but for various political reasons the match did not end up taking place. He was an engineer by training, and a financial auditor by profession. Capablanca, near the end of his life in the early 1940s, said of Maroczy that 'with the exception of Botvinnik and Keres, Maroczy in his time was superior to all the other young masters of today.' Maroczy popularized White's setup in his capacity as a chess journalist, but there are no published games of his where he played the system with White. In fact, the first recorded game in the Maroczy Bind is Swiderski-Maroczy, 1904, where Maroczy defended the Black side of the Accelerated Dragon against the  (to be named)  Maroczy Bind. In order to combat the Maroczy Bind, Black must follow a dark-squares strategy. Notice that in asserting the central c4/e4 'clamp', White has forever denied the  (dark)  d4-square protection from a pawn. We will see in the next chapter that the Breyer Variation is based on seizing this square from White's grip. In keeping with the dark-squares strategy, exchanging dark-squared bishops is in general congenial to Black. In fact, GM Tiviakov once highlighted the importance of this exchange by playing the highly creative, though slightly dubious, 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Bh6 !? }
5... Nc6 6. Nc2
{ This is not the most challenging line for Black, but since it has been played by Keres, Tal, Korchnoi, and Carlsen, it has earned our serious attention. White usually waits for Black to play ... Bc8-d7 before retreating this Knight, because Black's two most common ways of countering Nc2 are either a  ...Nf6-d7-c5, often capturing on c3 with the g7 bishop  (an option made available by White's departure from d4)  , or b  ... Bc8-e6  (which is not recommended when White's knight is on d4)  and quickly targeting the c4 pawn with ...Ra8-c8, ...Nc6-e5, etc. The latter of these plans will be covered when we discuss the 'Main Line' Maroczy. Here I will go over two additional systems for the reader who wishes to take advantage of White's premature retreat. }
6... e6
{ This move is almost a novelty, but  (to my dismay)  not quite: it has been played a mere four times  (and with different intentions to ours)  in the recorded history of our game. The idea of this move occurred to me while I was analyzing the ...Ne8-d6 maneuver in the 6. ..Nf6 line, where Black often plays ...f7-f5 and recaptures on f5 with the knight. I wondered whether Black could reach similar positions and save some time by taking the route Ng8-e7-f5 rather than Ng8-f6-e8-d6-f5. I was also aware of similar ideas with colors reversed in the English opening, such as after 1. c4 e5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Nc3 Nb6 6. e3 !? or 1. c4 c5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nc7 6. e3 !?. Black's basic idea is to go for a quick ...f7-f5, and then recapture on f5 with the knight, from where it controls the important d4 square and also often pressurizes White's e3 bishop. White can take one of  (at least)  two strategies: either try to develop normally and hope that Black's offbeat play will lead to static positional weaknesses in the middlegame, or White can aim for a refutation of the system with an early h2-h4 or Bc1-f4-d6. According to my analysis, Black equalizes in all variations.   6...Nf6  7.Nc3  O-O  8.Be2  b6  The double-fianchetto is particularly adept at meeting White's Nd4-c2. With the knight on d4, a reliable way to meet Black's double fianchetto is with Nd4xc6, which is not possible here.  9.O-O  Bb7  Black intends to continue with the at first glance unbelievable, but in this book thematic, ...Nf6-e8-d6, followed by ...f7-f5.  10.f3   10.Bf4  This deters Black's ...Ne8-d6 idea but after ... Nf6-e8 Black may instead gain a tempo on the f4-bishop after ...Ne8-c7-e6. Also, White's f4-bishop is under X-ray attack from Black's f8 rook after an eventual ... f7-f5.  Rc8  11.Ne3  Ne8  12.f3   12.Ng4 ??  h5  13.Ne3 ?  e5  -+  Herman-Panjwani, New York 2014  12...Nc7  13.Ned5  Ne6  14.Be3  f5  15.exf5  Rxf5  ⇆  Black will continue with ...Ne6-d4, ...e7-e6, and eventually .. . d7-d5.   10.Bg5  Not the most popular, but quite possibly White's best.  Ne8 !   10...Rc8 ?!  Black should not delay ... Nf6-e8, because that allows White to coordinate in the center and render the plan too slow.  11.f3  h6  12.Be3  Kh7  13.Qe1  Ne8 ?!  14.Rd1  Nd6 ?!  15.Qd2 !   15.Kh1  f5  16.c5  bxc5  17.Bxc5  fxe4  18.Bxd6  exf3  19.Bxf3  exd6  ⇆  0-1  (35)  Sadorra,J  (2431)  -Jobava,B  (2664)  Al Ain UAE 2008  15...f5  16.exf5  Nxf5  17.Qxd7  Nxe3  18.Nxe3  ±  11.Qd2   11.f3  Bxc3   11...Nd6  12.Qxd6 !  exd6  13.Bxd8  Raxd8  14.Rad1  +=  Black certainly has compensation for the weakened structure, because White is without his prized dark-squared bishop, but I think Black's compensation will be at best enough for a draw, and as a general rule it is worth avoiding positions where your opponent is playing for two results.  12.bxc3  Ng7  ⇆  Black will play in accordance with the system of Nimzowitsch: first blockade White's doubled c-pawns with ... d7-d6, ...Ng7-e6-c5, then pile up on the weak c4-pawn with ...Ra8-c8, ... Nc6-a5, ...Bb7-a6.  11...Nd6  12.f3  f5 !   12...f6  It is instructive to see how Black ends up worse after this move.  13.Bf4   13.Bh6  Bxh6  14.Qxh6  Ne5  15.b3  g5  ⇆  13...Ne5  14.Ne3  f5  15.exf5  Nxf5  16.Nxf5  Rxf5  17.Be3  Rc8  18.b3  Black cannot allow White to coordinate like this, because Black has made anti-positional moves and he can only get away with them if he plays energetically enough to prevent White from 'achieving harmony'. Therefore, Black lives and dies by the power of his counterplay: here, unfortunately, Black has capitulated control over the center, and is consequently unable to achieve the desired ...d7-d5.  Nf7  19.Rad1  Nd6  20.Bd4  +=  13.exf5  Both recaptures on f5 are interesting, but my analysis indicates that 13... Nxf5 is the better of the two.  Nxf5   13...Rxf5 ?!  14.Bh6 !  This move, which is all too easy for White to find, makes life difficult for Black. From a broader perspective this should not surprise us: by exchanging pieces White dulls Black's counterplay, which is Black's only compensation for his hanging central pawns and multiple weaknesses.   14.Be3  Qf8 !  15.Rad1  Rf7  16.c5  Nf5  17.cxb6  e6  18.bxa7  Nxe3  19.Qxe3  Nxa7  =∞  14...Qf8  15.Bxg7  Qxg7  16.b3  Raf8  17.Rad1  g5  In a practical game Black can probably get away with playing like this, but I cannot recommend this as something to aim for from the outset.  18.Bd3  Rf4  19.Ne4  Ne5  20.Nxd6  exd6  21.Be2 !

{ We have here the starting position of the Maroczy Bind, named after Hungarian master Geza Maroczy  (1870-1951)  . Maroczy was one of the best players in the world in the early 1900s, and was even set to play a World Championship match with Emanuel Lasker in 1906, but for various political reasons the match did not end up taking place. He was an engineer by training, and a financial auditor by profession. Capablanca, near the end of his life in the early 1940s, said of Maroczy that 'with the exception of Botvinnik and Keres, Maroczy in his time was superior to all the other young masters of today.' Maroczy popularized White's setup in his capacity as a chess journalist, but there are no published games of his where he played the system with White. In fact, the first recorded game in the Maroczy Bind is Swiderski-Maroczy, 1904, where Maroczy defended the Black side of the Accelerated Dragon against the  (to be named)  Maroczy Bind. In order to combat the Maroczy Bind, Black must follow a dark-squares strategy. Notice that in asserting the central c4/e4 'clamp', White has forever denied the  (dark)  d4-square protection from a pawn. We will see in the next chapter that the Breyer Variation is based on seizing this square from White's grip. In keeping with the dark-squares strategy, exchanging dark-squared bishops is in general congenial to Black. In fact, GM Tiviakov once highlighted the importance of this exchange by playing the highly creative, though slightly dubious, 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Bh6 !? }

{ We have here the starting position of the Maroczy Bind, named after Hungarian master Geza Maroczy  (1870-1951)  . Maroczy was one of the best players in the world in the early 1900s, and was even set to play a World Championship match with Emanuel Lasker in 1906, but for various political reasons the match did not end up taking place. He was an engineer by training, and a financial auditor by profession. Capablanca, near the end of his life in the early 1940s, said of Maroczy that 'with the exception of Botvinnik and Keres, Maroczy in his time was superior to all the other young masters of today.' Maroczy popularized White's setup in his capacity as a chess journalist, but there are no published games of his where he played the system with White. In fact, the first recorded game in the Maroczy Bind is Swiderski-Maroczy, 1904, where Maroczy defended the Black side of the Accelerated Dragon against the  (to be named)  Maroczy Bind. In order to combat the Maroczy Bind, Black must follow a dark-squares strategy. Notice that in asserting the central c4/e4 'clamp', White has forever denied the  (dark)  d4-square protection from a pawn. We will see in the next chapter that the Breyer Variation is based on seizing this square from White's grip. In keeping with the dark-squares strategy, exchanging dark-squared bishops is in general congenial to Black.

Black's basic idea is to go for a quick ...f7-f5, and then recapture on f5 with the knight, from where it controls the important d4 square and also often pressurizes White's e3 bishop. White can take one of  (at least)  two strategies: either try to develop normally and hope that Black's offbeat play will lead to static positional weaknesses in the middlegame, or White can aim for a refutation of the system with an early h2-h4 or Bc1-f4-d6.

{ We have here the starting position of the Maroczy Bind, named after Hungarian master Geza Maroczy  (1870-1951)  . Maroczy was one of the best players in the world in the early 1900s, and was even set to play a World Championship match with Emanuel Lasker in 1906, but for various political reasons the match did not end up taking place. He was an engineer by training, and a financial auditor by profession. Capablanca, near the end of his life in the early 1940s, said of Maroczy that 'with the exception of Botvinnik and Keres, Maroczy in his time was superior to all the other young masters of today.' Maroczy popularized White's setup in his capacity as a chess journalist, but there are no published games of his where he played the system with White. In fact, the first recorded game in the Maroczy Bind is Swiderski-Maroczy, 1904, where Maroczy defended the Black side of the Accelerated Dragon against the  (to be named)  Maroczy Bind. In order to combat the Maroczy Bind, Black must follow a dark-squares strategy. Notice that in asserting the central c4/e4 'clamp', White has forever denied the  (dark)  d4-square protection from a pawn. We will see in the next chapter that the Breyer Variation is based on seizing this square from White's grip. In keeping with the dark-squares strategy, exchanging dark-squared bishops is in general congenial to Black.

Unlike the Maroczy Bind   5.c4  , which was never played by its namesake Geza Maroczy, the Breyer variation was indeed first played by Gyula Breyer in Kostic-Breyer, Gothenburg 1920.

True, in the middlegame - after both sides have developed - the trade of dark squared bishops is generally desirable for Black, but here Black purchases this exchange at the cost of precious time.  9.Bxd4  Nxd4  10.O-O-O !

9... e5
{ Bent Larsen used to prefer 9... Ne6, but I think 9... e5 offers more chances for counterplay based on Black's occupation of the center. Computers generally tend to prefer White in the Breyer, but from my experience even 2600+ GMs find it very uncomfortable to 'play around' Black's d4 knight, which  (invariably)  leads them to mishandle White's position. This line has a very Sveshnikov Sicilian feel to it. Fischer taught us that "you have to give squares to get squares"; Black has opted to relinquish control over the light squares  (especially d5)  in order to stake a claim over the all-important d4 square. This is the first significant branching point for White: he will either develop routinely with Bd3, O-O, Qd2, etc., or he will attempt to immediately take advantage of Black's weaknesses with 10. Nb5. We consider these options in the coming chapters, but we begin with an underrated sideline. }
10. Be2
{ If this move is followed by routine development, then it lacks independent value, since White's bishop is better placed on d3. However, there are some idiosyncrasies to this line if White combines Bf1-e2 with Nc3-b5. }
10... O-O
{ 10...d6  The reader can make life easier for themselves by playing 10... d6 in response to any of White's major options, but since he can get away with it, it is at least symbolically more flexible for Black to castle first. }
11. Nb5

{ Bent Larsen used to prefer Ne6, but I think e5 offers more chances for counterplay based on Black's occupation of the center. Computers generally tend to prefer White in the Breyer, but from my experience even 2600+ GMs find it very uncomfortable to 'play around' Black's d4 knight, which  (invariably)  leads them to mishandle White's position. This line has a very Sveshnikov Sicilian feel to it. Fischer taught us that "you have to give squares to get squares"; Black has opted to relinquish control over the light squares  (especially d5)  in order to stake a claim over the all-important d4 square. This is the first significant branching point for White: he will either develop routinely with Bd3, O-O, Qd2, etc., or he will attempt to immediately take advantage of Black's weaknesses with 10. Nb5. We consider these options in the coming chapters, but we begin with an underrated sideline. }
10. Be2
{ If this move is followed by routine development, then it lacks independent value, since White's bishop is better placed on d3. However, there are some idiosyncrasies to this line if White combines Bf1-e2 with Nc3-b5. }
10... O-O 11. O-O d6 12. Qd2 Be6
{ White can obtain this position with his bishop more appropriately placed on d3. In fact, my computer recommends that White play 13. Bd3 here. }

12... Be6
{ It is worth dissecting this position a little, because it is one where general understanding of themes is more important than concrete knowledge of moves. Black's counterplay will take root in either  (or both)  ...f7-f5 or ...b7-b5, but suppose for a moment that Black 'does nothing' - what will White do ? There are basically two plans at White's disposal that Black must constantly be prepared to meet: White will either aim for Nc3-e2 or go for f2-f4. Black generally has three ways of meeting Nc3-e2: capture on e2, ignore it and play . ..b7-b5, or retreat ...Nd4-c6. Which of these Black plays will depend on the concrete timing of White's Nc3-e2; sometimes all three options are viable for Black. In response to f2-f4, Black will either  (and not both this time)  play .. .f7-f5, or he will capture on f4 and re-route his knight from d4 to e5 via c6. Of course, Black should not 'do nothing'; he should remain flexible so as to be able to play either ...f7-f5 or ...b7-b5 depending on what White does. Black's a8 rook will either be placed on c8 or b8. Black's Queen usually goes to d7, but as we will see it can also find a home on e7,c7, or a5. An important disclaimer is in order before we continue: computers favor White by approximately +0.4 in most lines. However, when one presses the computer to formulate a plan, it is totally at a loss: while maintaining its += evaluation, it recommends shifting White's pieces back and forth aimlessly. So, my point is, do not be discouraged by the engine's prejudice - it has similar biases against the King's Indian and other respectable openings as well. }

Black's counterplay will take root in either  (or both)  ...f7-f5 or ...b7-b5, but suppose for a moment that Black 'does nothing' - what will White do ? There are basically two plans at White's disposal that Black must constantly be prepared to meet: White will either aim for Nc3-e2 or go for f2-f4. Black generally has three ways of meeting Nc3-e2: capture on e2, ignore it and play . ..b7-b5, or retreat ...Nd4-c6. Which of these Black plays will depend on the concrete timing of White's Nc3-e2; sometimes all three options are viable for Black. In response to f2-f4, Black will either  (and not both this time)  play .. .f7-f5, or he will capture on f4 and re-route his knight from d4 to e5 via c6. Of course, Black should not 'do nothing'; he should remain flexible so as to be able to play either ...f7-f5 or ...b7-b5 depending on what White does. Black's a8 rook will either be placed on c8 or b8. Black's Queen usually goes to d7, but as we will see it can also find a home on e7,c7, or a5. An important disclaimer is in order before we continue: computers favor White by approximately +0.4 in most lines. However, when one presses the computer to formulate a plan, it is totally at a loss: while maintaining its += evaluation, it recommends shifting White's pieces back and forth aimlessly. So, my point is, do not be discouraged by the engine's prejudice - it has similar biases against the King's Indian and other respectable openings as well. }

{ I was pleasantly surprised to come across this very rare idea in a book on pawn structures by Andy Soltis. Soviet  (grand)  masters of the 1950s and 1960s like Simagin, Bagirov, Aronson, and Veresov developed some truly original ideas in this system. Even if their crafty maneuvers are ultimately 'too good to be true', it is instructive to play over their games to get a feel for this system. Black plans to continue with ... Bc8-b7, ...Rf8-e8, ...Ra8-c8, followed by ... Bf8-c5/...Nd4-e6, or ... Re8-e6-d6 ! I envy them for playing chess in the pre-computer era; the analysis of this variation must have brought them such joy. Computers do spoil the fun a little, but there is no clear refutation of the idea either. }

{ This variation does not have an accepted name, but because it is the top choice of virtually all the top Accelerated Dragon players nowadays, I will refer to it as the 'main line'. Compared with the Breyer Variation, this line is far more nuanced and, frankly, difficult to play well  (for both sides)  . As with all practical matters, the choice involves a tradeoff: the Breyer is easy to play for Black, but if White plays accurately  (which very few are able to do in practice)  then he can achieve a slightly more pleasant position  (if you find this state of affairs to be unacceptable, I recommend abandoning the Sicilian altogether in favor of the Berlin or Marshall)  . In this line Black's counterplay is more reactive in nature - Black can't just 'wear a blindfold' and proceed with a plan on autopilot, but in return Black can count on dynamic equality and a tense struggle where all three results are on the table. }

{ There are many ways to play this position for Black, but the main tabiya involves Black playing  (in various move orders)  ...Bc8-d7, ...Nc6xd4, ... Bd7-c6, ...a7-a5, ...Nf6-d7-c5. The question of move order is an important one for Black here: should Black start with 9... Bd7 or first play 9... Nxd4 10. Bxd4 Bd7 ? In practice they usually transpose, because most White players are unwilling to play a different line against each of these, preferring instead to enter the Qd2 main line regardless of Black's move order. That being said, according to my research, 9. ..Bd7 is the significantly better move order  (and it is introducted in the next chapter)  , in light of 9... Nxd4 10. Bxd4 Bd7 11. Qd3 ! }

{ This is not a new move, it was first played in Smyslov-Pirc 1956  (1-0)  ; for some reason it has not caught on. I owe Kevin Spraggett for revealing its strength to me. White's basic idea is to prophylactically defend the e4-pawn so that ...Bd7-c6 can be met with b2-b4 ! White usually wants to wait for Black's bishop to be on c6 before playing b2-b4, because the weak c4-pawn is under less pressure when Black's bishop is on c6 as opposed to e6. In general Black wants to prevent White from playing b2-b4  (at least)  until his knight has landed on c5, so the central theme of this variation is White trying to achieve b2-b4 and Black trying to either prevent it or render it premature. Unfortunately, nothing seems to work for Black. I will present the following lines without comment, because I am recommending we avoid this altogether, but I encourage the reader to try to find improvements on my analysis, and to at least skim through the ensuing variations to get a feel for which positions are playable for Black and which are to be avoided.   11.b4  Be6  12.f3  Nd7  13.Nd5  Bxd4+  14.Qxd4  Bxd5  15.cxd5  a5  16.a3  axb4  17.axb4  Rxa1  18.Rxa1  Qc7 = }

{ The downside of this line is 10. Nc2, whereas the downside of the 9... Nxd4 move order is 11. Qd3 ! In my judgment we should prefer to allow White 10. Nc2 here. Let's first have a look at some side moves. }
10. Nb3
{ The logic of this move is similar to 10. Nc2: since White has more space, he wants to avoid exchanges to keep Black's position cramped. Furthermore, the 'soft' c4-pawn can be defended by Nb3-d2, as it often is by Nc2-a3 in the 10. Nc2 line.   10.Rc1  Nxd4  11.Bxd4  Nowadays I prefer to play 11... Bc6 here, because things are likely to transpose to the 10. Qd2 line where White's rook on c1 does nothing to promote the central positional aim of b2-b4. The reader may prefer 11...

{ This is one of the few times in the book where I'll give White a slight advantage in a main recommendation. The reader should be suspicious of authors who claim pure equality in all lines in anything other than the most topical lines of the Ruy Lopez or perhaps the Najdorf Sicilian. This is the sort of += we have to live with as Accelerated Dragon players. White played very well to get here; he had to navigate his way around many landmines. After all that, we can seek consolation in the fact that objectively speaking, there are only three results in chess, and '+=' is just short-hand for '= after accurate play'. The onus is on White to improve his position; Black can shift his pieces around until White makes a concession. For example, if White goes for g4-g5, then Black may relocate his knight to c5 via d7, and place his bishop on e5, perhaps combined with ... Qa5-b4. }

{ This is one of the few times in the book where I'll give White a slight advantage in a main recommendation. The reader should be suspicious of authors who claim pure equality in all lines in anything other than the most topical lines of the Ruy Lopez or perhaps the Najdorf Sicilian. This is the sort of += we have to live with as Accelerated Dragon players. White played very well to get here; he had to navigate his way around many landmines. After all that, we can seek consolation in the fact that objectively speaking, there are only three results in chess, and '+=' is just short-hand for '= after accurate play'. The onus is on White to improve his position; Black can shift his pieces around until White makes a concession. For example, if White goes for g4-g5, then Black may relocate his knight to c5 via d7, and place his bishop on e5, perhaps combined with ... Qa5-b4. }

Rfc8, . ..h5, ...Qd8, ...Kh7, and ... Qh8 with pressure on the long diagonal. This is the line I mentioned early in the book, which Mamedov suggested was equal. Playing this plan on autopilot has its appeal, but because of its extravagance most White players are aware of it nowadays, and will not be caught off guard. The line I recommend in lieu of this is, in contrast, quite rare  (it is played only about 8% of the time, but it has been growing in popularity)  and in my judgment equally sound, but with far greater surprise value. The idea is to fight for the center with ... e7-e6 and ...Bg7-e5, ideally followed by ...f7-f5. Black's bishop is rather safe on e5, because White can scarcely achieve f3-f4 without losing the e4-pawn. White tends to focus his attention in one  (or more)  of three directions: either he will directly target the weakness on d6 that Black creates after ...e7-e6, or he will try to achieve f3-f4 which indirectly targets d6 by hitting its defender  (the bishop to be on e5)  , or as always White can 'ignore' Black's central gestures and continue with the usual a3/b4 queenside expansion. }

Qb6  -+  23...Qb6  =∞   16.Bd1  I first came across this move when Cuban GM Abreu seemed to come up with it over the board against me after a long think in the game I mentioned in the opening remarks of this book. However, he was not the first to play it; that honor goes to the late Bulgarian GM Georgi Tringov who played it in 1986.16. Bd1 is a perfectly logical move: the bishop will relocate to c2, from where it simultaneously bolsters the critical e4, b3, and a4 squares. White already threatens 17. a3 since the knight cannot hop into b3 after 17... a4 18. b4. In the last few years, 16. Bd1 has been played more times than it has in all previous years combined. I think the most common move, 16... Be5, does not equalize for Black, but 16... Qc7 does. It makes sense too - Black targets the c4-square which has been abandoned by the relocation of the e2-bishop. I thank IM Dave Ross for suggesting this move to me.  Qc7 !  This move is a good illustration of the aforementioned 'reactive' nature of Black's play in this line. White relocates his bishop to c2, so Black targets the c4-pawn with his queen, and in some lines with his knight by relocating to e5 via d7.   16...f5 ?!  17.exf5  gxf5   17...Rxf5  18.Ne2  ±  41 Tringov, G-Haik,A/ Vrnjacka Banja 1986  18.Bc2  f4  19.Bf2  Qg5  20.Kh1  Be5  21.Rfe1  Qg7  22.Ne2  b6  23.Nd4  Bb7  24.a3  Rf6  25.b4  Nd7  26.Nb5  Kh8  27.Bg1  axb4  28.axb4  Rg8  29.Re2  d5  30.Rbe1   30.cxd5  +=2  Bxd5  31.Bb3  Bxb3  32.Rxb3  ±  30...dxc4  31.Nd4  Rh6  32.Rxe5 ??

Black's bishop is rather safe on e5, because White can scarcely achieve f3-f4 without losing the e4-pawn. White tends to focus his attention in one  (or more)  of three directions: either he will directly target the weakness on d6 that Black creates after ...e7-e6, or he will try to achieve f3-f4 which indirectly targets d6 by hitting its defender  (the bishop to be on e5)  , or as always White can 'ignore' Black's central gestures and continue with the usual a3/b4 queenside expansion. }

{ I first came across this move when Cuban GM Abreu seemed to come up with it over the board against me after a long think in the game I mentioned in the opening remarks of this book. However, he was not the first to play it; that honor goes to the late Bulgarian GM Georgi Tringov who played it in 1986.16. Bd1 is a perfectly logical move: the bishop will relocate to c2, from where it simultaneously bolsters the critical e4, b3, and a4 squares. White already threatens 17. a3 since the knight cannot hop into b3 after a4 18. b4. In the last few years, 16. Bd1 has been played more times than it has in all previous years combined. I think the most common move, Be5, does not equalize for Black, but Qc7 does. It makes sense too - Black targets the c4-square which has been abandoned by the relocation of the e2-bishop. I thank IM Dave Ross for suggesting this move to me. }

{ This move is a good illustration of the aforementioned 'reactive' nature of Black's play in this line. White relocates his bishop to c2, so Black targets the c4-pawn with his queen, and in some lines with his knight by relocating to e5 via d7. }

Playing this plan on autopilot has its appeal, but because of its extravagance most White players are aware of it nowadays, and will not be caught off guard. The line I recommend in lieu of this is, in contrast, quite rare  (it is played only about 8% of the time, but it has been growing in popularity)  and in my judgment equally sound, but with far greater surprise value. The idea is to fight for the center with ... e7-e6 and ...Bg7-e5, ideally followed by ... f7-f5. Black's bishop is rather safe on e5, because White can scarcely achieve f3-f4 without losing the e4-pawn. White tends to focus his attention in one  (or more)  of three directions: either he will directly target the weakness on d6 that Black creates after ...e7-e6, or he will try to achieve f3-f4 which indirectly targets d6 by hitting its defender  (the bishop to be on e5)  , or as always White can 'ignore' Black's central gestures and continue with the usual a3/b4 queenside expansion. }

[Black "2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Overview"]

{ In these final chapters we turn to White's most popular anti-Sicilian options after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6: the Alapin, also known as the c3-Sicilian, and the Morra Gambit, also known as the Esserman Gambit. The Alapin can be played on move two   1.e4  c5  2.c3  or on move three   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  g6  3.c3  , so for convenience and consistency I recommend a line for Black which works against either of these. The Morra Gambit   1.e4  c5  2.d4  cxd4  3.c3  or  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  g6  3.d4  cxd4  4.c3  , a sister to the Alapin, has recently seen a revival, especially at the club level, thanks to the publication of IM Esserman's masterpiece 'Mayhem in the Morra'. }
1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3
{ Here we have the Morra Gambit, a system emblematic of the Romantic Era in chess - not chronologically, but in spirit: 'The masters of that time found a sound and fruitful plan: disregarding pawns, achieve a rapid development of the pieces for a swift attack on the enemy king. '  (World Champion Emanuel Lasker)  . On Steinitzian grounds one might insist that the principled continuation for Black is to accept the gambit - 'the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it'. However, there is a hidden premise in this assertion: the gambit must be refutable ! It is not at all clear to me that the Morra Gambit is refutable; on the contrary, Esserman's aforementioned book is a convincing defense of its soundness. Furthermore, as Hyper Accelerated Dragon players we offer White the option of a 'delayed' Morra Gambit 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 cxd4 4. c3 after which our options are far more limited. As best I can tell, Black cannot safely accept the delayed Morra Gambit, so for the sake of consistency I recommend declining after 1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 as well. The usual way to decline the gambit is to transpose to the Alapin with ...Ng8-f6, but this is not in keeping with my recommended Alapin repertoire. Fortunately, the ...d4-d3 line is a reliable way of transposing into Maroczy-structures which we are familiar with and happy to play as Black. I cannot overstate how frustrating it is for Morra Gambit players to be denied their Romantic fantasies and instead be lulled into a slow, maneuvering Maroczy structure. }

8. O-O
{ 8.Nc3  Nfd7 !  If Black wants to play my idea, then White must not be permitted to recapture on c3 with the queen, so Black must play ... Bxc3 before White achieves Bc1-e3 and Qd1-d2.   8...O-O  9.Be3  Nfd7  10.Qd2  This is of course playable for Black but not in keeping with our theme.  9.Be3  Bxc3+  10.bxc3  Ne5 !

{ In a similar position, Esserman cautions that White should not allow 'the queen's knight lopped off by the swooping ...Bxc3 wrecking the pristine Maroczy structure. ... Black's dark squared deficiencies overshadowed by White's mangled formation.' Here, however, White does not have much of a choice: Black is ready to capture on c3 and White's only ways to prevent it are rather contrived.   9...Nc6  Black's most popular move, but in my judgment it is insufficiently sensitive to the time factor in the position. White does, after all, have more space, so he will go on to have a more comfortable position  ('achieve harmony')  if Black is unable to pose any disruptive threats.  10.Be3  Nd7  11.Qd2  Nc5  12.Bh6 !  +=  Black should be able to defend, but White is playing for two results. }
10. Be3
{ I think if White wants to attempt an opening advantage then this is his best hope. Allow the doubled pawns, and hope there is enough dynamic compensation. In researching this structure I have come to regard White's attacking potential as quite formidable, even though computers tend to think that Black is equal 'no matter what'. I recommend immediately aiming for simplifications with 11... Ne5 ! to neutralize White's initiative.   10.Bg5  Bxc3 !  11.bxc3  Ne5  Computers take some time to appreciate this idea, but from a human perspective it is clear that exchanging pieces benefits Black. This is because White's compensation for his static pawn weaknesses must be predicated on dynamic piece play.   11...Nc5  This is perfectly playable for Black as well, but as a matter of convenience I have recommended 11... Ne5 here instead since I recommend the same idea in the main line.  12.Bc2  Be6  13.e5   13.Qe2  f6  14.Bh6  Re8 =  13...Bxc4  14.exd6  Qxd6  15.Qxd6  exd6  16.Rfd1  d5 =  12.Nxe5   12.c5  Nxd3  13.Qxd3  dxc5  14.Qxd8  Rxd8  15.Bxe7  Re8  16.Bxc5  Rxe4 =  12...dxe5  13.c5   13.f4  exf4  14.Rb1  Na6 ! =  13...Be6  14.Rb1  Nd7  15.Rxb7  Qc8 ! =   10.Nd5  This is a pretty extreme way for White to avoid ...Bg7xc3; with this concession Black can equalize with 'normal' Maroczy moves.  Nc5  11.Rb1  e6  12.Ne3   12.Nc3  Bxc3  13.bxc3  e5 =  12...a5  13.Ng4  Nc6  14.Bc2  f5  =+   10.Qe2  Bxc3  11.bxc3  Ne5  Our go-to idea: the resulting structure is always fine for Black as long as White can't immediately stir up some trouble.   11...Nc5  12.Bc2  e5 !?  This interesting blockading idea is playable as well.  13.Rd1  Nc6  14.Nd2  Be6  15.Nf1  Na5  16.Ne3  Rc8  17.Nd5  Qh4  18.Rb1  b6 =  12.Nxe5  dxe5 =   10.Qc2  White deters Black's ...Bg7xc3 but in so doing misplaces his queen.  Nc6  Threatening ...Nc6-b4.  11.a3  Nde5  12.Nxe5  Nd4 !  13.Qd1  dxe5 =   10.Bd2  This is a concession - the bishop would prefer a more active square. Now we can equalize with 'normal' Maroczy development.  Nc5  11.Bc2  Nc6  12.a3  There are of course many ways to handle this position, I just give one relatively straightforward and logical path for Black - targeting the d4-square.   12.Rb1  Nb4  13.a3  Nxc2  14.Qxc2  b6  15.b4  Ne6 =  12...b6  13.b4  Ne6  14.Bd3  Bb7  15.Rc1  Ne5 !  16.Nxe5  dxe5  17.Be3  Nd4 =   10.Qd2  Ne5 !   10...Nc6  11.b3  Nc5  12.Bb2  f5  13.exf5  Nxd3  14.Qxd3  Bxf5  15.Qe3  +=  11.Nxe5  dxe5  12.b3  Nc6  13.Bb2  b6  14.Rad1  Bb7 = }
10... Bxc3 11. bxc3 Ne5
{ I recall an interview with Aronian where he said  (paraphrasing)  that the greatest joy in chess preparation nowadays comes from finding ideas the computer is unable to immediately appreciate. That was certainly the case with this move. The computer's suggestions all enabled White to develop a dangerous kingside attack, but I was looking for something requiring less accuracy from Black. The engine initially thinks that White is += after the exchange on e5, but the human realizes that either Black is getting into immediate trouble or he'll successfully develop his pieces and be fine. If it is the latter, which it fortunately is, then '+=' is not a very meaningful assessment.   11...Nc5 ?!  12.Bxc5  dxc5  13.e5  +=   11...Nc6  This is the computer's first choice but I think the engine underestimates White's attacking potential.  12.Nd4  Nce5  13.Be2  Nb6  14.Bh6  Re8  15.f4  Nexc4  16.f5  ↑  White's attack is not devastating, but it's just not very comfortable to be Black here. The position is reminiscent of lines in the Sämisch or Rubinstein Nimzo Indian where Black doubles White's c-pawns and expends several tempos to win the c4-pawn at the cost of allowing White an f4-f5 attack.   11...Na6  This move fits with Nimzowitsch's philosophy of blockade: 'First restrain, next blockade, lastly destroy'. Unfortunately, the ideal blockade is not always the most relevant aspect of a position, and I believe Black's first priority should be to avoid a kingside onslaught by liquidating with 11... Ne5 !  12.Bc2  Nac5   12...f6  13.Nd4  Nac5  14.Bh6  Re8  15.f4  Kh8  16.h4  Rg8  17.Re1  Nb6  18.e5  dxe5  19.fxe5  Nxc4  20.exf6  exf6  21.h5  ±  13.Nd4  Re8   13...b6  14.Nc6  Qe8  15.Bh6  ±  14.f4  b6  15.f5  Ne5   15...Bb7  16.Qf3   16.fxg6  fxg6  16...Ne5  17.Qf4  Kh8  18.fxg6  fxg6  19.Qh4  Kg8  20.Rad1  +=  16.Nf3  Qc7  17.Qe1  Nxc4  18.e5  ∞  A complete mess.

However, in chess  (and in many spheres of life)  there is a phenomenon whereby the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. My father used to refer to this as 'cooperation points': for every combination of pieces, add a point, so two pieces are worth 3+3+1, ie. more than a rook+pawn  (pawns don't count as pieces)  . Similarly, three pieces are worth 3+3+3+1+1+1. This may be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's not a bad first approximation. I suspect my father thought of this himself  (in the context of a variation in the Pirc where three pieces outshine a Queen and two pawns)  , but I also came across the idea in Lasker's Chess Manual. }

{ If we accept Euler's estimation of the value of the pieces, then the material is numerically equal  (three pieces for a queen)  . However, in chess  (and in many spheres of life)  there is a phenomenon whereby the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. My father used to refer to this as 'cooperation points': for every combination of pieces, add a point, so two pieces are worth 3+3+1, ie. more than a rook+pawn  (pawns don't count as pieces)  . Similarly, three pieces are worth 3+3+3+1+1+1. This may be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's not a bad first approximation. I suspect my father thought of this himself  (in the context of a variation in the Pirc where three pieces outshine a Queen and two pawns)  , but I also came across the idea in Lasker's Chess Manual. }

{ In this book I have tried, where possible, to present novel ideas, even where the accepted wisdom is perfectly adequate. There is value in exploring new terrain, both from a scientific perspective of enriching the literature on an opening, but also from the practical, 'surprise value' perspective. 5... Nc6 is an extremely rare move, about fifty  (!)  times less common than the main move, 5... Bg7. I am not sure, nor do I frankly care very much, which of 5... Bg7 or 5... Nc6 is 'objectively' the better move. It seems to me though, that the new ideas which follow lead to rich, unexplored positions where a well-prepared Black player can pose serious problems for their opponent. Praxis and the test of time will determine whether these ideas have wings, or whether Black is better off adhering to the usual 5... Bg7. Before continuing I would like to mention that the following is joint analysis between myself and Canadian  (exiled by marriage to America)  IM Dave Ross.   5...Bg7  The reader may consult GM Ftacnik's book on the Sicilian for his treatment of this move. Black may be fine with accurate play, but the amount of awkward queen moves Black is lured into is not to my taste.  6.Nbd2 !  I think this rare move deserves more attention.   6.Na3  This transposes to a position we have already discussed, see 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. c3 d5 4. exd5 Qxd5 5.

{ This move order is recommended by GM Sveshnikov in his book 'The Complete c3 Sicilian' as particularly effective against the system I am recommending against 2. c3. White's idea is to delay d2-d4, so that after 3... d5 4. exd5 Qxd5 White has the option of 5. Na3, considered better for White by Sveshnikov. Black has two ways to transpose to the main line of this chapter: either play 3... d5 and allow Sveshnikov's 5. Na3, or play 3... Nc6 and allow a 'delayed' Rossolimo with 4. Bb5. According to my analysis, either of these is fine for Black, but 3... Nc6 is more in keeping with my recommended repertoire for reasons I will make clear in this chapter. }
