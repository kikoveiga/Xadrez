{ All chess players are constantly battling against two separate forces when it comes to choosing which opening to play.   On the one hand, we want the element of surprise and the ability to drag our opponents out of their comfort zone as early as possible and trick them into playing a difficult position they've never seen before, in which a single inaccuracy might be brutally punished with a checkmating attack.   On the other hand, we desire for our openings to be sound so that even a well-prepared adversary will not be able to refute our play after memorizing 30 moves of supercomputer theory.  The Nakhmanson Gambit sits happily on this spectrum of surprise value and objective correctness as the opening with the absolute most venomous potential and greatest difficulty of refuting out of any of the so-called 'dubious gambits'. There certainly are risks ahead that any brave Nakhmanson player must face but I am very happy with the unique solutions to them that I will propose in this course for the first time.  Many believe the Nakhmanson to be just another dubious one-trick pony gambit but this is just patently untrue. In fact, this unfounded belief may even be in our favor and if the opponents underestimate this mighty opening, they may easily become yet another victim of the world's most dangerous gambit. }
1... e5 2. Bc4
{ The Bishop's Opening is my personal choice for reaching our starting position but it can be achieved from so many different e4 e5 openings. If you play this way you avoid the Petroff altogether and can choose to play the Urusov Gambit along the way but it's easy to incorporate the Nakhmanson into a repertoire involving the Italian Game or the Scotch Gambit.   2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bc4  The Italian Game is the most common path to the Nakhmanson so if you already have this in your repertoire you can decide to toss in the Nakhmanson Gambit from time to time whenever you feel the moment is right.  3...Nf6  4.d4  exd4  5.O-O  Nxe4  6.Nc3 !!   2.d4  exd4  3.Nf3  Nc6  4.Bc4  The Scotch Gambit is another common way to reach the Nakhmanson.  4...Nf6  5.O-O  Nxe4  6.Nc3 !! }
2... Nf6
{ We might also reach our desired position if Black starts with  2...Nc6. } 3.
d4 exd4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ 4...Nxe4  5.Qxd4  This is the Urusov Gambit, of which your dear writer is very fond. We kick the black knight back to f6 and follow it up with Nc3, Bg5, O-O-O and Rhe1 against any defense from Black. It's a very interesting opening to explore if you wish to copy my repertoire choice directly. }
5. O-O Nxe4 6. Nc3
{ This amazingly beautiful move is the start of the world's most dangerous gambit... the Nakhmanson!  The most critical line is actually to accept our generous gift on c3 but Black must really know his stuff. It is not intuitive how he should continue whatsoever and so many players fall for all the same traps game after game if they aren't well-prepared for this rare gambit.  The 'safest' way for Black to continue is to decline the gambit in one of the three ways. Many sources, in fact, claim that declining the gambit is best and many 'refutations' have been offered. It is very true that we will need to be careful as White anytime our gambit is declined but there are also tricks that Black must watch out for in all of these lines.  With proper play I do not believe White is in any objective danger. Danger is a two-way street in the Nakhmanson and as is so often true in chess the more prepared player has the better chances. }
6... dxc3
{ Accepting the gambit allows us to demonstrate our beautiful idea.   6...Nxc3  This is perhaps the most common way of declining the gambit and will be explored in theNakhmanson Declined chapter.   6...Nd6  is perhaps the most cited 'refutation' of all the declined variations, while  6...d5  is not nearly as common as the other declined lines but still a reasonable attempt. They are both covered in the correspondingChapter. }
7. Bxf7+ { Sacrificing a second piece to drag the black king out! } 7... Kxf7
8. Qd5+
{ We will win one piece back when the time is right but already Black has a critical decision to make and what may look obvious for most opponents is actually quite dangerous. }
8... Ke8
{ This position has occurred in approximately 50% of all Nakhmanson games but it is in fact already very close to losing for Black! Herein lies the hidden venom of the Nakhmanson and we will explore this possibility in thedesignated section.   8...Kf6 !  If there exists a true refutation of the Nakhmanson it lies in the critical ...Kf6 line. This, however, is not for the faint of heart and impossible to play unless the opponent has really done some homework.  In that case, there are infinite possibilities for us to complicate this position and even computer engines often fail to evaluate what's going on here at first sight.My recommendation here is to pick from any of thetrickiest lines that I will propose and see if the opponent's king can really survive thisattack. At a minimum we are guaranteed a very exciting game ahead!   8...Kg6 ??  A very bad square for the king. We can now capture on e4 with check.  9.Qxe4+  Kf7   9...Kf6 ?  10.Bg5+  It's important to keep in mind the h4-d8 diagonal in all of these lines in which the black king is floating around because it's so easy for Black to lose a queen.  10.Ng5+  Kf6   10...Kg8  11.Qd5  11.Qf4+  Kg6  12.Qf7+  Kh6  13.g4 !  A nice move to keep in mind. White threatens mate and Black is unable to resist from here.  13...g6  14.Ne6+ !  g5  15.Qh5   8...Ke7  This is the same story as 8...Kg6.  9.Qxe4+  Kf7  10.Ng5+  is a transposition to a line we know is winning.   @@StartFEN@@r1bq1b1r/ppppk1pp/2n5/8/4Q3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 9@@EndFEN@@  9...Kd6  this would be an unhealthy walk after  10.b4  threatening  Bf4+  , and if  10...Nxb4  11.Qe5+  Kc6  12.Nd4+  Kb6  13.Qb5#  White wins. }

2... Nc6
{ One popular way for Black to avoid the Nakhmanson Gambit altogether is to play  2...Nc6  followed by 3...Bc5. }
3. Nf3 { We renew our interest in playing d4 next. } 3... Bc5
{ Black prevents our main idea and we have now entered the Giuoco Piano. This is a very solid choice for Black that is outside the scope of this course, but we should have something in mind if our opponents choose to go down this path. I will highlight a few main ideas to give the reader some options. }
4. c3
{ This is by far the main line. Our play has been based around our intention of playing d4 so why stop now?   4.b4  The Evans Gambit is an excellent choice for anyone going for an all gambit repertoire. The main idea is, of course, to sacrifice a pawn and attempt to gain an initiative with  c3  and  d4  coming next. This gambit has a reasonably solid reputation and has even been played by legends such as Paul Morphy, Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. }
4... Nf6
{ Black has run out of direct ways to prevent us from playing d4 so the next most logical move is ...Nf6 to threaten the pawn on e4. White's two main options are:   Play a slow and solid game with  5.d3  and hope for a slight advantage.  Live adventurously with  5.d4  and hope to trap the opponent in the opening.  I suspect I know which line will be closer to the hearts of Nakhmanson advocates out there, but we will briefly outline both so that we can be familiar with the options available to us. }
5. d4
{ White adamantly follows through with the desire to play d4, at the risk of complicating the position.   5.d3  With this move we have entered the Giuoco Pianissimo @@StartBracket@@Italian for 'Very Quiet Game'@@EndBracket@@ which is slightly more popular than  5.d4.  Both sides are content to play a slow middle game. White still might play for  d4  in the future but only after some high-class maneuvers have been played.  5...d6  6.O-O  O-O  Thousands of top-level games have been played from this position. White is slightly for choice but the game has hardly begun. }
5... exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+
{ White now has a variety of ways to block the check but the two most popular moves are  7.Bd2  and  7.Nc3. }
7. Bd2
{ This is the most popular move and the 'correct' way to play if White doesn't want to sacrifice a pawn.   7.Nc3  This line often referred to as Greco's Attack, is a slightly dubious way to continue but it can be very dangerous and many amateurs have fallen for traps along the way.  7...Nxe4  The critical move is obviously to take the pawn.  8.O-O  Bxc3  9.d5.   8...Nxc3?!  This is the most obvious move at first sight and while it is not necessarily a blunder, the way it's followed up often gets Black in trouble.  9.bxc3  Bxc3??  10.Ba3!!  This just wins for White.   10.Qb3!?  Bxa1??  Black can seriously increase his chance of survival by playing 10...d5, which is why 10.Ba3 is to be preferred, but it's instructive to see the trap played out.  11.Bxf7+  Kf8  12.Bg5!  It's clear that Black is in deep trouble.  12...Ne7  13.Ne5!  Greco's preference but 13.Re1 is also easily winning. The point of Ne5 is that Qf3 is coming next and White has a winning attack. We can completely ignore the bishop on a1 and focus entirely on giving mate.  10...d6  The most common defense but White's initiative is simply too strong.   10...Bxa1??  This greedy move loses without a fight.  11.Re1+  Ne7  12.Bxe7  Black is forced to give up the queen and the game is over.  11.Rc1  Saving the rook is a good first step.  11...Ba5  12.Qa4!  White threatens to play d5 next and the black knight is woefully committed to the defense of the bishop on a5. There's no way for our opponents to avoid losing material once they've come this far. }
7... Bxd2+
{ The most common approach by Black.   7...Nxe4  This doesn't actually win a pawn for Black due to a nice little tactic.  8.Bxb4  Nxb4  9.Bxf7+!  The clever point.  9...Kxf7  10.Qb3+  White wins back the piece and has a safer king, but Black has the better structure and the isolated d-pawn could become a target. It's a murky position that some readers may wish to explore on their own. }
8. Nbxd2 d5
{ With this move, Black guarantees himself the better structure but White is relying on his activity to generate an initiative. }
9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Qb3
{ Players that prefer active positions may be attracted to this line for White, but objectively this is very close to equal. There are many more moves that we should be aware of if we head down this line, but this is a good starting point for understanding the types of positions that may arise out of this opening. }

{ Black's basic defensive plan is to play ...c6 and ...d5 to be able for both: developing the light-squared bishop and creating some luft for the king on d7. This will require some time but Black is a piece up and argues that if he's left alone for a turn or two he will comfortably stabilize the position.  As true Nakhmanson players, we know it's our job to keep throwing jabs at our opponent until they finally break and make a mistake. }

14. Re3
{ This is the most active square for the rook from where it might be able to head over to the f-file after typical moves such as Bf6 and Ng5.   The reason we can't play  14.Rf4  right now is because Black can play  14...h6  and ...g5 to embarrass our rook. We should always be mindful of Black's pawn avalanche when deciding whether to play  Rf4  or not. }
14... Bf5
{ This looks like the correct defensive plan for Black but the good news for us is that this has never actually been played in a game @@StartBracket@@at least not at the time of writing@@EndBracket@@. The bishop will come to e4 to  @@StartBracket@@temporarily@@EndBracket@@ shut the e-file.  We will eventually be able to move our knight and capture the bishop or play f3 to remove it but perhaps this will buy Black just enough time to keep his position under control. }
15. Rae1 Be4 16. Bf6
{ This move again for us. We now threaten Ng5 which must be stopped @@StartBracket@@especially now that this move also attacks the bishop@@EndBracket@@. }
16... h6 17. Qxc3
{ Black is still up a piece but it never feels comfortable. White follows the same basic plan every time and gets a good position.  White's next move might be Nd2 and it's still not easy for Black, who still needs to be resourceful in defending this position. }

9. Re1
{ Bringing the rook into the attack is much stronger than recapturing with the queen. Our primary objective is to develop our forces and overwhelm the helpless black king with all of our pieces before Black has time to consolidate.   9.Qxe4+??  This is simply too slow and lets Black off the hook.  9...Be7  10.Re1  d5  White's attack is gone. }
9... Ne7
{ Shielding the e-file with the knight in this position leads to some incredibly fascinating positions. Most of the time White will actually remain down a piece for most of the middlegame but Black often finds himself so tied down that it's impossible to find good moves.  This line is objectively balanced but it's unlikely that our opponents will actually have spent much time studying this line as there are much simpler ways for Black to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson and one slip in this thorny tree of variations could be fatal! }

11. Nf7

11... h6

12. Nxh8
{ The most natural move for White but we're about to enter another labyrinth of messy computer lines. }
12... d6

13. Bg5+
{ Boom! There are more sedate options that could be explored by White here but once you see this, who could refuse diving deeper into the madness? }
13... hxg5 14. f4
{ Technically, Black has three minor pieces for a rook in this position but we are definitely putting our pieces to great effect. We now threaten to open the f-file and activate our rook  (not to mention the threat of fxg5#)  . }
14... g6
{ Black was once again facing an only move. Our opponent creates a square for his king on g7 and is very close to continuing development with ...Be6. We need to act quickly. }
15. Qg8 { Preventing the king from escaping and threatening mate on g6! } 15...
Qg7
{ The only move again but this one would be easy enough for a human opponent. }
16. fxg5+
{ Opening the f-file and the black king will go for a precarious stroll. }
16... Kxg5 { The only move again. } 17. Rxf8 Qxg8 18. Rxg8
{ Black manages to trade queens and avoids the immediate mating attack. Black has two minor pieces for the rook so if he manages to consolidate he could end up better. Maybe Black is better here but come on. Who can play like this? }
18... Kh6
{ Only move again. Black needs to meet  19.Rxg6+  with  19...Kh7  to maintain an edge here. }
19. Rf1
{ A normal enough move that surreptitiously threatens mate after Rxg6+. } 19...
Kh7 20. Re8 { 20.Rgf8  is similar. } 20... Rb8
{ Still, this is the only move for Black that gives the opponent a chance for the advantage. If the opponent memorizes 20-30 moves of supercomputer theory in a dozen different variations just to end up very slightly better what can you do? }
21. Rf7+ Kh6 22. Rxc7
{ This would never occur on a real chess board but Black should be able to untangle here.  Hopefully, a line like this demonstrates just how difficult it would be for Black to prove an advantage in this line. This would simply be an impossible task for a human unfamiliar with the 9.bxc3 line and any mistake along the way would be fatal. }

But perhaps in a real game without computer-assisted defense, our opponent's fate may be different. }

If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }

9. d5
{ This is an interesting option available to White if Black refrains from playing ...d5 himself. White takes more space and dislodges the black knight. }
9... Na5

11... g6
{ Planning to fianchetto the bishop by hand is generally flawed. White is happy in any position in which we trade off the dark-squared bishops because it will make it much more likely for our attack to be successful. }
12. Bh6 Bg7 13. Bxg7 Kxg7
{ Black's king is lonely without any defenders in the area. White has the opportunity for a strong attack with moves like Qd2 and Rb1-b4-h4 in the air. }

{ Gaining a tempo on the knight before swinging a rook into the attack. } 14...

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nxc3
{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }
7. bxc3
{ From an aesthetic point of view, it's hard to resist playing an intermezzo like  7.Re1+  when you notice such an insertion is possible. However, it's not obvious why White should force Black in this position to play  7...Be7  , which is a part of his plan anyway. It's possible to spend this time making progress on the queenside as we shall see. }
7... Be7
{ The line is not all that common but Black does have a very interesting option in ignoring any of the drama in the centre and prioritizing castling. What's amazing about this idea is that it's actually Stockfish's first choice but I think White has the potential to get an amazingly powerful attack that even the computer does not quite understand at first sight. }

12. Bd2 c6 { Protecting the black knight with the queen is a logical try. } 13.
c4 { Keeping the pawn on d5 is the right idea. } 13... cxd5 14. cxd5 b6
{ This is the main choice of more than one top engine but this, at least, lets us double the pawns with some compensation for the pawn we're still down. }
15. Bxa5 bxa5 16. Qa4
{ This is one interesting option. Our queen keeps a careful eye on Black's a-pawn but, more importantly, might swing over to the kingside. It also enables Nd4 next so we definitely have play here for our missing pawn. }

7... Be7
{ The line is not all that common but Black does have a very interesting option in ignoring any of the drama in the centre and prioritizing castling. What's amazing about this idea is that it's actually Stockfish's first choice but I think White has the potential to get an amazingly powerful attack that even the computer does not quite understand at first sight. }
8. cxd4 O-O
{ This leads to a very interesting position that scores very well in practice for White despite Stockfish's initial assessment of about -1.00.  In fact, I'm very happy to share with you a novel approach to this position that gives White a tremendous attack.  Computers tend to be very happy being a pawn up and with optimal defense, perhaps there is nothing for Black to fear. But if Black's idea with 6...Nxc3 was to be practical and just remain a pawn up comfortably, he will be in for a big surprise! }
9. d5
{ This is an interesting option available to White if Black refrains from playing ...d5 himself. White takes more space and dislodges the black knight. }

{ Our rook is content on the half-open b-file and might even enter the attack later on with the maneuver Rb1-b4-f4. }
11... b6 12. h4
{ This new move is extremely dangerous. At first, even Stockfish really doubts this but if you force it to play it out, it often changes its mind and figures out just how powerful this attack really can be!  White intends on playing aggressive moves such as Ng5, Qf3, Re1, and Rb1-b4 to get all of the pieces into the attack. Black should tread incredibly cautiously here as we will be attacking with all of our pieces and there will again be many situations where Black needs to play perfectly to stay in the game. }
12... d6 13. Ng5
{ Here we come! White threatens h7 and forces Black to defend accurately. }
13... Bxg5 14. hxg5
{ Giving up the dark-squared bishop is never right and this is no exception. We would love to be able to sneak in Qh5 here but even if Black somehow stops this, the h-file is accessible to our rook as well via Rb1-b4-h5. Black should crack soon enough without any defenders around the king. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nxc3
{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nxc3
{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }
7. bxc3
{ From an aesthetic point of view, it's hard to resist playing an intermezzo like  7.Re1+  when you notice such an insertion is possible. However, it's not obvious why White should force Black in this position to play  7...Be7  , which is a part of his plan anyway. It's possible to spend this time making progress on the queenside as we shall see. }
7... Be7
{ The line is not all that common but Black does have a very interesting option in ignoring any of the drama in the centre and prioritizing castling. What's amazing about this idea is that it's actually Stockfish's first choice but I think White has the potential to get an amazingly powerful attack that even the computer does not quite understand at first sight. }
8. cxd4 O-O
{ This leads to a very interesting position that scores very well in practice for White despite Stockfish's initial assessment of about -1.00.  In fact, I'm very happy to share with you a novel approach to this position that gives White a tremendous attack.  Computers tend to be very happy being a pawn up and with optimal defense, perhaps there is nothing for Black to fear. But if Black's idea with 6...Nxc3 was to be practical and just remain a pawn up comfortably, he will be in for a big surprise! }
9. d5
{ This is an interesting option available to White if Black refrains from playing ...d5 himself. White takes more space and dislodges the black knight. }
9... Na5
{ Black's most common move. Black is still up a pawn for now but after we move our bishop to safety, Black will often need to play moves like ...b6 and ...Nb7 to get the knight back into the game. }
10. Bd3 Bf6 11. Rb1
{ Our rook is content on the half-open b-file and might even enter the attack later on with the maneuver Rb1-b4-f4. }
11... b6 12. h4
{ This new move is extremely dangerous. At first, even Stockfish really doubts this but if you force it to play it out, it often changes its mind and figures out just how powerful this attack really can be!  White intends on playing aggressive moves such as Ng5, Qf3, Re1, and Rb1-b4 to get all of the pieces into the attack. Black should tread incredibly cautiously here as we will be attacking with all of our pieces and there will again be many situations where Black needs to play perfectly to stay in the game. }
12... d6 13. Ng5
{ Here we come! White threatens h7 and forces Black to defend accurately. }
13... g6 14. Re1
{ Here the computer is happy with the idea of f2-f4-f5 but I think White can even play natural moves such as Re1, Qf3, and Rb4-f4, with good practical chances. }
14... Bd7
{ Black opts to develop his last piece before maneuvering the knight via a5-b7-c5. White can follow up with ideas such as Qf3 and Rb1-b4 to ask some questions on the kingside. }
15. Qf3
{ If we're given time for Rb1-b4-f4 we will be winning so Black needs to mount a defense now. }
15... Nb7 { Beginning the natural maneuver to the c5 square. } 16. Rb4
{ Threatening Rf4 with tremendous kingside pressure. } 16... Nc5 17. Rf4
{ Both sides have completed their maneuvers and now Black is virtually forced to acquiesce to taking on g5 and accepting our sacrifice. }
17... Bxg5 18. hxg5 Qxg5
{ Black is now two pawns up but we've seen how dangerous life can be for the black king without the dark-squared bishop on the board. Black has also stepped into a discovered attack. }
19. Rc4
{ Revealing an attack on the enemy queen. Black can now move the queen to either h5 or d8 but both are unpleasant. }
19... Qd8
{ A logical retreat but Black still needs to take care of the dark squares. }
20. Bb2
{ Our real threat in this position is the nearly invisible Bxg6!! followed by Qc3 which would be winning on the spot. Bf6 is also a serious threat. }
20... Nxd3
{ This exchange doesn't change the situation Black is facing on the dark squares. }
21. cxd3 f6 { Defending against our threat of Bf6. } 22. Rf4
{ A proper defense is still possible for computers but I suspect a lot of humans would not be able to handle all of our threats in this position. }
22... Kg7
{ An easy mistake to make. White now has a move that's easy to overlook. } 23.
Rfe4 { Switching back to the e-file wins on the spot. } 23... Rf7 24. Re7
{ Although it may not be obvious at first, our dark-squared attack will ultimately be triumphant. }
24... Bf5 { A logical try to safeguard the f6 square. } 25. Rxf7+ Kxf7 26. g4
Bd7 27. g5 f5 28. Qe3
{ We are completely winning and it's not easy to suggest a good move for Black. We have ideas of either Qd4 or even Bf6 next and Black is busted. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nxc3
{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }

It's possible to spend this time making progress on the queenside as we shall see. }
7... Be7
{ The line is not all that common but Black does have a very interesting option in ignoring any of the drama in the centre and prioritizing castling. What's amazing about this idea is that it's actually Stockfish's first choice but I think White has the potential to get an amazingly powerful attack that even the computer does not quite understand at first sight. }

{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }
7. bxc3
{ From an aesthetic point of view, it's hard to resist playing an intermezzo like  7.Re1+  when you notice such an insertion is possible. However, it's not obvious why White should force Black in this position to play  7...Be7  , which is a part of his plan anyway. It's possible to spend this time making progress on the queenside as we shall see. }
7... Be7
{ The line is not all that common but Black does have a very interesting option in ignoring any of the drama in the centre and prioritizing castling. What's amazing about this idea is that it's actually Stockfish's first choice but I think White has the potential to get an amazingly powerful attack that even the computer does not quite understand at first sight. }
8. cxd4 d5
{ Starting with 7...Be7 before playing 8...d5 is a very clever approach by Black and one of the very best tries against the Nakhmanson. }
9. Bb5
{ White can consider placing the bishop somewhere else but we're still following the dark-squared strategy revolving around taking control of the e5 square. }
9... O-O 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. Re1
{ Here is a moment where we need to be incredibly cautious. We should remain as flexible as possible in this situation. The problem with the natural  11.Ne5  is that it allows  11...Bd6!  with the idea of  12.Nxc6  Qh4!  and Black has a dangerous attack. }
11... Bg4
{ This natural move is almost universally the choice of our opponents. We are worse but Black still needs to be precise to demonstrate his advantage. }
12. h3
{ It's usually correct in these positions to immediately question a bishop that lands on g4. }
12... Bh5 { This retreat is perhaps the most obvious choice for Black. } 13.
Qd3
{ Stepping out of the pin and preparing a future Ba3 @@StartBracket@@most likely after Ne5 is played first@@EndBracket@@. }
13... Bg6
{ The most common human move but we're happy to move the queen to c3. } 14. Qc3
{ The c6 pawn is not so easily defended but we also have ideas of Ne5, Rxe7, and simply just Ba3. We're only a little worse in this position and still have things to look forward to. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope.

9. Nd4
{ 9.Ne5  also works but the text move sets a trap in that now Bd7 is unplayable. }
9... Bd7
{ This looks like an obvious defensive move but in fact it blunders the game away. White's sneaky attacking plan involves pressuring the e7 square with the moves Re1, Ba3, and removing the knight on c6. Here we see just how it can be done. }
10. Nxc6
{ There might be other ways for White to punish Black here but Nxc6 is just so crystal clear. }
10... bxc6 11. Re1+ { This move is probably on Black's radar. } 11... Be7 12.
Ba3
{ This move, however, often escapes Black. This Re1/Ba3 trick is essential to the entire 6...Nxc3 line and worth bearing in mind in all of these lines. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nxc3
{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }

7... d5 { By far the most common response by Black. } 8. Bb5
{ This is the best square for the bishop in the line @@StartBracket@@as opposed to, say, d3@@EndBracket@@. Part of our plan is to remove the knight on c6 and plant our own knight on e5, compensating for being down a pawn. }
8... Bd6
{ This is not a very common way to develop the bishop but putting a piece on the most active square is usually not such a bad idea. }
9. Re1+
{ I believe this to be objectively the best move for White but it does allow a forced draw if Black wants it. If you are worried about that, you can roll the dice with a move such  9.Nxd4  , which is inferior but could be played against a significantly lower-rated opponent or in a must-win situation. }

{ This is the main line and the most critical move.  Black, for his part, is happily a pawn up and desires only to castle and enter a middlegame without complications. It's our job to pose as many problems here as possible before this dream comes true. }
9. Bxc6+
{ This is the move I am proposing. White actually has a handful of options on move 9 such as cxd4, Nxd4, Ne5, Re1, etc. but Bxc6 is the most intriguing to me as a practical attempt to get a playable middlegame that will keep Black on his toes. }

10... Bd7 { Black really should avoid losing the c-pawn. } 11. Qf3

12. cxd4

{ This is the most direct way of making sure our prized stallion is removed from its post. }
13. Nxd7
{ Seeing that we're down a pawn, it might be tempting to play Nd3 and preserve material on the board at any cost. But that would, of course, prevent our main plan of playing Ba3 and the extra material isn't really being felt yet. }
13... Qxd7 14. Ba3
{ Our main point. Exchange the dark-squared bishops and create pressure on the queenside to offset the material imbalance. }
14... Bd6 { This is a common reaction in this type of position. } 15. Bxd6
{ The simplest solution. This trade is strategically desirable and there's no need to delay it. Regardless of how Black recaptures, White can choose from a variety of plans including occupying either of the open files @@StartBracket@@b- or e- files@@EndBracket@@, playing Rc1 and c4, or keeping the queen on the queenside with the move Qc3.  The main problem for Black is that White can afford to trade both pairs of rooks and still be fine. Even this pawn up queen endgame will be very difficult for Black to convert and it will still be a while before Black's extra pawn is actually felt. }

{ This is the best square for the bishop in the line @@StartBracket@@as opposed to, say, d3@@EndBracket@@. Part of our plan is to remove the knight on c6 and plant our own knight on e5, compensating for being down a pawn. }
8... Be7
{ This is the main line and the most critical move.  Black, for his part, is happily a pawn up and desires only to castle and enter a middlegame without complications. It's our job to pose as many problems here as possible before this dream comes true. }
9. Bxc6+
{ This is the move I am proposing. White actually has a handful of options on move 9 such as cxd4, Nxd4, Ne5, Re1, etc. but Bxc6 is the most intriguing to me as a practical attempt to get a playable middlegame that will keep Black on his toes. }
9... bxc6
{ We can take a moment to admire Black's twin set of doubled pawns but there's no time to let our foot off the gas. Black needs to be as direct as possible. }
10. Ne5
{ Any recapture of a pawn allows Black to castle, so White instead creates yet another threat by attacking c6. }
10... Bd7 { Black really should avoid losing the c-pawn. } 11. Qf3
{ It doesn't get more direct than threatening mate in one but the real point of White's play is to try to take control of the dark squares by playing cxd4 and Ba3. We will then be able to play against the weaknesses on the queenside. Perhaps it's objectively not quite enough but as we go along it's also not so easy to find a path to victory for Black. }
11... O-O
{ Black's main objective of castling and remaining up a pawn has been achieved but White carries on. }
12. cxd4
{ White regains one pawn and is now ready to play Ba3. This temporary rest gives Black time to come up with a useful idea of his own, which might involve removing the knight from e5 with either ... Bd6 or ... f6. }
12... f6
{ This is the most direct way of making sure our prized stallion is removed from its post. }
13. Nxd7
{ Seeing that we're down a pawn, it might be tempting to play Nd3 and preserve material on the board at any cost. But that would, of course, prevent our main plan of playing Ba3 and the extra material isn't really being felt yet. }
13... Qxd7 14. Ba3
{ Our main point. Exchange the dark-squared bishops and create pressure on the queenside to offset the material imbalance. }
14... Rfe8
{ This move is not very popular but bringing a rook to an open file is logical enough. }
15. Bxe7 { Achieving our strategic aim of trading the dark-squared bishops. }
15... Qxe7 16. c4
{ This is an idea we haven't seen yet but is a decent way to try and equalize. Other moves like  16.Rab1  and  16.Qc3  were also possible but this is simple enough. }
16... Rad8
{ Certainly not the only move for Black but there's nothing else that is particularly theoretically challenging. }
17. cxd5 cxd5 18. Qc3
{ Again we see the queen take her place on c3 where she exerts pressure on the queenside. Next, we will bring a rook to the c-file with dynamic equality. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nxc3
{ 6...Nxc3  is one of the most practical approaches to the Nakhmanson Gambit and not at all a bad choice. It is also the most popular way of declining the Nakhmanson by a wide margin and is therefore worth studying on our part. Black simply states that he is not interested in any of the shenanigans involved with accepting our gambit and perhaps with good reason!  With the best play, Black will usually remain a pawn up in an endgame but there are a few traps along the way. White actually has a wide array of plans in this position that the opponent would need to be ready for. I have chosen to show what I think is the most practical way for White, by using a dark-squared approach to achieve an active position even into the late middlegame. }
7. bxc3
{ From an aesthetic point of view, it's hard to resist playing an intermezzo like  7.Re1+  when you notice such an insertion is possible. However, it's not obvious why White should force Black in this position to play  7...Be7  , which is a part of his plan anyway. It's possible to spend this time making progress on the queenside as we shall see. }
7... d5 { By far the most common response by Black. } 8. Bb5
{ This is the best square for the bishop in the line @@StartBracket@@as opposed to, say, d3@@EndBracket@@. Part of our plan is to remove the knight on c6 and plant our own knight on e5, compensating for being down a pawn. }
8... Be7
{ This is the main line and the most critical move.  Black, for his part, is happily a pawn up and desires only to castle and enter a middlegame without complications. It's our job to pose as many problems here as possible before this dream comes true. }
9. Bxc6+
{ This is the move I am proposing. White actually has a handful of options on move 9 such as cxd4, Nxd4, Ne5, Re1, etc. but Bxc6 is the most intriguing to me as a practical attempt to get a playable middlegame that will keep Black on his toes. }

10. Ne5
{ Any recapture of a pawn allows Black to castle, so White instead creates yet another threat by attacking c6. }
10... Bd7 { Black really should avoid losing the c-pawn. } 11. Qf3

We will then be able to play against the weaknesses on the queenside. Perhaps it's objectively not quite enough but as we go along it's also not so easy to find a path to victory for Black. }
11... O-O

12. cxd4
{ White regains one pawn and is now ready to play Ba3. This temporary rest gives Black time to come up with a useful idea of his own, which might involve removing the knight from e5 with either ... Bd6 or ... f6. }
12... Bd6 13. Re1
{ White could potentially start with  13.Ba3  here but it's more prudent to wait and see how Black intends on dealing with our knight on  e5. }
13... f6 14. Nxd7 Qxd7 15. Ba3
{ This plan again! White will at some point trade the dark-squared bishops and, once more, we reach a position in which Black is a pawn up but it's still not so clear if he will be able to win the game with the best play by both sides.  This is possibly the best position that Black can achieve with the best play in this line, so this is the worst we have to fear here. We should be able to complicate things by keeping the queen on the queenside with moves like Qc3 and by occupying the open files with the rooks. We usually do not need to fear rook trades in these positions because it would require a lot for Black to win a pure queen endgame here, even if a pawn up. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with the best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... d5
{ This move is not all that common but definitely not a horrible way to decline the Nakhmanson. Black is not trying for all that much but just hoping for a playable position. The most important thing in this line is that White plays the right move in this position. }
7. Bxd5
{ This is the one move White must know. Everything else is dangerous for White but if we remember this we should be fine.  7.Nxd5??  Be6  is obviously to be avoided. }
7... Nxc3
{ 7...Nxc3  is actually five times more popular than  7...dxc3  but not necessarily better. White is at the very least comfortable here but it's not always easy for us to play for a win if Black defends properly. We now see a forced series of trades. }
8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. bxc3 dxc3
{ We are technically down two pawns but we can win one back right away with a nice move. }
10. Qe1+
{ Other checks such as  10.Re1+  or  10.Qe2+  are possible, but the idea of just winning the pawn back on  c3  is simple enough. }
10... Be7
{ This is not the most accurate way for Black to block the check although it may be the most tempting if Black hasn't studied these positions. White can now get a slight initiative and Black needs to be careful for the next few moves. }
11. Ba3
{ Ba3 is often a good move in structures where ...d6 is not possible and here is no different. This also clears the d1 square for a rook so we have an opportunity to make a few more forcing moves before Black can castle. }
11... Be6 12. Rd1 { Forcing Black to defend carefully. } 12... Bd6
{ Black has spent two moves with the dark-squared bishop but how do we continue the initiative? }
13. Nd4 Qe7
{ This clever defense is possibly the best for Black but we will have a good position if we don't fall for Black's trap of  14.Nxc6?  Bxh2+!  15.Kxh2  Qxa3. }
14. Qxc3 O-O 15. Nxc6 Qd7 16. Rd2
{ 16.Rd4  is the same. White doubles on d-file. } 16... Bxa2 17. Rfd1 Be6 18.
Bxd6 cxd6 19. Rxd6 { We can be happy with this approximately equal position. }

11... Qd5
{ A good find from Black. The idea is to play ... Qc4 or ...Qc5 to try and trade queens, to relieve the pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal. Black can actually be very annoying in trying to shadow our queen. For example: }

In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope.

There's still a whole game ahead of us but Black is a little better due to the pawn structure.

{ 6...Nd6  is perhaps the most cited antidote to the entire Nakhmanson Gambit and not without good reason! This odd-looking knight retreat reminds us that we are still a pawn down and now have two pieces hanging. In this portion of this chapter, I will present what I believe is White's best attempt against this problematic line.  We have to accept that we're a pawn down and to play an opposite-colored bishop endgame in which White has insufficient compensation for the pawn but very realistic drawing chances. I know this won't satisfy every reader so I will include a few different variations that White can try. They are objectively dubious but that will certainly contain a lot of venom against an unsuspecting opponent which might appeal those willing to roll the dice. But first, let's understand the main position. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with the best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }

{ For those not content with being down a pawn in the main line of the6...Nd6 variation, I will propose a few trick shots that we can use when the moment is right. Objectively, the Bg5 variation might not be sound but I do want to point out just how many traps and pitfalls Black must avoid. I will leave it to the reader's judgment to determine if you want to play this variation in a real game.  Understandably, many readers will turn their nose up at any line that is not 100% sound according to whatever the most recent strongest computer engine assesses as best, but at the end of the day in the course of a real game, we must make a series of very tough decisions at the chessboard. Practically speaking, if all of our decisions are relatively easy and all of the opponent's decisions require razor-sharp precision at every turn, where one small inaccuracy could be fatal, it is more likely for Black to slip. }
7... f6
{ This looks like a very tempting continuation for Black as now White has two pieces hanging but we had a trap in mind. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with the best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }

I will leave it to the reader's judgment to determine if you want to play this variation in a real game.  Understandably, many readers will turn their nose up at any line that is not 100% sound according to whatever the most recent strongest computer engine assesses as best, but at the end of the day in the course of a real game, we must make a series of very tough decisions at the chessboard. Practically speaking, if all of our decisions are relatively easy and all of the opponent's decisions require razor-sharp precision at every turn, where one small inaccuracy could be fatal, it is more likely for Black to slip. }

{ Once again, we surprise our opponents with the wonderful move Nc3! We will now take a look at the many different ways that Black can decline the Nakhmanson Gambit. If our gambit is declined it means one of two things:  Our opponent has done some preparation and he believes he has found a way to get an advantage against the Nakhmanson. He is too afraid to accept our gambit on the basis that clearly we have some tricks up our sleeve.  Perhaps our opponents would be very wise to not accept the gambit in the first place. As we shall see in many cases, with the best play Black actually will achieve an advantage out of the opening. This is a tough pill to swallow for die-hard Nakhmanson fans and may in fact put many people off from playing this fantastic opening altogether. But we can take solace in the fact that objectively none of the declined lines are clearly lost for us either.  In many cases, we will have to play a position down a pawn but always with at least some unclear compensation. This is to say that if two supercomputers played a game, the result in any of the declined lines would most likely be a draw. White is often worse but there are still many traps that await our opponents if they are not very well prepared.   Again, this is not necessarily an opening you would want to play against someone who does his homework but if you do find yourself in trouble, it is important to not lose hope. The positions are still complicated enough that we may be able to squeeze out wins, especially if we are more familiar with the resulting positions than our opponents. }
6... Nd6
{ 6...Nd6  is perhaps the most cited antidote to the entire Nakhmanson Gambit and not without good reason! This odd-looking knight retreat reminds us that we are still a pawn down and now have two pieces hanging. In this portion of this chapter, I will present what I believe is White's best attempt against this problematic line.  We have to accept that we're a pawn down and to play an opposite-colored bishop endgame in which White has insufficient compensation for the pawn but very realistic drawing chances. I know this won't satisfy every reader so I will include a few different variations that White can try. They are objectively dubious but that will certainly contain a lot of venom against an unsuspecting opponent which might appeal those willing to roll the dice. But first, let's understand the main position. }

Again, I offer the  Bg5  line not as the antidote to the 6...Nd6 problem but merely as a tricky attempt to bamboozle the opponent. Even an opponent that has studied 6...Nd6 might not be ready for 7.Bg5 as it's so far outside the computer's recommended choices. I wish you the best of luck if you chose this line but you have been warned! }

{ It's definitely not easy to suggest good moves for Black in this position. ...Bd7 is incredibly natural but this situation might require unnatural solutions in order for Black to survive.

{ The normal approach by Black preparing ...Bf5 @@StartBracket@@possibly queening on b1 first to distract our rook@@EndBracket@@. Now is the time for action before Black can activate his pieces. }
13. Bxe7
{ 13.Qxc6+  This is the drawing line but there's no reason to not play for a win with White here.  13...bxc6  14.Rxe7+  Qxe7  15.Rxe7+.  Black is forced into a windmill and both players can agree to a draw. }
13... Nxe7 14. Qh5+
{ Not a bad move. With best play by both sides, it will end up transposing to the course recommendation. White is better here as well. There's no good way to block the check so the black king needs to make an uncomfortable escape.   14.Qb5+  This is the line presented in the course.  14...c6  15.Qxb2  Rf6  16.Qb3  d5  17.Rxe7+  Qxe7  18.Rxe7+  Kxe7  19.Qa3+.  Despite the material disadvantage, White is doing very well here, with the possibility of infiltrating with the queen and starting a kingside attack with  Ne5  ,  g4  , h4-h5-h6, etc. }
14... Kd7 15. Nd4
{ The one blemish on an otherwise masterfully played game. White takes away all the escaping squares from the black king and threatens Qg4+ but unfortunately, Black has a good way to create luft for the king.   15.Rxe7+ !  Surprisingly, White could nowtranspose to the course recommendation.  15...Qxe7  16.Qb5+  c6  17.Rxe7+  Kxe7  18.Qxb2  Rf6  19.Qb3  d5  20.Qa3+. }
15... c5
{ This is the concrete solution to Black's problems but unfortunately for him, he still needs to find a few more very exact moves to survive this position and he immediately goes wrong. }
16. Qg4+ Kc7
{ Missing an unbelievable chance to change fortunes and win brilliantly.   16...Nf5 !!  The piece sacrifice is only temporary.  17.Nxf5  Kc6 !  Black avoids the check on g7 and will win the piece back with a harmonious piece up position. }
17. Rxe7+ Qxe7
{ 17...Kb8  is better. After  18.Nc6+!  bxc6  19.Qxg7  Black needs to be alert to  Qxb2+  as well as Rb1-Rxb2 ideas and life is still not so easy for the opponent. }
18. Rxe7+ Kd8 19. Qg5 { Setting a nasty trap. } 19... h6 20. Rxb7+
{ With the point  20...hxg5  21.Nc6+  Ke8  22.Re7#.  White's last two pieces are enough to deliver mate! }

[Result "*"]

{ This bullet game between GMs Brandon Jacobson and Magnus Carlsen demonstrates that even World Champions are not immune to the Nakhmanson Gambit's venom.  We will be fair in acknowledging that this was a one minute game, but if even the strongest player in the world can fall for a trap right away in the opening, it shows that the Nakhmanson is very dangerous at any level. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Nc3 Nxc3
{ Carlsen very sensibly declines the gambit. This is certainly not a bad choice by Black but it does require a proper follow-up. }
7. bxc3 d5 8. Bb5
{ So far everything has been going according to plan but now greed gets the best of the World Champion. }
8... dxc3
{ This doesn't lose per se but it does force Black to play accurately over the next few moves to stay in the game. White hopes to trap Black here by finding a way to trade off Black's light-squared bishop and follow up with Re1+ and Ba3, which is exactly what happened in the game.   A much safer approach by Black would be  8...Be7  followed by castling. }
9. Re1+ { 9.Nd4  isrecommended in the course. } 9... Be7 10. Ne5
{ Demanding a precise response by Black. } 10... Bd7
{ Allowing White to trade off the light-squared bishop loses a piece by force. The game is already over.   10...Qd6 !  The only defense. Black covers c6 and maintains the option of blocking the e-file in the future with ...Be6.  11.Nxc6   11.Bf4  and  11.Ba3  are dangerous alternatives that Black would need to be prepared for as well.  11...bxc6  12.Ba3 !  This move anyway!  12...Qxa3  13.Bxc6+  Bd7  14.Bxa8  c6  The white bishop is not trapped.  15.Qe2 !  Adding an attacker on the e-file to prevent the immediate ...O-O.  15...Qd6  The queen must return to d6 to protect the c-pawn before blocking the e-file with ...Be6.  16.Rab1  Be6  17.Qe5 !  Removing the defender of c6 gives White a slight initiative heading into the endgame but Black has survived the worst of it. }
11. Bxc6
{ White now trades off the minor pieces on the queenside and exploits the pin on the e-file. }
11... bxc6 12. Nxd7 Qxd7 13. Ba3
{ The Re1+/Ba3 plan works to perfection and Black cannot avoid losing material. }
13... O-O 14. Rxe7 { Now it's just a matter of technique. } 14... Qf5 15. Rxc7
Rfc8 16. Rxc8+ Rxc8 17. Rb1 h6 18. Rb3 d4
{ An interesting try to create counterplay but White has no back-rank issues if the queen takes on d4 here. }
19. Qxd4 Qxc2 20. Rxc3 Qxa2 21. h3 a5 22. Rg3
{ Not only is White up a piece but he still has the initiative! } 22... f6 23.
Qxf6 Qf7 24. Qc3 a4 25. Bb2 Rc7 26. Qa5 g5
{ Black resigned after playing this move. Keep in mind this trap with Re1+ and Ba3 because it can win games at any level. }
