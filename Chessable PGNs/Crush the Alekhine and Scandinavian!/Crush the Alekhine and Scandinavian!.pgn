{ Welcome to my sixth Chessable course!    After dealing a heavy blow to the Pirc, Modern, and Philidor defenses, it's now time to take on another pair of second-rate defenses. My objective in this course was to create a practical and very ambitious repertoire designed to get an advantage against the Scandinavian and Alekhine defenses.    To achieve this, I had to go for the mainlines, namely the 4. Nf3 variation vs the Alekhine and the 3. Nc3 4. d4 variation vs the Scandinavian. However, that does not mean you need to learn 100s of variations. I found many new ideas that were  @@StartBracket@@a@@EndBracket@@ often stronger than the most played variations and    @@StartBracket@@b@@EndBracket@@ heavily cut down on the number of lines you need to learn.   I set myself the goal of making it around 150 trainable lines and was able to achieve it while covering all of Black's main variations.    I spent countless hours refining this system with the latest versions of the revolutionary neural network engines, Leela and Stockfish 12, running on very powerful cloud computers. This resulted in significant improvements over current theory and dozens of novelties, including a completely new system against the 3...Qd8 Scandinavian. I also made extensive use of correspondence games and the latest version of the MegaDatabase.    I have tried to remain as objective as possible in this repertoire, and I am very pleased to report that White can count on an advantage in every single line! The ball is now in Black's court to challenge the recommendations in this course.    Chapters 2-5 are dedicated to the Alekhine defense, while chapters 6-10 tackle the Scandinavian defense. }

White can continue with f2-f4 and Bd3. Kh1, Rg1, and Rb1 are also on the agenda. Almost all of Black's pieces are on the back rank so it's not surprising the engines are already evaluating White's advantage as larger than +1.  This position is analyzed in-depth in the next two alternative lines. Because Chessable has a wide audience, I opted to make the following lines alternatives as opposed to trainables since the average club player does not need to know these details. Ambitious and/or higher-rated players may choose to train these lines if they see fit. }

White can continue to improve his position with natural moves like c2-c3, Re1, and then expand on the kingside with h4-h5. White has a clear advantage.

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5
{ This is Black's most common choice in the Scandinavian complex. I am going to recommend a very strong and easy to learn setup which puts the Scandinavian under serious pressure. }
4. d4 Nf6 5. Bd2
{ White start by developing the dark-squared bishop and will play Bc4 next, leaving the knight on g1 for the time being. This allows us to retain a great degree of flexibility and adapt to Black's setup, thus posing the second player as many problems as possible. }
5... Bg4
{ This is Black's second most popular move and, in my opinion, the critical test of White's move order. Black wants to provoke the slightly weakening move f2-f3. }
6. f3
{ Blocking the bishop. This move also supports the g2-g4 pawn advance in certain variations. Black has two main moves: the rather provocative 6... Bf5 and 6... Bd7. }
6... Bd7 7. Bc4
{ 7.f4  is also interesting. However, 7. Bc4 is objectively stronger and, armed with a series of strong novelties that I found with Leela and Stockfish, you can count on a clear advantage. }
7... Qb6
{ This is a critical position in the 3...Qa5 Scandinavian. 7...Qb6 has been essayed by several 2600+ GMs such as Laznicka and Van Wely.   Nevertheless, I have found several improvements over the current theory that give White a clear advantage.   There’s some exciting stuff coming up, so let's get into it! }
8. Nge2 e6 9. Be3
{ This is White's best move and the critical test of Black's setup. Black now has two main moves: 9...Be7 and 9...Nc6. }

11... Ned5 12. O-O Be7 13. Qd3
{ Developing the queen and connecting the rooks. White has completed development. }
13... O-O 14. Ne4
{ White will play Ba2 and follow up c2-c4 with full control over the center. Black is very cramped and he doesn't have an active plan, making his position very hard to play in a practical game. White is clearly better.   Conclusion: 5...Bg4 6...Bd7 with 7...Qb6 is a critical continuation. Aided by Leela and Stockfish, I've found several key improvements that place Black under serious pressure. As it stands, Black cannot come anywhere close to equalizing in the 3...Qa5 Scandinavian. }

{ The following is a model game in the 3...Qa5 variation of the Scandinavian between GM Lev Psakhis and GM Alexander Shabalov from the 1997 Canadian Open in Winnipeg. }

{ This was all covered in the theoretical section of the course, specifically in the5...c6 6...Qc7 variation in chapter 9. }
10... b5 11. Bd3
{ The sacrifice   11.Nxb5 !  was very strong. After  11...cxb5  12.Bxb5+  Kd8  Worse is   12...Nbd7  13.g5  undermining the main defender of the knight on d7 and if  13...Bh5  simply  14.f3+−  and White will recoup his piece with a decisive advantage.  13.h4  Be4  14.Rh3  White is now threatening g4-g5 to remove the only defender of the bishop on e4.  14...Bb7  15.Rc3  Qe7  16.Rc5+−  with the idea Ba5. Black's king is simply too exposed. }
11... Bb4 12. f4
{ 12.h4 !  was more accurate.  12...Bxd3  13.Nxd3  Bxc3  14.Bxc3±  White can continue expanding on the kingside with h4-h5 and g4-g5. }
12... Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Nbd7 14. Ne2 a5
{ 14...Bxd2+ !  was also possible. After  15.Qxd2  Rd8  16.O-O-O  O-O  Black can break with c7-c5 and start an attack against White's king. }
15. O-O-O O-O 16. Kb1
{ The kings are castled on opposite wings and both sides have already started an attack by advancing their pawns. }
16... Rfd8
{ Eliminating the dark-squared bishop with   16...Bxd2 !  was preferable. White's bishop on c1 turned out to be a very important defensive piece. }
17. Bc1 c5
{ Black tries to open files against White's king but just ends up giving up a pawn. }
18. Qxb5
{ White courageously picks it up, correctly calculating that Black does not have much to show for it. }
18... Nxe5 19. dxe5 Nxg4 20. c3
{ A good move but there was an even better option.  Starting with   20.Rxd8+ !  was even stronger. After  20...Rxd8  21.Rg1  Nxh2  22.c3  Ba3  23.Ka1+−  and Black's dark-squared bishop will soon drop. }
20... Ba3
{ Black was counting on this move but simply runs out of attacking pieces. }
21. Rxd8+ Rxd8 22. Rd1
{ A strong move, which I suspect Black missed. White takes advantage of Black's weak back rank to activate his rook. }
22... Rb8 23. Qd7 { White forces the queens off. } 23... Qxd7 24. Rxd7
{ White's rook is very active on d7. Black's queenside pawns are very weak and his bishop is in danger. }
24... c4
{ Black creates an escape route for his bishop but gives up the control over the d4 square. }
25. Nd4
{ Immediately exploiting the drawback of Black's last move. White is planning to go after the a5 pawn with Nc6. }
25... h5 26. Nc6 Rb5 27. Kc2
{ Getting the king out of the pin. Black's bishop is now under attack. } 27...
Bc5 28. a4
{ White drives Black's rook back, which was the only defender of the a5 pawn. }
28... Rb6 29. Nxa5 Nxh2 30. Nxc4
{ White is only a pawn up but has three connected passed pawns on the queenside. Black doesn't stand a chance in this endgame. }
30... Rc6 31. Nd6 { The f7 pawn is about to drop. } 31... h4
{ 31...Bxd6  would only give White a fourth passed pawn after  32.exd6+− } 32.

{ In this chapter, you will find several tactical combinations. Some of these tactical patterns have occurred in multiple games in this variation, i.e. they are typical motifs.    Note that a few of them are not easy so don't worry if you don't find the correct solution on your first attempt. I recommend trying to calculate the forcing variations until the end @@StartBracket@@and not just trying to guess the first move@@EndBracket@@.    Finally, I recommend setting the quiz timer to infinity @@StartBracket@@or at least a couple of minutes@@EndBracket@@. It's 60 seconds by default because this is an opening course and Chessable does not, as of the time I'm writing this, allow for different quiz timers in different chapters.
