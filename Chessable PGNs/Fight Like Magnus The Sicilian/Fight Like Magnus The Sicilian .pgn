1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nb3
{ This is a common retreat square for the d4-knight after being hit by ...e5 in the Sicilian, but in the Sveshnikov Black is still able to play with ... Bb4, contrary to popular lines like   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  a6  6.Be2  e5  6.Nb3  for example. }
6... Bb4
{ An excellent, multi-functional move. We pin the knight, attack e4, develop and prepare castling. }
7. Bd3 d5
{ In the comparable position with 6. Nf3 played instead of 6. Nb3 I recommend to take on c3 and play ...d6 next, aiming against the weakened White pawn structure. This is also possible here, but White has an early f4 available here, which I think gives White more options for counterplay, for example after   7...Bxc3+  8.bxc3  d6  9.O-O  O-O  10.f4.  This is playable of course, but I liked 7... d5 more in this position. }
8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Bd2 Nxc3 10. bxc3 Be7
{ Here we can already conclude that Black is fine. We have the better pawn structure and the centre pawn on e5. }

6... Bb4
{ The natural move with many purposes. It pins the knight, indirectly attacks e4, prepares castling - all at the same time. }
7. Bd3
{ This is played most often here. The sharper  7.Bc4  is also examined in the Sveshnikov Sidelines chapter. }
7... Bxc3+
{ I recommend to just enter an improved version of the 7. Bc4 line, with the bishop on the more passive d3-square. Black may also play differently, for instance with   7...d5  , but a consistent approach makes sense in my opinion. }
8. bxc3 d6
{ Black has good chances due to White's ruined pawn structure. The pawns on the c-file will be eternally weak. }

Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5
{ The 7. Nd5 variation has never been considered particularly threatening for Black, but recently there have been new developments putting this line back into the limelight. Fabiano Caruana played it four times against Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship Match, showing some new ideas for White. Carlsen ultimately scored well, but he still experienced problems in these games. Black's reply is completely forced, so let's discuss the concepts of this line after the forced moves. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ Here Black obviously has 8... Ne7 and 8... Nb8 to choose from. Magnus has played both moves, so it is tough to make a choice here. I ultimately went for 8... Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. c4
{ This is the traditional main line for White, but Black does not experience any particular problems against it. This is the reason why the whole 7. Nd5 line has been a sideline for many years, only recently the new idea of playing 9. a4 has posed new problems for Black.That being said, the move 9. c4 makes a lot of sense. It gives the knight a natural square on c3 to return to and prepares the advance of the queenside majority. Black will set his kingside majority in motion as well, playing ...f5 is on the agenda soon. }
9... Be7
{ Black will play the moves ...Be7,...O-O and ...f5, but ...Nd7 and ...a6 are part of the setup as well. Black may start his play with either ...Be7, ...a6 or ...Nd7, and it will usually lead to the same thing, as ultimately all moves mentioned above will be on board.In the 9. a4 line the move order is important, as you need to be precise with the timing of the move ...a6, here it does not matter all that much. I suggest to start with 9... Be7 and castle next, doing it in the same way as after 9. a4. After 9... Be7 White usually chooses between developing the bishop to e2 or d3, but there is the independent possibility 10. c5. }
10. Be2
{ White develops the bishop and prepares castling. His usual plan is to answer our ...f5 push with f4, as we will see. }
10... O-O 11. O-O a6
{ Similarly to the comparable position with the bishop on d3 instead of e2 the move   11...f5  is less precise due to  12.c5.  It's best to first send the knight back and then proceed with the standard setup. }
12. Nc3 f5
{ White's main plan is to play f4 in such a position, fighting Black's pawn advance. Usually it is played right away, but White has also played   13.Kh1  first and continued with f4 on the next move. }
13. f4 Bf6
{ 13...Nd7  is also fine and will lead to the same position.   Please note that  13...exf4  14.Bxf4  Qb6+  15.Kh1  Qxb2  is a huge blunder due to  16.Na4. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.

Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.

Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. a4 Be7
{ It is important to get the move order right against 9. a4. It is especially important to not play ...a6 early on, as White is happy to play Na3, intending to play Nc4 and a5 next. This type of queenside bind is strategically very desirable for White and should be avoided. }
10. Be2
{ This was Caruana's choice in the World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen in two games. It always has been the most popular move at this point, but Caruana has shown some new ideas for White. }
10... O-O 11. O-O Nd7
{ As mentioned several times in the lines after 9. a4: don't play ...a6 too early, but rather wait until White has lost time to prepare the move a5, usually by playing Bd2. After   11...Nd7  the immediate  12.a5  makes little sense , as after  12...a6  the knight needs to retreat to c3, which does not fit all that well with the 9. a4 idea.  I'd like to mention that instead of 11... Nd7 Black also has tried   11...f5  , and in fact this was played once by the World Champion as well. This looks like a good alternative if you want to vary your play. }
12. Bd2
{ The World Championship Match between defending Champion Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana started with three Rossolimo Sicilians when Caruana had White. He got absolutely nowhere and in the 8th game he finally went for the open Sicilian and this line with 12. Bd2 was the preparation of team Caruana. White intends to play a5 next, allowing the knight tour Nb5-a3-c4. }
12... a6
{ As mentioned before: in the 9. a4 line only play this if White has already spent a move on Bd2. Magnus actually played   12...f5  here, but I'd like to suggest a different approach that was introduced later. It is quite clear that after the match the whole line was examined in detail and responses are more refined than what Carlsen was playing over the board. Of course 12... f5 is not a terrible move, but I feel my suggestion fits better with the other lines in the 9. a4 complex that I selected for the repertoire. }
13. Na3 a5
{ We are stopping the advance a5, just like we do in other similar cases. It should be noted that   13...b6  instead is bad due to  14.a5  b5  15.c4  , and the queenside is falling apart. }
14. c3 f5 15. b4 f4
{ This was played in the rapid game P.Svidler-A.Grischuk, Amsterdam 2019. I think this is a very instructive moment. Black stops f4 by White and gains more space on the kingside, having an attack on White's king in mind. Svidler showed a later part of this game on video, and only mentioned that he made some mistakes in the opening. I wonder if he is already referring to this position or a later stage. I already like Black here, if only for pratical reasons: it's more fun to attack the king ! }

If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Nd5 Be7 10. Nxe7
{ This move makes an odd impression, but it is the only option that does not give Black the pair of bishops. That seems to be the only upside, though. Black has no problem at all with control over d5 and gets active play quickly. }
10... Nxe7
{ Stronger than  10...Qxe7.  Now e4 is immediately attacked and the knight supports future ...d5 and/ or ...f5 pawn breaks. }
11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. c4
{ The most ambitious and sharp move, attacking the weakened queenside and trying to make use of the offside knight on a3. }
12... f5
{ Very instructive ! The move c4 is frequently seen in the Sveshnikov, giving Black three options. You can take on c4, play....b4 or just ignore it and allow White to take on b5. While each situation has its own specific details, there are some general considerations to take into account.First of all, it is almost never good to take on c4, allowing the knight to enter the game on c4. You should only take if you have a very concrete reason to do so, like winning material or a clear tactic.  Playing ...b4 is more likely to be a good reply, trying to keep the queenside closed. Here this fails to   12...b4  13.Qa4+  , dropping the b-pawn.  The third option is the most aggressive approach and quite often the most attractive. We will frequently see this idea in the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. Bd3 Ne7 12. Nxe7 Qxe7, when c4 is regularly ignored and answered by ...f5. Black does not mind to give up a pawn or two on the queenside for a central pawn roller. Let's return to the game position, which features the same pawn structure as the mentioned line. }
13. exf5 Nxf5 14. cxb5 Nd4
{ Black has good compensation for the pawn in this position. I'll show the most important line. }
15. bxa6 Bxa6 16. Bxa6 Qa5+ 17. Qd2 Qxa6
{ We are stopping O-O, which gives us good play. As it happens often the engines show a way for White to defend, but it is not easy at all for a human player to do the same. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }

6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up.

By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6
{ In my mind this is the only logical move, trying to establish control over the light squares, in particular d5. After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5. Depending on the concrete circumstances Black might even be able to play d6-d5, for instance prepared by ...Be6 and ...Ne7. We will discuss more ideas for both sides in the notes to the individual lines. }
10... Bxf6
{ Now White's massive main line is  11.c3  ,   but  11.c4  has seen a surge of popularity over the last decade. The alternatives don't convince and at best transpose to less challenging versions of the two main moves with the c-pawn. }
11. c4
{ While 11. c3 is still the main line, 11. c4 has gotten more popular starting from the mid 2000s. White forces   11...b4  ,  closing the queenside. This is a completely different approach compared to 11. c3, when White usually goes for a quick Nc2 and a4, attacking Black's queenside formation.   After  11.c4  b4  the play is rather slow. White has tried various ways to put pressure on Black , but the current theoretical status is completely satisfactory for Black. There is one move order pitfall to avoid , right on move  12. Let's have a look. }
11... b4 12. Nc2 O-O
{ This is a very important move order finesse that took me a while to understand. Black usually plays ...a5 and ...O-O, but should you play 12... a5 or 12... O-O first ? It turns out that it is more precise to play   12...O-O  , but this is not very obvious and therefore important to remember. The reason is the move  13.Qf3  ,  which is considerably less dangerous after 12...O-O, as we will see.   If White plays a slower move , like  13.Be2   or  13.g3  , we'll just follow up with  13...a5  and protect the b4-pawn, completing the queenside setup.  By the way: 12... O-O does not blunder the b-pawn, we will get excellent compensation if White elects to take it. }
13. g3
{ This is by far White's most popular move. If you compare it to the other continuations you will see that this is no coincidence. White does not get anywhere with a Be2-based setup and the fianchetto is the only other reasonable way to develop.On a more general note: it seems very difficult for White to make any headway with pure piece play, as we have seen in other lines. You can't generate serious pressure on the d-file and opening up the queenside with a3 leads to nothing much either. The only other way to alter the pawn structure seems to be f4, which is prepared by g3. Of course White needs to prepare this a bit more, but after 13. g3 you need to expect this to happen later. }
13... a5 14. Bg2
{ White also plays  14.h4  here ,  but this we have covered via 13. h4 a5 14. g3 -  (lines #25-31.) }
14... Be6 15. O-O Bg5 16. Qd3 Qb8
{ Again this idea to allow ...Bd8-b6. I have a soft spot for this idea, but it's good to know that Black's game is not dependent on a single line, but rather flexible. Here Black has successfully played many other moves, ranging from the simplifying   16...Bxd5   to the original  16...Nb8  , which are all playable. }

The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6
{ In my mind this is the only logical move, trying to establish control over the light squares, in particular d5. After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5. Depending on the concrete circumstances Black might even be able to play d6-d5, for instance prepared by ...Be6 and ...Ne7. We will discuss more ideas for both sides in the notes to the individual lines. }
10... Bxf6
{ Now White's massive main line is  11.c3  ,   but  11.c4  has seen a surge of popularity over the last decade. The alternatives don't convince and at best transpose to less challenging versions of the two main moves with the c-pawn. }
11. c4
{ While 11. c3 is still the main line, 11. c4 has gotten more popular starting from the mid 2000s. White forces   11...b4  ,  closing the queenside. This is a completely different approach compared to 11. c3, when White usually goes for a quick Nc2 and a4, attacking Black's queenside formation.   After  11.c4  b4  the play is rather slow. White has tried various ways to put pressure on Black , but the current theoretical status is completely satisfactory for Black. There is one move order pitfall to avoid , right on move  12. Let's have a look. }
11... b4 12. Nc2 O-O
{ This is a very important move order finesse that took me a while to understand. Black usually plays ...a5 and ...O-O, but should you play 12... a5 or 12... O-O first ? It turns out that it is more precise to play   12...O-O  , but this is not very obvious and therefore important to remember. The reason is the move  13.Qf3  ,  which is considerably less dangerous after 12...O-O, as we will see.   If White plays a slower move , like  13.Be2   or  13.g3  , we'll just follow up with  13...a5  and protect the b4-pawn, completing the queenside setup.  By the way: 12... O-O does not blunder the b-pawn, we will get excellent compensation if White elects to take it. }
13. Qf3 Bg5 { We preserve the bishop and avoid doubled f-pawns. } 14. h4
{ This is the point of the queen sortie. White starts concrete play against the bishop. }
14... Bh6 15. g4
{ This is a case of 'having said 'A', you need to say 'B' as well'. Black was also ready to strike with ...f5 now, so a slower move in combination with 14. h4 makes little sense. }
15... f6
{ Now, here is the moment where the difference between 12... a5 and 12...O-O becomes very relevant. If you picture this position with ...a5 being played instead of ...O-O you will spot that 16. g5 ! would be a strong move, while here this is clearly prevented and White has no direct follow-up to his pawn storm on the kingside.The play is very complex and interesting now. White has no obvious safe place for his king, which is very relevant in the long run. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }

In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6
{ In my mind this is the only logical move, trying to establish control over the light squares, in particular d5. After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5. Depending on the concrete circumstances Black might even be able to play d6-d5, for instance prepared by ...Be6 and ...Ne7. We will discuss more ideas for both sides in the notes to the individual lines. }
10... Bxf6
{ Now White's massive main line is  11.c3  ,   but  11.c4  has seen a surge of popularity over the last decade. The alternatives don't convince and at best transpose to less challenging versions of the two main moves with the c-pawn. }
11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it is usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11...O-O felt like the most practical choice to me. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. h4
{ This move is regarded as the critical one against the move order 11...O-O 12. Nc2 Rb8. White stops ...Bg5 and this is no small feat. If you study the move 13. Be2 and 13. Bd3 you see that ...Bg5 and ...Ne7 is a common way for Black to continue. Now   13...Ne7  is a huge concession , as  14.Nxf6+  gxf6  changes the pawn structure in White's favour. }
13... g6
{ It looks a bit odd at first to play ...g6 AFTER White has played h4, but we don't need to worry about the h-file here. White has no attacking pieces and the bishop defends the dark squares reliably. With 13... g6 Black intends to play ...Bg7, then proceed with the play for the d5-square with ...Ne7. The main incentive to select it for the repertoire was the game W. So-M.Carlsen, Stavanger 2019 - if in doubt, play what Magnus plays. }
14. g3 Bg7 15. h5 Ne7 16. Nce3 Nxd5 17. Nxd5
{ This position was reached in the mentioned So-Carlsen game. Now Magnus went for  17...Be6  18.Bh3  Bxd5  19.Qxd5  b4  and later drew the game. I have to admit that I don't like this approach for Black. The resulting positions don't offer much activity and the alternative 17... Bb7 looks perfectly fine. It has been tested in many high level correspondence games and Black had no problems. }
17... Bb7
{ Black's basic idea is to play ...Bf6-g5 and ...Rc8-c5 next, fighting for control of d5. Some sample continuations from here are examined in the dedicated chapter. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'.

Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6
{ In my mind this is the only logical move, trying to establish control over the light squares, in particular d5. After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5. Depending on the concrete circumstances Black might even be able to play d6-d5, for instance prepared by ...Be6 and ...Ne7. We will discuss more ideas for both sides in the notes to the individual lines. }
10... Bxf6
{ Now White's massive main line is  11.c3  ,   but  11.c4  has seen a surge of popularity over the last decade. The alternatives don't convince and at best transpose to less challenging versions of the two main moves with the c-pawn. }
11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11...O-O felt like the most practical choice to me. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful. Let's have a look:   a  ...a5 prepares ...b4 and prevents Ncb4,  b  ...Be6 develops,  c  ...g6 prepares ...f5,  d  ...Ne7 to challenge the knight on d5 and  e  ...Kh8 is useful in any ...f5 scenario, to avoid possible checks on the a2-g8 diagonal and to clear the g-file for ideas like ...Rg8, once ...f5/exf5/...gxf5 is on the board.   So why 14... Kh8 first and not one of the others ? Let's check the alternatives: First of all,   14...a5  can be answered by  15.Na3 !  , which is a bit awkward to meet , as  15...b4  16.Nb5  is annoying   and  14...a5  15.Na3 !  Na7  is not ideal either.   14...Be6  is possible and not bad in my mind. One argument against it could be that you are not able to play ...Bb7 anymore, which was Carlsen's reply to Bg4 against Giri. You may also question if ...Be6 is necessary if you like to play ...f5 soon.   Next we have  14...g6  ,  which is not as flexible as 14... Kh8. It also prepares ...f5, but is not as useful in other scenarios.   Finally there is  14...Ne7  ,  which is the most solid move. We will see this idea after 14... Kh8 15. a3 Ne7. It is already playable in move 14 for sure, but less combative compared to 14... Kh8. Once you play ... Ne7 you focus on fighting for d5 and are less likely to mix it up with ...f5.  To sum it up, there are alternatives, and I think Carlsen went for 14... Kh8 because it is a flexible move that is not yet explored as much as the other choices. This leads us to an additional point in favour of copying the World Champion at this point. The line we are examining right now was recommended in an important repertoire book for White, written by GM John Shaw: 'Playing 1. e4 - Sicilian Main lines'. Shaw checks most of Black's alternatives on move 14, but not 14... Kh8. This makes this move more attractive for us, as White players might have studied up to this point, but likely don't know the king move if they only relied on this popular book. After 14... Kh8 we will check four options for White, illustrating the main ideas in the process. }
15. Qd3
{ White goes for a quick play on the d-file, but we are ready for counterplay. }
15... f5
{ This looks particularly strong at this moment , given that  16.exf5  Bxf5  looks unattractive for White. }
16. Bf3 g6 17. Rfd1 a5
{ Now what ? We see a typical dilemma of the Sveshnikov pawn structure. It is just not possible to have a knight on d5 and apply pressure against d6 at the same time ! You can only do one at a time, but each on its own is something that Black can handle well. }
18. Nde3 Bxe3
{ Black also has the interesting  18...f4  , but I wanted to show a strategic idea with this move. }
19. Nxe3 f4 20. Nd5 Be6
{ Now White has a great looking knight on d5, but it actually has no square to go to ! In this position White needs to get something going on the queenside quickly, otherwise Black's play on the kingside will be tough to handle. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look at rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c4
{ A sharp alternative to the mainlines. Similarly to  11.Bd3  Ne7  12.Nxe7  Qxe7  13.c4  White attacks Black's queenside pawns and we have no good alternative to sacrificing the b-pawn. As usual Black gets excellent compensation and quite often manages to win attractive attacking games.  The resulting positions are much easier to handle for Black, in particular if you know what to do. In many cases White does not, because if he had known that after 11. c4 he's be on the defensive the whole time he wouldn't have played into the line in the first place. After perfect play White is still OK after 11. c4, but you will not encounter that against a human opponent. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. g4
{ 'No ... f5 for you !' - White stops the-f-pawn, but weakens his position a lot in the process. In particular ...Qh4 can be an annoying move for him to face. First of all we have a good opportunity on the queenside that we should use. }
15... b4
{ A strong resource that we need to keep in mind. This move is strong here and even more so against 15. a4. The idea is to either get the d4-square after cxb4 or to get the centre into motion after Nxb4, which is already quite bad for White. }
16. Bg2
{ By far the best choice. White continues to develop and does not take on b4. }
16... bxc3 17. bxc3 Rc8
{ The ...b4 idea has created a weakness that we can attack with ...Ne7 soon. Chances in this interesting position are about even. }

By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. g4
{ 'No ... f5 for you !' - White stops the-f-pawn, but weakens his position a lot in the process. In particular ...Qh4 can be an annoying move for him to face. First of all we have a good opportunity on the queenside that we should use. }
15... b4
{ A strong resource that we need to keep in mind. This move is strong here and even more so against 15. a4. The idea is to either get the d4-square after cxb4 or to get the centre into motion after Nxb4, which is already quite bad for White. }
16. cxb4
{ This gives Black great play, but 16. Nxb4 Nxb4 17. cxb4 d5 is even worse. }
16... Rb8
{ The Rook move is a bit better than  16...Nd4  - it's not a huge difference , though. }
17. a3 Nd4
{ Compared to the position without ...Rb8 and a3 we have provoked the weakness on b3. }
18. h4
{ Played to prevent a line like  18.Bg2  Qh4  , which looks very annoying. }
18... e4 19. Bg2 f5 { Black's attack is already very dangerous. } 20. gxf5 Bxd5
21. Nxd5 Rxf5
{ White's king is under heavy fire and has no safe place to go to. The engines already see a win for Black, which is not a surprise. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. Bd3
{ A natural and popular move, angling for piece play against the centre and Kingside, often connected with Qh5. }
15... f5
{ After our natural move  15...f5  White now chooses between  16.O-O  ,   16.Qh5   and  16.Bc2. }
16. O-O
{ In some of the sharp lines White does not manage to castle, so this solid move is certainly a reasonable choice. }
16... e4
{ We usually play ...e4 in these lines in reply to Qh5, so we will choose a similar approach here. Note that   16...f4  fails to  17.Qh5   and  16...Ne7  is refuted by  17.Nxe7+  Qxe7  18.Bxf5 !  , which amounts to a disaster as well. }
17. Nf4 { The only move, otherwise we'd have ... f4 next. } 17... Bf7 18. Bc2
Be5
{ As played by Magnus Carlsen , so we'll follow the Champion's example. Black has some decent alternatives here , like  18...Qd7   and  18...Qg5. }
19. Nfd5 Qg5
{ I suggest to play this move instead of Carlsen's  19...Kh8.  He got into some trouble against V.Topalov in Abidjan 2019. He still won this Blitz game quickly after Topalov misplayed it soon after.  The move 19... Qg5 is the recommendation of both the engines and the correspondence players and looks attractive, so we'll go for it. Our threats are now ...f4 and ...Bh5. }

2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black.

So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Bd3
{ After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course, the 11. Bd3 Sveshnikov is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wracking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. c4 { A bad move that is met with an instructive refutation. } 12... Nxd5
13. cxd5 f5 14. O-O fxe4 15. Bxe4 O-O
{ With ...f5 coming next Black is clearly better. Imagine a later ...e4, ...Be5 and ...Ra7-g7. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary.

This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }

It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Bd3
{ After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course, the 11. Bd3 Sveshnikov is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wracking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. c4
{ After 13. c4 or 13. O-O O-O 14. c4 the game gets very sharp. After any c4 move by White in the Sveshnikov you need to decide what to do with the b-pawn. Taking on c4 is bad 99.9% of the time, as it helps the knight on a3 far too much. In some cases you can play ...b4, but here it would blunder the pawn due to   13...b4  14.Qa4+.  This leads to the third option to just ignore the threat to the pawn and allow White to take on b5. This is why the c4-line is the sharpest one: White will win material and Black throws the kitchen sink to claim compensation. }
13... f5
{ After  13...f5  White should play  14.O-O  and after  14...O-O  we will transpose to the mainline of the  11.Bd3  chapter. Other moves are bad , ranging from dubious to downright losing  ! }
14. Qh5
{ This queen sortie is the main line with 13. O-O O-O inserted, but with the king still being on e1 this is a huge blunder ! }
14... d5
{ This is why you play the Sveshnikov ! Now ...Qb4+ is the threat, but the pawns on c4 and e4 are attacked twice as well ! White is completely lost already. }
15. cxd5 fxe4
{ This is is how the famous game L. Psakhis-A. Vaisser, Paris 1990 ended. Psakhis, a two-time Soviet Champion, resigned here. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games.

{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Bd3
{ After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course, the 11. Bd3 Sveshnikov is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wracking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c3
{ A more restrained way to play for White. He prepares Nc2-e3, improving the misplaced knight on a3. }
14... f5 15. Nc2 d5
{ Always an attractive option if it works out tactically. Here it does ! } 16.
exf5 e4 17. Be2 Rd8 { Black needs to cover d5 first. } 18. Nd4 Qf6 19. f3
{ White needs to play this move or  19.g4  to keep the f5-pawn. If we just get to take this pawn we are fine. Now after 19. f3 - or 19. g4 - White has weakened the dark squares and we immediately start play on them. }
19... b4
{ This is a key move to destabilize the knight on d4. We will play ...Bd7 and ...Rac8 to increase the pressure on the c-pawn. We have full compensation. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  the starting position of this variation arises. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:     the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.    The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Bd3
{ After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course, the 11.

{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }

O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qf3 { White's main tries for an advantage are  15.Qh5  and this move. }
15... d5
{ We have seen this idea multiple times , so this should not come as a great surprise. In this particular case we can't play  15...fxe4  16.Qxe4  with a double threat, so ...d5 is played first in order to make ...fxe4 possible. }
16. cxd5 fxe4 17. Bxe4 Rb8
{ We need to play this first. White was threatening d6, which even works after   17...f5 ?  18.d6  !.  The rook move is useful not only as prophylaxis, but also introduces active ideas into the position, in particular a rook lift with ...Rb6-h6 or to g6. We explore this position further in the 11. Bd3 chapter. }

The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawns early on.   The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.   These three main lines are covered in five chapters of this course. White also has some lines that are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not guaranteed that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6   and  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that are still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? In the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10.Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5
{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter.   By far the most important line besides the main line is  11.c4  , which is a popular alternative seen at all levels of play. }
9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Bd3
{ After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course, the 11. Bd3 Sveshnikov is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wracking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. cxb5
{ This is not a good idea. White is be able to defend in the coming lines, but it's not a fun task for a human player. }
15... d5
{ Black is forcing the long diagonal open with this standard pawn push. } 16.
exd5 e4 17. Qe2
{ The only move to cover b2 and defend the d3-bishop by tactical means. Black now has a plethora of good attacking ideas. I'll show a promising one. }
17... Qb4 18. Bc4 Qxb2 19. Nc2 axb5 20. Rab1 Qf6 21. Rxb5 f4
{ With excellent attacking chances for just one pawn. } *

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }

{ The open Sicilian will very likely always be the critical test of any Sicilian setup. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's choice is the Sveshnikov Variation.

Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Bd3
{ After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course, the 11. Bd3 Sveshnikov is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wracking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qh5 Rb8
{ We would have liked to take on e4, but   15...fxe4  16.Bxe4  is a double threat on h7 and on the rook. This explains 15... Rb8 - now we are threatening to take on e4 and then play ...f5 a second time !  The move 15... Rb8 has been tested numerous times in over the board play and correspondence chess and it looks like Black is doing fine in the hair-raising complications. I need to mention that 15... Rb8 is not the only move, though. In fact only some days before these lines were written the World Champion went for a different move: he played 15... d5 !? in the Grand Swiss Isle of Man Tournament against Russian hopeful Alexey Sarana. 15... d5 is a rare move and was probably intended as a surprise, but Sarana had done his homework and blitzed out the following moves.   15...d5  16.cxd5  Qd8  17.exf5  Qxd5  18.Rad1  e4  19.Bxb5  Qxf5  20.Qxf5  Bxf5  21.Bd7  Bxd7  22.Rxd7  Bxb2  23.Nc4.  Now, this sequence is in fact clearly best play after 15... d5 and the resulting position I don't want to recommend, even though Magnus played the line. Black is very close to equality, but it's a grovel and not fun at all. Magnus ultimately drew the game after some unpleasant moments. Maybe HE kept his cool, but I would have been concerned ! In any case, I don't want to play for two results just yet if a win is not among them. }
16. exf5
{ A more or less forced decision. Otherwise we take on e4 and play ...f5 next. }
16... e4 17. Rae1
{ We attacked both the bishop on d3 and the pawn on b2, so White needs a tactical solution. }
17... Bb7 18. Qg4 Rfe8 { We need to cover e4. } 19. cxb5 Kh8
{ We can't play without this king move. Our bishop was pinned and ...Rg8 is an important option to gain. }
20. bxa6 Ba8
{ This is a good moment to take stock. Black is three pawns down, but on all other accounts things are great ! The pieces are active and there are many weak pawns that we might win back soon, like b2 and a6. Remarkably the engine evaluation is 'equal' and in correspondence chess White has not won a single game out of the 43 games in my database ! This is amazing and an almost sure sign that purely from an analytical point of view Black is fine. This is not so important in a practical game, of course, but assuring to know. Given the choice, I'd take Black - our play is often directed against the king, which is always attractive. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not. This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the fianchetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this 'Rossolimo Reversed' structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. O-O
{ White's flexible choice instead of taking on c6. After our natural reply   4...Bg7  there is a parting of the ways. }
4... Bg7 5. c3
{ This is a very popular move, but it has not yet been tried against Magnus Carlsen, so we don't now what he has planned against 5. c3. What we do know is that Magnus has a preference for the Botvinnik setup with ...e5, so I decided to recommend 5... e5 here. }
5... e5
{ The move  5...e5  is the most consistent with our repertoire choices and also the sharpest move here. The reason is that White only has one serious way to fight for an advantage , and this approach involves a pawn sacrifice. After  6.d4  cxd4  7.cxd4  exd4  we are winning a pawn , but White gets good compensation. This line actually scores very well for White , but I think I found some good new ideas to strengthen Black's cause.  One important consideration is: if you don't play master level players or theoretically very well prepared opponents it is very likely that White will not go for this pawn sacrifice and this gives Black a fairly easy game with structures that are well known to us.   I'd like to mention that Black's main alternative is  5...Nf6  ,  which is actually the most popular move and satisfactory for Black as well. The main reason for not selecting this move is that does not fit all that well with the rest of the repertoire and takes a lot more effort to learn compared to 5... e5. }
6. d4
{ This is clearly the critical move. Against something slow like  6.d3  we are completing our setup with ...Nge7, ...O-O and ...d6.  The following play looks a lot like a Ruy Lopez, but Black has some options that are usually not available in a Ruy, most notably to play ...f5 at the right moment or the more solid ...d5. We have excellent protection of e5, so ...d5 is more realistic than in many Ruys - think of the Marshall Attack, which features a quick ...d5, but it comes with the price tag of a pawn. }
6... cxd4 7. cxd4 exd4 8. Bf4
{ This is a good moment to talk about White's compensation for the pawn. He is better developed and has already castled, while we still need to develop the knight to get the king out of the middle of the board. An important idea for White is the move Bd6, which can be very annoying to face, as it blocks the d-pawn and makes it difficult for Black to coordinate. So White definitely has enough for the pawn, but I don't think it is all doom and gloom for Black. I suggest to play a less explored concept against this line and I doubt that many White players will be able to handle this correctly, in particular without any computer assisted preparation. }
8... a6
{ Black's main move is  8...Nge7  ,  but it does not fare well in practice. I think the less common 8.. .a6 is better, as it immediately forces a decision about the bishop placement. This is very relevant, as the move ...a6 is part of Black's play anyway, but if you play it later, White has a wider choice of critical replies, for example Bd3 becomes an option. }
9. Ba4
{ The main upside of this move is that now  9...d6  is impossible due to  10.Nxd4  , using the pin. }
9... Nge7
{ We are now ready to play either ...b5 and ...d6, or even ...d5 in one move to free our position and think about converting the extra pawn. Therefore White's replies   10.Bd6   and  10.e5  must be critical. This position has been reached in seven games in my database and White played 10. Bd6 in all of them. }
10. Bd6
{ This is the only move played in this position so far and very logical, also taking into account that without ...a6 and Ba4 inserted White also goes Bd6. There is an important difference between these similar lines though, as we will see. }
10... b5 11. Bb3 Bb7
{ We prioritized the queenside development and delayed castling. The important point is that now the e7-knight is able to move and attack the bishop on d6, usually from c8. }
12. Re1
{ After  12.e5  Nf5  White does not have anything better than  13.Re1  Nxd6  14.exd6+  Kf8  ,  which transposes to 12. Re1. }
12... Nc8 { This gives Black a good game. } 13. e5 Nxd6 14. exd6+ Kf8
{ We play ...Bf6 and ...Kg7 next and again White struggles to show enough play for the pawn and the bishop pair. }

I think the only challenging moves now are  6.Bxc6  - transposing to 4. Bxc6, the final opportunity to take the knight before ...Nge7 renders this illogical,   and the gambit style move  6.b4  , which was played by Caruana in the mentioned game. }
6. b4
{ Playing in gambit style ! This move was employed by Fabiano Caruana in the 5th game of the World Championship Match, trying to surprise the World Champion. This attempt was unsuccessful, as Magnus knew exactly how to neutralize this idea. Funny side note: I had looked at the line from White's point of view for the Keep It Simple: 1. e4 repertoire and concluded that it does not promise much, exactly because of what Magnus played. It's just what the engines show after digging for a while. }
6... Nxb4 7. Bb2 a6
{ This is the safe choice. Black has also tried  7...Qc7   and  7...Qb6  , but those moves give White dangerous attacking possibilities. }
8. a3
{ The only test of Black's play, otherwise there is no compensation at all. }
8... axb5 9. axb4 Rxa1 10. Bxa1 d6
{ This sequence is forced after 7... a6. Black now is ready to return the pawn to coordinate the position. }
11. bxc5 Ne7
{ We need to catch up in development. Note that we still have the bishop pair as a possible long term asset - if White does not show anything concrete over the next moves this will become very relevant. }

In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this 'Rossolimo Reversed' structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3 Bg7 6. h3
{ This is White's most popular move. It does not look all that obvious why this is the case, but a closer look reveals some points. It is a very flexible move that fits into many concepts. White does not yet commit to castling kingside, keeping both options open. If you want to delay 6. O-O, there is not much else left actually. You may play   6.Nc3  ,  but this limits White's options on the queenside, as sometimes you'd rather play Nb1-d2-c4, for example. }
6... Qc7
{ Our trademark move. We like to wait with ...e5 until White has committed to a setup. }
7. Nc3
{ White often plays 7. O-O here, which leads to lines examined via the 6. O-O move order. The early Nc3 usually signals that White does not want to castle kingside soon, as you'd like to be more flexible with your queenside after going O-O. Ideas like a3+b4 are more effective with the knight being able to go to d2/a3 and c4 later. }
7... e5 8. Be3 b6 9. Qd2
{ Against  9.O-O  we play  9...Nf6  ,  intending to go for the ...Nh5 plan. This is a transposition to 6. O-O again. }
9... h6
{ This is played to avoid Bh6 after a knight move. It is also useful to control g5, of course. }
10. a3
{ I found 9 games reaching the position on move 10, and in 5 of them 10. a3 was played. The a3/b4 plan makes more sense to me in other versions, but what else is there for White. The pawn breaks are b4 and f4, there is not much else to do. }
10... Ne7 11. b4 f5
{ Black has excellent counterplay in this position. White may try various queen moves now, let's have a look at the most obvious looking one. }
12. Qc1
{ The queen anticipates a future opening of the queenside and intends to go to b2 or a3 later. Black was threatening ...f4, so the queen needed to move anyway. }
12... f4 13. Bd2 cxb4 14. axb4 g5
{ This is going to be an entertaining game ! Black has good chances on the kingside, while White needs to make some headway on the other side of the board. As usual this kind of play is not easy to conduct for White, as we have his king as the primary target. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not. This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the fianchetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this 'Rossolimo Reversed' structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2.

It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,  while after 6... Qc7 White is only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan.   In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to the  line 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7. Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. h3
{ A useful waiting move and the most common choice by White. I need to mention that the whole ...Qc7 approach is rather new and therefore we don't have hundreds of games to rely upon. This is not a negative point of course, there are still many new ideas to uncover. }
7... e5 8. Be3
{ Aronian has tried this move in a Blitz game against Magnus Carlsen, in Stavanger 2019. }
8... b6 9. a4 a5
{ If White plays a4, you need to go ...a5, so just play the move and press the clock, if you are actually sitting at a physical board :- }
10. Na3 { We are following the Blitz game B.Amin-M.Carlsen, Abidjan 2019. }
10... Ne7
{ A setup with  10...Nf6  followed by ...Nd7 is possible, but this move is more active, still retaining the possibility of a quick ...f5. }
11. Nc4 Be6
{ Attention ! This position is closed at the moment, but White has the idea to play b4 ! next, which might be fatal, depending on what you play. For instance, if you want to 'prepare' ...Be6 with   11...h6  ,  12.b4 !  is going to be terrible for Black , as  12...axb4  13.a5  is very powerful.  The game move 11.... Be6 is stopping b4 entirely, as you can always chop the knight on c4. }

The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,  while after 6... Qc7 White is only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan.   In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to the  line 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7. Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. h3
{ A useful waiting move and the most common choice by White. I need to mention that the whole ...Qc7 approach is rather new and therefore we don't have hundreds of games to rely upon. This is not a negative point of course, there are still many new ideas to uncover. }
7... e5 8. Be3
{ Aronian has tried this move in a Blitz game against Magnus Carlsen, in Stavanger 2019. }
8... b6 9. a3
{ This looks like the most principled move, directly going for the b4 push. }
9... f5
{ I suggest this sharp move , which is yet untested in practice. There is nothing particularly wrong about  9...Ne7   or  9...Nf6  ,  but the complications that arise after 9... f5 are fascinating and very tough for White to handle  (if he does not know how to continue and needs to figure it out over the board. As it is a new move, this is very likely to be the case. For more information please see the dedicated chapter)  on the Rossolimo with 4. Bxc6. }

{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'.

2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ Many players are happy to play an open Sicilian in general, but prefer to avoid the Sveshnikov specifically. For those players the main options are the Rossolimo with 3. Bb5 and this move. With 3. Nc3 White still retains the idea to play 4. d4 against moves like 3... e6, 3... d6 or 3... g6. }
3... e5
{ The World Champion has scored very well with this move, so it's a natural choice for this repertoire. With 3... e5 we stop d4 and set up the Botvinnik pawn center. Black's main idea in this pawn formation is to block the center and generate play with ...f5 later. On a very good day Black might even manage to play ...d5.   I'd like to mention that it is difficult to play a different 3rd move that still retains chances to get a Sveshnikov. There is  3...Nf6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  would transpose.   After  3...Nf6  White is not obliged to play  4.d4  , though.   In fact  4.Bb5  is tricky to handle for Black and not worth studying, given that we have a sound alternative with 3... e5.   I'd like to mention  3...d6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  looks somewhat like a Sveshnikov , but instead of  6.Ndb5  when we can go into a Sveshnikov with 6... Nf6,   White also has the annoying options  6.Nf5   and even  6.Nb3. }
4. Bc4 Be7
{ Black intends to play ...Nf6, but needs to prepare this move. After the immediate   4...Nf6  White has  5.Ng5.  The move 4... Be7 is the main move by far, as played by Magnus Carlsen numerous times. However, there is a second option in 4... g6, which was also tried by the World Champion. I decided to cover 4... Be7, as this seems to be Carlsen's more 'serious' choice. I also need to mention that after   4...g6  5.h4  h6  6.h5  g5  the game might become extremely blocked on the kingside and I'd like to keep the game a bit more flexible instead. }
5. d3 d6
{ After the natural move 5... d6 White has two main options and some sidelines. The first main option is   6.Nd2  ,  intending the Knight tour via f1 to e3, lending additional control over the d5-square.  The second main move is to just castle kingside, mostly intending to play a quick Ng5 after Black has played ...Nf6. We need to check those two main moves, but will also take a look as some lesser alternatives to get a better grip on the general scenario in this pawn structure. }
6. O-O Nf6
{ Now White has the fundamental choice between direct play with  7.Ng5  or a slow set-up , somewhat similar to lines in the Italian game or Ruy Lopez. }
7. Ng5
{ This is the most aggressive line in the whole 3. Nc3 e5 complex. White uses this tempo move to play f4 next, opening up the f-file for his Rook. }
7... O-O 8. f4 Bg4
{ Magnus Carlsen has never faced the 7. Ng5 line, so we don't know what the World Champion would play here. Black has two main options at this point and I think both are fine to play. I am recommending 8... Bg4, but   8...exf4  9.Bxf4  h6  10.Nf3  Be6  11.Nd5  and now the less common  11...Nb4  is worth a shot as well.  I ultimately went for 8... Bg4, which is sharp, but a bit simpler to play in my opinion. Still it is good to have options and here you have a good choice between two respectable defences. }
9. Qe1 exf4 10. Bxf4 Nd4
{ The point of 8... Bg4 is to gain a bit of time on the Queen. It has to move again after this useful centralization of the Knight. }
11. Qd2 Qd7
{ A good move that connects Rooks and prepares moves like ...Be6 and ...b5. Black has equal chances here. }

6. Nd2
{ This is the most popular move here, heading immediately for the Knight route to e3. }
6... Nf6
{ 6...Bg5  does not look bad at first sight , but White has the annoying reply  7.h4 !  , after which Black can't play  7...Bxh4  due to  8.Qh5. }
7. Nf1 Nd7
{ This move has been played twice by the World Champion , netting him two attractive wins. Right before I started to analyse this line for the course , I reached this position in a classical time control game and went for  7...O-O  8.Ne3  Nd7.  Over the board I remembered that ...Nd7 was the idea Magnus had played, but I didn't get the move order correct. So in case you read these lines and find the game somewhere: castling first is just based on my sketchy knowledge at the time, not some hidden analytical idea. By the way it is not terrible to play 7...O-O, but let's stick with Carlsen's approach.  Why ...Nd7 in the first place ? It involves more than one idea. One point is to enable ...Bg5 again, trading off the passive Bishop. The second one is that ... Nb6 will happen soon, again connecting to the vital d5-square and getting a possible ...Nxc4 on the map. Finally, we clear the way for the f-pawn push, as it happened in Carlsen's games to great effect. }
8. Nd5
{ This was played by Peter Svidler against Magnus Carlsen at the Grenke Chess Classics 2019. }
8... Nb6 9. Nxb6 axb6
{ The doubled pawn is no problem at all for Black. White has no way to put pressure on it and for the moment we are happy to have the Rook on a8 'half-developed' for free. }
10. c3 O-O 11. Ne3 Bg5
{ We are making sure that this Bishop will be traded. At the same time we are also indirectly fighting for the d5-square, as ...Bxe3 and later ...Be6 would almost make sure to achieve ...d5 at the end. }

2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3
{ White goes for a King's Indian Attack with g3 next. This way to play is much more interesting for White after 2... e6, as this limits Black's possible set-ups. Now we have a very convenient choice. }
3... g6
{ I think that the Botvinnik set-up with a later ...e5 is excellent against the KIA. However, here you may also play   3...Nf6  and 4... d5, which will very likely transpose into a line we will check via 2. g3 d5 3. d3 Nc6 4. Nd2 Nf6. }
4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O e5
{ We have completed the Botvinnik formation with ...c5 and ...e5. From here it is difficult to analyze on a move-by-move basis, because White has so many different move orders available. For me the only set-up by White worth checking is a quick c3, a3, b4 push on the queenside. If White plays moves like Nbd2, Re1, a4 we will complete our standard set-up with ...Nge7,...O-O, ...h6, ...Be6 and ...Qd7. We are ready to play ...d5 or ...f5 while it is unclear what White is playing for. Often the Knight on f3 goes to h4 or some other square to reach f4, but this is not dangerous. Against f4 we are well equipped to play ...d5, possibly after taking on f4 first. In the chapter 'Sidelines on move 3' I will show some examples of this type of play to illustrate ideas. }
7. c3
{ As mentioned , I regard a quick c3/a3/b4 push as the only interesting idea for White. One thing to mention is that  7.Nc3  is also possible, but this we examine as part of the closed Sicilian via 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 etc. }
7... Nge7 8. a3 O-O
{ This is important. We should not stop b4 with   8...a5  , as after  9.a4 !  White gains useful control over the weakened squares on the queenside. }
9. b4 a6 10. Nbd2 h6
{ This is the main move, preparing ...Be6. In the blitz game T. Petrosian-M.Carlsen, Riadh 2017, Magnus played the immediate   10...Be6  , but after  11.Ng5  Bd7  12.Nc4  h6  White could have gained the upper hand with  13.Nxf7  !.  There is not much upside to playing ...Be6 first, so just play 10... h6. Now we have reached a rather slow-paced position with flexible move orders. Black's main idea is to play for ...f5 later, gaining space on the kingside. }

2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation, or as it is often simply called: the 'c3-Sicilian'. The Alapin enjoys a sound reputation, but is not perceived as particularly threatening for Black. White intends to play d4 next and prepares to recapture with the c-pawn, keeping a full pawn centre. It is not surprising to learn that Black's best replies   2...d5   and  2...Nf6  immediately attack the e4-pawn and prevent the desired central pawn duo on e4 and d4. Magnus Carlsen has played both main lines in his career, but in recent years showed a preference for 2... Nf6. }
2... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3
{ White often plays 4. d4 instead, when 4... cxd4 will lead us to the same positions as after 4. Nf3 almost all of the time. Two common paths are   4.d4  cxd4  5.Nf3  Nc6   or  4.d4  cxd4  5.cxd4  d6  6.Nf3  Nc6. }
4... Nc6
{ This position might also have been reached by the move order  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.c3  Nf6  4.e5  Nd5.  Now White has three main options to choose from.   He can play d4 and after ...cxd4 simply recapture with cxd4. This was always considered to be fine for Black, but you need to be alert if you want to play for a win - some lines are quite dull and to be avoided if a draw is unacceptable.  The second option is to play d4, but after ...cxd4 play the move Bc4, which often leads to gambit play. This is considered to be the main line nowadays. It's fine for Black, but more testing than the older approach with the simple recapture.  The third idea is to skip d4 altogether, but to play Bc4 now. This might transpose to approach number two later, but there are some independent options. }

{ Almost mandatory.  7.d4  cxd4  8.cxd4  Bg4  is good for Black and discussed via the move order 5. d4 cxd4 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Bb3 d5 8. cxd4 Bg4  (- line #31.) }
7... Qxd6 8. O-O Be6
{ The bishop on b3 is White's best piece, so this approach is very logical for sure. }
9. Bxe6 Qxe6 10. a4
{ Again 10. d4 cxd4 would transpose to the Alapin main line. The more common move order via the main line would be   1.e4  c5  2.c3  Nf6  3.e5  Nd5  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.d4  cxd4  6.Bc4  Nb6  7.Bb3  d5  8.exd6  Qxd6  9.O-O  Be6  10.Bxe6  Qxe6.  The idea of 10. a4 is to advance the pawn all the way to a6, trying to weaken the black queenside. }
10... Qd7 11. a5 Nd5
{ Black is fine in this position. The a-pawn advance does not look too threatening and we develop with ...e6 and ... Be7 next in most cases. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation, or as it is often simply called: the 'c3-Sicilian'. The Alapin enjoys a sound reputation, but is not perceived as particularly threatening for Black. White intends to play d4 next and prepares to recapture with the c-pawn, keeping a full pawn centre. It is not surprising to learn that Black's best replies   2...d5   and  2...Nf6  immediately attack the e4-pawn and prevent the desired central pawn duo on e4 and d4. Magnus Carlsen has played both main lines in his career, but in recent years showed a preference for 2... Nf6. }
2... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3
{ White often plays 4. d4 instead, when 4... cxd4 will lead us to the same positions as after 4. Nf3 almost all of the time. Two common paths are   4.d4  cxd4  5.Nf3  Nc6   or  4.d4  cxd4  5.cxd4  d6  6.Nf3  Nc6. }
4... Nc6
{ This position might also have been reached by the move order  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.c3  Nf6  4.e5  Nd5.  Now White has three main options to choose from.   He can play d4 and after ...cxd4 simply recapture with cxd4. This was always considered to be fine for Black, but you need to be alert if you want to play for a win - some lines are quite dull and to be avoided if a draw is unacceptable.  The second option is to play d4, but after ...cxd4 play the move Bc4, which often leads to gambit play. This is considered to be the main line nowadays. It's fine for Black, but more testing than the older approach with the simple recapture.  The third idea is to skip d4 altogether, but to play Bc4 now. This might transpose to approach number two later, but there are some independent options. }
5. d4 cxd4 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Bb3 d5 8. cxd4
{ This is a serous inaccuracy. We are now getting an excellent version of an advance Caro-Kann. }
8... Bg4
{ Compared to a Caro-Kann we have managed to play ... Bg4 instead of ...Bf5 and played ...c5 in one move. Of course we have spent time to play the knight over to b6, but this is actually a common idea in the Caro as well  (Ng8-e7-c8-b6)  . Please note that the bishop on b3 is not well placed either. }

{ Here White's only interesting attempts are  9.O-O  (the main move by far)   and  9.Na3.  Taking on d4 is harmless and already tends to favour Black. There alternatives are discussed in the dedicated chapter on the Alapin. }
9. O-O Be6
{ The bishop on b3 is White's best piece, so this approach is very logical for sure. Now the traditional main line is   10.Bxe6  , but this is considered completely harmless nowadays.   The focus has shifted to  10.Na3  , continuing in gambit style. }
10. Na3 Bxb3 11. axb3 dxc3
{ Here we need to improve on the World Champion's play. Magnus played  11...a6  against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the St. Louis blitz tournament , but this fails to equalize after the clever  12.Nxd4  Nxd4  13.Be3 !  Nf5  14.Qxd6  Nxd6  15.Bxb6.  White had some annoying pressure that we should avoid by playing 11... dxc3. After the capture on c3 White struggles to prove compensation. }
12. Qe2 a6
{ We need to prevent Nb5 and thus keep the knight on a3 offside. I don't think White has enough compensation here, and the engines agree. }

If White plays anything even less active, we have an easy game with either ...Bg4 or a ...g6 based setup.   An interesting way to look at this position is to compare it with Alekhine's Defence. See  1.e4  Nf6  2.e5  Nd5  3.d4  d6  4.Nf3  Nc6  - in our position the c-pawns are missing and therefore the only challenging move c4 is out of the picture. }
7. Bc4 Nb6 8. Bb5 Bd7
{ Black's main line is actually  8...dxe5  ,  but the bishop move has gained some momentum recently and was successfully employed by the World Champion, so it is an obvious choice. One key advantage over 8... dxe5 is that Black retains more chances to play for a win. }
9. exd6 e6 10. Bg5 f6 11. Bh4 Bxd6 12. Nc3 Nb4
{ A useful regrouping. We don't mind a bishop trade, as this would help us to control the light squares, in particular the one in front of the IQP: the d5-square. }

2. d4 cxd4 3. c3
{ The Smith-Morra Gambit. This line is basically extinct on the professional level , but quite frequently seen in amateur games. White may also play  3.Nf3  here , after which  3...Nc6  just leads us to a normal position.   You could also investigate the tricky  3.Nf3  a6 !?  , hoping for  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5 !  , but I don't think it is worth the effort to learn , as this move order is extremely rare. }
3... Nf6
{ Magnus has faced the Morra only once , in a game when he was 11 years old. Back then he played the questionable reply  3...Nc6  , which does not help us in choosing a line.  I am therefore going for a practical approach to recommend 3... Nf6, which transposes to the Alapin - 2. c3.   Of course you can argue that this is not the 'punishment' White deserves after having played a slightly dubious gambit. If you want to take the pawn and invest some time studying this , I recommend the Chessable course by Logozar on how to 'Mop up the Morra'. Logozar recommends  3...dxc3  4.Nxc3  Nc6  5.Nf3  e6  6.Bc4  Nge7  , which is challenging for White.  Actually my main argument for transposing to the Alapin is that you might be able to get more by taking the pawn, but it is not an easy single line to learn, but takes some effort.If you use this course to include the Sicilian to your repertoire, easy solutions to sidelines make a lot of sense - you will already have a lot on your plate with the mainlines. At a later stage, or when you know you will face the Morra in an important game, you can still add the Morra accepted to your repertoire. }
4. e5 Nd5
{ And we have transposed to the Alapin , usually arising after  1.e4  c5  2.c3  Nf6  3.e5  Nd5  4.d4  cxd4. }

2. Nc3
{ White just develops the knight to its most natural and best square. This move does not yet tell you what White's intention is. He might play a setup like the closed Sicilian with g3 next or the Grand Prix with f4.The other point of playing 2. Nc3 first, might be to ask Black about his intentions. It is important to note that White still is able to play 3. Nf3 or 3. Nge2 and switch to an open Sicilian. We play 2... Nc6, as this fits perfectly with our open Sicilian of choice.But what if we wanted to play the Najdorf or the Dragon ? Then 2... d6 would be the move to play, avoiding to be tricked into an open Sicilian that is not part of the repertoire. After 2... d6 White has gained some options, for example after 3. f4  (Grand Prix Attack)  . No problem at all for us, but other Sicilian players need to worry about move orders after 2. Nc3. }
2... Nc6
{ We are not worried about a switch to an open Sicilian, as ...Nc6 fits perfectly with the Sveshnikov. After   3.Nge2  Nf6  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  we would transpose into our line of choice.  It also should be mentioned that being able to play 2... Nc6 is very useful, as this allows us to play more ambitiously against many of the offbeat lines. One key point is that the move ...d5 is often possible in one go, compared to ... d6 first.After 2... Nc6 White has a wide choice. With 3. Nge2 or 3. Nf3 he can still try to play an open Sicilian, but there are some independent possibilities. The most important ones are the closed Sicilian after 3. g3 and the Grand Prix Attack after 3. f4. Both systems are popular on the club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. Bb5
{ This is one of the 'nameless' variations in chess, as far as I am aware. It is quite a decent line for White actually and scores quite well. One of the reasons for the score is that Black often fails immediately here on move 3. Similarly to the Grand Prix Attack after   1.e4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.f4  g6  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Bb5  White intends to capture on c6, which Black should prevent immediately. }
3... Nd4
{ Very important ! If you don't play that move, White will take on c6 and get a good game with d3 and f4, in the style of the Grand Prix Attack. }
4. Bc4 Nf6
{ This is the move order Magnus chose when he faced this line. There is nothing wrong about starting with  4...e6  first - in general our setup consists of ...Nf6, ...e6 and ...a6. }
5. Nge2 e6 6. O-O a6
{ This is a very important move  ! There is a trap after the natural  6...d5 ?  , after which  7.exd5  exd5  8.Nxd5 !  Nxd5  9.Nxd4  cxd4  10.Qh5  Be6  11.Re1  leads to a huge advantage for White because Black can't simultaneously defend the d5-knight and deal with the threat of Bb5+. 6... a6 takes control over the b5-square, after which we are ready for ...d5. }
7. a4 d5 8. exd5 exd5 9. Nxd5
{ Now 9. Nxd5 ? does not work ! White should play a modest move like   9.Ba2  , but that's not very worrisome. }
9... Nxd5 10. Nxd4 cxd4 11. Qh5 Be6 12. Re1 Nf4
{ Now Black is winning, because Bb5+ is not possible. This is the key reason for inserting the a-pawn moves. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Nc3
{ White just develops the knight to its most natural and best square. This move does not yet tell you what White's intention is. He might play a setup like the closed Sicilian with g3 next or the Grand Prix with f4.The other point of playing 2. Nc3 first, might be to ask Black about his intentions. It is important to note that White still is able to play 3. Nf3 or 3. Nge2 and switch to an open Sicilian. We play 2... Nc6, as this fits perfectly with our open Sicilian of choice.But what if we wanted to play the Najdorf or the Dragon ? Then 2... d6 would be the move to play, avoiding to be tricked into an open Sicilian that is not part of the repertoire. After 2... d6 White has gained some options, for example after 3. f4  (Grand Prix Attack)  . No problem at all for us, but other Sicilian players need to worry about move orders after 2. Nc3. }

Both systems are popular on the club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. g3
{ White opts for the closed Sicilian, usually aiming at a slow, but complicated battle with most pieces and pawns staying on the board for a while. Quite often White aims at a kingside expansion including the moves f4 and even g4 at a later stage. The closed Sicilian is a solid choice for White, but not all that dangerous for us if we know some lines and general concepts. }
3... g6
{ Playing ...g6 to emphasize control over the dark squares, like d4, is certainly very logical. Magnus has played this main line on many occasions, therefore it is a clear cut choice for us.I'd like to point out a small detail. There is the line 2. d3 Nc6 3. g3, covered in the chapter on move two sidelines. In this case I prefer to play a quick ...d5, because White still has the option to play a pawn to c3 to control d4 and blunt the bishop. This is not possible here for White, or only while losing time with moves like a later Ne2. }
4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 d6 6. f4 e5
{ White plays f4 immediately, usually planning to combine this move with Nf3 and a later kingside expansion. Against 6. f4, just as against the other setups, Black does not need to play the Botvinnik setup with ...e5, but has multiple good options, in particular setups with ...e6. Still I decided to be consistent and recommend playing 6... e5 here as well. }
7. Nf3 Nge7 8. O-O exf4
{ The perfect timing for this move  ! If you play  8...O-O  instead , White has  9.f5 !  gxf5  10.Nh4  with a dangerous attack. }
9. Bxf4 O-O
{ Black is fine in this position. The long diagonal is opened and a ...b5 play is very natural next. }

4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 d6 6. Be3

6... e5 7. Qd2 Nd4
{ Black has also employed  7...Be6  successfully.  Both 7... Nd4 and 7... Be6 look equally attractive to me. After 7....Nd4 White has tried a range of moves, all related to the idea to play c3 soon. }
8. Nd1 Ne7 9. c3 Ne6

We see a similar approach in the line  1.e4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.Bb5  , when Black should also play  3...Nd4  ,  before White gets to capture on c6. }
6. O-O a6 7. Bd3 d6
{ This is a bit better than  7...e6  ,  because the threat of ...Bg4 encourages the following sequence. }
8. Nxd4 cxd4 9. Ne2 Nf6
{ The knight is more actively placed here than on e7. It puts some pressure on e4 and might have a good spot after Nf6-d7-c5 in some scenarios. Note that White can't take on d4 because of   10.Nxd4  Qb6. }

1. e4 c5
{ Hello and Welcome to 'Fight like Magnus: The Sicilian'! This opening course provides you with a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Sicilian Defense. I am a bit reluctant to write 'Defense', because in the Sicilian you don't intend to defend all that much, but rather want to 'fight fire with fire'!In the Sicilian Black immediately breaks the symmetry on move one, making it an ideal weapon to unbalance the game and play for a win. In the main lines of the Sveshnikov Black frequently sacrifices material to drum up an attack on the white king, which is fun to play and tricky for White to handle. If you are looking for an active and ambitious opening for Black, you are studying exactly the right course.  As the title suggests our repertoire choices are based on the opening play of the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Through his whole career Magnus has mostly relied on two moves against 1. e4: the symmetrical   1...e5   and  1...c5  ,  the Sicilian. Over the years the mix between the two moves shifted back and forth. 1... c5 was a frequent choice in his younger years, but he played it less after he became World Champion in 2013. This changed in 2018, when Magnus returned to the Sicilian, making it his main weapon in his title match against Fabiano Caruana. In this match  (including the tiebreak)  (Magnus played seven games with the black pieces, and all of them featured the Sicilian. He managed to win the rapid game in the tiebreak after drawing all six classical time control games in the regular match.)  As of today  (Nov 11, 2019)  Magnus Carlsen has not lost a single Sicilian in Classical time control not only since this match, but even since 2011! Admittedly, he did not play it that frequently between 2011 and 2018, but still a very impressive run.I am mentioning non-losing streaks, but what about wins ? Magnus has won many attractive games with the Sicilian, some of which are included as model games in this course. Alright, back to our repertoire concept. I have compiled a full repertoire for Black, based on the World Champion's repertoire. This means that any major choice should be according to games that Magnus has played, showing his belief in the merit of the line. This works well with most lines, but some rarer continuations never featured in the World Champion's games, so I selected lines that matched the structure and spirit of the overall repertoire.There are some cases where I suggest to improve on Magnus' play. I only do that if thorough engine-assisted analysis suggests that my alternative is significantly better or preserves more winning chances, while being of equal quality. You have to take into account that he has played the opening not only in Classical time controls, but also in Rapid and Blitz games. It is perfectly possible that he plays a second-tier move in a Blitz game, because he does not want to show his main preparation or simply forgot the line. In those cases it makes sense to not blindly copy all moves, but see if there is room for improvement. These cases are rare, though - he knows his stuff, of course !This course consists of 12 main chapters and this 'Quickstarter Guide'. The 'Quickstarter Guide' is a selection of the 40 variations that you should learn first to get a full overview of the Sicilian. It has all the information that you need to play it in your games, as the most frequently played lines are selected. It also features extensive explanations about ideas and concepts, serving as an introduction to the typical middle games. I suggest to learn the Quickstarter Guide first, then go through the individual chapters one by one, deepening your knowledge. }
2. Bc4
{ This move is rare and quite harmless, but you should know why. The problem with the bishop development at this particular moment is that Black is not yet committed to any central setup. We have not moved any pawn besides the c-pawn, and are able to fight against the bishop with a quick ...e6 and ...d5 approach. Note that in the English opening with 1. c4 e5 Black is frequently developing his bishop to c5, but only after White has played g3 first. Black is happy to play 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 Bc5, but after 3. Nf3 usually avoids 3... Bc5 due to 4. e3 !.   It is also useful to compare to  2.a3  g6  ,  after which White goes for Bc4 after having 'provoked' ...g6 first. }
2... Nc6
{ Starting with  2...e6  and then 3... Nc6 etc. is also fine and should transpose to 2... Nc6. }
3. Nf3 e6
{ This prepares ...d5 and blunts the bishop on c4. I'd like to mention that in the coming variations I am frequently advising to actually avoid or delay this move for the sake of creating more combative positions. Black equalizes with a quick ...d5, but the positions might not be everybody's cup of tea, in particular if you want to imbalance the game. }
4. O-O
{ You also also meet  4.d3   or  4.Nc3  ,  which most likely should lead to 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 or 4. O-O Nf6 5. Nc3, examined later. }
4... Nf6
{ Black also has  4...d5  ,  leading to similar positions as after 1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. d4 d5. This is a fine alternative to 4... Nf6, which intends to pose more problems. We will manage to play ... d5 with a useful tempo on the bishop, but White may allow something even better for us. }
5. Nc3 Nxe4
{ This motif is well known, mostly from the open games after 1. e4 e5. It works nicely in our favour. }
6. Nxe4 d5 7. Bd3 c4 8. Bxc4 dxe4
{ Black has a good game, because White now has to retreat the knight to the passive square e1. }

The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9.

{ White sometimes goes for a delayed Morra, which makes no difference to the Morra played one move earlier. }
4... Nf6 { I suggest to transpose to the Alapin this way. } 5. e5 Nd5
{ And we have transposed to the main line of the Alapin -  1.e4  c5  2.c3.  I discuss some alternatives against the Morra via the proper 2. d4 Morra move order,  (so please see variation #31 of move 2 sidelines for more information.) }

3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nf3
{ One of the rarely played sidelines, but it turned out to be not so easy to handle in the analysis. I ultimately found a good way to play, but there are some pitfalls in other lines. }
6... Bb4
{ The natural move with many purposes. It pins the knight, indirectly attacks e4, prepares castling - all at the same time. }
7. Bd3 { This is played more often than  7.Bc4  , but easier to handle. } 7...
Bxc3+
{ I recommend to just enter an improved version of the 7. Bc4 line, with the bishop on the more passive d3-square. Black may also play differently, for instance with   7...d5  , but a consistent approach makes sense in my opinion. }
8. bxc3 d6
{ Black has good chances due to White's ruined pawn structure. The pawns on the c-file will be eternally weak. }

At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nf3
{ One of the rarely played sidelines, but it turned out to be not so easy to handle in the analysis. I ultimately found a good way to play, but there are some pitfalls in other lines. }
6... Bb4
{ The natural move with many purposes. It pins the knight, indirectly attacks e4, prepares castling - all at the same time. }
7. Bc4
{ This is the most challenging move. White recognizes that taking on e4 is not that easy for Black and plays the bishop to the most active square. }
7... Bxc3+
{ Taking on e4 is risky due to Qd5 ideas. Instead I recommend a line that focuses on White's damaged pawn structure. }
8. bxc3 Qa5
{ The idea of this move is to keep White busy with the defence of c3, but also prevent early Ba3 moves. }
9. O-O O-O
{ This seems best. After  9...Qxc3  White has the amazing  10.Qd3 !  , which is not easy at all to anticipate. Black easily equalizes after  10...Qxd3  , but I couldn't find an advantage. }

{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }

It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }

{ This move is better than some other sideline options on move 6, but still not very threatening. White's development is sluggish and we have no problems setting up an active position. }
6... Bc5 { Why not develop this to an active square before playing ...d6 ? } 7.

{ I like this prophylactic move, giving the bishop a useful retreat square on a7. }
9. O-O O-O

{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov.

3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nf5 { This would be quite strong, if it wasn't for the only good reply. }
6... d5
{ Very important to remember ! If you don't play this, you are in trouble because White's knight is extremely annoying on f5. Compare this with 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3, when this piece is on the edge of the board. }
7. exd5 { White's only move to keep the game equal. } 7... Bxf5 8. dxc6 bxc6
{ 8...Qxd1+  does equalise as well ,  but 8... bxc6 keeps a bit more tension in the game. I don't think you need to know much more about 6. Nf5, but there is one more concrete line that merits attention. }
9. Qf3 Qd7 { Please avoid  9...Qc8  10.Ba6 ! } 10. Bc4
{ White is offering the c2-pawn with this move. } 10... Bxc2
{ I think we should take this pawn. It's not possible to keep the material, but White will lose time with regaining his investment. }
11. O-O { Instead  11.Qe2  Bg6  12.Qxe5+  Be7  will lead to the same thing. }
11... Be7 12. Qe2 Bg6 13. Qxe5 O-O 14. Rd1 Qb7
{ Black is fine here. We have active pieces and the white queen might be a liability on e5. Moves like ...Rfe8 or ...Ng4 are on the cards. }

The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9.

6. Nb3
{ This is a common retreat square for the d4-knight after being hit by ...e5 in the Sicilian, but in the Sveshnikov Black is still able to play with ...Bb4, contrary to popular lines like   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  a6  6.Be2  e5  6.Nb3  for example. }

7. Bd3 d5
{ In the comparable position with 6. Nf3 played instead of 6. Nb3 I recommend to take on c3 and play ...d6 next, aiming against the weakened White pawn structure. This is also possible here, but White has an early f4 available here, which I think gives White more options for counterplay, for example after   7...Bxc3+  8.bxc3  d6  9.O-O  O-O  10.f4.  This is playable of course, but I liked 7... d5 more in this position. }
8. O-O
{ Rarely played , but not bad. The idea is to answer  8...Bxc3  with  9.exd5 !  and White keeps equality. He gets a better version of 7. Bd3 d5 8. exd5. }
8... d4

Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nb3
{ This is a common retreat square for the d4-knight after being hit by ...e5 in the Sicilian, but in the Sveshnikov Black is still able to play with ...Bb4, contrary to popular lines like   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  a6  6.Be2  e5  6.Nb3  for example. }
6... Bb4
{ An excellent, multi-functional move. We pin the knight, attack e4, develop and prepare castling. }
7. Bd3 d5
{ In the comparable position with 6. Nf3 played instead of 6. Nb3 I recommend to take on c3 and play ...d6 next, aiming against the weakened White pawn structure. This is also possible here, but White has an early f4 available here, which I think gives White more options for counterplay, for example after   7...Bxc3+  8.bxc3  d6  9.O-O  O-O  10.f4.  This is playable of course, but I liked 7... d5 more in this position. }
8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O { White plays in gambit mode, but it is not enough. } 9...
Nxc3 10. bxc3 Bxc3 11. Rb1
{ White keeps the material investment down to a pawn, but I don't see enough compensation for White. }
11... O-O 12. Qh5 g6 13. Qh6 Qe7
{ And Black does not need to be unduly worried here. } *

{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }

{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years.

It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe.

However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nb3
{ This is a common retreat square for the d4-knight after being hit by ...e5 in the Sicilian, but in the Sveshnikov Black is still able to play with ...Bb4, contrary to popular lines like   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  a6  6.Be2  e5  6.Nb3  for example. }
6... Bb4
{ An excellent, multi-functional move. We pin the knight, attack e4, develop and prepare castling. }
7. Bg5 { This counter-pin is harmless. } 7... h6 8. Bxf6 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qxf6
{ White is worse here due to the pawn structure. He does not even have the bishop pair as a compensation. }

{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter.

A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Nb3
{ This is a common retreat square for the d4-knight after being hit by ...e5 in the Sicilian, but in the Sveshnikov Black is still able to play with ...Bb4, contrary to popular lines like   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  a6  6.Be2  e5  6.Nb3  for example. }
6... Bb4
{ An excellent, multi-functional move. We pin the knight, attack e4, develop and prepare castling. }
7. Bc4 O-O 8. Bg5 { White plays for a counter-pin to cover the e4-pawn. } 8...
h6 9. Bh4 Bxc3+
{ Please avoid a line like  9...g5  10.Bg3  Nxe4  11.Qd3  , when  11...Nxg3  12.Qg6+  is more than embarrassing  ! }
10. bxc3 d6
{ Black is very comfortable here. The pawn structure is clearly favourable for Black and the bishop on h4 is offside and does not put any pressure on us. Next ...Qe7 and ...Be6 is a good way to proceed. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov.

In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6
{ After 6... d6 White has tried some offbeat lines to avoid the main variations   7.Nd5   and  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5. }
7. Be3
{ This looks quite odd , but this position has quite often occurred via a different move order.  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  e6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nc6  5.Nb5  d6  6.Bf4  e5  7.Be3  Nf6  8.N1c3  and we have reached the same thing , just using 8 moves instead of  7. You only need to remember one point to be fine. }
7... a6 8. Na3 Rb8
{ This is the point to remember. You can play  8...b5  immediately , but  9.Nd5  requires some precision to answer.  After the prep move 8... Rb8 it is not obvious what White should play. }
9. Nd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Ne7
{ This looks similar to the 7. Nd5 line, but the knight is misplaced on a3 and ...Nf5 with come with a hit on the bishop. }
11. c4 Nf5 12. Bd2 Be7
{ And Black is fine in this common structure. We will castle next and have ...Nh4 and ...f5 on the agenda. }

8. f3 Be6 9. Bc4 a6
{ This is useful to control b5  (there are ...Na5 ideas)  and prepare the pawn push. This position is yet untested, but White's ideas are limited. After something slow we play ...b5 and answer Bd5 with ...Rc8 or ...Qd7. White's knights look really silly in such a scenario. }
10. Bb3 { This frees up c4 for the offside knight. } 10... Na5
{ Black is fine here. Note that White has a standard idea in Bg5 and Bxf6 next to increase control over d5. This concept also lost some bite after f3 is on board, as the dark squares are weakened a lot after the bishop is traded. }

{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6. Sveshnikov and mostly Gennadi Timoshenko used their innovation successfully and quite quickly the variation was taken up by some more Russian players, most notably the winners of the World Junior Championships Valeri Chekhov, Sergei Dolmatov and Artur Jussupow, all students of the legendary chess trainer and author Mark Dvoretsky.Since these early days almost all of the World Champions and World Championship challengers have played the Sveshnikov  (or Chelyabinsk variation, as it is often called in Russia)  regularly or on occasion. We can list Kasparov, Anand  (occasionally)  , Kramnik, Topalov, Gelfand, Caruana and of course Magnus Carlsen employing the Sveshnikov on the highest level and even during World Championship clashes, as seen in the Carlsen-Caruana Match in London 2018.Now, what is so great about the Sveshnikov Variation ? At the early days of the Sveshnikov Black's weak d5-square and backward d-pawn were thought to be too much to handle - why has this assessment changed ? I think this actually needs to be explained combining some general points and some concrete lines. After 5... e5 White needs to move the knight and concrete lines show that the only challenging move is 6. Ndb5. In this chapter we will examine why 6. Nb3, 6. Nf3 etc. at best lead to equality for White, often less than that.   After  6.Ndb5  d6  is best, after which White has the option to enter the line 7. Nd5, as examined in a dedicated chapter. However, after  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5  we have to state that Black's structural problems - the d5-square and the d-pawn - are already solved. Only very recently this line has seen some new ideas for White, making it more interesting for White to try. Still Black retains fair chances, usually utilizing the pawn majority on the kingside.   The two other main lines of the Sveshnikov start after  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5.  Before we look at those concrete lines, I need to mention how important the bad position of the a3-knight is. White has lost quite a bit of time already with this piece and will move it again more often than not, trying to connect it with the d5-square. All these time losses with the knight make the position viable for Black. Just imagine the knight would be on e3 instead of a3 - this would be a terrible position for Black.   Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.  The evaluation of the Sveshnikov depends on the theoretical state of the earlier mentioned 7. Nd5 and these two traditional main lines. In both lines Black gains the bishop pair, which is a great asset to have that early in the game.   Now , the line  8...b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is White's more strategic choice, trying to exploit the static advantages - control over d5, d-pawn. We will see that Black is able to fight for control over d5, but in many cases does not need to focus on that. Often ignoring the knight and starting play with ...f5 or/and even on the queenside is possible. One point to understand is that it is almost impossible for White to BOTH use the d5-square and build up pressure on the d-file. A knight on d5 plugs the d-file, so White is not just attacking d6 and wins this pawn later. In fact the 'weak' d6-pawn almost never gets lost in any Sicilian.  White also has the line 9. Bxf6 gxf6   forced , because  9...Qxf6  10.Nd5  Qd8  11.c4  is too bad  10. Nd5.  In this line the play is more dynamic, because Black will play ...f5 quickly and tries to completely take over the centre. The position opens up, which is excellent for Black's bishop pair. Quite quickly tactics will become an important factor and the knowledge of concrete lines is more essential than in any other line of this repertoire.  Before we continue to examine the sidelines, I'd like to mention one very important aspect of the Sveshnikov. Black very frequently will play the move ...f5, starting play in the centre and on the kingside. Black has a central pawn majority since move 3 and ...f5 will even try to remove the e4-pawn to set the central pawn mass in motion.Contrary to Sicilians without ...e5, Black's play is mostly in the centre and on the kingside, while Black's king is perfectly safe. In lines like the Dragon or the Najdorf Black often loses due to mating attacks, which almost never happens in the Sveshnikov, quite the contrary. In some lines we have to abandon the queenside in order to throw the kitchen sink towards White's king, going for Checkmate ! This is an important practical consideration that often allows Black to score points from objectively dubious positions. }
6. Ndb5 d6
{ After 6... d6 White has tried some offbeat lines to avoid the main variations   7.Nd5   and  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5. }
7. a4
{ This move prevents ...b5 and therefore intends to support the knight to get back into the centre via c4. }
7... a6 8. Na3 Bg4
{ The merits of this cheeky bishop move were fully appreciated in the later 1990s. 7. a4 was never a problem for Black, but 8... Bg4 was the end of this line as a try for an advantage. }
9. f3 Be6
{ The move f3 does not help White at all. It weakens the dark squares, which becomes particularly relevant after White trades his bishop against the knight on f6, which is a common idea. }
10. Bc4 Rc8 11. O-O Ne7
{ This is a novelty , suggest by LeelaZero. The usual move  11...Nb4  is also fine for Black ,  but potentially moving the knight closer to the white king via g6 and f4 is interesting. Black is also ready to play ...d5, of course. }
12. Nd5 { Just one possible move of many. White stops ...d5. } 12... Bxd5 13.
exd5 g6
{ And I like Black here. We have ...h5 coming, possibly ...h4 and ...Nh5 next. The e7-knight has f5 available as well. White's prospects in such a structure are on the queenside, but the pieces on c4 and a3 are not helping in pushing the pawn majority forward. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ This is the first chapter of this course on the open Sicilian after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4. Against the open Sicilian Magnus Carlsen's main choice is the Sveshnikov Variation. After   3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  that starting position of this variation arises. In this chapter we will examine odd lines before this starting position even arises , and more importantly sideline in the Sveshnikov itself. The Sveshnikov has three main lines:   the first one arises after  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  , which has become fashionable in the last year.   The second one is  5...e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  , which settles Black with doubled f-pawn early on.  The third option is to play  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  , after which Black plays  9...Be7  , avoiding the doubled pawns.  These three main lines are looked at in the next 5 chapters - 7. Nd5, 9. Bxf6 sidelines, 9. Bxf6 mainline, 9. Nd5 sidelines and 9. Nd5 mainline - while all other lines in the Sveshnikov, and the open Sicilian in general, are examined in this chapter. They are all sidelines for a reason, but still useful to study. In particular on the junior/amateur level it is not a given that players on the white side go for the critical lines. If you study the sidelines, you will have no problems whatsoever and often Black is getting the better game early on. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Nowadays this name of the variation is widely accepted , but there have been many other names over the years. It was first used in a top level game by World Champion Emanuel Lasker against Carl Schlechter in 1910 , but Schlechter played the uncritical  6.Nb3  and Lasker obtained a good game easily.  It was quite quickly figured out that 6. Ndb5 should be critical, and for a long while the structural weaknesses in Black's position were considered to be too severe. It took almost 50 years to put this line back on the map, when Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik found some new ideas for Black. They mostly investigated   6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  Be6  and  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.Na3  d5  , lines that still seen today occasionally.  So in the late 1960s the move 5... e5 would be called the start of the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik-Variation.  Then in the early 1970s Evgeny Sveshnikov and some fellow master players from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk discovered that Black should play 8... b5, rather than 8... Be6.

Back to the real position: after  8...b5  Black threatens ...b4, which leaves White with the choice between  9.Nd5  , usually followed by  9...Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6   or  8...b5  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5.

6. Ndb5 d6

7. Bg5 a6 8. Bxf6
{ This is the only possible deviation from  8.Na3  b5  , when White chooses between the two absolute main lines of the Sveshnikov ,  9.Bxf6   and  9.Nd5. }
8... gxf6 9. Na3 b5
{ I recommend to play this move, simply transposing to the main line usually reached via 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6. You don't have to transpose, though. Black has a good alternative in   9...f5  ,  which is regarded as a slight improvement by many theoreticians, compared to just transposing with 9... b5.  I checked 9... f5, but I am not convinced that it is better than the main lines. It is actually a rather complicated affair with many lines to study, and the benefit is not entirely clear to me. So my practical advice is to simply transpose into the main line with 9... b5, which is covered in chapters 4 and 5. }

{ The 7. Nd5 variation has never been considered particularly threatening for Black, but recently there have been new developments putting this line back into the limelight. Fabiano Caruana played it four times against Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship Match, showing some new ideas for White. Carlsen ultimately scored well, but he still experienced problems in these games. Black's reply is completely forced, so let's discuss the concepts of this line after the forced moves. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ Here Black obviously has 8... Ne7 and 8... Nb8 to choose from. Magnus has played both moves, so it is tough to make a choice here. I ultimately went for 8... Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. c4

Nd5 line has been a sideline for many years, only recently the new idea of playing 9. a4 has posed new problems for Black.That being said, the move 9. c4 makes a lot of sense. It gives the knight a natural square on c3 to return to and prepares the advance of the queenside majority. Black will set his kingside majority in motion as well, playing...f5 is on the agenda soon. }
9... Be7
{ Black will play the moves ...Be7,...O-O and ...f5, but ...Nd7 and ...a6 are part of the setup as well. Black may start his play with either ...Be7, ...a6 or ...Nd7, and it will usually lead to the same thing, as ultimately all moves mentioned above will be on board.In the 9. a4 line the move order is important, as you need to be precise with the timing of the move ...a6, here it does not matter all that much. I suggest to start with 9... Be7 and castle next, doing it in the same way as after 9. a4. After 9... Be7 White usually chooses between developing the bishop to e2 or d3, but there is the independent possibility 10. c5. }
10. Bd3
{ Here  10.Be2   and  10.Bd3  are about equally popular.  With 10. Bd3 White usually has a setup with f3 in mind, stopping Black's coming pawn duo on e5 and f5. White might also play with f4, but this plan works better with the bishop on e2 instead of d3. }
10... O-O 11. O-O a6
{ This is the right timing for this move. After  11...f5  White would have the irritating move 12  c5.  We have seen this idea before, but here it is a bit stronger than in the earlier case, because ...f5 makes little sense in the structure after  12.c5  a6  13.Nxd6  Bxd6  14.cxd6  Qxd6. }
12. Nc3 f5 13. f4
{ White has also tried this move frequently, but it is just a worse version compared to the line starting with 10. Be2. I'll just show one line and recommend to check the 10. Be2 line for more information about this structure. }
13... Nd7 14. Kh1 g6 15. Be3 Bf6 16. Rc1 exf4 17. Bxf4 Be5
{ This is an important point to know. Black should not place the knight on e5, blocking the bishop. It is better to play the bishop to e5 and use the knight differently. It may still go to e5 AFTER the trade of bishops or find a good spot on c5.Note that the bishop on d3 is misplaced here, which is why the f4-plan is more popular after 10. Be2. The bishop on d3 will often be attacked by the knight and might also be in the way of the queen. After a bishop trade d4 could be a good square for the white queen. }

Be7 White usually chooses between developing the bishop to e2 or d3, but there is the independent possibility 10. c5. }
10. Bd3
{ Here  10.Be2   and  10.Bd3  are about equally popular.  With 10. Bd3 White usually has a setup with f3 in mind, stopping Black's coming pawn duo on e5 and f5. White might also play with f4, but this plan works better with the bishop on e2 instead of d3. }
10... O-O 11. O-O a6
{ This is the right timing for this move. After  11...f5  White would have the irritating move  12.c5.  We have seen this idea before, but here it is a bit stronger than in the earlier case, because ...f5 makes little sense in the structure after  12.c5  a6  13.Nxd6  Bxd6  14.cxd6  Qxd6. }
12. Nc3 f5 13. f3
{ White stops the advance ...e4. White almost always plays the f-pawn here, but he has also tried slow moves like Kh1 at this point. Against this or other slowish moves we should continue with useful moves like ...Nd7, ...g6 and ...Bf6. This prepares ...e4 in the optimal way. }
13... Nd7
{ It makes a lot of sense to play ...Bg5 against White's Bd3/f3 setup. White has excellent control over e4, so it is unlikely that Black will play ...e4 anytime soon to use the bishop on f6. Therefore trading this piece or at least activating it on g5 is useful. Now White needs to decide how to deal with Black's idea to play ...Bg5. He may play Be3, preserving the bishop on the f2-square. The alternative is to play a universally useful move like Kh1 and after ...Bg5 just accept the trade. }
14. Be3 Bg5 15. Bf2
{ White may also play a move like 15. Qd2, but this is just a slightly worse version of the bishop trade line starting with 14. Kh1. }
15... Qf6
{ This is the most popular move for Black. It didn't struck me as particularly logical or obvious, until I realized that it actually stops b4 for the moment. }
16. Qc2 { This move protects the knight on c3 and thus prepares b4. } 16... Nc5
17. Be2 a5 { We need to stop b4 after we decided to place the knight on c5. }
18. Na4
{ This looks best for White. Against something slow we have useful moves like ...Bd7, ...Rae8 and ...Qh6, ultimately aiming to push ...e4 and/or attack on the kingside. }
18... Nxa4 19. Qxa4 e4
{ Black is fine here. The position opens up and gets tactical now, so you could continue to analyse, but I decided to stop here, as it is already rather a deep line. }

Fabiano Caruana played it four times against Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship Match, showing some new ideas for White. Carlsen ultimately scored well, but he still experienced problems in these games. Black's reply is completely forced, so let's discuss the concepts of this line after the forced moves. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ Here Black obviously has 8... Ne7 and 8... Nb8 to choose from. Magnus has played both moves, so it is tough to make a choice here. I ultimately went for 8... Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.

It gives the knight a natural square on c3 to return to and prepares the advance of the queenside majority.

20. Be2 Nb8

10... O-O 11. O-O a6

12. Nc3 f5

{ 13...Nd7  is also fine and will lead to the same position.   Please note that  13...exf4  14.Bxf4  Qb6+  15.Kh1  Qxb2  is a huge blunder due to  16.Na4. }

16. Be3 exf4 17. Bxf4 Be5
{ This is an important point to know. Black usually should not place the knight on e5, blocking the bishop. It is better to play the bishop to e5 and use the knight differently. It may still go to e5 AFTER the trade of bishops or find a good spot on c5. In general Black has scored well in these structures. White is still not making any substantial progress on the queenside while Black enjoys an excellent piece on e5 and good prospects on the dark squares in general. }

11... f6

14. O-O-O Rd8
{ The idea is to play ...b6 next, intending either ...Qb7 or ...Bb7 to finally push the knight back from b5. After a knight retreat we get the queenside pawns into motion. It's a complicated game with chances for both sides. }

{ Here Black obviously has 8... Ne7 and 8... Nb8 to choose from. Magnus has played both moves, so it is tough to make a choice here. I ultimately went for 8... Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. a4
{ This is the current fashion, started by games in the Carlsen-Caruana match. White's idea is to react to a later ...a6 with Na3 and ideally get the moves a5 and Nc4 in, establishing a strong position on the queenside. This ambitious approach will often lead to sharp games, because it takes time that Black can use to bring pieces to the kingside and play for checkmate ! This type of play is often easier for Black to conduct, as your play smashing through is the end of the game. If White wins on the queenside, it might be troublesome, but it is not a knockout and you might be able to strike back on the kingside. }
9... Be7
{ It is important to get the move order right against 9. a4. It is especially important to not play ...a6 early on, as White is happy to play Na3, intending to play Nc4 and a5 next. This type of queenside bind is strategically very desirable for White and should be avoided. }
10. Be3
{ This is rare, but not bad at all. The bishop puts some pressure on the queenside, but note that White is not yet threatening to take the pawn on a7, as we can take the piece on a7 with the rook and have ...Qa5+ available next. }
10... Nd7
{ It is important to start with this move , as after  10...O-O  White plays  11.a5  and you are in trouble  ! }

We are quickly developing and prepare a swift ...Nd7 and ...Rc8 for natural development of the queenside. The bishop will often drop back to g6 later, preparing the common ...f5 push.

I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. a4
{ This is the current fashion, started by games in the Carlsen-Caruana match. White's idea is to react to a later ...a6 with Na3 and ideally get the moves a5 and Nc4 in, establishing a strong position on the queenside. This ambitious approach will often lead to sharp games, because it takes time that Black can use to bring pieces to the kingside and play for checkmate ! This type of play is often easier for Black to conduct, as your play smashing through is the end of the game. If White wins on the queenside, it might be troublesome, but it is not a knockout and you might be able to strike back on the kingside. }
9... Be7
{ It is important to get the move order right against 9. a4. It is especially important to not play ...a6 early on, as White is happy to play Na3, intending to play Nc4 and a5 next. This type of queenside bind is strategically very desirable for White and should be avoided. }
10. Be2
{ This was Caruana's choice in the World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen in two games. It always has been the most popular move at this point, but Caruana has shown some new ideas for White. }
10... O-O 11. O-O Nd7
{ As mentioned several times in the lines after 9. a4: don't play ...a6 too early, but rather wait until White lost time to prepare the move a5, usually by playing Bd2. After   11...Nd7  the immediate  12.a5  makes little sense , as after  12...a6  the knight needs to retreat to c3, which does not fit all that well with the 9. a4 idea.  I'd like to mention that instead of 11... Nd7 Black also has tried   11...f5  , and in fact this was played once by the World Champion as well. This looks like a good alternative if you want to vary your play. }
12. Be3
{ A natural move, but it does not harmonize all that well with White's queenside plans, as we will see. }

14. Nc4 a5

15. Be3 { A slower approach compared to the immediate push of the f-pawn. }
15... b6
{ This is important to play. With Be3 White introduced the idea to take on c5, possibly followed by d5-d6. This should be stopped and ...b6 does the job. Now White needs to find a plan. In my mind f4 still looks like the most logical play, but this would basically lead to the line 15. f4 with a tempo down for White - Be3-f4 in two moves. Against slower ideas we have moves like ...f5 and ...Bd7, starting kingside play. It's a very interesting position with chances for both sides. }

15... exf4 16. Bxf4 f5
{ At first glance Black's position might look a bit suspect. Compared to similar scenarios we don't have active pieces on f6 and e5, like Bf6 and Ne5 or vice versa. The bishop on e7 is passive and not easily improved as it needs to cover the d6-pawn. Black has a good way to play, as demonstrated by the World Champion. }
17. Bd3
{ Certainly not the only move for White, but others are met with the same plan that now follows. }
17... b6 18. Qe2 Ba6
{ The point ! Black just wants to take the knight on c4, getting rid of the pressure on the d6-pawn. After that our bishop can be improved to f6 or g5. Note that after the capture on c4 the white bishop might come to b5 later, which looks very annoying at first. We have a good plan, though: just play ...Ra7-e7 to activate the rook. The bishop on b5 always looks at the e8-square, but we are able to 'play around it'. }
19. Nxb6
{ White decides to change the course of the game by this tactic. After this we get some mass simplifications and a likely draw. If you like to avoid this you could investigate 18... Ra7 as a waiting move, playing ...Ba6 soon after. This also looks completely fine to me. }

I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside.

After   11...Nd7  the immediate  12.a5  makes little sense , as after  12...a6  the knight needs to retreat to c3, which does not fit all that well with the 9. a4 idea.  I'd like to mention that instead of 11... Nd7 Black also has tried   11...f5  , and in fact this was played once by the World Champion as well. This looks like a good alternative if you want to vary your play. }
12. b4
{ This novelty was played in game 10 of the World Championship Match, deviating from 12. Bd2, which was played just 3 days earlier in game 8. Magnus did not react in the most precise way, but the game was still very complicated and unclear and ended in a draw. Black's play can be improved, as we will see shortly.An amazing fact is that at the time of writing, about 10 months after the move's debut in London, it has not ever repeated just once. It is not clear to me or other annotators why this is the case. Black seems to be alright, but there is no clear reason why White seems to have abandoned the idea after just a single outing. }
12... a6 13. Na3 b6
{ This is the suggested improvement on Magnus Carlsen's move  13...a5.  After  14.bxa5  Rxa5  15.Nc4  Ra8  16.Be3  f5  17.a5  f4  they reached a sharp battle that ended in a draw. Engines show that White should be better in these complications , but it is tough to play and the game ultimately ended in a draw.  This type of play is important to understand: even if something goes slightly wrong on the queenside Black will have counterplay on the kingside and this is often easier to handle for Black. White's king is at stake and he might get nervous or make a costly mistake. Still we should try to improve with 13... b6, which slows down White first before taking further action. }
14. Nc4 f5
{ This is Anish Giri's main line in his analysis. He states that  14...a5  should be avoided , as  15.bxa5  bxa5  16.Bd2  leaves the a-pawn too weak. I checked this a bit and agree. It is not terribly bad for Black, but still playing 14... f5 looks better. }
15. Rb1
{ I'll take this as an example for a 'slow move', just to show the idea for Black. }
15... f4
{ This stops f4 by White and now I am unsure what White should do next. I don't see a clear way to open up the queenside, but Black has the simple plan to shift pieces to the kingside and play for mate. This scenario should be compared to the line 12. Bd2 a6 13. Na3 a5, as it happened in the game Svidler-Grischuk. }

Fabiano Caruana played it four times against Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship Match, showing some new ideas for White. Carlsen ultimately scored well, but he still experienced problems in these games. Black's reply is completely forced, so let's discuss the concepts of this line after the forced moves. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ Here Black obviously has 8... Ne7 and 8... Nb8 to choose from. Magnus has played both moves, so it is tough to make a choice here. I ultimately went for 8... Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. a4
{ This is the current fashion, started by games in the Carlsen-Caruana match. White's idea is to react to a later ...a6 with Na3 and ideally get the moves a5 and Nc4 in, establishing a strong position on the queenside. This ambitious approach will often lead to sharp games, because it takes time that Black can use to bring pieces to the kingside and play for checkmate ! This type of play is often easier for Black to conduct, as your play smashing through is the end of the game. If White wins on the queenside, it might be troublesome, but it is not a knockout and you might be able to strike back on the kingside. }
9... Be7
{ It is important to get the move order right against 9. a4. It is especially important to not play ...a6 early on, as White is happy to play Na3, intending to play Nc4 and a5 next. This type of queenside bind is strategically very desirable for White and should be avoided. }
10. Be2
{ This was Caruana's choice in the World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen in two games. It always has been the most popular move at this point, but Caruana has shown some new ideas for White. Besides 10. Be2. }
10... O-O 11. O-O Nd7
{ As mentioned several times in the lines after 9. a4: don't play ...a6 too early, but rather wait until White lost time to prepare the move a5, usually by playing Bd2. After   11...Nd7  the immediate  12.a5  makes little sense , as after  12...a6  the knight needs to retreat to c3, which does not fit all that well with the 9. a4 idea.  I'd like to mention that instead of 11... Nd7 Black also has tried   11...f5  , and in fact this was played once by the World Champion as well. This looks like a good alternative if you want to vary your play. }
12. b4
{ This novelty was played in game 10 of the World Championship Match, deviating from 12. Bd2, which was played just 3 days earlier in game 8. Magnus did not react in the most precise way, but the game was still very complicated and unclear and ended in a draw. Black's play can be improved, as we will see shortly.An amazing fact is that at the time of writing, about 10 months after the move's debut in London, it has not ever repeated just once. It is not clear to me or other annotators why this is the case. Black seems to be alright, but there is no clear reason why White seems to have abandoned the idea after just a single outing. }
12... a6 13. Na3 b6
{ This is the suggested improvement on Magnus Carlsen's move  13...a5.  After  14.bxa5  Rxa5  15.Nc4  Ra8  16.Be3  f5  17.a5  f4  they reached a sharp battle that ended in a draw. Engines show that White should be better in these complications , but it is tough to play and the game ultimately ended in a draw.  This type of play is important to understand: even if something goes slightly wrong on the queenside Black will have counterplay on the kingside and this is often easier to handle for Black. White's king is at stake and he might get nervous or make a costly mistake. Still we should try to improve with 13... b6, which slows down White first before taking further action. }
14. Nc4 f5
{ This is Anish Giri's main line in his analysis. He states that  14...a5  should be avoided , as  15.bxa5  bxa5  16.Bd2  leaves the a-pawn too weak. I checked this a bit and agree. It is not terribly bad for Black, but still playing 14... f5 looks better. }
15. f4
{ Giri ends his analysis at this point and does not suggest a follow-up for Black. Before I show my proposed reply I need to mention that 15. f4 looks active and logical, but he might also play something slow instead. }
15... a5
{ I suggest to play this only now, after f4 is on the board. This makes a huge difference, as we will see. }
16. bxa5 { This seems less testing than  16.c3. } 16... bxa5
{ Without f4 on the board White has a Bd2/Qe1 idea to put pressure on a5, which is not possible anymore with all the play going on in the centre. }
17. Bd2 exf4 18. Bxf4 Ba6
{ Black is completely fine here. It is useful to compare this position to the line 12. Kh1 a6 13. Na3 Nc5 14. Nc4 a5 - line #17. In this line we reach a position similar to the one on the board, but with pawns being on b2 and b6. This difference favours Black, as it is rather the white queenside now that is weakened. }

{ This was Caruana's choice in the World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen in two games. It always has been the most popular move at this point, but Caruana has shown some new ideas for White. Besides 10. Be2. }
10... O-O 11. O-O Nd7
{ As mentioned several times in the lines after 9. a4: don't play ...a6 too early, but rather wait until White lost time to prepare the move a5, usually by playing Bd2. After   11...Nd7  the immediate  12.a5  makes little sense , as after  12...a6  the knight needs to retreat to c3, which does not fit all that well with the 9. a4 idea.  I'd like to mention that instead of 11... Nd7 Black also has tried   11...f5  , and in fact this was played once by the World Champion as well. This looks like a good alternative if you want to vary your play. }
12. Bd2
{ The World Championship Match between defending Champion Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana started with three Rossolimo Sicilians when Caruana had White. He got absolutely nowhere, and in the 8th game he finally went for the open Sicilian. This line with 12. Bd2 was the preparation of team Caruana. White intends to play a5 next, allowing the knight tour Nb5-a3-c4. }
12... a6
{ As mentioned before: in the 9. a4 line only play this if White has already spend a move on Bd2. Magnus actually played   12...f5  here - see model game #2 -  but I'd like to suggest a different approach that was introduced later. It is quite clear that after the match the whole line was examined in detail and responses are more refined than what Carlsen was playing over the board. Of course 12... f5 is not a terrible move, but I feel my suggestion fits better with the other lines in the 9. a4 complex that I selected for the repertoire. }
13. Na3 a5
{ We are stopping the advance a5, just like we do in other similar cases. It should be noted that   13...b6  instead is bad due to  14.a5  b5  15.c4  , and the queenside is falling apart. }
14. f4 exf4
{ I am sticking with a familiar plan , but here the non-standard computer suggestion  14...Nb6  also deserves consideration. }
15. Bxf4 Nc5
{ We have seen this type of position more than once in this repertoire. Here White is not yet committed to c4 with the knight, which makes a difference to the line 12. Kh1 a6 13. Na3 Nc5 14. Nc4 a5 15. f4 exf4 16. Bxf4 - line #18. }
16. Nb5
{ From here the knight might use the d4-square, but we will see it is not such a big deal. }
16... f5
{ Boris Gelfand played  16...Ne4  instead in a recent game  (March 2019)  against Gregori Oparin, but going ...f5 is more in line with other setups that we play. }
17. Kh1 b6 18. Nd4 Bf6
{ We have seen this setup before. It turns out that Nc6 does not bother us at all. }
19. Nc6 Qc7 20. c3 Bd7 { Black has equal chances in a complicated position. } *

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5
{ The 7. Nd5 variation has never been considered particularly threatening for Black, but recently there have been new developments putting this line back into the limelight. Fabiano Caruana played it four times against Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship Match, showing some new ideas for White. Carlsen ultimately scored well, but he still experienced problems in these games. Black's reply is completely forced, so let's discuss the concepts of this line after the forced moves. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ Here Black obviously has 8... Ne7 and 8... Nb8 to choose from. Magnus has played both moves, so it is tough to make a choice here. I ultimately went for 8... Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. a4
{ This is the current fashion, started by games in the Carlsen-Caruana match. White's idea is to react to a later ...a6 with Na3 and ideally get the moves a5 and Nc4 in, establishing a strong position on the queenside. This ambitious approach will often lead to sharp games, because it takes time that Black can use to bring pieces to the kingside and play for checkmate ! This type of play is often easier for Black to conduct, as your play smashing through is the end of the game. If White wins on the queenside, it might be troublesome, but it is not a knockout and you might be able to strike back on the kingside. }

14. Nc4 b6 15. f4 { Another version of the f4-plan. } 15... exf4 16. Bxf4 Nc5
{ Black is fine here, as this is the same position type as after 12. Kh1 a6 13. Na3 Nc5 14. Nc4 a5 15. f4 exf4 16. Bxf4 - line #18. Here White has played Bd2 first, then Bxf4, so this can't be a better version of the mentioned line. }

Svidler showed a later part of this game on video, and only mentioned that he made some mistakes in the opening. I wonder if he is already referring to this position or a later stage. I already like Black here, if only for practical reasons: it's more fun to attack the king ! }

Nb8, because I felt this is somewhat easier to handle, but it is largely a matter of taste.   The critical line after  8...Ne7  is  9.c4  Ng6  10.Qa4  Bd7  11.Qb4  , after which Magnus has played  11...Qb8   and  11...Bf5  , which allows White to repeat with  12.Qa4  Bd7  , if he is happy with a draw.  The knight on g6 often gives White the opportunity to play a quick h4, intending to push the pawn to h5 and kick the knight away.  This type of game is more concrete and requires more memorization than 8... Nb8, which was a point in favour of the retreat to b8. I need to mention that this is not a passive retreat, but rather the attempt to send the knight later to the flexible d7-square. From d7 you may transfer it to the centre or kingside. Black basically all the time will play ...Be7, ...O-O and ...f5 to expand on this side of the board, while White tries to exploit his space advantage on the queenside. The knight may transfer to f6 or even e5 later, which often happens after Black has played his e-pawn to e4 or White played f4 to trade his f-pawn for e5, freeing up this square for a black minor piece.   After  8...Nb8  White's traditional main line is  9.c4  ,   but Caruana's choice  9.a4  has gained some momentum and needs to be checked carefully.   Other moves don't pose too many problems objectively , but the moves  9.Qf3   and  9.Qd3  ,  both intending Qc3 and Qa3 ideas, have trick potential and the best reply should be studied. }
9. a4
{ This is the current fashion, started by games in the Carlsen-Caruana match. White's idea is to react to a later ...a6 with Na3 and ideally get the moves a5 and Nc4 in, establishing a strong position on the queenside. This ambitious approach will often lead to sharp games, because it takes time that Black can use to bring pieces to the kingside and play for checkmate ! This type of play is often easier for Black to conduct, as your play smashing through is the end of the game. If White wins on the queenside, it might be troublesome, but it is not a knockout and you might be able to strike back on the kingside. }
9... Be7
{ It is important to get the move order right against 9. a4. It is especially important to not play ...a6 early on, as White is happy to play Na3, intending to play Nc4 and a5 next. This type of queenside bind is strategically very desirable for White and should be avoided. }
10. Be2
{ This was Caruana's choice in the World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen in two games. It always has been the most popular move at this point, but Caruana has shown some new ideas for White. Besides 10. Be2. }
10... O-O 11. O-O Nd7
{ As mentioned several times in the lines after 9. a4: don't play ...a6 too early, but rather wait until White lost time to prepare the move a5, usually by playing Bd2. After   11...Nd7  the immediate  12.a5  makes little sense , as after  12...a6  the knight needs to retreat to c3, which does not fit all that well with the 9. a4 idea.  I'd like to mention that instead of 11... Nd7 Black also has tried   11...f5  , and in fact this was played once by the World Champion as well. This looks like a good alternative if you want to vary your play. }
12. Bd2
{ The World Championship Match between defending Champion Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana started with three Rossolimo Sicilians when Caruana had White. He got absolutely nowhere, and in the 8th game he finally went for the open Sicilian. This line with 12. Bd2 was the preparation of team Caruana. White intends to play a5 next, allowing the knight tour Nb5-a3-c4. }
12... a6
{ As mentioned before: in the 9. a4 line only play this if White has already spend a move on Bd2. Magnus actually played   12...f5  here - see model game #2 -  but I'd like to suggest a different approach that was introduced later. It is quite clear that after the match the whole line was examined in detail and responses are more refined than what Carlsen was playing over the board. Of course 12... f5 is not a terrible move, but I feel my suggestion fits better with the other lines in the 9. a4 complex that I selected for the repertoire. }
13. Na3 a5
{ We are stopping the advance a5, just like we do in other similar cases. It should be noted that   13...b6  instead is bad due to  14.a5  b5  15.c4  , and the queenside is falling apart. }
14. c3 f5 15. b4 f4
{ This was played in the rapid game P.Svidler-A.Grischuk, Amsterdam 2019. I think this is a very instructive moment. Black stops f4 by White and gains more space on the kingside, having an attack on White's king in mind. Svidler showed a later part of this game on video, and only mentioned that he made some mistakes in the opening. I wonder if he is already referring to this position or a later stage. I already like Black here, if only for practical reasons: it's more fun to attack the king ! }
16. f3 Bh4
{ This is an idea worth keeping in mind. The bishop is often able to sacrifice itself with ...Bg3 and ...Qh4 next. }
17. Nc4 Rf6
{ Instead  17...Bg3  18.hxg3  fxg3  19.Be1  just about holds for White. After the rook move we get a strong attack. I'll just show why a5 can't be taken now. }
18. Nxa5 Qb6+ 19. Kh1 Rh6 { This attack is already winning for Black. } 20. Be1
Qd8 21. h3 Nf8
{ A great move ! Black might win with others as well, but this is brutal. We will play ...Bg3 next and ...Ng6-h4 and ...Qg5 will be devastating. }

{ The 7. Nd5 variation has never been considered particularly threatening for Black, but recently there have been new developments putting this line back into the limelight. Fabiano Caruana played it four times against Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship Match, showing some new ideas for White. Carlsen ultimately scored well, but he still experienced problems in these games. Black's reply is completely forced, so let's discuss the concepts of this line after the forced moves. }

This in particular applies to the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.Bd3  , which is the subject of the subsequent chapter.   In this chapter we will examine other lines after  9.Bxf6  , most importantly  9...gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.c3  ,  which is the second main sub-branch of the 9. Bxf6 line, besides the 11. Bd3 line. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. g3
{ White goes for one of the better sidelines. Black will get a fine position, but White usually does not get in trouble early on. }
11... f5
{ Instead  11...Ne7  is not bad either, but 11... f5 is sharper and sets a small trap later. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the Queen is still able to take on d5. }
12. Bg2
{ White tries to establish the Bishop on e4, but this is not a stable post. }
12... fxe4 13. Bxe4 Be6
{ Here   13...O-O  is a mistake since now after  14.Ne3!  we're forced into a piece placement that makes  ...f5  much more difficult to achieve.  In comparison, after   13...Be6  14.Ne3  Qd7  leads to a much more harmonious position. }
14. O-O
{ This is harmless and leads to positions very similar to 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Bg2 Be6 14. c3 O-O 15. Nc2, but with Black being a tempo up. }
14... O-O 15. c3 f5

11. c4
{ A sharp alternative to the mainlines. Similarly to  11.Bd3  Ne7  12.Nxe7  Qxe7  13.c4  White attacks the Black Queenside Pawns and we have no good alternative to sacrificing the b-pawn. As usual Black gets excellent compensation and quite often manages to win attractive attacking games.  The resulting positions are much easier to handle for Black, in particular if you know what to do. In many cases White does not, because if he had known that after 11. c4 he's be on the defensive the whole time he wouldn't have played into the line in the first place. After perfect play White is still OK after 11. c4, but you will not encounter that against a human opponent. }
11... f5
{ We have to give up the b-pawn. As mentioned several times throughout the course, taking on c4 is always  (99. 9% of the time)   bad in such a structure. On very few occasions  ...b4  is playable , but this is not one of them , as  11...b4  12.Nc2  a5  13.Nce3  is terrible for Black. We are happy to sacrifice the pawn , luring the c-pawn away from the centre. }
12. Bd3
{ Rare at this point, but not a bad move. After it you have a wide range on possibilities, but I simply recommend to try to transpose to the 11. Bd3 Ne7 main line. There is nothing significantly stronger and the likelihood that White plays 11. c4 and then knows the ins and outs of the massive main line is about zero. }

Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c4
{ A sharp alternative to the mainlines. Similarly to  11.Bd3  Ne7  12.Nxe7  Qxe7  13.c4  White attacks the Black Queenside Pawns and we have no good alternative to sacrificing the b-pawn. As usual Black gets excellent compensation and quite often manages to win attractive attacking games.  The resulting positions are much easier to handle for Black, in particular if you know what to do. In many cases White does not, because if he had known that after 11. c4 he's be on the defensive the whole time he wouldn't have played into the line in the first place. After perfect play White is still OK after 11. c4, but you will not encounter that against a human opponent. }
11... f5
{ We have to give up the b-pawn. As mentioned several times throughout the course, taking on c4 is always  (99. 9% of the time)   bad in such a structure. On very few occasions  ...b4  is playable , but this is not one of them , as  11...b4  12.Nc2  a5  13.Nce3  is terrible for Black. We are happy to sacrifice the pawn , luring the c-pawn away from the centre. }
12. cxb5 Nd4 13. bxa6 { Very greedy ! } 13... O-O
{ White was threatening the annoying Bb5+, so we could not take on e4 just yet. }
14. exf5
{ Otherwise we take on e4, getting a massive central Pawn mass. In any case Black has more than enough for the material after White has taken on a6. }
14... Qa5+ 15. Nc3 d5
{ Black has a great attack that White probably won't be able to defend against in a practical game. There is no normal way to develop the Kingside and castle anymore. }
16. Bb5 Bxa6 17. Bxa6 Qxa6
{ This is a typical scenario. White's King is stuck in the middle of the board. }

The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. Qh5 Ne7 { White stopped ...f5, so this is the right move. } 12. Nxe7 Qxe7
13. c3
{ Here  13.Bd3  can be answered by  13...d5  ,  as examined in the next chapter via the move order 11. Bd3 Ne7 12. Nxe7 Qxe7 13. Qh5 d5. }
13... Qb7
{ This move is perfectly fine for Black , but a little bit unusual for this line. Of course I checked the more normal looking  13...f5  , but after  14.exf5  I was not able to make the complications work. Compared to similar lines after 11. Bd3 we lack a crucial tempo with ...e4. That being said, the Queen move makes a lot of sense. We attack e4 and prepare ...d5 and/or ...f5. }
14. Bd3 f5
{ The whole 11. Qh5 line is rather rare, so we don't have any game examples. The analysis shows Black is fine here. }
15. exf5
{ The sharpest line and the one with a critical moment to happen soon. } 15...
Qxg2 16. O-O-O Bf6
{ This is the only move that works for Black ! The reasoning is that the Queen should stay on g2 for the moment to cover the diagonal and prevent Be4, but at the same time Rhg1 was the threat. Of course now ...Qg5+ is on the agenda as well. This is still an interesting position to analyse, but I'll stop here, given that 11. Qh5 is not played often. }

10. Nd5 Bg7

In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }

Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the Queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. g4
{ 'No ... f5 for you !' - White stops the-f-pawn, but weakens his position a lot in the process. In particular ...Qh4 can be an annoying move for him to face. First of all we have a good opportunity on the Queenside that we should use. }
15... b4
{ A strong resource that we need to keep in mind. This move is strong here and even more so against 15. a4. The idea is to either get the d4-square after cxb4 or to get the centre into motion after Nxb4, which is already quite bad for White. }
16. Nxb4 { Probably even worse than  16.cxb4. } 16... Nxb4 17. cxb4 e4
{ And ...d5 next sets the central steamroller in motion. White is in terrible shape here. }

The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the Queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. Bd3
{ A natural and popular move, angling for piece play against the centre and Kingside, often connected with Qh5. }
15... f5
{ After our natural move  15...f5  we have the final split in this chapter , when White now chooses between  16.O-O  ,   16.Qh5   and  16.Bc2.  The play in similar in these lines , but we need to check some concrete lines. }
16. Qh5 e4 { The f5-pawn was attacked and this gains a tempo, an easy reply. }
17. Bc2 Ne7
{ We are fighting for control over  d5  , a common theme.  17...f4  instead looks tempting , but White has  18.Bxe4 !  ,  when White attacks h7 with decisive effect. }
18. Nf4 Bf7 19. Qg5 Ng6 20. Qxd8 Rfxd8
{ Black has a fine position after the Queen trade. With the Bishop pair as a long term asset I'd rather be Black here. }

{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three.    This in particular applies to the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.Bd3  , which is the subject of the subsequent chapter.   In this chapter we will examine other lines after  9.Bxf6  , most importantly  9...gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.c3  ,  which is the second main sub-branch of the 9. Bxf6 line, besides the 11. Bd3 line. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the Queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. Bd3
{ A natural and popular move, angling for piece play against the centre and Kingside, often connected with Qh5. }
15... f5
{ After our natural move  15...f5  we have the final split in this chapter , when White now chooses between  16.O-O  ,   16.Qh5   and  16.Bc2.  The play in similar in these lines , but we need to check some concrete lines. }
16. Qh5 e4 { The f5-pawn was attacked and this gains a tempo, an easy reply. }
17. Bc2 Ne7
{ We are fighting for control over  d5  , a common theme.  17...f4  instead looks tempting , but White has  18.Bxe4 !  ,  when White attacks h7 with decisive effect. }
18. Rd1 Nxd5
{ Black mostly plays  18...b4  here, an idea that we will also employ after the trade. Trading first on d5 is a bit easier to play, I think. In any case Black has no problems at all. }
19. Nxd5 b4
{ A strong idea ! Black is happy to take on c3 next or play   20.cxb4  Bxb2  ,   so the only critical move could be  20.Nxb4  ,  but we didn't just blunder the pawn on b4. }
20. Nxb4 a5 21. Nd5 Rb8 22. Bb3 a4 23. Bxa4 Rxb2
{ And White has to worry about equality here. Next we have ...f4 on the agenda. }

Na3 b5 9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three.    This in particular applies to the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.Bd3  , which is the subject of the subsequent chapter.   In this chapter we will examine other lines after  9.Bxf6  , most importantly  9...gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.c3  ,  which is the second main sub-branch of the 9. Bxf6 line, besides the 11. Bd3 line. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the Queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2
O-O 14. Nce3 Be6
{ A very natural sequence so far. White has gotten his problem piece back in the centre and now needs to make a decision how to proceed. By far White's most popular move is  15.Bd3  , but there are some offbeat tries worth checking. }
15. Bd3
{ A natural and popular move, angling for piece play against the centre and Kingside, often connected with Qh5. }
15... f5
{ After our natural move  15...f5  we have the final split in this chapter , when White now chooses between  16.O-O  ,   16.Qh5   and  16.Bc2.  The play in similar in these lines , but we need to check some concrete lines. }
16. O-O
{ In some of the sharp lines White does not manage to castle, so this solid move is certainly a reasonable choice. }
16... e4
{ We usually play ...e4 in these lines in reply to Qh5, so we will choose a similar approach here. Note that   16...f4  fails to  17.Qh5   and  16...Ne7  is refuted by  17.Nxe7+  Qxe7  18.Bxf5 !  , which amounts to a disaster as well. }
17. Nf4 { The only move, otherwise we'd have ... f4 next. } 17... Bf7 18. Bc2
Be5
{ As played by Magnus Carlsen , so we'll follow the Champion's example. Black has some decent alternatives here , like  18...Qd7   and  18...Qg5. }
19. Nfd5 Qg5
{ I suggest to play this move instead of Carlsen's  19...Kh8.  He got into some trouble against V.Topalov in Abidjan 2019. He still won this Blitz game quickly after Topalov misplayed it soon after.  The move 19... Qg5 is the recommendation of both the engines and the correspondence players and looks attractive, so we'll go for it. Our threats are now ...f4 and ...Bh5. }
20. f4
{ A case of 'What else ?'. White needed to do something about our mentioned ideas. }
20... exf3 21. Qxf3 Bh5
{ White has  22.Qf2   and  22.Qh3  now. Both lead to extremely tactical positions that are fine for Black , but I am not sure how deep I should cover these complications , given that we are already on move 21 and some lines easily run until move 35  (!)  (.)  This sounds crazy, but if you look at the whole sequence starting from 11. c3 our moves are the only ones or clearly the best ones almost the whole time, so this lines is extremely relevant from a theoretical point of view. I'll show some variations from here, but won't go all the way. You can easily add your own analysis if you feel you need more information. }
22. Qh3 f4
{ Surprisingly White has half a dozen playable moves here. In such a sharp position this is quite unusual. I'll check three of them. }
23. Qd7 { Well, you need to check 'Mate in one'-threats ! } 23... Ra7 24. Qxc6
fxe3 25. Rxf8+ Kxf8 { In this position White needs to find the way to draw ! }
26. Qc8+ { This is better for Black, but not yet winning. } 26... Kg7 27. Qh3
e2 28. Qe3 Qxe3+ 29. Nxe3 b4
{ White has a tough defensive task, but we need to look any deeper to prove if he can still draw. }

(.)  This sounds crazy, but if you look at the whole sequence starting from 11. c3 our moves are the only ones or clearly the best ones almost the whole time, so this lines is extremely relevant from a theoretical point of view. I'll show some variations from here, but won't go all the way. You can easily add your own analysis if you feel you need more information. }

Na3 b5 9. Bxf6
{ White has three mainlines in the Sveshnikov:   6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5,  6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5   and this one, which is by far the sharpest and most tactical line of the three.    This in particular applies to the line  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.Bd3  , which is the subject of the subsequent chapter.   In this chapter we will examine other lines after  9.Bxf6  , most importantly  9...gxf6  10.Nd5  Bg7  11.c3  ,  which is the second main sub-branch of the 9. Bxf6 line, besides the 11. Bd3 line. }
9... gxf6
{ This is forced. Black can't capture with the queen , because after  9...Qxf6 ?  10.Nd5  Qd8  White has many lines to give him a huge advantage. The brutal  11.Bxb5   and  11.c4  are terrible for Black.  A good comparison to make: look at the very popular mainline 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6  (covered in 2 chapters of this course)  , in which Black has the bishop on f6, while after 9... Qxf6 ? 10. Nd5 Qd8 it is on f8 !So long story short: take with the g-pawn and look forward to playing ...f5 even twice, if possible. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Black has two good moves in this position, the more traditional 10... f5 and the newer move 10... Bg7, the so-called Novosibirsk variation. Both lines have some overlap, because   10...Bg7  does only delay ...f5 for the moment. The main difference between the two lines is how the reply  11.Bd3  is handled. In the Novosibirsk you play  11...Ne7  to get rid of the Knight immediately ,   an approach that is clearly not possible after  10...f5  11.Bd3  , when  11...Ne7  12.Nf6#  is a bit of a problem.   Instead after  10...f5  11.Bd3  ,  11...Be6  is the move , which leads to completely different positions compared to the Novosibirsk.   Our repertoire choice is quite easy , as the World Champion has always played  10...Bg7  ,  as far as I can see. After 10... Bg7 White has two main tries for an advantage. The first one and the sharpest line is 11. Bd3 which we examine in the subsequent chapter. The second approach is to simply play  11.c3  , after which  11...f5  12.exf5  Bxf5  leads to a position that is often reached via 10... f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5. This line leads to interesting play and is considered to be leading to equal chances.  It is obviously a critical line for the Sveshnikov, as White can basically force you to enter it. Even going 10... Bg7 or 10... f5 is not relevant, as you have no way to avoid it in both cases. So 11. c3 f5 is clearly the main chunk of this chapter, but we will also look a rare alternatives on move 11. }
11. c3
{ This is White's more strategic choice at this point , compared to  11.Bd3.  White intends to improve the Knight as quickly as possible. }
11... f5
{ This is a lot better than 11... Ne7. Playing ...Ne7 is much more pointed after 11. Bd3, because Black in this case immediately threatens to take on d5, forcing the pawn recapture. Therefore after 11. Bd3 Ne7 White has to take on e7, which is not the case here as the Queen is still able to take on d5. An example line would be   11...Ne7  12.Nc2  Nxd5  13.Qxd5  Rb8  14.Ne3  ,  when Black is more or less busted - you can't even get in ...f5 in the first place. }
12. exf5 { The simplest and most popular choice for White. } 12... Bxf5 13. Nc2

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. c4
{ After 13. c4 or 13. O-O O-O 14. c4 the game gets very sharp. After any c4 move by White in the Sveshnikov you need to decide what to do with the b-pawn. Taking on c4 is bad 99.9% of the time, as it helps the knight on a3 far too much. In some cases you can play ...b4, but here it would blunder the pawn due to   13...b4  14.Qa4+.  This leads to the third option to just ignore the threat to the pawn and allow White to take on b5. This is why the c4-line is the sharpest one: White will win material and Black throws the kitchen sink to claim compensation. }
13... f5
{ After  13...f5  White should play  14.O-O  and after  14...O-O  we will transpose to the mainline of this chapter - line #34 and further. Other moves are bad , ranging from dubious to downright losing  ! }
14. cxb5
{ A somewhat naive move, but it has been played once by a 2650 GM. Black is now immediately crashing through with a standard move. }
14... d5 { Of course ! We have ...Qb4+ lined up and e4 is attacked twice. } 15.
O-O fxe4 16. Bc2 Bb7

O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. c4
{ After 13. c4 or 13. O-O O-O 14. c4 the game gets very sharp. After any c4 move by White in the Sveshnikov you need to decide what to do with the b-pawn. Taking on c4 is bad 99.9% of the time, as it helps the knight on a3 far too much. In some cases you can play ...b4, but here it would blunder the pawn due to   13...b4  14.Qa4+.  This leads to the third option to just ignore the threat to the pawn and allow White to take on b5. This is why the c4-line is the sharpest one: White will win material and Black throws the kitchen sink to claim compensation. }
13... f5
{ After  13...f5  White should play  14.O-O  and after  14...O-O  we will transpose to the mainline of this chapter - line #34 and further. Other moves are bad , ranging from dubious to downright losing  ! }
14. Qh5
{ This queen sortie is the main line with 13. O-O O-O inserted, but with the king still being on e1 this is a huge blunder ! }
14... d5
{ This is why you play the Sveshnikov ! Now ...Qb4+ is the threat, but the pawns on c4 and e4 are attacked twice as well ! White is completely lost already. }
15. cxd5 fxe4
{ This is how the famous game L.Psakhis-A. Vaisser, Paris 1990 ended. Psakhis, a two-time Soviet Champion, resigned here. }

Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3.

{ Compared to  13.c4  or 14. c4 this is the slower approach. White intends to improve the knight via c2-e3. }
13... f5
{ What else ? You could actually castle first and ...f5 next move, but the rule of thumb to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves is useful to have. }
14. Nc2
{ The logical follow-up. White may also castle here, but other moves don't convince. }
14... O-O
{ This is not that popular, but I see no reason why. Most of the time White will now castle as well, transposing into the line 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,  (which is part of our repertoire anyway - see lines #23-26.)  Instead of my recommendation 14... O-O Black most often plays   14...Qb7  ,  which seems fine as well. I just felt that we save a bit of workload with 14... O-O, as it mostly transposes as mentioned. }
15. Ne3
{ This is a logical move to avoid a transposition to lines starting with 13. O-O O-O. Black seems fine, though. }
15... f4 16. Nd5
{ At first it look like White has achieved his goal and should be fine, but he lacks one or two tempi to be coordinated. }
16... Qg5 { This is the move that justifies Black's play. } 17. O-O
{ This move is actually better than it looks at first sight. } 17... Bh3 18. g3
{ Forced , as  18.Qf3  fails miserably. } 18... Kh8
{ Yes, you can take the exchange, but White has some compensation on the light squares. With the king move we prepare later attacks with ...f5, which is particularly attractive after White saves the rook with Re1, leaving the f-file. I prefer this less materialistic approach to grabbing material, but you may also check out   18...Bxf1.  The engines give Black a small advantage in both cases. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7

12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }

18. h4 Qd8 19. g4

19... f5 { It still works, in very instructive fashion actually. } 20. gxf5

22. Bxe4 Re8 23. f3 b4

{ The logical follow-up. White may also castle here, but other moves don't convince. }
14... O-O
{ This is not that popular, but I see no reason why. Most of the time White will now castle as well, transposing into the line 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,  (which is part of our repertoire anyway - see lines #23-26.)  Instead of my recommendation 14... O-O Black most often plays   14...Qb7  ,  which seems fine as well. I just felt that we save a bit of workload with 14... O-O, as it mostly transposes as mentioned. }
15. O-O { This accepts the transposition to 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5 15. Nc2. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }

White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }

14. c3 f5

{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. Qf3 f5
{ After 13. O-O O-O we will play ...f5 next, basically no matter what White does. }
15. c4
{ This is probably White's best move here, but it transposes to 14. c4 f5 15. Qf3. }
15... d5
{ Always good fun to play this attractive move ! We have transposed to 14. c4 f5 15. Qf3 d5 now. Please see line #34 and further for details. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qf3 { White's main tries for an advantage are  15.Qh5  and this move. }
15... d5
{ We have seen this idea multiple times , so this should not come as a great surprise. In this particular case we can't play  15...fxe4  16.Qxe4  with a double threat, so ...d5 is played first in order to make ...fxe4 possible. }

O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qf3 { White's main tries for an advantage are  15.Qh5  and this move. }
15... d5
{ We have seen this idea multiple times , so this should not come as a great surprise. In this particular case we can't play  15...fxe4  16.Qxe4  with a double threat, so ...d5 is played first in order to make ...fxe4 possible. }
16. cxd5 fxe4 17. Bxe4 Rb8
{ We need to play this first. White was threatening d6, which even works after   17...f5 ?  18.d6  !.  The rook move is useful not only as prophylaxis, but also introduces active ideas into the position, in particular a rook lift with ...Rb6-h6 or to g6. Now White's most logical way to play is to support the d-pawn with a rook. Both rook moves to d1 have been tested in practice. }
18. Rfd1 Qg5
{ Unfortunately here 18... Rb6 is less convincing, compared to 18. Rad1 Rb6, which is fine. The reason is   18...Rb6  19.Rac1 !  , when  19...f5 ??  fails due to  20.Rxc8  !.  This means we need to lose more time with a move like ...Bd7, which is not great. It turns out that 18... Qg5 is fine, but it is a bit annoying that you need two different approaches. }
19. d6 Bg4 20. Qg3 Qf4 21. f3 Be6
{ Black is fine in this position, with full compensation for the pawn. We have ...f5 ready now and ...Rb6 and ...Rd8 will most likely pick up the d-pawn. }

There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }

{ I suggest this move, which is almost a novelty  (I found one older correspondence game)   and was not covered by Negi at all. If you face someone who has prepared with this book , they will be on their own from here. The traditional way to play this position is  19...d5  , after which White plays  20.Bxd5  Bxd5  21.f6  Qxf6  22.Qxd5  Rxb2  23.Nc4  and Negi concludes that White is easier to play, but Black should hold. It is the kind of position that an engine will probably never lose, but humans have a hard task once the knight comes to f5.  Our move 19... Rbd8 intends to play ...d5 without allowing the reply f6 as in the line above. The play is very sharp now, with many possibilities. }

20... d5 21. f6 Bxf6
{ This is an extremely important move to remember  ! The reply  22.Rh3  looks scary , but we are fine nevertheless.   Instead  21...Qxf6  is worse , because after  22.Rxb7  dxc4  23.Nxc4  we don't quite get enough play for the pawn.  There is a very similar line 20. Rg3 Kh8 21. Rb3, when after 21... d5 22. f6 Qxf6 gives enough compensation - the extra move ...Kh8 is very useful - and 22... Bxf6 ?? 23. Rh3 loses instantly. }
22. Rh3 Rfe8 23. Qxh7+ Kf8
{ I know it looks scary, but the dark-squared bishop covers everything ! After a future queen move to e5 or e6 the king might even go to e7. I have analyzed this position and don't see anything for White. I rather think White needs to be careful here. The knight on a3 is still bad and take a while to improve. }
24. Bxa6 { A direct tactical shot. } 24... Bxa6 25. Qh6+ Bg7 26. Qxa6
{ So White has won a second pawn, but Black is still fine. } 26... Qc5
{ Interestingly enough the engines suggest several moves for Black that are fine, but I like this best. The queen stops Nc2 and ...d4 is the next idea. You can also take on b2 with   26...Bxb2  ,  but then Nc2-e3 is coming. This is also fine by computer standards, but I like my recommendation more. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qh5 Rb8
{ We would have liked to take on e4, but   15...fxe4  16.Bxe4  is a double threat on h7 and on the rook. This explains 15... Rb8 - now we are threatening to take on e4 and then play ...f5 a second time !  The move 15... Rb8 has been tested numerous times in over the board play and correspondence chess and it looks like Black is doing fine in the hair-raising complications. I need to mention that 15... Rb8 is not the only move, though. In fact only some days before these lines were written the World Champion went for a different move: he played 15... d5 !? in the Grand Swiss Isle of Man Tournament against Russian hopeful Alexey Sarana. 15... d5 is a rare move and was probably intended as a surprise, but Sarana had done his homework and blitzed out the following moves.   15...d5  16.cxd5  Qd8  17.exf5  Qxd5  18.Rad1  e4  19.Bxb5  Qxf5  20.Qxf5  Bxf5  21.Bd7  Bxd7  22.Rxd7  Bxb2  23.Nc4.  Now, this sequence is in fact clearly best play after 15... d5 and the resulting position I don't want to recommend, even though Magnus played the line. Black is very close to equality, but it's a grovel and not fun at all. Magnus ultimately drew the game after some unpleasant moments. Maybe HE kept his cool, but I would have been concerned ! In any case, I don't want to play for two results just yet if a win is not among them. }
16. exf5
{ A more or less forced decision. Otherwise we take on e4 and play ...f5 next. }
16... e4 17. Rae1
{ We attacked both the bishop on d3 and the pawn on b2, so White needs a tactical solution. }
17... Bb7 18. Re3
{ This move was recommended by GM P.Negi in his GM Repertoire 1. e4 series, which is a very important source for ambitious players on the white side on the open Sicilian. We definitely need a good antidote to this move. }
18... bxc4 19. Bxc4 Rbd8
{ I suggest this move, which is almost a novelty  (I found one older correspondence game)   and was not covered by Negi at all. If you face someone who has prepared with this book , they will be on their own from here. The traditional way to play this position is  19...d5  , after which White plays  20.Bxd5  Bxd5  21.f6  Qxf6  22.Qxd5  Rxb2  23.Nc4  and Negi concludes that White is easier to play, but Black should hold. It is the kind of position that an engine will probably never lose, but humans have a hard task once the knight comes to f5.  Our move 19... Rbd8 intends to play ...d5 without allowing the reply f6 as in the line above. The play is very sharp now, with many possibilities. }
20. Rh3 h6 21. Rb3
{ This time White has provoked ...h6 first and then goes for the f6-based play. }
21... Kh7
{ This position we examine via the move order 20. Rg3 Kh8 21. Rh3 h6 22. Rb3 Kh7 - line #45. Here 22... d5 is also possible, but the king move is a simpler solution. White can force this position anyway. }

Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13.

O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qh5 Rb8
{ We would have liked to take on e4, but   15...fxe4  16.Bxe4  is a double threat on h7 and on the rook. This explains 15... Rb8 - now we are threatening to take on e4 and then play ...f5 a second time !  The move 15... Rb8 has been tested numerous times in over the board play and correspondence chess and it looks like Black is doing fine in the hair-raising complications. I need to mention that 15... Rb8 is not the only move, though. In fact only some days before these lines were written the World Champion went for a different move: he played 15... d5 !? in the Grand Swiss Isle of Man Tournament against Russian hopeful Alexey Sarana. 15... d5 is a rare move and was probably intended as a surprise, but Sarana had done his homework and blitzed out the following moves.   15...d5  16.cxd5  Qd8  17.exf5  Qxd5  18.Rad1  e4  19.Bxb5  Qxf5  20.Qxf5  Bxf5  21.Bd7  Bxd7  22.Rxd7  Bxb2  23.Nc4.  Now, this sequence is in fact clearly best play after 15... d5 and the resulting position I don't want to recommend, even though Magnus played the line. Black is very close to equality, but it's a grovel and not fun at all. Magnus ultimately drew the game after some unpleasant moments. Maybe HE kept his cool, but I would have been concerned ! In any case, I don't want to play for two results just yet if a win is not among them. }
16. exf5
{ A more or less forced decision. Otherwise we take on e4 and play ...f5 next. }
16... e4 17. Rae1
{ We attacked both the bishop on d3 and the pawn on b2, so White needs a tactical solution. }
17... Bb7 18. Qg4 Rfe8 { We need to cover e4. } 19. f3
{ A very rare move, but logical enough to check. } 19... h5
{ 19...Kh8  also looks fine , but this is a fun line. } 20. Qxh5 Bd4+ 21. Kh1
exf3 { The point of 19... h5. We are threatening ... fxg2#! } 22. gxf3 Qxe1 23.
Rxe1 Rxe1+ 24. Kg2 Rg1+ 25. Kh3 Rg7 26. f6 Bxf6

The pieces are active and there are many weak pawns that we might win back soon, like b2 and a6. Remarkably the engine evaluation is 'equal' and in correspondence chess White has not won a single game out of the 43 games in my database ! This is amazing and an almost sure sign that purely from an analytical point of view Black is fine. This is not so important in a practical game, of course, but assuring to know. As mentioned White has more than one move now, let's look at some sample lines. }

{ In this chapter we will examine the lines starting with this move. All other variations after 9. Bxf6 are covered in the previous chapter. After 11. Bd3 the game will become very sharp and tactical and Black needs to sacrifice pawns on a regular basis. In the main line of the 11. Bd3 complex we are three pawns down, but have great compensation !Of all the chapters in the whole course this is by far the one that requires move-by-move knowledge and precise calculation over the board. There is very little strategic content or 'plans' to guide you, it's just two sides engaging in a fight with clubs - and you better make sure to bring a huge club, meaning excellent preparation. It is definitely possible to work out some of the complications over the board, but this will be much more likely to be successful if you once had known them. It sounds odd, but it is true: study time is never wasted, even if you feel you have forgotten everything.The way to do it is to not try to remember as hard as you can, but rather think on your own and hope that you subconsciously piece it together. This works much better than sitting there and wrecking your brain to recall concrete lines.One important point that also needs to be mentioned: Black is the side on the attack after 11. Bd3. If White only has vague knowledge about the complications he is very likely just getting killed quickly. If you screw something up, it might be bad in computer terms... but you still have chances, given the enormous activity that Black usually enjoys. }
11... Ne7
{ The only good move after 11. Bd3. The bishop move prevents ...f5 and we need to get rid of the d5-knight right away. }
12. Nxe7
{ White's choice is limited, because with 11... Ne7 we had threatened to take on d5. As usual it's very desirable for Black to take on d5 when White needs to recapture with a pawn. }
12... Qxe7
{ After 12... Qxe7 White has two basic options. He can play c4, attacking the b5-pawn, or play c3, preparing to get the offside knight back into the game. White might play c4 or c3 right away or do it after castling kingside first. Castling is rather natural for both sides, so quite often this will be played quickly after a move of the c-pawn, for example   13.c4  f5  14.O-O  O-O   is just as common as  13.O-O  O-O  14.c4  f5.   I will examine  13.O-O  O-O  as the main line and then split the lines with  14.c4   or  14.c3.  If White starts 13. c4, it will very likely transpose to 13. O-O O-O 14. c4, as the deviations are unattractive for White.   13.c3  is a different story. After  13...f5  the sequence  14.O-O  O-O  is possible and examined via 13. O-O O-O 14. c3 f5,   but White often decides to not castle and then we will reach the only important independent line  13.c3  f5  14.Nc2  , when White's king will remain in the centre or castle queenside in some lines. Alright , let's check some moves to make things more concrete. }
13. O-O O-O
{ It's also possible to play  13...f5  first ,  there is no drawback to this move order. I went for 13... O-O because this way you have the rule of thumb for move 13 and 14 in this line to play ...f5 against the c-pawn moves and just castle as well if White plays O-O first. }
14. c4 f5
{ The best way to react to 14. c4. As usual taking on c4 is terrible, as it helps the knight far too much.   14...b4  is also a disaster , as after  15.Nc2  a5  16.Ne3  Black does not even manage to play the fundamental ...f5 break.  This only leaves Black with sacrificing the b-pawn, which explains why the 14. c4 - or 13. c4 - line is the sharpest one in the main line. Black is giving away the queenside and goes All-In with his counterplay in the centre and kingside. After 14... f5 White's main lines are the queen moves to h5 and f3, but he has also tried other continuations without much success. }
15. Qh5 Rb8
{ We would have liked to take on e4, but   15...fxe4  16.Bxe4  is a double threat on h7 and on the rook. This explains 15... Rb8 - now we are threatening to take on e4 and then play ...f5 a second time !  The move 15... Rb8 has been tested numerous times in over the board play and correspondence chess and it looks like Black is doing fine in the hair-raising complications. I need to mention that 15... Rb8 is not the only move, though. In fact only some days before these lines were written the World Champion went for a different move: he played 15... d5 !? in the Grand Swiss Isle of Man Tournament against Russian hopeful Alexey Sarana. 15... d5 is a rare move and was probably intended as a surprise, but Sarana had done his homework and blitzed out the following moves.   15...d5  16.cxd5  Qd8  17.exf5  Qxd5  18.Rad1  e4  19.Bxb5  Qxf5  20.Qxf5  Bxf5  21.Bd7  Bxd7  22.Rxd7  Bxb2  23.Nc4.  Now, this sequence is in fact clearly best play after 15... d5 and the resulting position I don't want to recommend, even though Magnus played the line. Black is very close to equality, but it's a grovel and not fun at all. Magnus ultimately drew the game after some unpleasant moments. Maybe HE kept his cool, but I would have been concerned ! In any case, I don't want to play for two results just yet if a win is not among them. }
16. exf5
{ A more or less forced decision. Otherwise we take on e4 and play ...f5 next. }
16... e4 17. Rae1
{ We attacked both the bishop on d3 and the pawn on b2, so White needs a tactical solution. }
17... Bb7 18. Qg4 Rfe8 { We need to cover e4. } 19. cxb5 Kh8
{ We can't play without this king move. Our bishop was pinned and ...Rg8 is an important option to gain. }
20. bxa6 Ba8
{ This is a good moment to take stock. This position is particularly important because of two reasons: 1. It is reached by forced or close to forced moves after 15... Rb8 and 2. White now actually has a choice of moves. One a general note: Black is three pawns down, but on all other accounts things are great ! The pieces are active and there are many weak pawns that we might win back soon, like b2 and a6. Remarkably the engine evaluation is 'equal' and in correspondence chess White has not won a single game out of the 43 games in my database ! This is amazing and an almost sure sign that purely from an analytical point of view Black is fine. This is not so important in a practical game, of course, but assuring to know. As mentioned White has more than one move now, let's look at some sample lines. }
21. a7 Qxa7 22. Bxe4 Qe7 { This pinning move is sufficient for equality. } 23.
f3 Rxb2 24. Nc4 Rxa2
{ We have gotten two pawns back and White's position remains unstable. I decided to stop here, but feel free to continue yourself if you feel this is relevant for you. }

{ Black has a strong attack, with ...Rg8 and the rook lift to h6 to come. You can also pick up a6, which makes sense. The far advanced a-pawn is a possible distraction during the attack and should be removed. This position is evaluated 0.00 by engines, which is what you expect somehow. Still it is clear that it is as far away from drawish as you can possibly imagine. White needs to defend very accurately against our attack, which is tough to do for a human. In a practical game I'll take Black any day ! }

The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10.

In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns.

Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9. Nd5 except the main line   9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c3  , which is examined in the next chapter.

9... Be7 10. Bxf6
{ In my mind this is the only logical move, trying to establish control over the light squares, in particular d5. After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5. Depending on the concrete circumstances Black might even be able to play d6-d5, for instance prepared by ...Be6 and ...Ne7. We will discuss more ideas for both sides in the notes to the individual lines. }

11. c4
{ While 11. c3 is still the main line, 11. c4 has gotten more popular starting from the mid 2000s. White forces   11...b4  ,  closing the queenside. This is a completely different approach compared to 11. c3, when White usually goes for a quick Nc2 and a4, attacking Black's queenside formation.   After  11.c4  b4  the play is rather slow. White has tried various ways to put pressure on Black , but the current theoretical status is completely satisfactory for Black. There is one move order pitfall to avoid , right on move  12. Let's have a look. }
11... b4 12. Nc2 O-O
{ This is a very important move order finesse that took me a while to understand. Black usually plays ...a5 and ...O-O, but should you play 12... a5 or 12... O-O first ? It turns out that it is more precise to play   12...O-O  , but this is not very obvious and therefore important to remember. The reason is the move  13.Qf3  ,  which is considerably less dangerous after 12...O-O, as we will see.   If White plays a slower move , like  13.Be2   or  13.g3  , we'll just follow up with  13...a5  and protect the b4-pawn, completing the queenside setup.  By the way: 12... O-O does not blunder the b-pawn, we will get excellent compensation if White elects to take it. }
13. Be2
{ This modest move is one of the popular choices for White. He prepares kingside castling and sometimes Bg4 is played soon, trying to trade off this inactive piece. }
13... a5 14. O-O Bg5
{ This move has multiple ideas: we preserve the bishop pair, control c1, allow a capture of a knight on e3, prepare ...f5, allow the queen to move without a worry about a capture on f6. Currently the queen has no good square, but after moves like ...Be6 and ... Rb8 you can think of ...Qd7 and later even ...Bd8-b6. After 14... Bg5 White has tried mostly two ideas: to play Bg4 or to build up on the d-file with Qd3 and a rook to d1. }
15. Bg4
{ This is a good moment to talk about what pieces to trade and under what circumstances. While you always should keep an open mind and be somewhat skeptical about 'general rules' in chess overall or in certain position types, it is still essential to know what to be skeptical about ! This is just a rephrase of 'In order to break the rules, you have to know them first.', a quote of unknown origin that I always liked.Getting back to the position type at hand. Here you don't want to trade the light-squared bishop without a pawn structure change. We are fine with White trading on e6, as this would patch the hole on d5 by moving a pawn to e6. It would be a serious strategic mistake to trade on g4 now or let White capture on c8. This way we would give up the pair of bishops with no particular compensation and make it easier for White to keep control over d5.Looking at the pawn structure, it is also apparent that White's bishop is limited by its own pawns on e4 and c4, while Black has most pawns on dark squares, as usual. This means that we usually don't want to trade this piece at all.Besides the scenario with the capture on e6  (Bxe6 answered by ...fxe6)  there are cases when Black may just take a knight on d5. This becomes an option mostly when White needs to recapture with a pawn. A pawn appearing on d5 is usually good news, as the d-file is plugged and d5 can't be occupied with a piece any more. In fact this scenario is favourable for Black in many cases, in particular if you manage to start a quick play with ...f5.There are other possible trading scenarios, of course. One interesting case is a possible ...Bg5xNe3 at a later moment. I feel there is no clear rule of thumb for this trade. In some cases a White setup with knights on d5 and e3 is a case of White having a 'superfluous knight', which means he has two knights for one weak square on d5, which means that the e3-knight is basically a piece with no active role. On the other hand you might have a case where you don't quite know what to with the bishop and simply want to reduce pieces that control d5.One important point to note is that d4 is a hole for White as well. In an ideal world we manage to plant a knight on d4 against the light-squared bishop. On the other hand we should avoid a position with a sole knight on d5 and against the dark-squared bishop. This type of piece distribution is almost always bad, unless the bishop is placed on d4 or c5 and you still have some heavy pieces on the board. }
15... Be6 { The best reply. We are fine with White taking on e6. } 16. Bxe6
fxe6 17. Nde3 Qc7
{ Black is fine in this position. Here we have a case where I would advise against taking on e3. White does not have even a single good square for one knight, let alone two ! For Black I'd like to suggest the regrouping Nd8-b7-c5, which allows Black to use the knight for play on the queenside, mostly connected with ...a4 and ...b3. The knight on c5 also safely protects e6, which is useful. Also keep in mind that ...Bd8-b6 is an idea for later as well. In the meantime it is unclear what White should do. I don't see a dangerous plan at all. }

In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9.

Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5. Depending on the concrete circumstances Black might even be able to play d6-d5, for instance prepared by ...Be6 and ...Ne7.

18. Bf3 Rb7

Rb7 you allow the interesting regrouping with ...Nb8-a6-c5. Of course the pawn push ...f5 is still part of Black's arsenal, but it needs to be prepared carefully. Moves like ...Kh8 come to mind. }

In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9.

9... Be7 10. Bxf6
{ In my mind this is the only logical move, trying to establish control over the light squares, in particular d5. After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5.

{ Now White's massive main line is  11.c3  ,   but  11.c4  has seen a surge of popularity over the last decade. The alternatives don't convince and at best transpose to less challenging versions of the two main moves with the c-pawn. }
11. c4
{ While 11. c3 is still the main line, 11. c4 has gotten more popular starting from the mid 2000s. White forces   11...b4  ,  closing the queenside. This is a completely different approach compared to 11. c3, when White usually goes for a quick Nc2 and a4, attacking Black's queenside formation.   After  11.c4  b4  the play is rather slow. White has tried various ways to put pressure on Black , but the current theoretical status is completely satisfactory for Black. There is one move order pitfall to avoid , right on move  12. Let's have a look. }
11... b4 12. Nc2 O-O
{ This is a very important move order finesse that took me a while to understand. Black usually plays ...a5 and ...O-O, but should you play 12... a5 or 12... O-O first ? It turns out that it is more precise to play   12...O-O  , but this is not very obvious and therefore important to remember. The reason is the move  13.Qf3  ,  which is considerably less dangerous after 12...O-O, as we will see.   If White plays a slower move , like  13.Be2   or  13.g3  , we'll just follow up with  13...a5  and protect the b4-pawn, completing the queenside setup.  By the way: 12... O-O does not blunder the b-pawn, we will get excellent compensation if White elects to take it. }
13. Be2
{ This modest move is one of the popular choices for White. He prepares kingside castling and sometimes Bg4 is played soon, trying to trade off this inactive piece. }
13... a5 14. O-O Bg5
{ This move has multiple ideas: we preserve the bishop pair, control c1, allow a capture of a knight on e3, prepare ...f5, allow the queen to move without a worry about a capture on f6. Currently the queen has no good square, but after moves like ...Be6 and ... Rb8 you can think of ...Qd7 and later even ...Bd8-b6. After 14... Bg5 White has tried mostly two ideas: to play Bg4 or to build up on the d-file with Qd3 and a rook to d1. }
15. Qd3
{ White prepares to play a rook to d1 and then decide what to do next. The decision between the a1- and f1-rook will be quite important, of course. }
15... Be6 16. Rad1
{ Using this rook probably means that White rather wants to play on the kingside, maybe making use of the f1-rook with g3 and f4. }
16... g6
{ Against the queenside oriented plans with a3 the move ...Rb8 proved to be fine. You could also play it here, but it seems less pointed. We suspect that White is going to play on the other side of the board, so we have more urgent things to do. Playing ... g6 is a useful move anyway. It prepares ...f5 and in some cases frees up g7 for a piece. }
17. g3 Bh6
{ A good prophylactic move. It also prepares ...Bg7 and a later ...Nd4. I also checked   17...f5  instead , which is very sharp and tough to evaluate.  I concluded that the simpler 17... Bh6 is perfectly fine and I didn't want to start an analysis up to move 25. Feel free to explore yourself, it's a lot of fun. }
18. Nde3
{ White goes for direct play against d6, but we already have seen that the threat to d6 can be met actively. Of course White may also try slow moves like   18.b3   or  18.Kh1  ,  but you always have the choice between ...Bg7 and ...Nd4 to be very solid or to go for ...f5, sharpening up the game instantly. }
18... Qb6 { The standard reply, covering the pawn on d6 by tactical means. }
19. Bg4
{ We have seen some cases of  19.Qxd6 ??  Rfd8  already ,  so this time I'll just give it in the text. After 19. Bg4 we have a straightforward way to prove equality. }
19... Bxe3 20. Qxe3 Qxe3 21. Nxe3 Bxg4 22. Nxg4 Nd4
{ And Black has equalised. The position is not dead, though - there is plenty of play left. We may target the c4-pawn and play on the queenside. }

This is a completely different approach compared to 11. c3, when White usually goes for a quick Nc2 and a4, attacking Black's queenside formation.   After  11.c4  b4  the play is rather slow. White has tried various ways to put pressure on Black , but the current theoretical status is completely satisfactory for Black. There is one move order pitfall to avoid , right on move  12. Let's have a look. }
11... b4 12. Nc2 O-O
{ This is a very important move order finesse that took me a while to understand. Black usually plays ...a5 and ...O-O, but should you play 12... a5 or 12... O-O first ? It turns out that it is more precise to play   12...O-O  , but this is not very obvious and therefore important to remember. The reason is the move  13.Qf3  ,  which is considerably less dangerous after 12...O-O, as we will see.   If White plays a slower move , like  13.Be2   or  13.g3  , we'll just follow up with  13...a5  and protect the b4-pawn, completing the queenside setup.  By the way: 12... O-O does not blunder the b-pawn, we will get excellent compensation if White elects to take it. }
13. h4
{ White stops ...Bg5 and also prepares to play g3 and Bh3 later. We are not particularly bothered by this idea, as taking on e6 is not frightening and h4 also has some downsides. It weakens the kingside and makes ideas connected to f4 tougher to play. }

{ After 8... b5 Black threatens to fork the knights, so White does not have a wide range of moves. He either plays 9. Nd5 or 9. Bxf6 first, followed by 10. Nd5. The difference between the two options is substantial. After the immediate   9.Nd5  Black plays  9...Be7  , after which  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  is the usual follow up. In this line Black is able to recapture on  f6  with the bishop ,   while after  9.Bxf6  you need to capture with the pawn, doubling the f-pawns. In this doubled f-pawn structure the play is considerably sharper early on, as Black is able to play ...f5 quickly to attack White's centre.  The line 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 is a slower, more strategic approach by White, trying to control the position, in particular the weak d5-square. In this chapter we will be examining all lines after 9.

After the trade White retains three pieces that may use d5, while Black only has two to fight for this square.A downside from White's perspective is the loss of the bishop pair, which is a serious concession. Once you have given it up, you are not getting it back ! I know this sounds extremely basic, but it is a very relevant factor.In the middle game Black's dark squared bishop is a key piece. If you manage to put it to effective use, it will often be very strong, as it has no counterpart any more. You will see some examples of this theme in the 11. c4 variation, when ...Bd8-b6 is an excellent idea to keep in mind. A more common scenario is to see the bishop on the diagonal h8-a1, for example on g7 after a later ...g6 and ...f5 is played. In some cases Black may also simply trade the bishop against a knight showing up on e3.White's problem piece is the knight on a3 and the route c2-e3 looks very natural to improve it. The trade on e3 changes the situation about the d5-square again, as both sides have a bishop and knight to control d5.

You can't generate serious pressure on the d-file and opening up the queenside with a3 leads to nothing much either.

You can't generate serious pressure on the d-file and opening up the queenside with a3 leads to nothing much either. The only other way to alter the pawn structure seems to be f4, which is prepared by g3. Of course White needs to prepare this a bit more, but after 13. g3 you need to expect this to happen later. }

You can't generate serious pressure on the d-file and opening up the queenside with a3 leads to nothing much either. The only other way to alter the pawn structure seems to be f4, which is prepared by g3. Of course White needs to prepare this a bit more, but after 13. g3 you need to expect this to happen later. }
13... a5 14. Bg2
{ White also plays  14.h4  here ,  but this we have covered via 13. h4 a5 14. g3 -  (lines #25-31.) }
14... Be6 15. O-O Bg5 16. Qd3 Qb8
{ Again this idea to allow ...Bd8-b6. I have a soft spot for this idea, but it's good to know that Black's game is not dependent on a single line, but rather flexible. Here Black has successfully played many other moves, ranging from the simplifying   16...Bxd5   to the original  16...Nb8  , which are all playable. }
17. f4 Bd8 18. Kh1 f6
{ This complex position is about equal. Black probably needs to play ...Ra7-d7 first to allow ...Bb6. We also have a5-a4 and in general try to prove that the bishop on g2 is not that great. It is tough for White to activate it, compared with Black's bishop coming to b6 soon. Of course White has a substantial space advantage, so the 'bad bishop' is not an issue yet. Black is hoping for a scenario in which his bishop on b6  (or some other square on the a7-g1 diagonal)  is looking deep into White's position, supporting an attack on the dark squares. }

{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Be2 Bg5
{ Our strategy is to fight for the d5-square with ...Ne7 next. We basically play in the same way as we do against 12. Nc2 Rb8 13. Be2 and  (successfully)  claim that if anything Nc2 should be more useful for White than ...Rb8 in the fight for the d5-square. }
13. O-O Ne7 14. Nxe7+ Qxe7 15. Nc2 Bb7 16. Bf3 a5
{ This is an idea to take note of. We are taking b4 under control, preventing Nb4-d5. This plan is not even that scary, but stopping it can't be bad. Black now has some choice of plans. You may play for ...g6 and ...f5, but playing more conservatively on the queenside is also possible. White is not very actively placed, so there is no need to rush anything. }

12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems.   13.g3  is a rare alternative and is examined in model game #4. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful. Let's have a look:   a  ...a5 prepares ...b4 and prevents Ncb4,  b  ...Be6 develops,  c  ...g6 prepares ...f5,  d  ...Ne7 to challenge the knight on d5 and  e  ...Kh8 is useful in any ...f5 scenario, to avoid possible checks on the a2-g8 diagonal and to clear the g-file for ideas like ...Rg8, once ...f5/exf5/...gxf5 is on the board.   So why 14... Kh8 first and not one of the others ? Let's check the alternatives: First of all,   14...a5  can be answered by  15.Na3 !  , which is a bit awkward to meet , as  15...b4  16.Nb5  is annoying   and  14...a5  15.Na3 !  Na7  is not ideal either.   14...Be6  is possible and not bad in my mind. One argument against it could be that you are not able to play ...Bb7 anymore, which was Carlsen's reply to Bg4 against Giri. You may also question if ...Be6 is necessary if you like to play ...f5 soon.   Next we have  14...g6  ,  which is not as flexible as 14... Kh8. It also prepares ...f5, but is not as useful in other scenarios.   Finally there is  14...Ne7  ,  which is the most solid move. We will see this idea after 14... Kh8 15. a3 Ne7. It is already playable in move 14 for sure, but less combative compared to 14... Kh8. Once you play ... Ne7 you focus on fighting for d5 and are less likely to mix it up with ...f5.  To sum it up, there are alternatives, and I think Carlsen went for 14... Kh8 because it is a flexible move that is not yet explored as much as the other choices. This leads us to an additional point in favour of copying the World Champion at this point. The line we are examining right now was recommended in an important repertoire book for White, written by GM John Shaw: 'Playing 1. e4 - Sicilian Main lines'. Shaw checks most of Black's alternatives on move 14, but not 14... Kh8. This makes this move more attractive for us, as White players might have studied up to this point, but likely don't know the king move if they only relied on this popular book. After 14...

Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems.   13.g3  is a rare alternative and is examined in model game #4. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful.

So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems.   13.g3  is a rare alternative and is examined in model game #4. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful. Let's have a look:   a  ...a5 prepares ...b4 and prevents Ncb4,  b  ...Be6 develops,  c  ...g6 prepares ...f5,  d  ...Ne7 to challenge the knight on d5 and  e  ...Kh8 is useful in any ...f5 scenario, to avoid possible checks on the a2-g8 diagonal and to clear the g-file for ideas like ...Rg8, once ...f5/exf5/...gxf5 is on the board.   So why 14... Kh8 first and not one of the others ? Let's check the alternatives: First of all,   14...a5  can be answered by  15.Na3 !  , which is a bit awkward to meet , as  15...b4  16.Nb5  is annoying   and  14...a5  15.Na3 !  Na7  is not ideal either.   14...Be6  is possible and not bad in my mind. One argument against it could be that you are not able to play ...Bb7 anymore, which was Carlsen's reply to Bg4 against Giri. You may also question if ...Be6 is necessary if you like to play ...f5 soon.   Next we have  14...g6  ,  which is not as flexible as 14... Kh8. It also prepares ...f5, but is not as useful in other scenarios.   Finally there is  14...Ne7  ,  which is the most solid move. We will see this idea after 14... Kh8 15. a3 Ne7. It is already playable in move 14 for sure, but less combative compared to 14... Kh8. Once you play ... Ne7 you focus on fighting for d5 and are less likely to mix it up with ...f5.  To sum it up, there are alternatives, and I think Carlsen went for 14... Kh8 because it is a flexible move that is not yet explored as much as the other choices. This leads us to an additional point in favour of copying the World Champion at this point. The line we are examining right now was recommended in an important repertoire book for White, written by GM John Shaw: 'Playing 1. e4 - Sicilian Main lines'. Shaw checks most of Black's alternatives on move 14, but not 14... Kh8. This makes this move more attractive for us, as White players might have studied up to this point, but likely don't know the king move if they only relied on this popular book. After 14... Kh8 we will check four options for White, illustrating the main ideas in the process. }
15. a3
{ This move does not look all that dangerous, but it was played by Teimour Radjabov against the World Champion in early 2019. One idea of the move is to enable the move axb4 after a possible Ncb4/...Nxb4 sequence. }
15... Ne7
{ A simple but sound approach by Magnus. Black may also keep the tension with other moves, but the immediate fight for d5 is a straightforward option. }
16. Ncb4 Bb7
{ Here Magnus played 16... Nxd5, but I'd like to suggest 16... Bb7 instead. In the game   16...Nxd5  17.Nxd5  Be6  was perfectly fine for Black ,   but after  16...Nxd5  the move  17.exd5  could have been irritating.  I don't see any problems at all after 16... Bb7, so this is to be preferred. }
17. Nxe7 Qxe7
{ And we have transposed to 16. Nxe7 Qxe7 17. Nb4 Bb7, which we have examined in lines #4-6. }

Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.

It is favourable for him to have a pair of knights traded , because he lacks good posts for knights and is happy to only have one of them.  It is useful to compare this situation with lines after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 and now 11. c4 b4 12. Nc2 O-O 13. Be2 a5 14. O-O Bg5 15. Bg4, when 15... Be6 is fine for Black. After 16. Bxe6 fxe6 17. Nde3 White has two knights that step on each other's toes.  Alright, let's return to the best move, 15... Bb7. Giri now played   16.Ncb4  ,  which did not pose many problems. This position is still fresh, so we can't rely on game samples. In addition to 16. Ncb4 I will also explore two other moves to illustrate the play. }
16. Qd3 { White covers e4 in anticipation of ...Ne7 and connects rooks. } 16...
Ne7
{ It's also possible to keep the tension, but ...Ne7 serves Black well in general, fighting for control over the crucial d5-square. }
17. Nxe7 Qxe7 18. Nb4
{ White is able to play this move because e4 is covered, a benefit of the earlier 16. Qd3. }
18... Qc7
{ I suggest to play this queen move, intending to play ...Qc4 in response to Nd5. This is an interesting option to keep the game more complicated. In fact Black may also play a move like   18...g6  and simple take the knight in case of Nd5.  After  19.Nd5  Bxd5  20.Qxd5  Black has  20...b4  to open up the queenside for counterplay. Such a position is about equal , but obviously not very exciting. }
19. Rfd1 { The immediate  19.Nd5  Qc4  leads to the same type of position. }
19... a5 20. Nd5 Qc4
{ This position is about equal, but a bit more complex than going for the Nd5/...Bxd5 structure. It's good to have a rock solid and a more fighting option. }

Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems.   13.g3  is a rare alternative and is examined in model game #4. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful. Let's have a look:   a  ...a5 prepares ...b4 and prevents Ncb4,  b  ...Be6 develops,  c  ...g6 prepares ...f5,  d  ...Ne7 to challenge the knight on d5 and  e  ...Kh8 is useful in any ...f5 scenario, to avoid possible checks on the a2-g8 diagonal and to clear the g-file for ideas like ...Rg8, once ...f5/exf5/...gxf5 is on the board.   So why 14... Kh8 first and not one of the others ? Let's check the alternatives: First of all,   14...a5  can be answered by  15.Na3 !  , which is a bit awkward to meet , as  15...b4  16.Nb5  is annoying   and  14...a5  15.Na3 !  Na7  is not ideal either.   14...Be6  is possible and not bad in my mind. One argument against it could be that you are not able to play ...Bb7 anymore, which was Carlsen's reply to Bg4 against Giri. You may also question if ...Be6 is necessary if you like to play ...f5 soon.   Next we have  14...g6  ,  which is not as flexible as 14... Kh8. It also prepares ...f5, but is not as useful in other scenarios.   Finally there is  14...Ne7  ,  which is the most solid move. We will see this idea after 14... Kh8 15. a3 Ne7. It is already playable in move 14 for sure, but less combative compared to 14... Kh8. Once you play ... Ne7 you focus on fighting for d5 and are less likely to mix it up with ...f5.  To sum it up, there are alternatives, and I think Carlsen went for 14... Kh8 because it is a flexible move that is not yet explored as much as the other choices. This leads us to an additional point in favour of copying the World Champion at this point. The line we are examining right now was recommended in an important repertoire book for White, written by GM John Shaw: 'Playing 1. e4 - Sicilian Main lines'. Shaw checks most of Black's alternatives on move 14, but not 14... Kh8. This makes this move more attractive for us, as White players might have studied up to this point, but likely don't know the king move if they only relied on this popular book. After 14... Kh8 we will check four options for White, illustrating the main ideas in the process. }
15. Bg4
{ This move was played by Anish Giri, two days after Carlsen had played the 14... Kh8 line for the first time against Radjabov. Did Giri manage to pose some problems ? Let's have a look. }
15... Bb7
{ This is the best move. We don't want to trade the light-squared bishops unless we benefit due to a favourable change of the pawn structure. In many positions the reply ...Be6 against against Bg4 is a good choice, anticipating the sequence Bxe6/...fxe6, after which Black covers the d5-square with a pawn.   In our specific position  15...Be6  is not great , because after  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Ndb4  Nxb4  18.Nxb4  White has the better chances. It is favourable for him to have a pair of knights traded , because he lacks good posts for knights and is happy to only have one of them.   It is useful to compare this situation with lines after  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c4  b4  12.Nc2  O-O  13.Be2  a5  14.O-O  Bg5  15.Bg4  , when  15...Be6  is fine for Black. After  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Nde3  White has two knights that step on each other's toes.  Alright, let's return to the best move, 15... Bb7. Giri now played   16.Ncb4  ,  which did not pose many problems. This position is still fresh, so we can't rely on game samples. In addition to 16. Ncb4 I will also explore two other moves to illustrate the play. }
16. a4
{ The a4 pawn lever should always be checked. Black is well equipped here to deal with it. }
16... bxa4 17. Rxa4 Ne7 18. Nxe7 Qxe7
{ Black has counterplay against b2 and e4, giving us equal chances in a still interesting position. }
19. Be2 Bc6
{ Black attacks b2 and e4 now, trading the a6-pawn for the e4-pawn - not a bad deal at all. }
20. Rxa6 Bxe4
{ This position is about equal, but it is rather White who needs to prove that in view of Black's long term pluses: Black has two centre pawns and the bishop pair. }

{ This is the best move. We don't want to trade the light-squared bishops unless we benefit due to a favourable change of the pawn structure. In many positions the reply ...Be6 against against Bg4 is a good choice, anticipating the sequence Bxe6/...fxe6, after which Black covers the d5-square with a pawn.

{ And we have a model position for the Sveshnikov. White has made progress on the queenside, but we have attacking chances based on f5-f4 and then ...f3 or ...e3, depending on the concrete tactical details. Engines call it equal, but it's not a boring position at all ! }

This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems.   13.g3  is a rare alternative and is examined in model game #4. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful. Let's have a look:   a  ...a5 prepares ...b4 and prevents Ncb4,  b  ...Be6 develops,  c  ...g6 prepares ...f5,  d  ...Ne7 to challenge the knight on d5 and  e  ...Kh8 is useful in any ...f5 scenario, to avoid possible checks on the a2-g8 diagonal and to clear the g-file for ideas like ...Rg8, once ...f5/exf5/...gxf5 is on the board.   So why 14... Kh8 first and not one of the others ? Let's check the alternatives: First of all,   14...a5  can be answered by  15.Na3 !  , which is a bit awkward to meet , as  15...b4  16.Nb5  is annoying   and  14...a5  15.Na3 !  Na7  is not ideal either.   14...Be6  is possible and not bad in my mind. One argument against it could be that you are not able to play ...Bb7 anymore, which was Carlsen's reply to Bg4 against Giri. You may also question if ...Be6 is necessary if you like to play ...f5 soon.   Next we have  14...g6  ,  which is not as flexible as 14... Kh8. It also prepares ...f5, but is not as useful in other scenarios.   Finally there is  14...Ne7  ,  which is the most solid move. We will see this idea after 14... Kh8 15. a3 Ne7. It is already playable in move 14 for sure, but less combative compared to 14... Kh8. Once you play ... Ne7 you focus on fighting for d5 and are less likely to mix it up with ...f5.  To sum it up, there are alternatives, and I think Carlsen went for 14... Kh8 because it is a flexible move that is not yet explored as much as the other choices. This leads us to an additional point in favour of copying the World Champion at this point. The line we are examining right now was recommended in an important repertoire book for White, written by GM John Shaw: 'Playing 1. e4 - Sicilian Main lines'. Shaw checks most of Black's alternatives on move 14, but not 14... Kh8. This makes this move more attractive for us, as White players might have studied up to this point, but likely don't know the king move if they only relied on this popular book. After 14... Kh8 we will check four options for White, illustrating the main ideas in the process. }
15. Bg4
{ This move was played by Anish Giri, two days after Carlsen had played the 14... Kh8 line for the first time against Radjabov. Did Giri manage to pose some problems ? Let's have a look. }
15... Bb7
{ This is the best move. We don't want to trade the light-squared bishops unless we benefit due to a favourable change of the pawn structure. In many positions the reply ...Be6 against against Bg4 is a good choice, anticipating the sequence Bxe6/...fxe6, after which Black covers the d5-square with a pawn.   In our specific position  15...Be6  is not great , because after  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Ndb4  Nxb4  18.Nxb4  White has the better chances. It is favourable for him to have a pair of knights traded , because he lacks good posts for knights and is happy to only have one of them.   It is useful to compare this situation with lines after  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c4  b4  12.Nc2  O-O  13.Be2  a5  14.O-O  Bg5  15.Bg4  , when  15...Be6  is fine for Black. After  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Nde3  White has two knights that step on each other's toes.  Alright, let's return to the best move, 15... Bb7. Giri now played   16.Ncb4  ,  which did not pose many problems. This position is still fresh, so we can't rely on game samples. In addition to 16. Ncb4 I will also explore two other moves to illustrate the play. }
16. Ncb4 Nxb4
{ Not a decision to be taken lightly , as White is able to take with the pawn and open a crucial file. It turns out that Black is fine , but he also had the option to just play  16...g6  for example. Let's see how the Giri-Carlsen game continued. }
17. cxb4 g6 18. a4
{ White decides it is time to act quickly in view of the coming ...f5 counterplay. Black is perfectly fine anyway, but after 19. a4 White actually is the one that needs to be careful. }
18... bxa4 19. Rxa4 Bc6 { This move ensures Black a good game. } 20. Ra5 Bxd5
21. Qxd5 Rxb4 22. Rxa6 Rd4 23. Qc6 d5
{ White still has to be careful here to hold, there is no need to analyse further. }

This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Be2
{ White simply develops the bishop and prepares castling kingside. It is still very frequently played , even though  13.h4  seems more testing these days. Of course 13. Be2 is a classical and sound move, but it does not exert any direct pressure or poses concrete problems.   13.g3  is a rare alternative and is examined in model game #4. }
13... Bg5
{ A standard part of our setup. We clear the way for the f-pawn, are now ready to take a knight on e3 if desirable and give more flexibility for the queen. We also enable ...Ne7 to be played soon. }
14. O-O Kh8
{ If in doubt, play what Magnus plays ! This is not a bad general approach, but for this repertoire part of the concept, of course. The World Champion has played this twice in 2019 and had no problems at all in both games.That being said, Black has good alternatives to the king move, which does not look extremely obvious. So why did Magnus go for 14... Kh8 ? Well, in this structure there are some moves that are generally useful. Let's have a look:   a  ...a5 prepares ...b4 and prevents Ncb4,  b  ...Be6 develops,  c  ...g6 prepares ...f5,  d  ...Ne7 to challenge the knight on d5 and  e  ...Kh8 is useful in any ...f5 scenario, to avoid possible checks on the a2-g8 diagonal and to clear the g-file for ideas like ...Rg8, once ...f5/exf5/...gxf5 is on the board.   So why 14... Kh8 first and not one of the others ? Let's check the alternatives: First of all,   14...a5  can be answered by  15.Na3 !  , which is a bit awkward to meet , as  15...b4  16.Nb5  is annoying   and  14...a5  15.Na3 !  Na7  is not ideal either.   14...Be6  is possible and not bad in my mind. One argument against it could be that you are not able to play ...Bb7 anymore, which was Carlsen's reply to Bg4 against Giri. You may also question if ...Be6 is necessary if you like to play ...f5 soon.   Next we have  14...g6  ,  which is not as flexible as 14... Kh8. It also prepares ...f5, but is not as useful in other scenarios.   Finally there is  14...Ne7  ,  which is the most solid move. We will see this idea after 14... Kh8 15. a3 Ne7. It is already playable in move 14 for sure, but less combative compared to 14... Kh8. Once you play ... Ne7 you focus on fighting for d5 and are less likely to mix it up with ...f5.  To sum it up, there are alternatives, and I think Carlsen went for 14... Kh8 because it is a flexible move that is not yet explored as much as the other choices. This leads us to an additional point in favour of copying the World Champion at this point. The line we are examining right now was recommended in an important repertoire book for White, written by GM John Shaw: 'Playing 1. e4 - Sicilian Main lines'. Shaw checks most of Black's alternatives on move 14, but not 14... Kh8. This makes this move more attractive for us, as White players might have studied up to this point, but likely don't know the king move if they only relied on this popular book. After 14... Kh8 we will check four options for White, illustrating the main ideas in the process. }
15. Bg4
{ This move was played by Anish Giri, two days after Carlsen had played the 14... Kh8 line for the first time against Radjabov. Did Giri manage to pose some problems ? Let's have a look. }
15... Bb7
{ This is the best move. We don't want to trade the light-squared bishops unless we benefit due to a favourable change of the pawn structure. In many positions the reply ...Be6 against against Bg4 is a good choice, anticipating the sequence Bxe6/...fxe6, after which Black covers the d5-square with a pawn.   In our specific position  15...Be6  is not great , because after  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Ndb4  Nxb4  18.Nxb4  White has the better chances. It is favourable for him to have a pair of knights traded , because he lacks good posts for knights and is happy to only have one of them.   It is useful to compare this situation with lines after  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  9.Nd5  Be7  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.c4  b4  12.Nc2  O-O  13.Be2  a5  14.O-O  Bg5  15.Bg4  , when  15...Be6  is fine for Black. After  16.Bxe6  fxe6  17.Nde3  White has two knights that step on each other's toes.  Alright, let's return to the best move, 15... Bb7. Giri now played   16.Ncb4  ,  which did not pose many problems. This position is still fresh, so we can't rely on game samples. In addition to 16. Ncb4 I will also explore two other moves to illustrate the play. }
16. Ncb4 Nxb4
{ Not a decision to be taken lightly , as White is able to take with the pawn and open a crucial file. It turns out that Black is fine , but he also had the option to just play  16...g6  for example. Let's see how the Giri-Carlsen game continued. }
17. cxb4 g6 18. a4
{ White decides it is time to act quickly in view of the coming ...f5 counterplay. Black is perfectly fine anyway, but after 19. a4 White actually is the one that needs to be careful. }
18... bxa4 19. Rxa4 Bc6 { This move ensures Black a good game. } 20. Be2
{ Giri opts for an exchange sacrifice. His idea is to get the a-pawn and generate play on the light squares , but it does not work out well. A similar sacrificial idea was possible with  20.Rxa6  , which would have been a better version. }
20... Bxa4 21. Qxa4 a5
{ This is the engine improvement on Magnus'  21...f5  ,  which was good enough for an advantage as well - but 21... a5 is a lot stronger ! }
22. b5 Qc8
{ Black has a substantial advantage in view of ...Qc5 and ...f5 to come. Note that White needs to take care of the idea ...Qc2 as well, which is very annoying after a queen move. }
23. Qxa5 { This makes it worse, but needs to be checked. } 23... Qc2
{ The mentioned point. Now White loses coordination and is not able to cover all the exposed pawns. Black has a winning position. }

Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality.

Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11...O-O felt like the most practical choice to me. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Bd3
{ A natural development move. White might have a later Bc2-b3 in mind, connecting the bishop to the d5-square. Black is not worried much about slow ideas like that. }
13... Bg5
{ The usual move we basically always play unless White stops us with 13. h4 or 13. a4. Here White might answer it with   14.h4  , but we'll see it is not an issue.   If you want to avoid this for some reason you might also start with  13...Be6  and only after  14.O-O  go  14....Bg5.  I recommend 13... Bg5 for consistency reasons - 'always play ...Bg5 unless they stop us'. }
14. h4
{ This leads to an unconventional and sharp position that gives Black equal chances. If you like to avoid this scenario you can play 13... Be6 first as mentioned. }
14... Bh6 { We can't take it due to Qh5. } 15. g4
{ The consistent follow up. White can't castle short with the exposed h4-pawn anyway. }

Here   14...Kh8  looks less pointed, as you can't play ...f5 that easily against the bishop on d3  and playing for control of d5 with a move like   14...Ne7   or  14...Be6  looks more urgent. With the bishop on d3 White has lesser influence on d5, compared to a a bishop on e2. Still Black has many playable options here, this being a rather slow type of game. I went for 14... Be6, which is played most often and easily scores 60% for Black. }
15. a4 bxa4
{ Against a4 Black should take the pawn almost all of the time, opening the b-file in the process. You can only allow a structure with axb5/...axb5 if you have a very specific reason to do so. I am not sure if I ever saw such a case, so you are not doing badly to just assume that you always have to take ! }
16. Ndb4 Ne7
{ This is a fighting idea. Instead  16...Nxb4  17.Nxb4  Bb3  is completely fine , but  18.Bc2  Bc4  19.Bd3  Bb3  is a possible draw that White may go for. }

After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11...O-O felt like the most practical choice to me. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. Bd3
{ A natural development move. White might have a later Bc2-b3 in mind, connecting the bishop to the d5-square. Black is not worried much about slow ideas like that. }
13... Bg5
{ The usual move we basically always play unless White stops us with 13. h4 or 13. a4. Here White might answer it with   14.h4  , but we'll see it is not an issue.   If you want to avoid this for some reason you might also start with  13...Be6  and only after  14.O-O  go  14....Bg5.  I recommend 13... Bg5 for consistency reasons - 'always play ...Bg5 unless they stop us'. }
14. O-O Be6
{ In the line 13. Be2 Bg5 14. O-O we have chosen to play 14... Kh8, copying Magnus Carlsen's approach. The World Champion never faced the Bd3-setup, so we don't know what he would play. Here   14...Kh8  looks less pointed, as you can't play ...f5 that easily against the bishop on d3  and playing for control of d5 with a move like   14...Ne7   or  14...Be6  looks more urgent. With the bishop on d3 White has lesser influence on d5, compared to a a bishop on e2. Still Black has many playable options here, this being a rather slow type of game. I went for 14... Be6, which is played most often and easily scores 60% for Black. }
15. Nce3
{ White supports the knight on d5. He always needs to worry about Black taking on d5, forcing a pawn to d5. This scenario is usually quite favourable for Black who easily gets f5 in later in such a structure. }
15... Ne7
{ This is a bit more interesting than  15...Bxe3  16.Nxe3  Ne7  , which already looks like a safe bet for equality. }
16. Bc2 Nxd5 17. Nxd5 a5
{ Black's idea is to just ignore the knight on d5 and go for kingside play. }
18. a3 Qd7 19. Bb3 Kh8
{ We have ...g6 and ...f5 next, starting the standard play on the kingside. This position is a good example why Black is not suffering from both a weak backward pawn on d6 AND a hole on d5. White is simply unable to use BOTH at the same time. White may put a knight on d5, but this means there is no pressure on the d-file. In the meantime it is unclear what the knight on d5 is actually attacking, while we know what to do on the kingside. This is why many Sveshnikov positions are actually easier to play for Black - you have the clearer ideas to pursue. }

In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.

{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?  Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11...O-O felt like the most practical choice to me. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. a4 bxa4
{ Always take on a4 ! It sounds a bit like a Ben Finegold quote, but it is nevertheless good advice. }
14. Ncb4
{ Black is fine after this move, but it is a least an interesting try. } 14...
Nxb4 15. cxb4
{ Here it is a good moment to briefly consider the difference between our move order with 11... O-O 12. Nc2 Rb8 compared to 11... Bg5 12. Nc2 Rb8. In our move order we are able to play 15... Bb7 after both captures and equalize easily  (or even more)  . If you play the second move order the king is still on e8, which means a4 is hanging with check, making ...Bb7 impossible. As discussed earlier the second move order is perfectly fine, but it takes much more learning effort to defuse the a4 idea. }
15... Bb7 16. Rxa4 Qc8
{ This is the only difficult move to remember, but it is important to do so. Black is able to even fight for more than equality now. Black's idea is to take on d5 and force White to recapture with the e-pawn, as Qxd5 allows a check on c1 ! }
17. Nxf6+ gxf6 18. Bd3
{ This position was reached in M.Vachier Lagrave-M.Carlsen, London 2015. }
18... d5 { This is even better than Carlsen's more cautious  18...Bc6. } 19.
exd5 Rd8
{ Black intends to take on d5 with the rook, with ...Qd7 to follow. The black kingside looks weak, but White has no way to exploit it. }
20. O-O Rxd5
{ Black is better here. Black's pieces are more active and even ...Rd4-g4 is a possible way to continue. }

Here the key point to study is  13.a4  bxa4  14.Ncb4  , when both  14...Nxb4  15.cxb4   and  15.Nxb4  lead to long , tactical lines. These lines are fine for Black , but you need to basically learn many variations beyond move 20 on a move-by-move basis. It's tough to work it out over the board and therefore more rote memorization than anything else. If possible I'd like to avoid those lines , unless it is absolutely necessary and the alternatives are unattractive.   I looked at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8  13.h4  in comparison and felt this is much easier to handle , but of course considerably less sharp and tactical. This is largely a matter of personal preference and less a matter of move/line quality. If you like to be as unpredictable as the World Champion , you may start with the line presented here to get you going and later add the other move orders that Carlsen plays as well. }
11... O-O
{ As explained in the remarks to 11. c3, Black has a range of lines and move orders available. 11... O-O felt like the most practical choice to me.   Carlsen has also played  11...Bg5  earlier in his career , as seen in model game #3. }
12. Nc2
{ What could be more natural after 11. c3 ? White has tried to delay this move, but unsurprisingly this is not dangerous at all. }
12... Rb8
{ As already explained earlier this move is played to discourage White to play a4, due to the pressure down the b-file. If you play   12...Bg5  instead you allow  13.a4  , when you have nothing better than  13...bxa4  14.Rxa4.  This line is still played nowadays , but I feel it is an unnecessary concession.   After  12...Rb8  the move  13.a4  is still playable , but rather harmless.   The only possible issue with  12...Rb8  is the reply  13.h4  ,  which prevents ...Bg5. The bishop move to g5 is desirable for Black, so we need to have something prepared against the h-pawn push.  Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. h4
{ This move is regarded as the critical one against the move order 11...O-O 12. Nc2 Rb8. White stops ...Bg5 and this is no small feat. If you study the move 13. Be2 and 13. Bd3 you see that ...Bg5 and ...Ne7 is a common way for Black to continue. Now   13...Ne7  is a huge concession , as  14.Nxf6+  gxf6  changes the pawn structure in White's favour. }
13... g6
{ It looks a bit odd at first to play ...g6 AFTER White has played h4, but we don't need to worry about the h-file here. White has no attacking pieces and the bishop defends the dark squares reliably. With 13... g6 Black intends to play ...Bg7, then proceed with the play for the d5-square with ...Ne7. The main incentive to select it for the repertoire was the game W. So-M.Carlsen, Stavanger 2019 - if in doubt, play what Magnus plays. }
14. g3 Bg7 15. h5 Ne7 16. Nce3 Nxd5 17. Nxd5
{ This position was reached in the mentioned So-Carlsen game. Now Magnus went for  17...Be6  18.Bh3  Bxd5  19.Qxd5  b4  and later drew the game. I have to admit that I don't like this approach for Black. The resulting positions don't offer much activity and the alternative 17... Bb7 looks perfectly fine. It has been tested in many high level correspondence games and Black had no problems. }
17... Bb7
{ Black's basic idea is to play ...Bf6-g5 and ...Rc8-c5 next, fighting for control of d5. We will check some sample continuations from here. }
18. Bh3
{ This way White takes control of c8, preventing ...Rc8 or ...Qc8 later. Black still has enough play on the queenside, though. }
18... Bh6
{ We can occupy this diagonal immediately, as Bh3 blocks the h-file. } 19. Qd3
Kg7 20. Rd1
{ This looks reasonable for White, but Black has a good queenside counterplay idea. }

Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White. In the first decades of the Sveshnikov it was basically the only one played, before 11. c4 gained some ground. In this chapter we are analysing 11. c3, while other continuations after 9. Nd5, in particular the 11. c4 line, are discussed in the previous chapter.The move 11. c3 makes a very logical impression. The knight on a3 is clearly a problem piece and needs to be improved. The route via c2 is now possible and often the knight soon connects to the weak d5-square via e3 or, less often, via b4. After the knight is moved away from a3 White gains the option to play a4, attacking the extended black queenside. White's strategy in this line is usually connected with this idea, but there are other options as well. White quite frequently plays the move h4, covering the g5-square and preventing ... Bg5. This may also be the start of play on the kingside, very much depending on the concrete circumstances.Alright, what is black supposed to do ? The good news is that Black has a number of options and Magnus Carlsen has tried most of them. This is also the bad news for an author: you need to pick a line if you want to simply copy what Magnus always does.   So what are the options  ? First of all , there is one independent and non-transpositional line that Black has available now. He may play  11...Ne7  , and this line was used once by the World Champion in a 2019 Blitz game against Lenier Dominguez. After the usual  12.Nxf6+  gxf6  you get the same pawn structure as after 9. Bxf6, featuring the doubled f-pawns. I think this line is not bad, but it was only employed once by Magnus in a Blitz game. In more important encounters he has used more standard main lines.   To understand how the main lines work it makes sense to look at how the theory developed over the course of time. In the early years of the Sveshnikov they started with  11...O-O  and after  12.Nc2  played  12...Bg5.  The bishop usually goes to g5, watching over the e3-square, freeing the f-pawn and allowing the queen to move without allowing Nxf6+ with doubled pawns. The drawback of 12... Bg5 is  13.a4  , when Black needs to capture with  13...bxa4.   it usually a bad idea to play something like  13...Rb8  14.axb5  axb5  ,  when White controls the a-file and b5 is a useful target for White.  After 13... bxa4 White just plays  14.Rxa4  and is happy to have a setup with Bc4 and often b3 next. This type of position is not terrible for Black, but nowadays Black tries to avoid it in view of better options.  One idea is to play an early ...Rb8, so that after White pushes a4 we are able to take and immediately attack b2, making the simple recapture on a4 problematic. There are multiple ways to employ the ...Rb8 idea. You can play it right away with   11...Rb8  ,  or wait until White has played Nc2, so for example   11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8   or  11...Bg5  (as we know a generally useful move)  12.Nc2  Rb8.  So essentially Black has three moves that we want to play  (...O-O, ...Rb8 and ...Bg5)  and he may do so in every imaginable order ! Magnus has played various orders, so we don't see a clear preference on his part. Let's work out what the difference between them is.   First of all , let's look at  11...O-O  12.Nc2  Rb8.  With 12... Rb8 we have defanged 13. a4, but White has the option to play  13.h4  ,  which stops our intended next move 13... Bg5. This is the drawback of the early ...O-O move order.   So what about  11...Rb8  12.Nc2  Bg5   or  11...Bg5  12.Nc2  Rb8 ?

Instead of 13. h4 White may also play a slower setup with   13.Be2   or  13.Bd3  , but these don't feel very challenging for Black. }
13. h4
{ This move is regarded as the critical one against the move order 11...O-O 12. Nc2 Rb8. White stops ...Bg5 and this is no small feat. If you study the move 13. Be2 and 13. Bd3 you see that ...Bg5 and ...Ne7 is a common way for Black to continue. Now   13...Ne7  is a huge concession , as  14.Nxf6+  gxf6  changes the pawn structure in White's favour. }
13... g6
{ It looks a bit odd at first to play ...g6 AFTER White has played h4, but we don't need to worry about the h-file here. White has no attacking pieces and the bishop defends the dark squares reliably. With 13... g6 Black intends to play ...Bg7, then proceed with the play for the d5-square with ...Ne7. The main incentive to select it for the repertoire was the game W. So-M.Carlsen, Stavanger 2019 - if in doubt, play what Magnus plays. }
14. g3 Bg7 15. h5 Ne7 16. Nce3 Nxd5 17. Nxd5
{ This position was reached in the mentioned So-Carlsen game. Now Magnus went for  17...Be6  18.Bh3  Bxd5  19.Qxd5  b4  and later drew the game. I have to admit that I don't like this approach for Black. The resulting positions don't offer much activity and the alternative 17... Bb7 looks perfectly fine. It has been tested in many high level correspondence games and Black had no problems. }
17... Bb7
{ Black's basic idea is to play ...Bf6-g5 and ...Rc8-c5 next, fighting for control of d5. We will check some sample continuations from here. }
18. Be2 { White develops the bishop and prepares a later Kf1-g2. } 18... Bf6
19. Qd3 Bg5
{ It took a while, but we got to g5 after all. Note that while it took longer than usual, in the meantime White has played h4-h5, which does not help much in the battle for central control. }
20. Rd1 Rc8 21. hxg6 hxg6 22. Kf1 Rc5
{ Black has completed the desired setup. Now we are threatening to take on d5, which force a pawn to d5. }
23. Ne3 Kg7
{ It's important to see that d6 is not hanging, because Black is targeting e4 as well. }
24. Bf3 Qb6
{ Black plans to play ...Rd8 and ...b4. Again White can't take on d6. } 25.
Qxd6 { This is wrong, but let's check why. } 25... Qxd6 26. Rxd6 Bxe3 27. fxe3
b4 28. cxb4 { The second mistake after 25. Qxd6. } 28... Rc2
{ Black is already winning here. The active rook will mop up the whole queenside. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the fianchetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this 'Rossolimo Reversed' structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5
{ As mentioned before: this position more often than not arises via 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6. I decided to cover it here, as the resulting positions are obviously very similar to 4. Bxc6 lines. }
7. d3 Qc7
{ Magnus Carlsen played his trademark move twice in this position. First against Caruana in the WC match , and a second time in 2019 against Hikaru Nakamura in the St. Louis Sinquefield Cup. It is useful to compare this position to  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bb5  g6  4.Bxc6  dxc6  5.d3  Bg7  6.O-O  Qc7  7.h3  e5.  Here Re1 is played instead of h3. This difference is important in some lines. We will see that in the Caruana game Magnus played a quick ...Bg4, which shows one difference. The other point is that a counterplay based on a quick ...f5 is tougher to initiate, as the rook applies pressure on the e-file. }
8. a3 Nf6 9. b4 O-O
{ This is an interesting move order twist. You may also take on b4, but waiting with this capture has a nice point. }
10. Be3 c4
{ This is the idea of waiting with the capture on b4. This is very much comparable to 5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7 7. h3 e5 8. a3 Nf6 9. Be3 c4 !, which is also part of this repertoire - line #13 - and was tested in a later Caruana-Carlsen encounter. }

Black's queenside is busted, but you have attacking chances. I think it is probably too risky to play this line in an important, serious game, but it could be worth a shot in Blitz.

It is useful to compare this position to  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bb5  g6  4.Bxc6  dxc6  5.d3  Bg7  6.O-O  Qc7  7.h3  e5.  Here Re1 is played instead of h3. This difference is important in some lines. We will see that in the Caruana game Magnus played a quick ...Bg4, which shows one difference. The other point is that a counterplay based on a quick ...f5 is tougher to initiate, as the rook applies pressure on the e-file. }
8. a3 Nf6 9. b4 O-O
{ This is an interesting move order twist. You may also take on b4, but waiting with this capture has a nice point. }
10. Nbd2 Bg4
{ Magnus insists on not taking on b4, asking White about a useful move. } 11.
h3
{ Instead  11.bxc5  Nd7  transposes to 10. bxc5 Bg4 11. Nbd2 Nd7  (- line #2.) }
11... Bxf3 12. Nxf3 Nd7
{ The World Champion played  12...cxb4  13.axb4  a5  instead , but after  14.bxa5  Rxa5  15.Rxa5 !  Caruana could have obtained some slight pressure. }
13. Be3 cxb4 14. axb4 a6
{ You may also play the simpler  14...a5  , which is a better version of the line played by Carlsen. Black has no problems in this position , as White's slightly better bishop does not amount to much.  I suggest 14... a6 to keep more play on the board, intending ...Re8 and ...Nf8-e6 next. A later ...f5 is possible, of course. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the fianchetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this 'Rossolimo Reversed' structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5
{ As mentioned before: this position more often than not arises via 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6. I decided to cover it here, as the resulting positions are obviously very similar to 4. Bxc6 lines. }
7. d3 Qc7
{ Magnus Carlsen played his trademark move twice in this position. First against Caruana in the WC match , and a second time in 2019 against Hikaru Nakamura in the St. Louis Sinquefield Cup.

{ As played by Magnus against Hikaru Nakamura in the Sinquefield Cup 2019. Instead  9...Nf6  is also playable , intending to answer  10.b4  with  10...c4  again , as seen before in similar cases.  What you need to avoid though: please don't play 9... f5 ??. This is possible with h3 played instead of Re1 - see 5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7 7. h3 e5 8. Be3 b6 9. a3 f5 !?. Here   9...f5 ??  10.exf5  gxf5  11.Bf4  leads to a disaster. }

{ This is an important point, as otherwise we'd lose the e5-pawn. Now we'll reach a position similar to 15. Qa4, as we play ...f6 there as well. }

{ This position was reached in the mentioned game H. Nakamura-M.Carlsen, Saint Louis 2019. It's very difficult to make progress for both sides, as there are no useful pawn breaks. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first. White has also tried other move orders , like  5.O-O   or  5.h3  first ,  but d3 will be played usually on the next move.   One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. Nc3
{ This move has little independent value and usually just transposes to  6.h3   or  6.O-O  lines. }
6... Qc7
{ We usually start with ...Qc7, so I am recommending this here as well. There is nothing wrong with   6...e5  either ,   nor with  6...Nf6  followed by ...Nd7 as described earlier. }
7. Be3 b6 8. Qd2 e5 9. O-O-O
{ Here or on earlier moves White could have played h3 or O-O, which would have transposed to the lines 6. h3 - lines #21-22 - or 6. O-O - lines #8-20. }
9... Bg4
{ A way to try to exploit the omission of  h3.  This is a good move , but there was nothing wrong with  9...h6  either, preparing to play ...Nf6 next. }
10. h3 Bxf3 11. gxf3 O-O-O 12. f4 Nf6
{ And this interesting position is about equal. Note that White was concerned about ...Nh5 and therefore played f4, but this will open up our bishop on g7. }

6... Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,   while after  6...Qc7  White is  only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan. With the open diagonal preparing b4 makes little sense and Be3 blunders b2. In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7  (- lines #1-6.)  Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. Nc3 Nf6
{ Here  7...e5  is a bit better than on move 6, but still I'd like to delay this move for the moment. I think it is an attractive idea to try to provoke h3, and White will very likely play is very soon. He wants to play Be3 - no other good square available - and ...Ng4 is annoying, so h3 makes a lot of sense. }

In the game V.Murzin-A.Barseghyan , Aktobe 2019 , Black played the seemingly more active  10...Nh5  , but after  11.Be3  b6  12.b4 !  the point of White's play was revealed. Black was in trouble , as after  12...axb4  13.a5 !  the position would fall apart immediately.   In the game after  10...Nh5  11.Be3  b6  12.b4 !  , the move  12...b5  was tried and Black managed to survive a bad position and even won in the end.  Still, this is not something to repeat ! Please take note of this b4 pawn break, it is an important resource for White after a4 and ...a5 is played. }
11. Be3
{ After 10... Nd7 there are no sample games, but the following sequence of moves makes sense. }
11... O-O 12. Qd2 b6 13. Bh6 f6
{ Black is going for a setup with ...Rf7 and Nf8-e6 next. Sometimes ...Ba6 and simply taking on c4 comes into consideration as well. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first. White has also tried other move orders , like  5.O-O   or  5.h3  first ,  but d3 will be played usually on the next move.   One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. O-O
{ White castles kingside early, which tells you something about his intentions. His play will very likely happen on the queenside, usually involving ideas like a4-a5 and in particular a3 and b4, opening up the position.. }
6... Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,   while after  6...Qc7  White is  only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan. With the open diagonal preparing b4 makes little sense and Be3 blunders b2. In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7  (- lines #1-6.)  Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. a4 a5
{ If White plays a4 in the ...dxc6 Rossolimo the reply ...a5 is almost an automatic move. Black should not allow a4-a5 to happen and stops the a-pawn. After a4 White has actually limited this options on the queenside, as the b4-break becomes very difficult to play. White has other ideas, though. }
8. Nfd2 { A creative idea, allowing f4 soon. } 8... Nh6
{ This was played by Anish Giri and looks fine, addressing the f4 idea. Still I'd like to mention that LeelaZero suggests the amazing line   8...Nf6  9.f4  g5  !?! , which is fun to analyse. I did not want to make this rather rare line too complicated to study , so I decided against it as the main recommendation. }
9. f4
{ This runs right into Black's idea, but there is one important point to know. }
9... Bd4+ 10. Kh1 Ng4 11. Nf3 Ne3
{ This is the important moment.  11...Nf2+  is a huge mistake due to  12.Rxf2  Bxf2  13.Qe2  Bd4  14.e5  , with a large advantage for White. }
12. Bxe3 Bxe3 { Black is fine in this rather unusual position. } *

With the open diagonal preparing b4 makes little sense and Be3 blunders b2. In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7  (- lines #1-6.)  Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. h3
{ A useful waiting move and the most common choice by White. I need to mention that the whole ...Qc7 approach is rather new and therefore we don't have hundreds of games to rely upon. This is not a negative point of course, there are still many new ideas to uncover. }
7... e5
{ I wondered if it makes sense to further delay ...e5, as we sometimes do in other lines. One example for this concept is 5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7 7. Nc3 Nf6, trying to provoke h3. Here h3 is already played and White's coming queenside play is slowed down a bit, so going 7... e5 now seems fine.   One remarkable line I'd like to mention is  7...b6  , which was my main candidate for a waiting move. LeelaZero suggests  8.a4  a5  9.e5 !?  against this , which is rather irritating. Taking this pawn gives White strong compensation and  9...Nh6  (how else to develop ?)  (didn't convince me either.)  I wonder if anybody would play 9. e5 !?, but in any case I didn't see anything wrong with 7... e5, so let's complete the Botvinnik structure.  It was also tested twice by the World Champion, so it's good enough for us 😊 }
8. a3
{ This move was played by Fabiano Caruana against the World Champion in Stavanger 2019, but it seems less testing than playing 8. Be3 first. }
8... Nf6 9. b4 { This move is more dangerous than Caruana's choice of  9.Be3. }
9... cxb4
{ It is important to remember that  9...c4  - the correct reply to 9. Be3 - is not good here due to  10.Bb2  , which is favourable for White. }
10. axb4 O-O 11. Be3 a6
{ Black can also try to play without this move, as currently White is not threatening to capture on a7 anyway. After for example   11...Be6  12.Bxa7  b6  Black traps the piece. Still it is difficult to avoid it in the long run , so I suggest to play it right away. Now many moves and ideas are possible for both sides. I'll show a sample line. }
12. Nbd2 Be6 { We need to stop Nc4. } 13. Ng5 Rfe8 14. Nxe6 Rxe6
{ This position is about equal. White has the better queenside structure, but Black has ideas as well. We can still play for a later ...f5, but a slower setup with ...Nd7-f8-e6 or ... Nh5-f4 also looks reasonable. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first. White has also tried other move orders , like  5.O-O   or  5.h3  first ,  but d3 will be played usually on the next move.   One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. O-O
{ White castles kingside early, which tells you something about his intentions. His play will very likely happen on the queenside, usually involving ideas like a4-a5 and in particular a3 and b4, opening up the position.. }
6... Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,   while after  6...Qc7  White is  only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan.

I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first. White has also tried other move orders , like  5.O-O   or  5.h3  first ,  but d3 will be played usually on the next move.   One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. O-O
{ White castles kingside early, which tells you something about his intentions. His play will very likely happen on the queenside, usually involving ideas like a4-a5 and in particular a3 and b4, opening up the position.. }
6... Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,   while after  6...Qc7  White is  only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan. With the open diagonal preparing b4 makes little sense and Be3 blunders b2. In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7  (- lines #1-6.)  Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. h3
{ A useful waiting move and the most common choice by White. I need to mention that the whole ...Qc7 approach is rather new and therefore we don't have hundreds of games to rely upon. This is not a negative point of course, there are still many new ideas to uncover. }
7... e5
{ I wondered if it makes sense to further delay ...e5, as we sometimes do in other lines. One example for this concept is 5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7 7. Nc3 Nf6, trying to provoke h3. Here h3 is already played and White's coming queenside play is slowed down a bit, so going 7... e5 now seems fine.   One remarkable line I'd like to mention is  7...b6  , which was my main candidate for a waiting move. LeelaZero suggests  8.a4  a5  9.e5 !?  against this , which is rather irritating. Taking this pawn gives White strong compensation and  9...Nh6  (how else to develop ?)  (didn't convince me either.)  I wonder if anybody would play 9. e5 !?, but in any case I didn't see anything wrong with 7... e5, so let's complete the Botvinnik structure.  It was also tested twice by the World Champion, so it's good enough for us 😊 }
8. Be3
{ Aronian has tried this move in a Blitz game against Magnus Carlsen, in Stavanger 2019. }
8... b6 9. a4 a5
{ As mentioned on more than one occasion: if White plays a4, you need to go ...a5, so just play the move and press the clock, if you are actually sitting at a physical board : - }
10. Na3 { We are following the Blitz game B. Amin-M.Carlsen, Abidjan 2019. }
10... Ne7
{ A setup with  10...Nf6  followed by ...Nd7 is possible, but this move is more active, still retaining the possibility of a quick ...f5. }
11. Nc4 Be6
{ Attention ! This position is closed at the moment, but White has the idea to play b4 ! next, which might be fatal, depending on what you play. For instance, if you want to 'prepare' ...Be6 with   11...h6  ,  12.b4 !  is going to be terrible for Black , as  12...axb4  13.a5  is very powerful. The game move 11.... Be6 is stopping b4 entirely, as you can always chop the knight on c4. }
12. Ng5 Bxc4 13. dxc4 h6 14. Nf3 Nc8
{ A useful regrouping. The knight will be better placed on d6. } 15. Nd2 O-O
16. Qe2 Nd6 17. Rad1 Rae8 18. b3 f5
{ Black has a slight initiative, but Amin managed to defend this position against the World Champion. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first. White has also tried other move orders , like  5.O-O   or  5.h3  first ,  but d3 will be played usually on the next move.   One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. O-O
{ White castles kingside early, which tells you something about his intentions. His play will very likely happen on the queenside, usually involving ideas like a4-a5 and in particular a3 and b4, opening up the position.. }
6... Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,   while after  6...Qc7  White is  only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan. With the open diagonal preparing b4 makes little sense and Be3 blunders b2. In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7  (- lines #1-6.)  Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. h3
{ A useful waiting move and the most common choice by White. I need to mention that the whole ...Qc7 approach is rather new and therefore we don't have hundreds of games to rely upon. This is not a negative point of course, there are still many new ideas to uncover. }
7... e5
{ I wondered if it makes sense to further delay ...e5, as we sometimes do in other lines. One example for this concept is 5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7 7. Nc3 Nf6, trying to provoke h3. Here h3 is already played and White's coming queenside play is slowed down a bit, so going 7... e5 now seems fine.   One remarkable line I'd like to mention is  7...b6  , which was my main candidate for a waiting move. LeelaZero suggests  8.a4  a5  9.e5 !?  against this , which is rather irritating. Taking this pawn gives White strong compensation and  9...Nh6  (how else to develop ?)  (didn't convince me either.)  I wonder if anybody would play 9. e5 !?, but in any case I didn't see anything wrong with 7... e5, so let's complete the Botvinnik structure.  It was also tested twice by the World Champion, so it's good enough for us 😊 }
8. Be3
{ Aronian has tried this move in a Blitz game against Magnus Carlsen, in Stavanger 2019. }
8... b6 9. a3
{ This looks like the most principled move, directly going for the b4 push. }
9... f5
{ I suggest this sharp move , which is yet untested in practice. There is nothing particularly wrong about  9...Ne7   or  9...Nf6  , but the arising complications are fascinating and very tough for White to handle if he does not know how to continue and needs to figure it out over the board. As it is a new move , this is very likely to be the case. }
10. exf5
{ Not strictly forced, but allowing f5-f4 to happen is at least risky for White. }
10... gxf5
{ White needs to generate some concrete play now, based on his superior development. If we get to play ...Ne7 and ...O-O Black will just be better with the bishop pair and strong centre. }
11. Bg5 h6
{ Black needs to insert this move. In the coming complications it is essential to control the g5-square. This point will become clearer some moves later. }
12. Bh4 Ne7 13. Bxe7
{ The only critical move. Otherwise ...Ng6 and ...O-O is more than OK for us. }
13... Qxe7 14. Re1 O-O 15. Nbd2
{ This is White's idea behind 11. Bg5: quick pressure on the e5-pawn and on the e-file. The concrete threat is Nxe5 !, so we need to move the queen again. }
15... Qc7
{ White needs to act quickly now. If we are allowed to play ...Bd7 and ...Rae8 we are just better. Let's check two possibilities. }
16. Nc4
{ Very critical , as we don't have a slow defence now. After  16...Re8 ?  17.Nh4 !  ,  intending Qh5, White is much better. }
16... e4 { Unleashing the bishop on g7. } 17. dxe4 Be6
{ Black is fine in this complicated position. There are some options now for White, but I'd like to show just one to illustrate why ...h6 is such an important move to have in. }
18. Nd6 Bxb2
{ We can simply take this pawn. Without ...h6 being played Ng5 ! would be a crushing reply now ! }

The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call. The older ...Nf6-d7/...e5 plan is also perfectly viable, as is the entire 4... bxc6 complex. This means that you have a wide choice of possible lines and Magnus has played them all. I think he mostly switches the lines in order to avoid being a sitting duck, not because there is a difference in quality among them.Alright, back to some concrete moves. One general issue of the Rossolimo is that move orders are very flexible. After 4. Bxc6 dxc6 White may play with O-O soon or delay it, he may start with h3 and then d3, and so on. It is not helpful to try to learn all these permutations by heart, but rather understand some key ideas. We will check some sample lines to see how this unfolds in practice. I will also tell you more about White's plans during this overview of sample variations. }
5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first. White has also tried other move orders , like  5.O-O   or  5.h3  first ,  but d3 will be played usually on the next move.   One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. O-O
{ White castles kingside early, which tells you something about his intentions. His play will very likely happen on the queenside, usually involving ideas like a4-a5 and in particular a3 and b4, opening up the position.. }
6... Qc7
{ This is an important finesse. It is better to play this move first and delay ...e5 for a moment. After the immediate   6...e5  White starts his play on the queenside with  7.Be3  b6  8.a3  ,   while after  6...Qc7  White is  only left with moves that don't help that much with this plan. With the open diagonal preparing b4 makes little sense and Be3 blunders b2. In the World Championships Match Caruana now decided to play  7.Re1  , after which  7...e5  transposes to 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Re1 e5 7. d3 Qc7  (- lines #1-6.)  Yet another and very common move order to reach this position is 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qc7. }
7. h3
{ A useful waiting move and the most common choice by White. I need to mention that the whole ...Qc7 approach is rather new and therefore we don't have hundreds of games to rely upon. This is not a negative point of course, there are still many new ideas to uncover. }
7... e5
{ I wondered if it makes sense to further delay ...e5, as we sometimes do in other lines. One example for this concept is 5. d3 Bg7 6. O-O Qc7 7. Nc3 Nf6, trying to provoke h3. Here h3 is already played and White's coming queenside play is slowed down a bit, so going 7... e5 now seems fine.   One remarkable line I'd like to mention is  7...b6  , which was my main candidate for a waiting move. LeelaZero suggests  8.a4  a5  9.e5 !?  against this , which is rather irritating. Taking this pawn gives White strong compensation and  9...Nh6  (how else to develop ?)  (didn't convince me either.)  I wonder if anybody would play 9. e5 !?, but in any case I didn't see anything wrong with 7... e5, so let's complete the Botvinnik structure.  It was also tested twice by the World Champion, so it's good enough for us 😊 }
8. Be3
{ Aronian has tried this move in a Blitz game against Magnus Carlsen, in Stavanger 2019. }
8... b6 9. a3
{ This looks like the most principled move, directly going for the b4 push. }
9... f5
{ I suggest this sharp move , which is yet untested in practice. There is nothing particularly wrong about  9...Ne7   or  9...Nf6  , but the arising complications are fascinating and very tough for White to handle if he does not know how to continue and needs to figure it out over the board. As it is a new move , this is very likely to be the case. }
10. exf5
{ Not strictly forced, but allowing f5-f4 to happen is at least risky for White. }
10... gxf5
{ White needs to generate some concrete play now, based on his superior development. If we get to play ...Ne7 and ...O-O Black will just be better with the bishop pair and strong centre. }
11. Re1 Ne7 12. Bg5 Ng6
{ it is important to avoid  12...O-O  , as after  13.Bxe7  Qxe7  14.Nbd2  Qc7  15.Nc4  we reach the 11. Bg5 line without the move ...h6 being played. This is a significant difference, as demonstrated in the analysis of 11. Bg5. }
13. Nxe5
{ This must be critical. If Black manages to castle and organize his position the long term advantages are too important  (centre and bishop pair)  . }
13... Nxe5 14. f4 O-O 15. fxe5 Bxe5
{ A very tense position. According to my analysis Black is fine here. } 16. Nd2
{ This feels like the critical choice. After some slow move black organizes with ...Bd7 and ....Rae8. }
16... Bxb2 { This works, so why not ? } 17. Re7 Bd4+ 18. Kh1 Qd6 19. Qh5 Qg6
{ White has enough activity to hold the balance, but not more. The whole line with 9... f5 is fun to analyse. If you have some spare time, add some of your own analysis to the lines presented here. This will be helpful, not only for your opening play, but your overall dynamic feel of the game. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering the capture on c6. For an overview about this scenario please see the notes after White's fourth move. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. Bxc6 dxc6
{ I selected this move for the repertoire , but Magnus Carlsen has also played  4...bxc6  with success , for example in a must-win game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup.  I have chosen ...dxc6 for three reasons:   1. White may also take on c6 after 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6, when 6... bxc6 is dubious and you need to take with the d-pawn anyway. This later capture on c6 is a somewhat different story than 4. Bxc6, but it is still useful to have a consistent approach: always take with the d-pawn is easier to remember.  2. After ...dxc6 Black usually builds a Botvinnik structure with ...e5, which fits well with other repertoire choices.  3. Magnus has played ...dxc6 far more often than ....bxc6, so we have more information to help us construct our repertoire. Now, back to the structure that we have on the board. After taking with the d-pawn it makes a lot of sense to play with ...e5 and go for a Botvinnik setup. Compared to other combinations of ...c5 and ...e5 here the pawn on c6 covers the d5-square, so one drawback of the Botvinnik is not present here.One interesting way to evaluate the Botvinnik setup here is to think about it in a different way: what else is there ? I suggest to check every piece and figure out where to develop them in a sensible way. Black's f8-bishop will go to g7, alright.But what about the bishop on c8 ? Where to develop this piece ? We don't want to play ...Bg4, as we don't intend to take on f3, so where to go ? In fact the bishop will often just stay on c8, because it has no great square to go to. Maybe it could be good on e6, but here is where the Botvinnik setup would make some sense. It looks much more harmonious to play ...e5 first and only then play ...Be6, placing it behind the pawn chain.Now, finally we get to the knight on g8. It is tough to find a good spot for the knight. On f6 it just looks at protected pawns and squares. A closer look reveals that d4 or sometimes f4 would be good squares, but this requires a long knight tour via g8-f6-d7-f8-e6 and finally d4/f4. And again this idea looks like it fits well with having a pawn on e5, clamping down on the dark squares.Of course ...e5 may also be combined with a later ...f5 advance, as we have seen numerous times in the Botvinnik pawn structures. One important point to note is that ... e5 does not worsen the bishop on g7 all that much, as it actually does not do much on the open long diagonal.Alright, so we have figured out that ...e5 makes sense and maybe the knight should transfer to d4 or maybe f4 in the long run. How to translate that into moves ? The World Champion has tried two approaches to this line. I am going to describe both and then explain what I have chosen for this course.Let's have a look at the first approach: a good way to implement the Botvinnik setup is to play the moves ...Bg7, then first ...Nf6-d7, ...e5 and go for ...Nf8-e6 next. Magnus played this setup multiple times, for example in the very first game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana.Please note that if you start with ...Bg7 and ...e5, going ...Nf6-d7 next is tough, as you leave e5 unprotected. This means that you have to commit your knight to f6 and d7 early on, which limits Black's options somewhat. That sounds like a negative point, but in fact this approach enjoys a very sound reputation.However in 2019 Magnus started to change his approach in this line, which leads us to the second way of implementing the Botvinnik setup. The new idea is to not play the knight to f6 early on, but play other useful moves first and only later decide what the knight is supposed to do. Those useful moves will be an early ....e5 and also ...Qc7, which lends some protection to the e5-pawn and allows a later ...Nf6 under the right circumstances. One point is that this way you may play ...Nf6-h5 ! in some cases, which is impossible in the first approach, which requires ... Nf6-d7 before ...e5 is played. Another key point is that Black also gains the option to directly play ...f5, even before the knight is developed at all. This leads to very interesting and sharp play, which poses fresh problems.I decided to recommend this new approach with an early ...Qc7/...e5 for this repertoire, which is a tough call.

5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move. White can hardly do without it , so it is played first.

One exception is  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  , after which you can go for  6...e5  ,  which would transpose to 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, a line that is part of our repertoire anyway -  (see lines #1-5.) }
5... Bg7 6. h3
{ This is White's most popular move. It does not look all that obvious why this is the case , but a closer look reveals some points. It is a very flexible move that fits into many concepts. White does not yet commit to castling kingside , keeping both options open. If you want to delay  6.O-O  , there is not much else left actually.   You may play  6.Nc3  ,  but this limits White's options on the queenside, as sometimes you'd rather play Nb1-d2-c4, for example. }
6... Qc7
{ Our trademark move. We like to wait with ...e5 until White has committed to a setup. Carlsen has also played the immediate   6...e5  - see model game #9 -   and  6...Nf6  - model game #10. }
7. Nc3
{ White often plays  7.O-O  here ,  which leads to lines examined via the 6. O-O move order. The early Nc3 usually signals that White does not want to castle kingside soon, as you'd like to be more flexible with your queenside after going O-O. Ideas like a3+b4 are more effective with the knight being able to go to d2/a3 and c4 later. }
7... e5 8. Be3 b6 9. Qd2
{ Against  9.O-O  we play  9...Nf6  ,  intending to go for the ...Nh5 plan. This is a transposition to 6. O-O again. }
9... h6
{ This is played to avoid Bh6 after a knight move. It is also useful to control g5, of course. Now I am unsure about White's best approach, so we will examine two moves that make sense to me. }
10. Ng1
{ This looks a bit artificial, but f4 is a typical pawn break in such a position. }
10... Ne7 11. f4 Be6 12. Nf3 exf4 13. Bxf4 Qd7
{ I am happy with Black's position here. We will castle queenside and ...g5 and ...Ng6 will be a good way to improve the knight. }

Levon Aronian played this against Magnus Carlsen in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup, and I think one reason was to avoid the setup usually favoured by the World Champion. }
4... Nf6
{ This was Carlsen's reply against Aronian, and the best move it seems. I looked at some alternatives to try to get into ...e5 positions, but they don't work out all that well. After   4...e5  , White has the very annoying move  5.Na3  !. This is not very obvious and not going to happen all of the time , but it is just too bad for Black to recommend.   Better is  4...Bg7  , which would transpose to lines we have in our repertoire anyway after  5.O-O  e5  ,   but after  4...Bg7  White will of course play the immediate  5.d4  , after which I don't see Black equalising. Black can play interesting moves like  5...Qa5   or  5...Qb6  ,  but these don't convince fully. Still it's interesting to research this if you have some time on your hands. You need to keep in mind that 4. c3 is very rare, so spending lots of time on it won't pay off that much. }
5. e5 Nd5 6. O-O Bg7 7. d4 cxd4 8. cxd4 O-O 9. Nc3
{ White plays this almost all of the time. Against slower moves our idea is to attack e5 with ...d6, either provoking a capture on d6 or take on e5 ourselves, creating a target on e5. This whole position is quite similar in nature to the Alapin Sicilian. }
9... Nxc3
{ The simple solution , but  9...Nc7  is also fine and a good alternative. }
10. bxc3 d6
{ We need to attack the centre and open up the position for the Bishops. } 11.
exd6 Qxd6
{ This position is about equal. White has active pieces, but the pawns on d4 and c3 may prove to be weak in the long run. We don't mind trading minor pieces in this structure and also aim for a blockade of the pawns on the squares d5 and c4. From here both side have some options. I'd like to show one instructive idea. }
12. a4 Qc7 { Black anticipates the Ba3 idea. } 13. Ba3 Be6 14. Re1 Bd5
{ This is the idea I wanted to show. Black gets enough compensation for a pawn after this move. }
15. Bxc6 Qxc6 16. Bxe7 Rfe8
{ Black's Bishop on d5 is very strong and Black has targets on c3 and a4 to attack. Black has enough compensation for the pawn and the easier game in practice. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations. We will try to use the Botvinnik-setup with an early ...e5 as often as possible, following the example of the World Champion. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }

5. Qe2
{ This was Aronian's choice. It is interesting to compare 4. c3 Nf6 to the line 4. O-O Bg7 5. c3 Nf6 - we play 5... e5 in this repertoire. After 5... Nf6 White has a much wider choice. In addition to 6. e5 or 6. Qe2, he also has the gambit move 6. d4 and most importantly 6. Re1, which is rather complex. }
5... Bg7 6. d4
{ White can also play this before castling, but it very likely transposes. }
6... cxd4 7. cxd4 O-O 8. d5
{ Here  8.O-O  looks normal and is indeed the transposition to the game Aronian-Carlsen - see line #6 and further.  The move 8. d5 instead is no problem at all if you reply correctly. }
8... a6 { This is important. We first drive the bishop to a worse square. } 9.
Bd3 Nb4
{ And Black is fine. We have ...e6 and ...b5 on the cards to develop and attack the centre. }

{ This is a rare move order for White, but it has an interesting point. After 4. c3 it is difficult for Black to steer the game into our usual Botvinnik setup with ... e5 to come. Levon Aronian played this against Magnus Carlsen in the 2019 Sinquefield Cup, and I think one reason was to avoid the setup usually favoured by the World Champion. }
4... Nf6
{ This was Carlsen's reply against Aronian, and the best move it seems. I looked at some alternatives to try to get into ...e5 positions, but they don't work out all that well. After   4...e5  , White has the very annoying move  5.Na3  !. This is not very obvious and not going to happen all of the time , but it is just too bad for Black to recommend.   Better is  4...Bg7  , which would transpose to lines we have in our repertoire anyway after  5.O-O  e5  ,   but after  4...Bg7  White will of course play the immediate  5.d4  , after which I don't see Black equalising. Black can play interesting moves like  5...Qa5   or  5...Qb6  ,  but these don't convince fully. Still it's interesting to research this if you have some time on your hands. You need to keep in mind that 4. c3 is very rare, so spending lots of time on it won't pay off that much. }
5. Qe2
{ This was Aronian's choice. It is interesting to compare 4. c3 Nf6 to the line 4. O-O Bg7 5. c3 Nf6 - we play 5... e5 in this repertoire. After 5... Nf6 White has a much wider choice. In addition to 6. e5 or 6. Qe2, he also has the gambit move 6. d4 and most importantly 6. Re1, which is rather complex. }
5... Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 cxd4 8. cxd4 d6
{ Magnus went for a dark squared setup against Levon Aronian , which is his usual preference - compare to the frequent use of the Botvinnik setup. Black's other approach here is to play  8...d5  or even 7... d5 without the trade on d4. Both ways of playing are perfectly acceptable. }
9. h3
{ White was concerned about ... Bg4, which would help Black to increase the influence over the d4-square and possibly trade the relatively useless bishop on c8. }
9... Nd7
{ Black was also doing fine with  9...a6  in earlier games , but we follow Magnus Carlsen's example. }
10. Rd1 a6 11. Bxc6
{ Certainly a difficult decision for White at this point. Keeping the bishop might be more testing. }
11... bxc6 12. Be3 a5 13. Qc2 c5
{ And Black had equalised in the game L.Aronian-M.Carlsen, Sinquefield Cup Saint Louis 2019. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations. We will try to use the Botvinnik-setup with an early ...e5 as often as possible, following the example of the World Champion. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. O-O
{ White's flexible choice instead of taking on c6. After our natural reply 4... Bg7 there is a parting of the ways. }
4... Bg7
{ After our natural reply White's main moves are  5.Re1   and  5.c3.  Against basically all White moves we are going for an ...e5 based setup, the so-called Botvinnik formation.   If White plays a slow move that I have not covered now , like  5.d3   or  5.Qe2  , the Botvinnik setup is going to be effective as well , and will usually lead to other lines via transposition.   For example after the rare  5.d3  you go  5...e5  and now  6.Nc3  transposes to 5. Nc3   or  6.c3  Nge7  7.Re1  is examined via 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 Nge7 7. d3. Our setup is basically the same, so different White move orders can easily lead to the same position. }
5. Bxc6
{ This is rather rare, because there is little point in taking now compared to move four. After 4. Bxc6 White has more options, while here O-O is already on the board. }
5... dxc6
{ We always take with the d-pawn. Now this position I examine via the move order 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg7, covered in the previous chapter. }

This line actually scores very well for White , but I think I found some good new ideas to strengthen Black's cause.  One important consideration is: if you don't play master level players or theoretically very well prepared opponents it is very likely that White will not go for this pawn sacrifice and this gives Black a fairly easy game with structures that are well known to us.   I'd like to mention that Black's main alternative is  5...Nf6  , which is actually the most popular move and satisfactory for Black as well.

If White plays a slow move that I have not covered now , like  5.d3   or  5.Qe2  , the Botvinnik setup is going to be effective as well , and will usually lead to other lines via transposition.   For example after the rare  5.d3  you go  5...e5  and now  6.Nc3  transposes to 5. Nc3   or  6.c3  Nge7  7.Re1  is examined via 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 Nge7 7. d3.

One important consideration is: if you don't play master level players or theoretically very well prepared opponents it is very likely that White will not go for this pawn sacrifice and this gives Black a fairly easy game with structures that are well known to us.   I'd like to mention that Black's main alternative is  5...Nf6  , which is actually the most popular move and satisfactory for Black as well.  The main reason for not selecting this move is that does not fit all that well with the rest of the repertoire and takes a lot more effort to learn compared to 5... e5. }

7. d4

{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations. We will try to use the Botvinnik-setup with an early ...e5 as often as possible, following the example of the World Champion. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. O-O
{ White's flexible choice instead of taking on c6. After our natural reply 4... Bg7 there is a parting of the ways. }
4... Bg7
{ After our natural reply White's main moves are  5.Re1   and  5.c3.  Against basically all White moves we are going for an ...e5 based setup, the so-called Botvinnik formation.   If White plays a slow move that I have not covered now , like  5.d3   or  5.Qe2  , the Botvinnik setup is going to be effective as well , and will usually lead to other lines via transposition.   For example after the rare  5.d3  you go  5...e5  and now  6.Nc3  transposes to 5. Nc3   or  6.c3  Nge7  7.Re1  is examined via 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 Nge7 7. d3. Our setup is basically the same, so different White move orders can easily lead to the same position. }
5. c3
{ This is a very popular move, but it has not yet been tried against Magnus Carlsen, so we don't now what he has planned against 5. c3. What we do know is that Magnus has a preference for the Botvinnik setup with ...e5, so I decided to recommend 5... e5 here. }
5... e5
{ The move  5...e5  is the most consistent with our repertoire choices and also the sharpest move here. The reason is that White only has one serious way to fight for an advantage , and this approach involves a pawn sacrifice. After  6.d4  cxd4  7.cxd4  exd4  we are winning a pawn , but White gets good compensation. This line actually scores very well for White , but I think I found some good new ideas to strengthen Black's cause.  One important consideration is: if you don't play master level players or theoretically very well prepared opponents it is very likely that White will not go for this pawn sacrifice and this gives Black a fairly easy game with structures that are well known to us.   I'd like to mention that Black's main alternative is  5...Nf6  , which is actually the most popular move and satisfactory for Black as well.  The main reason for not selecting this move is that does not fit all that well with the rest of the repertoire and takes a lot more effort to learn compared to 5... e5. }
6. Na3
{ The only point to remember about this line is to avoid 7... d6 on the next move. Let's have a look. }
6... Nge7 7. Nc4 O-O
{ Instead  7...d6  8.d4  is a bit awkward for Black.  With castling first we are giving up the bishop pair, but White has lost a lot of time with this knight tour. }
8. Nd6 Qc7 9. Nxc8 Raxc8 10. d3 d5
{ Black has a good centre and ...a6 and ...b5 will gain more space on the queenside. It should be about equal. }

10. e5

10. Bd6

White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo.

White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O.

He is better developed and has already castled, while we still need to develop the knight to get the king out of the middle of the board. An important idea for White is the move Bd6, which can be very annoying to face, as it blocks the d-pawn and makes is difficult for Black to coordinate.So White definitely has enough for the pawn, but I don't think it is all doom and gloom for Black. I suggest to play a less explored concept against this line and I doubt that many White players will be able to handle this correctly, in particular without any computer assisted preparation. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations. We will try to use the Botvinnik-setup with an early ...e5 as often as possible, following the example of the World Champion. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }

4... Bg7
{ After our natural reply White's main moves are  5.Re1   and  5.c3.  Against basically all White moves we are going for an ...e5 based setup, the so-called Botvinnik formation.   If White plays a slow move that I have not covered now , like  5.d3   or  5.Qe2  , the Botvinnik setup is going to be effective as well , and will usually lead to other lines via transposition.   For example after the rare  5.d3  you go  5...e5  and now  6.Nc3  transposes to 5. Nc3   or  6.c3  Nge7  7.Re1  is examined via 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 Nge7 7. d3. Our setup is basically the same, so different White move orders can easily lead to the same position. }
5. c3

5... e5
{ The move  5...e5  is the most consistent with our repertoire choices and also the sharpest move here. The reason is that White only has one serious way to fight for an advantage , and this approach involves a pawn sacrifice. After  6.d4  cxd4  7.cxd4  exd4  we are winning a pawn , but White gets good compensation. This line actually scores very well for White , but I think I found some good new ideas to strengthen Black's cause.  One important consideration is: if you don't play master level players or theoretically very well prepared opponents it is very likely that White will not go for this pawn sacrifice and this gives Black a fairly easy game with structures that are well known to us.   I'd like to mention that Black's main alternative is  5...Nf6  , which is actually the most popular move and satisfactory for Black as well.

He is better developed and has already castled, while we still need to develop the knight to get the king out of the middle of the board. An important idea for White is the move Bd6, which can be very annoying to face, as it blocks the d-pawn and makes is difficult for Black to coordinate.So White definitely has enough for the pawn, but I don't think it is all doom and gloom for Black. I suggest to play a less explored concept against this line and I doubt that many White players will be able to handle this correctly, in particular without any computer assisted preparation. }
8... a6
{ Black's main move is  8...Nge7  ,  but it does not fare well in practice. I think the less common 8... a6 is better, as it immediately forces a decision about the bishop placement. This is very relevant, as the move ...a6 is part of Black's play anyway, but if you play it later, White has a wider choice of critical replies, for example Bd3 becomes an option. This bishop retreat is completely harmless now. }
9. Bc4 d6
{ This is the most principled choice. We stop Bd6 and point at the drawback of 9. Bc4 compared to 9. Ba4, which does prevent 9... d6. I also looked at   9...Nge7  , thinking of the sequence  10.Bd6  b5  11.Bb3  Bb7  ,  which does transpose to the main line of 9. Ba4. This would be a neat way to save some learning effort,   but after  9...Nge7  10.Bd6  b5  White has the improvement  11.Bd5 !  ,  which poses more problems for Black. I think that this is actually also quite playable, so feel free to explore this alternative. It should be noted that 11. Bd5 is not a very natural move in my mind, and most people would just play 11. Bb3 to transpose. From a scientific point of view 9... d6 is the better move however, as I see not problems at all for Black to equalise. }
10. Qb3
{ This is the most testing move. White needs to act quickly here. If we just get to play ...Nf6 and ...O-O White will have no compensation. }
10... Na5
{ This is the only good move at this point, leading to some tactical play. It is important to consider that White very likely has no knowledge of the whole line and needs to figure the following lines out over the board. }
11. Bxf7+ Ke7
{ Now we see the first point: the queen needs to keep the bishop protected, so there is only Qd5 available, now or after inserting the check on g5. }
12. Qd5 Nf6 13. Bg5 { Again forced to keep the material. } 13... Rf8
{ And now the bishop on f7 is trapped. White actually needed to foresee that this position is still fine for him when he played 9. Qb3. I need to mention that 13... Nc6 instead is also interesting, but 13... Rf8 seems to be more straightforward. A practical drawback of   13...Nc6  is  14.Qb3  , after which we need to force a draw with  14...Na5. }
14. Re1
{ This move was actually played in two games, which is surprising. The whole line is relatively unexplored, so having two games reaching this position is remarkable. In both games Black had a completely winning position soon, but blundered everything away later. }
14... Nc6
{ This is the only playable move, but it is good for Black. We need to anticipate the e5-push. }
15. Nxd4
{ This was played in one of the mentioned games, but after the simple reply White clearly had insufficient compensation. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations. We will try to use the Botvinnik-setup with an early ...e5 as often as possible, following the example of the World Champion. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. O-O
{ White's flexible choice instead of taking on c6. After our natural reply 4... Bg7 there is a parting of the ways. }
4... Bg7
{ After our natural reply White's main moves are  5.Re1   and  5.c3.  Against basically all White moves we are going for an ...e5 based setup, the so-called Botvinnik formation.   If White plays a slow move that I have not covered now , like  5.d3   or  5.Qe2  , the Botvinnik setup is going to be effective as well , and will usually lead to other lines via transposition.   For example after the rare  5.d3  you go  5...e5  and now  6.Nc3  transposes to 5. Nc3   or  6.c3  Nge7  7.Re1  is examined via 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 Nge7 7. d3. Our setup is basically the same, so different White move orders can easily lead to the same position. }
5. c3
{ This is a very popular move, but it has not yet been tried against Magnus Carlsen, so we don't now what he has planned against 5. c3. What we do know is that Magnus has a preference for the Botvinnik setup with ...e5, so I decided to recommend 5... e5 here. }
5... e5
{ The move  5...e5  is the most consistent with our repertoire choices and also the sharpest move here. The reason is that White only has one serious way to fight for an advantage , and this approach involves a pawn sacrifice. After  6.d4  cxd4  7.cxd4  exd4  we are winning a pawn , but White gets good compensation. This line actually scores very well for White , but I think I found some good new ideas to strengthen Black's cause.  One important consideration is: if you don't play master level players or theoretically very well prepared opponents it is very likely that White will not go for this pawn sacrifice and this gives Black a fairly easy game with structures that are well known to us.   I'd like to mention that Black's main alternative is  5...Nf6  , which is actually the most popular move and satisfactory for Black as well.  The main reason for not selecting this move is that does not fit all that well with the rest of the repertoire and takes a lot more effort to learn compared to 5... e5. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, named after American-French-Greek-Russian GM Nicolas Rossolimo  (yes, I copied the Wikipedia intro)  . The Rossolimo nowadays has the reputation of being the most challenging try against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 if White seeks to avoid the open Sicilian. White struggles to prove any advantage against the Sveshnikov, which is the main reason why White turns to other options.In the World Championship Match 2018 Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian in all seven games with the black pieces and in the first three encounters Fabiano Caruana went for the Rossolimo. This shows that the line is an important part of top level chess in the present and likely also in the future, as Black continues to do well in the Sveshnikov.Now, what is the idea of 3. Bb5 ? White develops the bishop and prepares kingside castling, which is a very natural way to play. White does not yet commit to a particular setup in the centre, still allowing him to play c3+d4 later in some lines.The Rossolimo in fact has a wide range of central structures, depending on the key choices to be made on the next couple of moves. The most important choice is whether White wants to capture the knight on c6 or not.This course has two chapters on the Rossolimo, split according to these two scenarios. In this chapter we are covering lines without the early capture on c6, most importantly setups starting with 4. O-O. This approach does not yet determine the central pawn structure and leads to a variety of pawn formations. We will try to use the Botvinnik-setup with an early ...e5 as often as possible, following the example of the World Champion. }
3... g6
{ Against the Rossolimo Black has two main lines: 3... e6 and 3... g6. Magnus Carlsen has played both lines, but in the overwhelming majority of the games he went for the financhetto. In many cases Black intends to set up the Botvinnik pawn formation with a later ...e5, a structure that has been a frequent guest in the World Champion's games. This not only applies for Black, but also for White. In the first rapid game of the London 2018 tiebreak Magnus played 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4, showing that he was eager to go for this structure in a game of utmost importance. }
4. O-O
{ White's flexible choice instead of taking on c6. After our natural reply 4... Bg7 there is a parting of the ways. }
4... Bg7
{ After our natural reply White's main moves are  5.Re1   and  5.c3.  Against basically all White moves we are going for an ...e5 based setup, the so-called Botvinnik formation.   If White plays a slow move that I have not covered now , like  5.d3   or  5.Qe2  , the Botvinnik setup is going to be effective as well , and will usually lead to other lines via transposition.   For example after the rare  5.d3  you go  5...e5  and now  6.Nc3  transposes to 5. Nc3   or  6.c3  Nge7  7.Re1  is examined via 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 Nge7 7. d3. Our setup is basically the same, so different White move orders can easily lead to the same position. }
5. Re1 e5
{ As usual we choose the Botvinnik setup with ...e5. This line was placed twice by Magnus Carlsen, one game being the fifth game of the World Championship Match against Fabiano Caruana. I think the only challenging moves now are   6.Bxc6  ,  the final opportunity to take the knight before ...Nge7 renders this illogical,   and the gambit style move  6.b4  , which was played by Caruana in the mentioned game.   Other moves and setups are covered elsewhere in this repertoire , for example  6.c3  is examined via the move order 5. c3 e5 6. Re1 and can be considered fine for Black.   White has also tried  6.Nc3  ,  a setup we cover via 5. Nc3.   Similarly , White sometimes plays  6.d3  , but after  6...Nge7  White will decide between putting a knight or a pawn on c3, and these are covered with the transpositions already mentioned. }
6. Bxc6 dxc6
{ This position I have examined via the move order  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bb5  g6  4.Bxc6  dxc6  5.O-O  Bg7  6.Re1  e5  - see lines #1-5 of the previous chapter.  In fact it is more common to reach it via 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 e5 6. Bxc6 dxc6, but I wanted to group all the positions of this type starting with the same move order and in the same chapter. This makes it easier to organize and learn the moves.   I'd like to mention that  6...bxc6 ?!  is less reliable , as after  7.c3 !  Ne7  8.d4  White opens up the position in his favour. The main problem is that  8...cxd4  9.cxd4  exd4  10.Nxd4  leaves Black's bishop passive on c8, but any later d-pawn move creates new weaknesses. So just take with the d-pawn, leading to a familiar structure often reached via 4. Bxc6 dxc6. }

6. b4
{ Playing in gambit style ! This move was employed by Fabiano Caruana in the 5th game of the World Championship Match, trying to surprise the World Champion. This attempt was unsuccessful, as Magnus knew exactly how to neutralize this idea.Funny side note: I had looked at the line from White's point of view for the Keep It Simple: 1. e4 repertoire and concluded that it does not promise much, exactly because of what Magnus played. It's just what the engines show after digging for a while. }
6... Nxb4 7. c3 Nc6 8. d4

8... cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4
{ Compared to the line 5. c3 e5 6. d4 cxd4 7. cxd4 exd4 White has given up the b-pawn for the tempo Re1. White has some compensation, but two pawns are two pawns ! We will play similarly to the mentioned line, with ...a6 and ... Nge7 next. }

I'll quote the whole game:  17.e5  Qc5  18.Ne4  Qxe5  19.Nf3  Qb2  20.Qd6  Nc6  21.h4  h5  22.c3  Be6  23.Qf4  bxc3  24.Qh6  c2  25.Nfg5  Rc8  26.Nh7  Qg7  27.Nhf6+  Kf8  28.Nh7+  Kg8  29.Nhf6+  Kf8  30.Nh7+  Kg8  31.Nhf6+  Kf8  32.Nh7+  and a draw was agreed. It makes sense to study this sequence of moves all the way, but I did not want to include it fully as trainable moves. 30+ moves is a bit much ! }

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation, or as it is often simply called: the 'c3-Sicilian'. The Alapin enjoys a sound reputation, but is not perceived as particularly threatening for Black. White intends to play d4 next and prepares to recapture with the c-pawn, keeping a full pawn centre. It is not surprising to learn that Black's best replies   2...d5   and  2...Nf6  immediately attack the e4-pawn and prevent the desired central pawn duo on e4 and d4. Magnus Carlsen has played both main lines in his career, but in recent years showed a preference for 2... Nf6. }
2... Nf6 3. d3
{ This is rare and does not look too threatening. However there is one point I'd like to mention. If we play  3...d5  now , White has  4.e5  Nfd7  5.f4.  It is not clear if we have anything better than going for a French structure with ...e6 soon.   A similar case is  3...Nc6  4.f4  d5  5.e5.  I'd like to suggest a different approach, avoiding this pawn structure with a white pawn coming to e5. }
3... e5 { We are stopping the e-pawn first and only then play ...d5 next. } 4.
f4
{ The only challenging move. After something like  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.Nbd2  d5  6.g3  we will get a position type that we briefly looked at via 2. g3 d5 3. d3 Nc6 4. Nd2 Nf6 5. Bg2 e5  (- line #22 in the Sidelines at move 2 chapter.) }

{ This position might also have been reached by the move order  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.c3  Nf6  4.e5  Nd5.  Now White has three main options to choose from.   He can play d4 and after ...cxd4 simple recapture with cxd4. This was always considered to be fine for Black, but you need to be alert if you want to play for a win - some lines are quite dull and to be avoided if a draw is unacceptable.  The second option is to play d4, but after ...cxd4 play the move Bc4, which often leads to gambit play. This is considered to be the main line nowadays. It's fine for Black, but more testing than the older approach with the simple recapture.  The third idea is to skip d4 altogether, but to play Bc4 now. This might transpose to approach number two later, but there are some independent options that mostly lead to quiet play. }
5. Bc4 Nb6
{ Magnus Carlsen has played this most of the time , but he also played  5...e6  in one game. In the most recent games he always went for ...Nb6, so this is our choice. }
6. Bb3 d5
{ Here Black has a good alternative in  6...c4  , and only after  7.Bc2  play  7...d5.  This was played by Magnus in a Blitz game, but he went for 6... d5 in a more recent encounter and it feels like the more consistent choice in view of 5. d4 cxd4 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Bb3 d5, which is quite similar and sometimes leads to the same positions. }
7. exd6
{ Almost mandatory.  7.d4  cxd4  8.cxd4  Bg4  is good for Black and discussed via the move order 5. d4 cxd4 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Bb3 d5 8. cxd4 Bg4 -  (line #23.) }
7... Qxd6
{ Now  8.d4  cxd4  is a common way to transpose to the Alapin main line, usually reached via 5. d4 cxd4 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Bb3 d5 8. exd6 Qxd6  (- line #24 and further. White most of time delays this move for now, though.) }
8. Na3 a6
{ This seems best and very similar to line that we have in our repertoire with the moves d4 and ...cxd4 included. In fact we will very likely transpose into this line soon. Magnus Carlsen played this way as well, in a 2007 game vs. c3-specialist Sergei Tiviakov. Two years before that game Magnus had played the worse move 8... e6 against the same opponent, but of course the second time around had the improvement ready. }
9. O-O
{ Again 9. d4 cxd4 would transpose to the Alapin main line   1.e4  c5  2.c3  Nf6  3.e5  Nd5  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.d4  cxd4  6.Bc4  Nb6  7.Bb3  d5  8.exd6  Qxd6  9.Na3  a6  , discussed in lines #24-29. }
9... Bf5
{ This is an important finesse to remember. Usually we play  ...Be6  in this line , but precisely here  9...Be6  is questionable: White has the annoying move  10.Ng5  when you can't capture on b3 due to the double attack on f7 and the hanging knight on b6 - the drawback of ...a6. Best after 10. Ng5 is  10...Bd5  , but Black is worse after  11.d3.  This leads to the conclusion: If White plays an early Na3 we are playing with ...Bf5, otherwise we prefer to challenge the b3-bishop with ...Be6. There are two cases of this early Na3, the one examined here and the line   1.e4  c5  2.c3  Nf6  3.e5  Nd5  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.d4  cxd4  6.Bc4  Nb6  7.Bb3  d5  8.exd6  Qxd6  9.Na3  a6  10.O-O  Bf5  - lines #26-29 ,  which has the moves d4 and ... cxd4 inserted. So the rule of thumb is: If White plays Na3 on move 8 or 9 we should play ...a6 and go ...Bf5 next, otherwise ...Be6 is better. }
10. Bxf7+
{ A bit of a shocker , and about the only way to avoid the transposition to the Alapin main line. The bishop sacrifice is not correct objectively , but certainly worth knowing for Black. Most of the time White just plays  10.d4  , which after  10...cxd4  transposes to the same position usually reached via 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Bb3 d5 8. exd6 Qxd6 9. Na3 a6 10. O-O Bf5,  (lines #26-29.) }
10... Kxf7 11. Qb3+
{ The next moves are forced. White checks and attacks the knight on b6 at the same time, so there is just one reply. }
11... Nd5 12. Nc4 Qd8
{ This is best , as  12...Qf6 ?  13.d4  is too dangerous. } 13. Qxb7 Rc8
{ Again a forced move. } 14. d4 Rc7 15. Qxa6 cxd4 16. Rd1 e6
{ This is suggested by the engines as the best defence and evaluated as being better for Black. Computers are trustworthy in those positions, but it's still a bit for work for a human to handle. Still, you can't avoid situations like that after incorrect sacrifices - take the material and defend, and then convert at the end. }

9... Bxb3 10. axb3 Qd3
{ The queen is extremely annoying on d3, but ready to retreat to d5 or d7 after being attacked. Both squares are better than d6, so this a gain for us. In general White's play does not scare us much after the important bishop was traded. }

It's fine for Black, but more testing than the older approach with the simple recapture.  The third idea is to skip d4 altogether, but to play Bc4 now. This might transpose to approach number two later, but there are some independent options that mostly lead to quiet play. }

5. d4 cxd4 6. cxd4 d6
{ Now White's overwhelming main line is  7.Bc4  ,   but he has tried a ton of alternatives. The only ones worth checking are  7.exd6   and  7.Nc3.  If White plays anything even less active, we have an easy game with either ...Bg4 or a ...g6 based setup.   An interesting way to look at this position is to compare it with Alekhine's Defence. See  1.e4  Nf6  2.e5  Nd5  3.d4  d6  4.Nf3  Nc6  - in our position the c-pawns are missing and therefore the only challenging move c4 is out of the picture. }

{ White insists on playing an IQP position, a pawn formation very common in the c3-Sicilian. }
7... Qxd6 8. Nc3 Bg4
{ Black is fine here. Again , a comparison to a different opening helps to assess the position. Compare this to the Caro-Kann Panov:  1.e4  c6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  cxd5  4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Nc6  6.Nf3  Bg4  7.cxd5  Nxd5  - surprisingly this is nearly identical, but we have the move ...Qd6 for free ! This is actually very useful because the only interesting move in the Caro-Kann position is  8.Qb3  , an idea that completely fails here.   If White plays  9.Qb3  here ,  9...Bxf3  10.gxf3  e6  11.Qxb7  Rb8  is good for Black. This ...Rb8 is only possible because the knight on c6 is covered.   This basically leaves White with a lame move like  9.Be2  , which clearly does not bother us at all. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation, or as it is often simply called: the 'c3-Sicilian'. The Alapin enjoys a sound reputation, but is not perceived as particularly threatening for Black. White intends to play d4 next and prepares to recapture with the c-pawn, keeping a full pawn centre. It is not surprising to learn that Black's best replies   2...d5   and  2...Nf6  immediately attack the e4-pawn and prevent the desired central pawn duo on e4 and d4. Magnus Carlsen has played both main lines in his career, but in recent years showed a preference for 2... Nf6. }
2... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ This position might also have been reached by the move order  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.c3  Nf6  4.e5  Nd5.  Now White has three main options to choose from.   He can play d4 and after ...cxd4 simple recapture with cxd4. This was always considered to be fine for Black, but you need to be alert if you want to play for a win - some lines are quite dull and to be avoided if a draw is unacceptable.  The second option is to play d4, but after ...cxd4 play the move Bc4, which often leads to gambit play. This is considered to be the main line nowadays. It's fine for Black, but more testing than the older approach with the simple recapture.  The third idea is to skip d4 altogether, but to play Bc4 now. This might transpose to approach number two later, but there are some independent options that mostly lead to quiet play. }
5. d4 cxd4 6. cxd4 d6
{ Now White's overwhelming main line is  7.Bc4  ,   but he has tried a ton of alternatives. The only ones worth checking are  7.exd6   and  7.Nc3.  If White plays anything even less active, we have an easy game with either ...Bg4 or a ...g6 based setup.   An interesting way to look at this position is to compare it with Alekhine's Defence. See  1.e4  Nf6  2.e5  Nd5  3.d4  d6  4.Nf3  Nc6  - in our position the c-pawns are missing and therefore the only challenging move c4 is out of the picture. }
7. Bc4 Nb6
{ Magnus has also played the move  7...e6  here , for instance in a blitz game against Wei Yi in 2019. He seems to switch between this approach and the knight retreat.   You may also compare this to  1.e4  c5  2.c3  Nf6  3.e5  Nd5  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.d4  cxd4  6.Bc4  , after which he plays  6...Nb6  ,   but has also tried  6...e6  occasionally. }
8. Bb3 { This is a sideline that can lead to interesting play. } 8... dxe5
{ You should definitely play this move and avoid 8... d5. It is useful to compare to   1.e4  c5  2.c3  Nf6  3.e5  Nd5  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.d4  cxd4  6.Bc4  Nb6  7.Bb3  d5  8.cxd4.  Now it is our move and we play  8...Bg4  , developing the bishop actively.   Here after  8...d5  it is the same position , but White to move  ! White will play either  9.h3   or  9.Nh4  , as happened in the game F. Vallejo Pons-M.Carlsen in Sanxenxo 2004. Magnus had some problems early on in his career in the Alapin , but nowadays has it all worked out as you would expect. }
9. d5
{ The only interesting way to play the 8. Bb3 line. White goes for a pawn sac. }
9... Na5 10. Nc3 f6
{ This is the ambitious way to play.  10...Nxb3  11.Qxb3  e6  is more conservative , but this seems to give White adequate compensation for the pawn. }

13. Nd2
{ White covers c4 this way. This move is suggested as best by the engines, but it does not look scary to me. }
13... Kf7
{ A cool reply, keeping many options open. The f8-bishop may prove useful on its current square after a later ...e6 or can be used on h6, as we will see. }
14. f4 Nxb3 15. Qxb3 Bh6
{ White has some compensation for the pawn, but it is not enough it seems. The whole line with 8. Bb3 and 9. d5 is quite interesting and not particularly well explored. It does not look too scary to me  (a central pawn is nice to have !)  , but White's play is certainly not to be underestimated. }

10... Qxe6 11. Nxd4 Nxd4 12. Qxd4 Rd8
{ This position has been discussed since the early 1980s. White has tried all the possible queen moves, but it turned out that Black is fine against all of them. And why not ? Our development is fine and we still have a central pawn. The only issue is that we are still some moves away from castling. }
13. Qh4
{ This is the most popular move for White by far and the only one that needs to be checked more closely. Against other queen moves, a simple approach is to just play ...Qc6, to allow ...e6 next. }
13... h5
{ Black is also fine with other moves. There is the complicated move  13...Qe2  , but these lines sometimes go very deep and it still often ends in a draw by a perpetual  (yes, they are deeply explored !)  (.)  The original solution 13... h5 requires no memorization and leads to interesting play. Our idea is to play ...Qg4, provoking a queen trade on our terms. }
14. h3
{ White stops our idea, but now we are surprisingly quick in starting play on the kingside ! }
14... f6 15. Nd2 g5
{ And Black grabs the initiative on the kingside. Our king has a good spot on f7. This line with 13... h5 and the more concrete 13... Qe2 basically shuts down the old main line for White. }

{ White immediately tries to make sense of the bishop on c4, hoping for the e-pawn to move and open up the diagonal for the bishop. }
6... gxf5
{ I recommend to take the pawn and basically call White's bluff. The arising positions are somewhat murky , but good for Black. If you like a simpler option the more conservative move  6...Nge7  leads to a good game for Black as well. }
7. d3 Nge7
{ I don't think White has enough for the pawn. Let's check a possible line. }
8. O-O O-O 9. Qe1

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ White just develops the knight to its most natural and best square. This move does not yet tell you what White's intention is. He might play a setup like the closed Sicilian with g3 next or the Grand Prix with f4.The other point of playing 2. Nc3 first, might be to ask Black about his intentions. It is important to note that White still is able to play 3. Nf3 or 3. Nge2 and switch to an open Sicilian. We play 2... Nc6, as this fits perfectly with our open Sicilian of choice.But what if we wanted to play the Najdorf or the Dragon ? Then 2... d6 would be the move to play, avoiding to be tricked into an open Sicilian that is not part of the repertoire. After 2... d6 White has gained some options, for example after 3. f4  (Grand Prix Attack)  . No problem at all for us, but other Sicilian players need to worry about move orders after 2. Nc3. }
2... Nc6
{ We are not worried about a switch to an open Sicilian, as ...Nc6 fits perfectly with the Sveshnikov. After   3.Nge2  Nf6  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  we would transpose into our line of choice.  It also should be mentioned that being able to play 2... Nc6 is very useful, as this allows us to play more ambitiously against many of the offbeat lines. One key point is that the move ...d5 is often possible in one go, compared to ... d6 first.After 2... Nc6 White has a wide choice. With 3. Nge2 or 3. Nf3 he can still try to play an open Sicilian, but there are some independent possibilities. The most important ones are the closed Sicilian after 3. g3 and the Grand Prix Attack after 3. f4. Both systems are popular on the Club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. f4
{ This is the so-called 'Grand Prix Attack'. It was successfully employed decades ago by some players in a tournament series in the UK called the 'Grand Prix' and named accordingly.This opening is rarely seen on the top level, but quite popular at the club level. One reason for this popularity is that White's game is easy to play, and dangerous if Black does not know how to fight against it. Magnus has never faced it during his professional career, so I am recommending playing the main line with 3... g6. This promises Black an interesting game with at least equal chances. }
3... g6
{ We already have good control over d4 and the fianchetto will help to increase our influence over this important square even more. }
4. Nf3 Bg7
{ Now White most of the time either plays 5. Bc4 or 5. Bb5, but 5. g3 is not bad either and leads to a closed Sicilian. White might play passive moves like 5. d3 or 5. Be2, but these can always be answered by our standard setup with ... d6/...e5, just as we handle the closed Sicilian. }
5. Bc4
{ This setup does not have a good reputation because Black is able to quickly counter with ...e6 and ...d5 soon. This is also the reason why the Bc4-Grand Prix is more viable for White in a move order like 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4, as Black has already committed to ...d6 and ...d5 would take two moves to play. }
5... e6 6. O-O

6... Nge7 7. d3

7... O-O 8. a3
{ This move allows the bishop to retreat to a2, saving it from capture on b3 with Nc6-a5. }
8... d5 9. Ba2 Nd4
{ Black has a range of good moves, but the knight jump is annoying for White. }
10. Nxd4
{ If White does not take we simply develop with ...b6, followed by ...Bb7 or ...Ba6. All in all the bishop on a2 looks a bit silly. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ White just develops the knight to its most natural and best square. This move does not yet tell you what White's intention is. He might play a setup like the closed Sicilian with g3 next or the Grand Prix with f4.The other point of playing 2. Nc3 first, might be to ask Black about his intentions. It is important to note that White still is able to play 3. Nf3 or 3. Nge2 and switch to an open Sicilian. We play 2... Nc6, as this fits perfectly with our open Sicilian of choice.But what if we wanted to play the Najdorf or the Dragon ? Then 2... d6 would be the move to play, avoiding to be tricked into an open Sicilian that is not part of the repertoire. After 2... d6 White has gained some options, for example after 3. f4  (Grand Prix Attack)  . No problem at all for us, but other Sicilian players need to worry about move orders after 2. Nc3. }
2... Nc6
{ We are not worried about a switch to an open Sicilian, as ...Nc6 fits perfectly with the Sveshnikov. After   3.Nge2  Nf6  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  we would transpose into our line of choice.  It also should be mentioned that being able to play 2... Nc6 is very useful, as this allows us to play more ambitiously against many of the offbeat lines. One key point is that the move ...d5 is often possible in one go, compared to ... d6 first.After 2... Nc6 White has a wide choice. With 3. Nge2 or 3. Nf3 he can still try to play an open Sicilian, but there are some independent possibilities. The most important ones are the closed Sicilian after 3. g3 and the Grand Prix Attack after 3. f4. Both systems are popular on the Club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. f4
{ This is the so-called 'Grand Prix Attack'. It was successfully employed decades ago by some players in a tournament series in the UK called the 'Grand Prix' and named accordingly.This opening is rarely seen on the top level, but quite popular at the club level. One reason for this popularity is that White's game is easy to play, and dangerous if Black does not know how to fight against it. Magnus has never faced it during his professional career, so I am recommending playing the main line with 3... g6. This promises Black an interesting game with at least equal chances. }
3... g6
{ We already have good control over d4 and the fianchetto will help to increase our influence over this important square even more. }
4. Nf3 Bg7
{ Now White most of the time either plays 5. Bc4 or 5. Bb5, but 5. g3 is not bad either and leads to a closed Sicilian. White might play passive moves like 5. d3 or 5. Be2, but these can always be answered by our standard setup with ... d6/...e5, just as we handle the closed Sicilian. }
5. Bb5
{ This is regarded as the more challenging version of the Grand Prix, compared to 5. Bc4. The most important thing to know about it is the reply right now, on move 5. }
5... Nd4
{ This is the important move to know. Black should avoid the capture on c6, as this would help White a lot. The main point is that the knight is strong on d4 and White would be happy to simply trade it for the bishop before it gets there.   We see a similar approach in the line  1.e4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.Bb5  , when Black should also play  3...Nd4  ,  before White gets to capture on c6. }
6. O-O { This is by far the most popular move. } 6... a6 7. Bd3 d6
{ This is a bit better than  7...e6  ,  because the threat of ...Bg4 encourages the following sequence. }
8. Nxd4 cxd4 9. Ne2 Nf6
{ The knight is more actively placed here than on e7. It puts some pressure on e4 and might have a good spot after Nf6-d7-c5 in some scenarios. Note that we did not blunder d4: White can't take because of ...Qb6. }
10. c3 { This looks very logical and is played most of the time. } 10... dxc3
11. dxc3
{ Our plan after 11. dxc3 is quite similar to the one after the b-pawn recapture: castle and play ...b5 to put pressure on the centre. }
11... O-O 12. Kh1 b5
{ And we have useful pressure against White's centre, with ...Bb7 coming next. It looks like a Dragon structure, but without any dangerous activity for White. I already prefer Black here. }

3. Bb5
{ This is one of the 'nameless' variations in chess, as far as I am aware. It is quite a decent line for White actually and scores quite well. One of the reasons for the score is that Black often fails immediately here on move 3. Similarly to the Grand Prix Attack after   1.e4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.f4  g6  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Bb5  White intends to capture on c6, which Black should prevent immediately. }
3... Nd4
{ Very important ! If you don't play that move, White will take on c6 and get a good game with d3 and f4, in the style of the Grand Prix Attack. }
4. Nf3
{ White is emphasizing development with this move. Now it is tempting to take the bishop, but this does not help our development. }
4... a6 5. Bd3 Nc6
{ A fascinating solution ! This move was played in the Blitz game D.Andreikin-M.Carlsen, St Petersburg 2018. Black moves the knight again, claiming that the extra tempi don't help White all that much. Indeed the bishop is misplaced on d3 and will often move again soon to prepare d4. If the bishop stays on d3 the position will remain closed and the speed of development matters less, compared to the quality of the piece placement. }
6. Be2
{ Now White is ready to play d4. Black has various way to go about this, even the quirky 6... Nd4 !? has been tried. We have a different good option, similar to other lines in the repertoire. }
6... e5
{ Compared to  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Nc3  e5  White has Be2 extra, while we have ...a6 as an additional move. }

Bg5
{ This is played in an online Rapid game between Magnus Carlsen, playing with the white pieces, against Luka Lenic in 2018. Black is already quite comfortable and went on to win a good game against the World Champion ! A typical way to continue is with ...g6 and ...f5 later. }

It also should be mentioned that being able to play 2... Nc6 is very useful, as this allows us to play more ambitiously against many of the offbeat lines.

Nf3 he can still try to play an open Sicilian, but there are some independent possibilities. The most important ones are the closed Sicilian after 3. g3 and the Grand Prix Attack after 3. f4. Both systems are popular on the Club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. Nf3 e5
{ This line we examine in the chapter on sidelines after  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  , because  3.Nc3  e5  leads to the same position and is the far more common move order. }

3. g3
{ White opts for the closed Sicilian, usually aiming at a slow, but complicated battle with most pieces and pawn staying on the board for a while. Quite often White aims at a kingside expansion including the moves f4 and and even g4 at a later stage. The closed Sicilian is a solid choice for White, but not all that dangerous for us if we know some lines and general concepts. }
3... g6
{ Playing ...g6 to emphasize control over the dark squares, like d4, is certainly very logical. Magnus has played this main line on many occasions, therefore it is a clear cut choice for us. I'd like to point out a small detail. There is the line   1.e4  c5  2.d3  Nc6  3.g3  , covered in the chapter on move two sidelines.  In that case I prefer to play a quick ...d5, because White still has the option to play a pawn to c3 to control d4 and blunt the bishop. This is not possible here for White, or only while losing time with moves like a later Ne2. }
4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3
{ This is played most of the time. After our reply  5...d6  White then chooses a setup , usually between  6.f4  ,   6.Nge2   or  6.Be3  as the main options.

5... d6 6. Bg5
{ This move is very rare, but it was once played against Magnus Carlsen. it is somewhat relevant for our repertoire, because ...e5-setups are now difficult to play. You could play   6...h6  7.Be3  e5  , but the extra move  ...h6  is hurting us somewhat. I suggest switching to a different approach and just play like 13-year old Magnus did , back in 2004 against Nigel Short. }
6... Nf6 7. Nge2 Rb8 8. O-O b5
{ And Black was fine in N. Short-M.Carlsen, Hoogeveen 2004. The drawback of Bg5 for White is that f4 becomes unattractive and White does not have much else to play for. }

7. Nf3 Nge7
{ You can also take on f4 immediately, but this gives White the additional idea to delay O-O and play Qd2 first. Playing   7...Nge7  first is fine here , as  8.f5  is not to be feared. }

9. gxf4
{ Surprisingly this move has never been played. I admit it is much more natural to take with the bishop, but still there is usually someone to think differently. }
9... f5
{ In any case I wanted to show that the usual way to combat this pawn duo on e4 and f4 is to play ...f5 and stop the white f-pawn this way. Let's look at some sample moves. }

The f5 pawn sac needs moves like Nh4 and Qh5 to be viable, and the knight on e2 is clearly wrong for these concepts. Therefore contrary to lines with an early f4 and Nf3 or f4 and Nh3 we are able to keep the tension in the centre after White has played f4. }
6... e5 7. Be3

8... Nd4 { We should play this first, stopping the Bh6 idea. } 9. O-O
{ The sensible choice for White. } 9... O-O
{ This position also arises frequently after White started with castling and later played Be3 and Qd2, for example 6. Nge2 e5 7. O-O Nge7 8. Be3 O-O 9. Qd2 Nd4. }
10. Nd1

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ White just develops the knight to its most natural and best square. This move does not yet tell you what White's intention is. He might play a setup like the closed Sicilian with g3 next or the Grand Prix with f4.The other point of playing 2. Nc3 first, might be to ask Black about his intentions. It is important to note that White still is able to play 3. Nf3 or 3. Nge2 and switch to an open Sicilian. We play 2... Nc6, as this fits perfectly with our open Sicilian of choice.But what if we wanted to play the Najdorf or the Dragon ? Then 2... d6 would be the move to play, avoiding to be tricked into an open Sicilian that is not part of the repertoire. After 2... d6 White has gained some options, for example after 3. f4  (Grand Prix Attack)  . No problem at all for us, but other Sicilian players need to worry about move orders after 2. Nc3. }
2... Nc6
{ We are not worried about a switch to an open Sicilian, as ...Nc6 fits perfectly with the Sveshnikov. After   3.Nge2  Nf6  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  we would transpose into our line of choice.  It also should be mentioned that being able to play 2... Nc6 is very useful, as this allows us to play more ambitiously against many of the offbeat lines. One key point is that the move ...d5 is often possible in one go, compared to ... d6 first.After 2... Nc6 White has a wide choice. With 3. Nge2 or 3. Nf3 he can still try to play an open Sicilian, but there are some independent possibilities. The most important ones are the closed Sicilian after 3. g3 and the Grand Prix Attack after 3. f4. Both systems are popular on the Club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. g3
{ White opts for the closed Sicilian, usually aiming at a slow, but complicated battle with most pieces and pawn staying on the board for a while. Quite often White aims at a kingside expansion including the moves f4 and and even g4 at a later stage. The closed Sicilian is a solid choice for White, but not all that dangerous for us if we know some lines and general concepts. }
3... g6
{ Playing ...g6 to emphasize control over the dark squares, like d4, is certainly very logical. Magnus has played this main line on many occasions, therefore it is a clear cut choice for us. I'd like to point out a small detail. There is the line   1.e4  c5  2.d3  Nc6  3.g3  , covered in the chapter on move two sidelines.  In that case I prefer to play a quick ...d5, because White still has the option to play a pawn to c3 to control d4 and blunt the bishop. This is not possible here for White, or only while losing time with moves like a later Ne2. }

10. Nd5 Qd7 11. a4 Bg4

12. f3 Be6 13. f4 Bg4 14. Bf3 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Nxd5 16. exd5 Nd4

The main point of the 6. Be3 and 7. Qd2 approach is to discourage   7...Nge7  due to  8.Bh6.  This is actually not that bad for Black , but I see no reason to give White what he wants. }

{ Playing ...g6 to emphasize control over the dark squares, like d4, is certainly very logical. Magnus has played this main line on many occasions, therefore it is a clear cut choice for us. I'd like to point out a small detail. There is the line   1.e4  c5  2.d3  Nc6  3.g3  , covered in the chapter on move two sidelines.  In that case I prefer to play a quick ...d5, because White still has the option to play a pawn to c3 to control d4 and blunt the bishop. This is not possible here for White, or only while losing time with moves like a later Ne2. }
4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3
{ This is played most of the time. After our reply  5...d6  White then chooses a setup , usually between  6.f4  ,   6.Nge2   or  6.Be3  as the main options.  Instead of 5. d3 White may also play   5.Nge2   or  5.f4  first, but after a later d3 we will transpose to the main line move order of 5. d3. }
5... d6 6. Be3
{ This is a very popular choice for White. He retains some flexibility, not committing the g1-knight and f-pawn just yet. A concrete idea is to follow-up with Qd2 next, intending Bh6 if possible. }
6... e5 7. Qd2
{ This move is the most popular , but White has tried others , of course. They will transpose elsewhere , though - let's have a look. If White plays  7.f4  ,   7.Nge2   or  7.Nh3  , we will play  7...Nge7  and transpose into 6. f4  (line #27-33)  (,)  6. Nge2  (line #34-39)  or 6. Nh3  (line)  #40-41  respectively.  The main point of the 6. Be3 and 7. Qd2 approach is to discourage   7...Nge7  due to  8.Bh6.  This is actually not that bad for Black , but I see no reason to give White what he wants. }
7... Nd4
{ Black has also employed  7...Be6  successfully.  Both 7... Nd4 and 7... Be6 look equally attractive to me.  After 7....Nd4 White has tried a range of moves, all related to the idea to play c3 soon. After   8.Nge2  we just play  8...Nge7  and transpose into lines checked via 6. Nge2. }
8. Nd1 Ne7 9. c3 Ne6
{ The simple solution for Black. I also investigated the fascinating move  9...h5 !?  , which is an untried engine suggestion. This move has some nice traps , for example  10.Nf3 ?  Bh3 !  wins for Black  !   After  9...h5 !?  a very principled approach for White is  10.cxd4  cxd4  11.Bg5  f6  12.Bh4  g5  13.Bxg5  fxg5  14.Qxg5  Qa5+  15.Kf1  Rh7.  This position is a complete mess , but Black seems to be OK according to the engines. I did not want to recommend something this sharp against a fairly harmless line like this , making it more complicated than necessary. Still , this is a great option to analyse yourself if you want to get something messy on the board. }
10. Bh6 Bxh6 { 10...O-O  is also possible , but I prefer this solution. } 11.
Qxh6 f5 12. Nf3 f4 13. O-O Ng8 14. Qh4 Qxh4 15. Nxh4 Ne7
{ Black is just better here, with extra space and better pieces - look at the knight on d1. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ White just develops the knight to its most natural and best square. This move does not yet tell you what White's intention is. He might play a setup like the closed Sicilian with g3 next or the Grand Prix with f4.The other point of playing 2. Nc3 first, might be to ask Black about his intentions. It is important to note that White still is able to play 3. Nf3 or 3. Nge2 and switch to an open Sicilian. We play 2... Nc6, as this fits perfectly with our open Sicilian of choice.But what if we wanted to play the Najdorf or the Dragon ? Then 2... d6 would be the move to play, avoiding to be tricked into an open Sicilian that is not part of the repertoire. After 2... d6 White has gained some options, for example after 3. f4  (Grand Prix Attack)  . No problem at all for us, but other Sicilian players need to worry about move orders after 2. Nc3. }
2... Nc6
{ We are not worried about a switch to an open Sicilian, as ...Nc6 fits perfectly with the Sveshnikov. After   3.Nge2  Nf6  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  we would transpose into our line of choice.  It also should be mentioned that being able to play 2... Nc6 is very useful, as this allows us to play more ambitiously against many of the offbeat lines. One key point is that the move ...d5 is often possible in one go, compared to ... d6 first.After 2... Nc6 White has a wide choice. With 3. Nge2 or 3. Nf3 he can still try to play an open Sicilian, but there are some independent possibilities. The most important ones are the closed Sicilian after 3. g3 and the Grand Prix Attack after 3. f4. Both systems are popular on the Club level, but basically extinct on the professional level. This suggests that Black has no particular problems if he knows how to defend. }
3. g3
{ White opts for the closed Sicilian, usually aiming at a slow, but complicated battle with most pieces and pawn staying on the board for a while. Quite often White aims at a kingside expansion including the moves f4 and and even g4 at a later stage. The closed Sicilian is a solid choice for White, but not all that dangerous for us if we know some lines and general concepts. }

{ Welcome to the chapter about sidelines that White may play on the second move. We will look at many moves, but the coverage of each one will not be all that detailed. The reason is that you won't face them often, and usually just knowing a setup or some ideas is enough to handle those rare occasions.I should mention that most of the moves found in this part of the course have never been played against the World Champion, which shows that they are not regular choices of top players, but are mostly played at lower levels or are suitable as surprise weapons.   That being said , White is not in trouble in the more conservative lines like  2.b3  ,   2.d3   or  2.c4.  They are good enough to 'get a game' from White's point of view and often lead to interesting games with equal chances. }

{ Now  4.e5  is the most popular move , but White has tried others that are worth checking. }
4. e5 Nd5
{ At this point White has tried many moves , the most popular one is actually the move played in the Carlsen game ,  5.e6.  White was probably worried that the e5-pawn might become weak and decided to avoid this scenario. We should briefly check some alternatives. }
5. Bc4 Nb6 6. e6 f6 7. exd7+ Bxd7

1. e4 c5
{ Welcome to the chapter about sidelines that White may play on the second move. We will look at many moves, but the coverage of each one will not be all that detailed. The reason is that you won't face them often, and usually just knowing a setup or some ideas is enough to handle those rare occasions.I should mention that most of the moves found in this part of the course have never been played against the World Champion, which shows that they are not regular choices of top players, but are mostly played at lower levels or are suitable as surprise weapons.   That being said , White is not in trouble in the more conservative lines like  2.b3  ,   2.d3   or  2.c4.  They are good enough to 'get a game' from White's point of view and often lead to interesting games with equal chances. }
2. b3
{ One of the more respectable choices for White amongst the rare lines. The square b2 is a decent post for the bishop and White retains some flexibility on the kingside. There are lines that feature Nf3 and Bc4/Bb5 for White, but also setups with f4 or even a double fianchetto.Against 2. b3 we will copy Magnus Carlsen's approach from a classical time control game, played in the Doha Open 2015 against GM Aravindh from India. }

They are good enough to 'get a game' from White's point of view and often lead to interesting games with equal chances. }
2. Bc4
{ This move is rare and quite harmless, but you should know why. The problem with the bishop development at this particular moment is that Black is not yet committed to any central setup. We have not moved any pawn besides the c-pawn, and are able to fight against the bishop with a quick ...e6 and ...d5 approach.Note that in the English opening with 1. c4 e5 Black is frequently developing his bishop to c5, but only after White has played g3 first. Black is happy to play 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 Bc5, but after 3. Nf3 usually avoids 3... Bc5 due to 4. e3 !.   It is also useful to compare to  1.e4  c5  2.a3  g6  ,  after which White goes for Bc4 after having 'provoked' ...g6 first. }
2... Nc6
{ Starting with  2...e6  and then 3... Nc6 etc. is also fine and should transpose to 2... Nc6. }
3. Nf3 e6
{ This prepares ...d5 and blunts the bishop on c4. I'd like to mention that in the coming variations I am frequently advising to actually avoid or delay this move for the sake of creating more combative positions. Black equalizes with a quick ...d5, but the positions might not be everybody's cup of tea, in particular if you want to imbalance the game. }
4. d4 { This is uncommon, but involves an idea that is useful to know. } 4...
d5
{ This is the move that I referred to as 'useful to know'. You may also take on d4, which leads to an open Sicilian in which White has misplaced the bishop on c4. However it is an entirely different type of Sicilian, compared to the Sveshnikov. If you feel comfortable with this type of play   4...cxd4  is a fine alternative. }
5. exd5 exd5 { White now has to lose time with the bishop. } 6. Bb5
{ We have now transposes to the line  1.e4  e6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  exd5  4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4  with reversed colours. White has lost a tempo with the bishop and therefore now has to play the black side of an exchange French with 4. c4. This line is considered equal. }
6... Bd6 7. O-O Ne7
{ This setup with ....Bd6 and ... Nge7 stops unpleasant checks on the e-file. Black has equalised in this position. If you don't like the coming IQP position I advise you to take a look at 4... cxd4, leading to a more 'sicilianish' position. }

5. d3
{ This is the most frequently played move, but it does not pose any problems. }
5... a6
{ Again  5...d5  equalizes, but this is a bit more interesting. We control the b5-square and prepare ...b5. }
6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d5
{ We are grabbing lots of space with these pawn moves, but are somewhat behind on development. }
8. e5 { This requires a precise move by Black. } 8... Nd7 9. c3 d4
{ This is an important point ! We should not allow White to play d3-d4, completing a French structure in which Black's queenside expansion could be pointless. Now we complete development with ...Be7 and ...O-O, and maybe play ...a5 and ...Ba6 later. }

{ This is certainly not the refutation of the Sicilian Defence, but it is not as bad as it might look at first sight. The knight is offside, but might come back into the game later via c4 or c2, prepared by c3 first. Black is fine against this move with many lines.

That being said , White is not in trouble in the more conservative lines like  2.b3  ,   2.d3   or  2.c4.  They are good enough to 'get a game' from White's point of view and often lead to interesting games with equal chances. }
2. c4
{ Our repertoire quite often combines the moves ...c5 and ...e5, therefore White doing the same can't be all that terrible. That being said, White commits very early to this central pawn formation and we have a range of good options.You will meet 2. c4 very rarely, so it's not worth learning anything complicated against it. I will show some easy lines to remember and point out some more enterprising ideas if you want to avoid the very closed positions that frequently arise. }
2... Nc6 3. Nf3
{ This position might also occur after  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.c4.   Now it is very important to not play  3...d6   or  3...g6  , giving White the option to play  4.d4  for an open Sicilian that is not part of our repertoire , and even quite favourable for White. }
3... e5
{ The brutal way to stop d4. It is important to note that the position is not completely symmetrical, because White is already committed to Nf3, which means a push of the f-pawn is not so easy to accomplish. This is very relevant, because the position is completely locked in the centre and the pawn breaks with f-pawn or b-pawn are the most obvious ideas left to make any headway. I will show a line to illustrate this idea. }
4. Nc3 g6 5. d3 Bg7 6. Be2
{ White might also play with g3, but it makes little difference for the basic strategic idea. }
6... Nge7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 d6
{ Now we see that we are ready to play ...f5, expanding on the kingside. White's play is less obvious, which is also the reason why the blocked centre strucuture with a knight on f3 scores heavily for Black. An interesting fact worth knowing is that after   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  e6  3.c4  Nc6  4.Nc3  the move  4...e5  is considered fine for Black and scores 55% for him - we are a full tempo ahead on this line. }

2... Nc6 3. Ne2
{ Just as after 3. Nf3 we need to be aware that 4. d4 could lead us into an undesirable open Sicilian after moves like   3...g6   or  3...d6. }
3... e5
{ Black shuts down the d4 ideas and closes the centre. It is useful to compare this to 3. Nf3 e5 !, when White's knight is misplaced on f3. Here the knight is on e2, which will probably lead to a fully symmetrical position as shown in the sample line to come. This is clearly enough to equalize, but maybe a bit stale for some people's taste.   If you like to have a less symmetrical situation on the board you might want to venture  3...Nd4 !?   or  3...Nf6  4.Nbc3  e6  5.d4  d5  , which are interesting and unexplored ways to play. }
4. Nbc3 d6 5. d3 g6 6. g3 Bg7 7. Bg2 Nge7 8. O-O O-O

2... Nc6 3. Nc3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2
{ This position is often reached via the move order  1.c4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.g3  g6  4.Bg2  Bg7  5.e4.  Black has some satisfactory setups now , but I like the following interesting approach. }
5... a6 { Black goes for a quick expansion on the queenside. } 6. Nge2 Rb8 7.
O-O
{ White allows ...b5 with this move. If White stops the b-pawn with a4 in these positions you should keep in mind that after ...Nf6 and ...O-O you have the idea to play Nf6-e8-c7 to support the b-pawn push. }
7... b5 8. d3 d6 9. f4 Bd7

2. g3
{ White's idea is to play a closed Sicilian setup, but avoid the move Nc3 to be more flexible on the queenside and in the centre. Quite frequently White intends to play a pawn to c3 to support a later d4 pawn push to occupy the centre. These are valid ideas, but there is a concrete drawback of 2. g3. }
2... d5
{ I strongly suggest playing this move in response to early g3 setups. This obviously is the earliest possible case, the other one is 2. d3 Nc6 3. g3 d5, which might also arise via 2. g3 d5 3. d3 Nc6. I think Black should use this opportunity to immediately free his position and in many cases even gain a space advantage.   One point I'd like to mention is that it is of course possible to play in the style of the closed Siclian with  2...Nc6  3.Bg2  g6  , but after  4.d3  Bg7  5.f4  d6  6.Nf3  e6  7.O-O  Nge7  8.c3  O-O  9.Be3  I think White's position is a lot easier to play. He has d4 on the agenda and enjoys an advantage in space. I think we should not allow such a scenario, but rather be more ambitious early on. I also recommend to answer early f4 systems with a quick ...d5, which is a similar approach... }
3. d3
{ This is played rarely, but the position after our reply might also occur via the move order 2. d3 Nc6 3. g3 d5. }
3... Nc6
{ Of course trading on e4 and d1 is possible and easily equalizes, but there is no reason why we should simplify the game instead of trying to build a space advantage with Black. Against d3/g3-systems it is justified to be more ambitious. Now White most of the time supports the centre with a knight move, but taking on d5 is also played. }
4. exd5 Qxd5 5. Nf3
{ This looks similar to  1.e4  c5  2.g3  d5  3.exd5  Qxd5  , and in fact  4.Nf3  Nc6  5.d3  would be a way to reach this position as well. }
5... Nd4
{ This move equalizes reliably , but also allows an immediate draw in one line. If this is not acceptable , you may also play  5...Qe6+  with similar play as in the 2. g3 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nf3 Nc6  (lines #23-25.) }
6. Bg2 Bh3 7. Bxh3 { This leads to the mentioned draw by repetition. } 7...
Nxf3+ 8. Kf1 Nd2+ 9. Kg1 Nf3+ 10. Kf1 Nd2+
{ And it's a draw. You can try to deviate without being significantly worse, but if you want to be more ambitious you should probably go for 5... Qe6+ or 6... Qe6+. }

4... d4 5. Nce2 e5
{ Positions like this are the reason why I like to play a quick ...d5 against d3/ g3 setups. After only 5 moves Black is better with a huge space advantage. One important point is that Black has not yet committed in any way on the kingside. There is one idea in particular that is worth showing. }
6. Bg2 h5
{ This is a strong move ! Black is ready to disturb White on the kingside with ...h4. It is difficult to completely ignore this idea, but White does not want to play h4 himself, as this makes a later f4 unappealing due to Nf6-g4. }
7. h3 { This leads to a strategic disaster for White. } 7... h4 8. g4 g5
{ And Black has a huge advantage already, dominating the whole board. The kingside is closed and long term Black will attack on the queenside. This pawn structure is well known from many Kings' Indian games, the most famous one probably being T. Petrosian - S. Schweber, Stockholm 1962. }

Bg4, but this was long before he relied on top professional preparation, and therefore I am suggesting a different move. The main idea of avoiding ...Bg4 is that often after a later h3/g4/Nh4 sequence Black is forced to give up the bishop pair. }

Quite frequently White intends to play a pawn to c3 to support a later d4 pawn push to occupy the centre. These are valid ideas, but there is a concrete drawback of 2. g3. }
2... d5
{ I strongly suggest playing this move in response to early g3 setups. This obviously is the earliest possible case, the other one is 2. d3 Nc6 3. g3 d5, which might also arise via 2. g3 d5 3. d3 Nc6. I think Black should use this opportunity to immediately free his position and in many cases even gain a space advantage.   One point I'd like to mention is that it is of course possible to play in the style of the closed Siclian with  2...Nc6  3.Bg2  g6  , but after  4.d3  Bg7  5.f4  d6  6.Nf3  e6  7.O-O  Nge7  8.c3  O-O  9.Be3  I think White's position is a lot easier to play. He has d4 on the agenda and enjoys an advantage in space. I think we should not allow such a scenario, but rather be more ambitious early on. I also recommend to answer early f4 systems with a quick ...d5, which is a similar approach... }
3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Here  4...Bg4  is the traditional main line, but recently 4... Nc6 has become more popular. I actually found a 2003 game by the World Champion with 4... Bg4, but this was long before he relied on top professional preparation, and therefore I am suggesting a different move. The main idea of avoiding ...Bg4 is that often after a later h3/g4/Nh4 sequence Black is forced to give up the bishop pair. }
5. Nc3
{ The most obvious move for sure , but  5.Bg2  is also played frequently.   White may also play  5.d3  ,  which we cover via the move order 2. g3 d5 3. d3 Nc6 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. Nf3  (- lines #19-20.) }
5... Qe6+ { A very annoying check for White. } 6. Be2 Nd4
{ Concrete and strong play. We either get the bishop on e2 or White needs to take our knight on d4. }
7. Nxd4 cxd4 8. Nb5 Qc6 { It is useful to provoke the weakening move f3. } 9.
f3 Qb6
{ This is a novelty , improving on  9...e5  10.Bd3  , after which White seems to still be equal. This is not so easy to prove now. }
10. c3 { This seems most logical to me. } 10... e5 11. Bc4 Be7 12. Qb3 Nh6
{ And here I'd rather be Black. White has some structural weaknesses that don't go away, like the ones caused by f3. }

1. e4 c5
{ Welcome to the chapter about sidelines that White may play on the second move. We will look at many moves, but the coverage of each one will not be all that detailed. The reason is that you won't face them often, and usually just knowing a setup or some ideas is enough to handle those rare occasions.I should mention that most of the moves found in this part of the course have never been played against the World Champion, which shows that they are not regular choices of top players, but are mostly played at lower levels or are suitable as surprise weapons.   That being said , White is not in trouble in the more conservative lines like  2.b3  ,   2.d3   or  2.c4.  They are good enough to 'get a game' from White's point of view and often lead to interesting games with equal chances. }
2. d3
{ White usually plays this move with one of the following intentions: to continue with f4, Nf3 and Be2, or to play with g3, Bg2 and f4 later.The first plan I always thought of as a turbo charged version of the Classical Dutch - 1. d4 f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6, with ...e5 being a standard plan later. I suggest to quickly search for central play with ...d5, as I advise against all the early f4 setups.The second approach based on g3 is also answered with a quick ...d5 and actually covered via the 2. g3 move order, as we will see. }
2... Nc6
{ I only want to play ...d5 if White has weakened himself with f4 or has played g3 already. After the sequence with ...d5/exd5/ Qxd5 we need to have the tempo on the rook after g3 for concrete play - see 2. g3 d5 - or we are need to be able to justify a time loss with the queen, due to the weakening f4 move.   Now after  3.g3  we play  3...d5  ,  transposing to 2. g3 d5 3. d3 Nc6.   White may also play  3.Nc3  ,  controlling d5. This will lead to a closed Sicilian after  3...g6. }
3. Be2
{ This is an interesting move order. White delays the move f4 and makes the immediate ...d5 less appealing for Black. This position may also arise via 2. Be2 Nc6 3. d3. }
3... e6
{ Here  3...d5  is less effective after  4.exd5  Qxd5  5.Bf3.  Just remember to play ...d5 only after f4 or g3 are on the board already.  The move 3... e6 is my recommendation, mostly because it will transpose to 3. f4 d5 4. Be2 e6 and therefore is an economical solution. That being said, there is nothing wrong with other reasonable moves like 3... g6. }
4. f4 d5
{ And we have transposes to the mentioned line 3. f4 d5 4. Be2 e6 - lines #27-29. }

3. f4 d5 4. Be2
{ White plays this move in anticipation of the trades on e4 and d1 and enables the capture on d1 with the bishop. I think these trades don't net Black much and should be avoided. }
4... e6
{ This is a strong move that took me a while to appreciate. Black supports the pawn on d5 and intends to develop the kingside with ...Bd6 and ...Nge7. This setup is better than a quick ...Nf6, which after e5 and ...Nd7 would only clog up the position and lose time. }
5. Nf3 Bd6 6. e5 Bc7 7. c3 Nge7 8. O-O O-O
{ It is not easy for White now to play d4 quickly, because ...Nf5 and ...Bb6 puts a lot of pressure on the centre. Note that the bishop on c7 is also useful in supporting ...f6, attacking the pawn on e5. }

2. d4 cxd4 3. c3
{ The Smith-Morra Gambit. This line is basically extinct on the professional level , but quite frequently seen in amateur games. White may also play  3.Nf3  here , after which  3...Nc6  just leads us to a normal position.   You could also investigate the tricky  3.Nf3  a6 !?  , hoping for  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5 !  , but I don't think it is worth the effort to learn , as this move order is extremely rare. }
3... Nf6
{ Magnus has faced the Morra only once , in a game when he was 11 years old. Back then he played the questionable reply  3...Nc6  ,  which does not help us in choosing a line. I am therefore going for a practical approach to recommend 3... Nf6, which transposes to the Alapin - 2. c3.   Of course you can argue that this is not the 'punishment' White deserves after having played a slightly dubious gambit. If you want to take the pawn and invest some time studying this , I recommend the Chessable course by Logozar on how to 'Mop up the Morra'. Logozar recommends  3...dxc3  4.Nxc3  Nc6  5.Nf3  e6  6.Bc4  Nge7  , which is challenging for White.  Actually my main argument for transposing to the Alapin is that you might be able to get more by taking the pawn, but it is not an easy single line to learn, but takes some effort. If you use this course to include the Sicilian to your repertoire, easy solutions to sidelines make a lot of sense - you will already have a lot on your plate with the mainlines. At a later stage, or when you know you will face the Morra in an important game, you can still add the Morra accepted to your repertoire. }
4. Bd3 { White insists on playing a Morra type gambit, but this is incorrect. }
4... dxc3 5. Nxc3 Nc6
{ Compared to a main line Morra accepted, White now has the bishop on d3 instead of c4, which is a huge drawback. We can simply develop now with ...d6 and ...g6, which is not possible with the bishop on c4. }

{ This line 4. Nc3 Nxd5 is just one example of White returning the pawn without a fight. 4. Nf3 Nxd5 would be the same essentially. In such a position we are in good shape, as f4 is a rather useless move for White. A good future setup involves ...g6 and ...Nc6 trying to use the square d4. }

{ Welcome to the chapter about sidelines that White may play on the second move. We will look at many moves, but the coverage of each one will not be all that detailed. The reason is that you won't face them often, and usually just knowing a setup or some ideas is enough to handle those rare occasions.I should mention that most of the moves found in this part of the course have never been played against the World Champion, which shows that they are not regular choices of top players, but are mostly played at lower levels or are suitable as surprise weapons.   That being said , White is not in trouble in the more conservative lines like  2.b3  ,   2.d3   or  2.c4.  They are good enough to 'get a game' from White's point of view and often lead to interesting games with equal chances. }
2. f4

9. b4 a6 10. Nbd2 h6
{ This is the main move, preparing ...Be6. In the blitz game T. Petrosian-M.Carlsen, Riadh 2017, Magnus played the immediate   10...Be6  , but after  11.Ng5  Bd7  12.Nc4  h6  White could have gained the upper hand with  13.Nxf7  !.  There is not much upside to playing ...Be6 first, so just play 10... h6. Now we have reached a rather slow-paced position with flexible move orders. }
11. Rb1 Be6 12. Re1 Rb8
{ Here  12...b5  is less convincing , as after  13.bxc5  dxc5  14.Nb3  we don't have a fully satisfactory reply.  We have time for a prep move like 12... Rb8, keeping things flexible. The position is very complex now, with all the pieces on the board. The King's Indian Attack move 3. d3 is not scary for Black and even offers some choices for us. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ Many players are happy to play an open Sicilian in general, but prefer to avoid the Sveshnikov specifically. For those players the main options are the Rossolimo with 3. Bb5 and this move. With 3. Nc3 White still retains the idea to play 4. d4 against moves like 3... e6, 3... d6 or 3... g6. }
3... e5
{ The World Champion has scored very well with this move, so it's a natural choice for this repertoire. With 3... e5 we stop d4 and set up the Botvinnik pawn center. Black's main idea in this pawn formation is to block the center and generate play with ...f5 later. On a very good day Black might even manage to play ...d5.   I'd like to mention that it is difficult to play a different 3rd move that still retains chances to get a Sveshnikov. There is  3...Nf6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  would transpose.   After  3...Nf6  White is not obliged to play 4. d4, though. In fact  4.Bb5  is tricky to handle for Black and not worth studying, given that we have a sound alternative with 3... e5.   I'd like to mention  3...d6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  looks somewhat like a Sveshnikov , but instead of  6.Ndb5  when we can enter the Sveshnikov with 6... Nf6,   White also has the annoying options  6.Nf5   and even  6.Nb3. }
4. Bc4 Be7
{ Black intends to play ...Nf6, but needs to prepare this move. After the immediate   4...Nf6  White has  5.Ng5.  The move 4... Be7 is the main move by far, as played by Magnus Carlsen numerous times. However, there is a second option in 4... g6, which was also tried by the World Champion. I decided to cover 4... Be7, as this seems to be Carlsen's more 'serious' choice. I also need to mention that after   4...g6  5.h4  h6  6.h5  g5  the game might become extremely blocked on the kingside and I'd like to keep the game a bit more flexible instead. }
5. d3
{ White may also play  5.O-O  first and after  5...d6  6.d3  we transpose to the more common move order of 5. d3 d6 6. O-O. }
5... d6
{ After the natural move 5... d6 White has two main options and some sidelines. The first main option is   6.Nd2  ,  intending the knight tour via f1 to e3, lending additional control over the d5-square. The second main move is to just castle kingside, mostly intending to play a quick Ng5 after Black has played ...Nf6. We need to check those two main moves, but will also take a look as some lesser alternatives to get a better grip on the general scenario in this pawn structure. }
6. O-O Nf6
{ Now White has the fundamental choice between direct play with  7.Ng5  or a slow set-up , somewhat similar to lines in the Italian game or Ruy Lopez. }
7. h3
{ I don't think we were threatening ...Bg4, but this move often comes in handy for White anyway. }

Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3, a line that I have some experience with. Quite often I wished my pawns wouldn't be that exposed on the queenside, a drawback that is avoidable here. After 8...

9. Nd5 Bxd5

b6 { This move prepares ...Bb7 and covers c5 as well. } 12. Nd2 Bb7
{ Black is set up for ...d5 now. This was played in the game L.Hauge-M. Cornette, Fagernes 2018. French GM Matthieu Cornette is an expert in in the Kalashnikov Variation and oftens faces lines that avoid his favourite line. He is a good player to follow in lines like the Rossolimo or the one examined here. }

3... e5
{ The World Champion has scored very well with this move, so it's a natural choice for this repertoire. With 3... e5 we stop d4 and set up the Botvinnik pawn center. Black's main idea in this pawn formation is to block the center and generate play with ...f5 later. On a very good day Black might even manage to play ...d5.   I'd like to mention that it is difficult to play a different 3rd move that still retains chances to get a Sveshnikov. There is  3...Nf6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  would transpose.   After  3...Nf6  White is not obliged to play 4. d4, though. In fact  4.Bb5  is tricky to handle for Black and not worth studying, given that we have a sound alternative with 3... e5.   I'd like to mention  3...d6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  looks somewhat like a Sveshnikov , but instead of  6.Ndb5  when we can enter the Sveshnikov with 6... Nf6,   White also has the annoying options  6.Nf5   and even  6.Nb3. }
4. Bc4 Be7
{ Black intends to play ...Nf6, but needs to prepare this move. After the immediate   4...Nf6  White has  5.Ng5.  The move 4... Be7 is the main move by far, as played by Magnus Carlsen numerous times. However, there is a second option in 4... g6, which was also tried by the World Champion. I decided to cover 4... Be7, as this seems to be Carlsen's more 'serious' choice. I also need to mention that after   4...g6  5.h4  h6  6.h5  g5  the game might become extremely blocked on the kingside and I'd like to keep the game a bit more flexible instead. }
5. d3

5... d6
{ After the natural move 5... d6 White has two main options and some sidelines. The first main option is   6.Nd2  ,  intending the knight tour via f1 to e3, lending additional control over the d5-square. The second main move is to just castle kingside, mostly intending to play a quick Ng5 after Black has played ...Nf6. We need to check those two main moves, but will also take a look as some lesser alternatives to get a better grip on the general scenario in this pawn structure. }

{ This is played very rarely, compared to 11. Qd2. It still proved to be tricky, because the natural sequence   11...h6  12.Nf3  Nxf3+  13.gxf3  Bh3  leads to some complications. White has ways to almost force a draw -  14.Bxh6  even works - and play for compensation by sacrificing the exchange. I was happy to find a simpler option for Black against 11. Qf2. }
11... Be6
{ This looks like a concession at first, but Nxe6 is no problem at all and a quick ...d5 is on the cards now. I also checked   11...Qd7  , but this is met by  12.e5  with a dangerous initiative for White. }
12. Nxe6 fxe6

13. Ne2 d5 { Not the only move, but this equalizes for Black. } 14. Nxd4 cxd4
15. exd5 exd5 16. Bb3 Nh5 17. Qxd4 Nxf4 18. Rxf4 Bc5 19. Qxc5 Rxf4 20. Bxd5+

3... e5
{ The World Champion has scored very well with this move, so it's a natural choice for this repertoire. With 3... e5 we stop d4 and set up the Botvinnik pawn center. Black's main idea in this pawn formation is to block the center and generate play with ...f5 later. On a very good day Black might even manage to play ...d5.   I'd like to mention that it is difficult to play a different 3rd move that still retains chances to get a Sveshnikov. There is  3...Nf6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  would transpose.   After  3...Nf6  White is not obliged to play 4. d4, though. In fact  4.Bb5  is tricky to handle for Black and not worth studying, given that we have a sound alternative with 3... e5.   I'd like to mention  3...d6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  looks somewhat like a Sveshnikov , but instead of  6.Ndb5  when we can enter the Sveshnikov with 6...

Be7, as this seems to be Carlsen's more 'serious' choice.

I am recommending 8... Bg4, but   8...exf4  9.Bxf4  h6  10.Nf3  Be6  11.Nd5  and now the less common  11...Nb4  is worth a shot as well. I ultimately went for 8... Bg4, which is sharp, but a bit simpler to play in my opinion. Still it is good to have options and here you have a good choice between two respectable defences. }
9. Qe1
{ The point of 8... Bg4 is that White will lose some time with the queen now. The alternatives to 9. Qe1 don't convince. }
9... exf4 10. Bxf4 Nd4
{ A useful centralization of the knight, gaining yet more time on White's queen. }
11. Qh4

11... h6

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ Many players are happy to play an open Sicilian in general, but prefer to avoid the Sveshnikov specifically. For those players the main options are the Rossolimo with 3. Bb5 and this move. With 3. Nc3 White still retains the idea to play 4. d4 against moves like 3... e6, 3... d6 or 3... g6. }
3... e5
{ The World Champion has scored very well with this move, so it's a natural choice for this repertoire. With 3... e5 we stop d4 and set up the Botvinnik pawn center. Black's main idea in this pawn formation is to block the center and generate play with ...f5 later. On a very good day Black might even manage to play ...d5.   I'd like to mention that it is difficult to play a different 3rd move that still retains chances to get a Sveshnikov. There is  3...Nf6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  would transpose.   After  3...Nf6  White is not obliged to play 4. d4, though. In fact  4.Bb5  is tricky to handle for Black and not worth studying, given that we have a sound alternative with 3... e5.   I'd like to mention  3...d6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  looks somewhat like a Sveshnikov , but instead of  6.Ndb5  when we can enter the Sveshnikov with 6... Nf6,   White also has the annoying options  6.Nf5   and even  6.Nb3. }
4. Bc4 Be7

7. Nf1 Nd7
{ This move has been played twice by the World Champion , netting him two attractive wins. Right before I started to analyse this line for the course , I reached this position in a classical time control game and went for  7...O-O  8.Ne3  Nd7.  Over the board I remembered that ...Nd7 was the idea Magnus had played, but I didn't get the move order correct. So in case you read these lines and find the game somewhere: castling first is just based on my sketchy knowledge at this time, not some hidden analytical idea. By the way it is not terrible to play 7...O-O, but let's stick with Carlsen's approach.  Why ...Nd7 in the first place ? It involves more than one idea. One point is to enable ...Bg5 again, trading off the passive bishop. The second one is that ... Nb6 will happen soon, again connecting to the vital d5-square and getting a possible ...Nxc4 on the map. Finally, we clear the way for the f-pawn push, as it happened in Carlsen's games to great effect. }
8. Nd5
{ This was played by Peter Svidler against Magnus Carlsen at the Grenke Chess Classics 2019. }
8... Nb6 9. Nxb6 axb6
{ The doubled pawn is no problem at all for Black. White has no way to put pressure on it and for the moment we are happy to have the Rook on a8 'half-developed' for free. }
10. c3 O-O 11. Ne3 Bg5
{ We are making sure that this bishop will be traded. At the same time we are also indirectly fighting for the d5-square, as ...Bxe3 and later ...Be6 would almost make sure to achieve ...d5 at the end. }
12. O-O Kh8
{ This was Magnus' choice, but Black has some options here. The mentioned play to take on e3, followed by ...Be6 has been played here as well with good results, for example by Kramnik. The king move is more aggressive, preparing ...f5 directly, but also involves more risk. It seems that Black does not equalise fully here, so if you need more solidity you may just take on e3. }
13. Nd5 { This looks better than Svidler's move  13.a3. } 13... Bxc1 14. Qxc1
f5 15. exf5 Bxf5 16. Qe3
{ This line was mentioned by Magnus Carlsen chief second, Peter Heine Nielsen. He assessed this position as slightly better for White. The engines and I agree, this is a bit more comfortable for White. }
16... Be6
{ I suggest to play this move, toying with the idea to play ...b5. Now White at least has to make a decision how to answer this idea. }
17. Nxb6 { The tactical solution. } 17... Qxb6 18. Bxe6 Qxb2
{ This still looks better for White, but it remains an interesting fight. The whole approach with 12... Kh8 is a bit risky, but it's tough to win with Black without taking some risks. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ Many players are happy to play an open Sicilian in general, but prefer to avoid the Sveshnikov specifically. For those players the main options are the Rossolimo with 3. Bb5 and this move. With 3. Nc3 White still retains the idea to play 4. d4 against moves like 3... e6, 3... d6 or 3... g6. }
3... e5
{ The World Champion has scored very well with this move, so it's a natural choice for this repertoire. With 3... e5 we stop d4 and set up the Botvinnik pawn center. Black's main idea in this pawn formation is to block the center and generate play with ...f5 later. On a very good day Black might even manage to play ...d5.   I'd like to mention that it is difficult to play a different 3rd move that still retains chances to get a Sveshnikov. There is  3...Nf6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  would transpose.   After  3...Nf6  White is not obliged to play 4. d4, though. In fact  4.Bb5  is tricky to handle for Black and not worth studying, given that we have a sound alternative with 3... e5.   I'd like to mention  3...d6  , which after  4.d4  cxd4  5.Nxd4  e5  looks somewhat like a Sveshnikov , but instead of  6.Ndb5  when we can enter the Sveshnikov with 6... Nf6,   White also has the annoying options  6.Nf5   and even  6.Nb3. }
4. Bc4 Be7
{ Black intends to play ...Nf6, but needs to prepare this move. After the immediate   4...Nf6  White has  5.Ng5.  The move 4... Be7 is the main move by far, as played by Magnus Carlsen numerous times. However, there is a second option in 4... g6, which was also tried by the World Champion. I decided to cover 4... Be7, as this seems to be Carlsen's more 'serious' choice. I also need to mention that after   4...g6  5.h4  h6  6.h5  g5  the game might become extremely blocked on the kingside and I'd like to keep the game a bit more flexible instead. }
5. d3

5... d6
{ After the natural move 5... d6 White has two main options and some sidelines. The first main option is   6.Nd2  ,  intending the knight tour via f1 to e3, lending additional control over the d5-square. The second main move is to just castle kingside, mostly intending to play a quick Ng5 after Black has played ...Nf6. We need to check those two main moves, but will also take a look as some lesser alternatives to get a better grip on the general scenario in this pawn structure. }
6. Nd2
{ This is the most popular move here, heading immediately for the knight route to e3. }
6... Nf6
{ 6...Bg5  does not look bad at first sight , but White has the annoying reply  7.h4 !  , after which Black can't play  7...Bxh4  due to  8.Qh5. }
7. Nf1 Nd7
{ This move has been played twice by the World Champion , netting him two attractive wins. Right before I started to analyse this line for the course , I reached this position in a classical time control game and went for  7...O-O  8.Ne3  Nd7.  Over the board I remembered that ...Nd7 was the idea Magnus had played, but I didn't get the move order correct. So in case you read these lines and find the game somewhere: castling first is just based on my sketchy knowledge at this time, not some hidden analytical idea. By the way it is not terrible to play 7...O-O, but let's stick with Carlsen's approach.  Why ...Nd7 in the first place ? It involves more than one idea. One point is to enable ...Bg5 again, trading off the passive bishop. The second one is that ... Nb6 will happen soon, again connecting to the vital d5-square and getting a possible ...Nxc4 on the map. Finally, we clear the way for the f-pawn push, as it happened in Carlsen's games to great effect. }

exd5 Nb8 9. a4
{ A positional approach, restraining any ...b5 breaks by Black while also supporting the knight on b5.   9.c4  is a serious alternative with heaps of theory behind it. But let's not be afraid and get on with our counterplay.  Be7  10.Be2  O-O  11.O-O  a6  12.Nc3  f5  13.f4  Nd7  Black has his usual dynamic counterplay. }
9... Be7 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O Nd7 12. Kh1 a6 13. Na3 a5
{ This is our typical idea, but the timing is not ideal. In general we like to meet a4 by playing ...a5, to hold up White's queenside play. Although we hand the light squares to White, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. We secure a nice square on c5 for the knight, and we can look to play ...Nc5 followed by ...f5, building a potential kingside attack. In the game we will see why the idea is correct, but the timing can be improved.   13...f5  14.f4  Qc7  15.Nc4  b6  is an alternative way to play for Black, but I prefer the choice of Magnus. It's more straightforward.   13...Nc5 !  This seems best and was played by Magnus some weeks later in a game against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. The point is that Black first provokes Nc4 and only then plays ...a5.  More on that in lines #17-18  in the 7. Nd5 theoretical section. }
14. f4 f5 15. Nc4
{ 15.Nb5  This is an improvement on the game and the reason why it is better to first make sure that the knight goes to c4 - 13... Nc5 !. The key difference between having the knight on b5 or c4 is that from b5 it may go to d4 later, after the e-pawn and f-pawn are traded. From c4 this is not possible and the knight does not have a good route to improve. }
15... b6
{ Now everything is back in order. We can see now that by playing ...a5 and ...b6, Magnus has made it very difficult for his opponent to create anything real on the queenside. Now he can look to the kingside, where he can create his own play. }
16. Ra3
{ In some ways thematic, but Magnus proves that this is too ambitious.   16.c3  e4   16...Qc7 !?  keeping the centre as fluid as possible, is also playable.  17.Be3  Qc7 = }
16... exf4 17. Bxf4 Nc5 18. Re3
{ 18.Rg3  g6  was a safer way to go. Although Black looks very solid here as well. }
18... g5
{ Once again Magnus plays in very aggressive Alpha Zero style. He is playing very concretely. It used to be that players were afraid to push their pawns on the kingside, but the influence of computers has seen today's generation have an about-turn on this. Now they don't care about generalizations so much. it's all about whether it's the best move or not 😁 }
19. Rxe7
{ 19.Rg3  Ne4  Wins the exchange for Black.  20.Be3  Nxg3+  Black could even ignore the rook on g3 and play something sadistic like   20...g4 !?  21.Bxb6  Nxg3+  Only now do we cash in  22.hxg3  Qe8  our plan now is obvious  (but difficult to stop.)  Play ...Qh5, ...Rg6 and go for mate !  21.hxg3  Rb8   21...Bf6  just to show that losing the b-pawn isn't such a big deal.  22.Bxb6  Qe7  and Black is for preference.  22.Bd3  and White has compensation, but I think I'd rather take Black. I like having the extra material. }

{ This is a funky way to play. The knight will later come around to d7 and then join in an attack on White's kingside. Magnus has been defending this line a lot, with great success in fact.   8...Ne7  is of course a serious alternative, played many times.  9.c4  Nf5  10.Bd3  Be7  11.O-O  O-O  has been debated many times.

This approach seems riskier than our repertoire choice, but is also interesting.   12...a6  13.Na3  a5  is our repertoire recommendation , as played by Grischuk against Svidler. We are slowing down White's play on the queenside , as frequently seen in this variation. See lines #24-30  in the 7. Nd5 chapter for more details. }
13. a5 a6 14. Na3 e4
{ 14...f4 !  Was apparently the choice of Alpha Zero, as explained by Matthew Sadler in a Youtube video. Sadler was close to the Alpha Zero team as he had access to that program for his book 'Gamechanger'. Although ...f4 seems like a positional blunder, in fact things aren't so clear. White can't get a knight to the e4-square very easily, and the cramping effects of this move are considerable.  15.Bb4  Rf6  and Black has great coordination. As Sadler explains, there is this sense where Alpha Zero is like a mad hacker at times, really finding these aggressive plans in order to put pressure on the opponent's king. The rook is also defending the pawn on d6.  16.Re1  Rh6  17.Nc4  Bf8  18.Ra3  Qg5  19.g3  e4  With the sort of mess that could make White feel very uncomfortable.  20.Qd4  Nf6  21.Bxd6  Bxd6  22.Nxd6  e3  White is being set very dangerous problems on every move.

{ Perhaps this is over-aggressive here. Black weakens his king, without gaining any great attacking chances in return.   18...Nd7  19.Be3  Bf6  was a sounder way to play.  20.Bd4  Re8  with close to equality. }
19. c4
{ Also advocated by Alpha Zero. White's plan is now consistent and clear, play Bc3, and then c5, pushing the pawn through as far as possible. }
19... f4 20. Bc3 Bf5
{ This seems to accelerate White's advantage.   20...Qc7 !  was preferable, at least holding up the c5 break.  21.Rc1   21.Nxc8  Qxc8  probably doesn't offer White a great deal.  21...Bf6  22.Bxe5  Bxe5  23.c5  Bxb2  24.Rc4  Bf5  25.c6  Rbe8  26.Bg4  Bg7  and now White has a couple of alternatives,  27.Kh1  However here Black is still under some pressure - Black's queen is tied down to c7, as if it moves then the advance c6-c7 will be incredibly strong.  Or even the mad hacking   27.h4 !? }
21. c5 Nxf3+ 22. Qxf3 dxc5 23. Rad1
{ 23.Rae1  was a serious alternative, but there was nothing wrong with what Caruana played.  Rf7  24.Be5  Bd6  25.Nc4  with a growing edge for White. }
23... Bd6 24. h3
{ Too tentative.   24.Qh5 !  was incredibly powerful. One of the main ideas is to tie the Black's queen down to the defence of g5.  Bg6   24...Qe8  25.Qxg5+  Qg6  26.Qxg6+  hxg6  27.Nc4  is a thoroughly depressing ending for Black.  25.Qh3  Rf7  26.Nc4  Qf8  27.Rfe1 !!  and Black is probably close to being busted here. }
24... Qe8
{ Now Black is out of danger. At world championship level, that's all it takes. One slip and the win has gone ! }

He has his counter-attacking idea ...f5 in the locker, and it's not clear what White has achieved with all this h4 stuff. Perhaps he has just weakened the kingside without achieving much in return. }
15... a5
{ It's important to cause some disruption to this powerful Nb4/d5 set-up that White has. }
16. Nxe7+
{ 16.Bb5  Bd7   16...Bh3 !?  is also interesting, with the desperado bishop.  17.Nxe7+   17.gxh3  axb4  feels like a gain for Black - White's king will always be somewhat exposed.  17...Qxe7  18.Nd5  Qb7  A funny line, but Black is fine here.  17.Nxe7+  Bxe7  18.Bxd7  axb4  and it's completely equal. }
16... Qxe7
{ 16...Bxe7 !?  17.Nd5  Rb8  is once again, fine for Black. all our moves are natural and easy to play. We'll probably follow up later with the usual plan of ...Kh8 and ...g6 and then ...f5. }

The pawn on a5 is weak and so White's pressure with the light-squared bishop might prove important this time. }
20. O-O Rc8 21. Bb3
{ 21.b3  a4  Of course Black is happy to get rid of this liability. } 21... Rb8
22. Qc2 Kh8 23. Rfa1
{ Too optimistic. The pawn a5 is well protected and the rook is clearly misplaced on a1. In fact with the bishop on b3 and the queen on c2, White lacks coordination and needs to find a plan to keep the balance.   23.Ne3  Be6  24.Bd5  This is a sensible way to regroup.  Bb6  Black finally gets his bishop on a more active post. The position is about equal.   23.Ba4 ?  This is strategically desirable, but fails due to a tactic. White's move in the game prepares Ba4.  Bxa4  24.Rxa4  Rxb2  That's the problem !  25.Qxb2  Qxa4  And Black has just won a pawn. }
23... f5 24. Ba4
{ The idea of the previous move, but now Black quickly creates counterplay. We can also check some alternatives, but they don't convince, either.   24.exf5  Bxf5  25.Qd1  Qg6  Black's play gains momentum while White's forces are stuck on the queenside.   24.f3  fxe4  25.fxe4  Qg6  Again Black has taken over the initiative. }
24... Bxa4 25. Rxa4 fxe4 26. R4a2
{ 26.Rxe4  Qb5  A key point: Black has a double attack on d5 and b2. } 26...
Qf7
{ The start of an amazing manoeuvre: who could guess that the rook on b8 will get to f3 in just 3 moves ! }
27. c4 Rb3
{ A typical idea by Carlsen to discover unexpected tactical resources. The rook finds the quickest way to the kingside. }
28. Re1 Bh4 29. g3
{ The alternative was   29.Re2  and although Black has several attractive continuations, White also has resources to defend.  29...e3 !?  30.f3  The only move, there was no way to avoid it.  30...Bf2+  31.Kh1  Rfb8  Black has strong pressure, but there is nothing clear yet. }
29... Rf3 { The rook has arrived near the target, a very impressive journey. }
30. b3 { f2 needed some help. } 30... Bd8 31. Rxe4 h5
{ Invite everybody to the party ! Black uses every imaginable force to attack - even the h-pawn. }
32. Re2
{ 32.h4  g5 !  Very powerful play.  33.hxg5  Bxg5  Now ...h4 is going to be very powerful. White only has one move to defuse this idea.  34.Qe2  Rxb3  The simple answer that gives Black a clear advantage.   34...h4  35.Nf4  This trick is keeping White in the game. Now things are not clear at all. }

{ This is a fairly rare move and not examined in our theoretical section. Black's setup against it is fairly standard: fight for the d5-square. }
13... Bg5 14. Bg2 a5
{ The most popular choice. Black fights for control over the queenside.   14...Be6  15.O-O  a5  16.Qd3  Ne7  is also possible. In general in these lines both sides are fairly solid, and there are a high percentage of draws. }
15. O-O Ne7 16. f4
{ 16.Nce3  is the main move here. However Black doesn't experience any problems in this line either, as long as he is consistent and continues the fight for the d5-square.  Bxe3  Taking on e3 is by no means forced.   16...Be6  seems eminently playable if you want to keep the position a bit more funky and retain those two bishops.  17.Qd3  Nxd5  18.Nxd5  b4  With the usual counterplay, chipping away at White's queenside.  17.Nxe3  Be6  18.Qd2  Qb6  19.Rfd1  Rfd8  20.b3  Rbc8  where once again, Black is solid and fine. He is holding d6 fairly comfortably. }
16... Nxd5 17. Qxd5 Be6 18. Qd2 Bh6
{ The bishop looks rather passive on h6, but this isn't really a problem for Black. His position is tough and hard for White to really lay a glove on. Already, the engine prefers Black.   18...exf4  19.gxf4  Bf6  is another fairly reasonable way to play if you don't want the bishop stuck on h6. We'll follow up with a quick ...b4, gaining obvious counterplay on the queenside. }

29... Rc2 30. Qf1
{ 30.Ne3  Rf2  31.Qd5  Bxf4  is also hopeless for White. That's the danger when you play this f4 move early on in the game like Andreikin did here: you leave your kingside much more vulnerable to a counter-attack later in the game. }

{ 13...bxc4  14.Nxc4  and some sort of position where White imposes a bind with Ne3-d5, or Ne3-f5, is something we should definitely avoid. Therefore it's a good idea to play our dynamic ...f5 break as early as possible. }

There are at least two meaty alternatives for White here, one of which is   15.Qh5  Rb8  16.exf5  e4  17.Rae1  Bb7  And here White has a wide choice, as examined in the theoretical section.   15.Qf3  d5  16.cxd5  fxe4  17.Bxe4  Rb8  And Black obtains enough compensation, as examined in the course.

Qe3 Rg6 20. Bc2
{ The black attack becomes very strong after this move, but it's very tough to defend this position. White has offside pieces on a3 and b1.   20.bxa6  This greedy looking move is probably best.  Qh4  21.a7  Bb7  22.Bc4  Bd4 !  a nice tactical trick, that ensures the draw.   22...Be5  23.g3  Qh3  24.f4  Bc7  is also playable and avoids the immediate end of the game with the perpetual after 22... Bd4. The engines already calculate a forced draw from here, which is of course rather academical and not very relevant for human play. White has many ways to go wrong in the defense.  23.Qxd4  Rxg2+ = }

Qh3  22.f4  White needs to be able to defend on the second rank.  h5  and Black's attack is still very dangerous. Instead of 22... h5 the move 22... Bd4 draws already for Black, which makes the whole line additionally unattractive for White: Black has a draw in hand and can look for more... }

Black's rook will come to c8 and put pressure on c3 as well.   13.Bxd7+  Qxd7  =+  and with a long-term blockade of d5, Black is already for choice.

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5
{ Magnus is quick to adopt the Botvinnik set-up. It's a very solid way to play. Very little can go wrong for Black. We control the center and get our pieces out. }
4. Bc4 Be7 5. d3 d6 6. Nd2 Nf6 7. Nf1 Nd7
{ A typical idea. The knight is coming around to the queenside, where it can harass the bishop on c4, while also freeing up the kingside for a potential ...f5 break. In some lines Black can also carry out ... Bg5. }
8. Nd5
{ 8.Ne3  Nb6  9.O-O  O-O  10.Ncd5  Bg5  would be a very typical continuation. Black always has the possibility of taking on e3, eroding White's control over d5. }
8... Nb6 9. Nxb6 axb6 10. c3 O-O 11. Ne3
{ 11.f4  This is a bit loosening. The problem is that White's king is still stuck in the centre.  b5 !?  The solid   11...Be6  would no doubt have been preferred by Magnus. He always seems to love to play by position.  12.f5  d5 !  is fun !  13.fxe6   13.Bb3  c4  with the same idea.  13...dxc4  ∓  12.Bxb5  f5  Is a sharp and interesting idea, trying to explode the situation in the centre before White has completed his development. }
11... Bg5
{ Black is very solid here and is very close to equalising completely. Again, this is a typical manoeuvre, exchanging some pieces and freeing up Black's position even more. We can think about putting the king on h8 and playing for the ...f5 break. }
12. O-O Kh8
{ The ambitious try for Black.  There was the solid alternative   12...Bxe3  13.Bxe3  Be6  This is possible, but less interesting than playing for ...f5 as in the game. }
13. a3
{ 13.Nd5  This is the critical move that is analyzed in the theoretical section -  (see line #30 in the move 3 Sidelines chapter.) }
13... f5
{ Black has carried out the desired break. Now the f8-rook can breathe on the half-open file, and Black's position is very easy to play. }
14. Nxf5
{ White could 'hang tough' with   14.f3  but then a nice and straightforward way to play would be to pursue our policy of exchanges with  Bxe3+  15.Bxe3  f4 !  16.Bf2  Bd7  and then eventually Black can continue with play on the kingside, perhaps even a pawn storm with ...g5-g4 etc.  Alternatively, piece play with .. .Qg5 and ...Rf6-g6 isn't bad either.  It looks like the kind of position where Alpha Zero is coming up with some powerful attacking plan, and as we know this is the direction that Magnus has been following of late. }
14... Bxc1 15. Rxc1 Bxf5 16. exf5 d5 { Building a very powerful centre. } 17.
Ba2 Rxf5 18. Qg4 Rf6 19. f4
{ Trying desperately to get out of the typical Magnus vice-like grip that he seems to have inflicted on the position, but this only seems to accelerate White's fate.   19.Rce1  Qd6  and Black has something of a bind on the dark squares. }
19... exf4 20. Qg5 Qf8 21. Qxd5 Rd8 22. Qf3 Ne5 23. Qe4 Ng4
{ 23...Re8  24.d4  Ng4  was a reasonable alternative. Once again, the knight heads for e3. }
24. Rce1 Ne3 25. Rf2 Re8 26. Qxb7 g5
{ Again, very much in Alpha Zero style, going for a direct attack. The bishop on a2 is a particularly miserable piece  (especially when you compare it with the dominant black knight on e3)  and the computers already give Black a decisive edge here. }
27. Rfe2
{ 27.Qf3  g4  and White is gradually being deprived of oxygen.  28.Qe2  f3 !  with a crushing attack. }
27... g4 28. Rf2
{ It's difficult to give White any good advice. Also losing was   28.d4  f3  29.Rf2  Re7  30.Qa6  Nxg2  When Black powers through. }
28... Qh6 29. Qc7 Ref8 30. h3 gxh3 31. g3 fxg3 32. Rxf6
{ True to his sportsmanslike ethos, Svidler allows a pretty mate on the board. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 Be7 5. d3 d6 6. Nd2
{ This looks slow, but is a typical manoeuvre for White in this system, intending Nf1-e3 establishing even greater control over d5. This also frees up the f-pawn, so Black has to watch out for an eventual f4 by White. }
6... Nf6 7. Nf1 Nd7 8. a3
{ 8.Nd5  was tried by Svidler in the same position against Magnus, but not with any great success - see the previous model game - so Karjakin tries to avoid any potential exchanges.  8...Nb6  9.Nxb6  axb6  10.c3  O-O  and with Black eyeing up a potential plan of ... Kh8 followed by ... f5, Magnus was absolutely fine in that game. }
8... Nb6 9. Ba2 O-O 10. Ne3 Be6
{ It was possible to play other moves, but Magnus sticks to his beliefs, and adopts a positional approach. He is fighting for control of the d5 square.   10...Bg5  is a reasonable alternative that is analyzed in lines #32-34 of the move 3 Sidelines chapter.  11.O-O  Kh8  looking to get ...f5 in. Black is ok here as well. If you play sound positional moves as Black, it is very hard for White to get anything at all in this system. }
11. Ncd5 Bg5 12. O-O Bxe3
{ Giving up the two bishops, but in return Black now has a very easy plan that he can follow, exchange some pieces on d5 and remove any danger to his position. }
13. fxe3 Ne7 14. c4
{ 14.Nxe7+  Qxe7  15.Bxe6  Qxe6  clearly gives Black a very easy game. We are ready for ...f5, and potentially ...d5 breaks as well. It's all about the pawn breaks for Black here.   15...fxe6  is also very playable, intending ...d5. }
14... f5 15. Bd2 Bxd5
{ While there were plenty of decent alternatives, as is so often his style, Magnus goes for one of the more clear-cut options. He is happy to give White the 'advantage' of the bishop pair, as it isn't really an advantage in this position. The bishop on a2 is rather dismal and is clogged up by its own pawn on d5.   15...Qd7  Was also fairly reasonable, but less forcing. }

bxc5 bxc5 23. Rxf5
{ Taking this pawn is very tempting, but turns out to be a huge mistake. The problem for White is that his queen on a4 is very far from the action, leaving White vulnerable to a kingside attack.  It was better to play something like   23.Rae1  just awaiting developments, with roughly equal chances.  Rb8  24.Qc2  e4 !  25.d4   25.dxe4  Nxe4  is really good for Black, the knight is dominating.  25...Qc7  with the idea of ...Ne7, kicking away the bishop from c6. }
23... e4
{ 23...Nh4 !  24.Rff1  e4 !  was already completely crushing. One idea is just to play ...Ng4 and then just attack directly on the kingside with the queen, say by ...Qg5. Not only is the White Queen not taking part in the defence, but the bishop on c6 rather resembles a large pawn in this position.  25.d4  Ng4  26.Qd1  Qg5  27.Qe2   27.dxc5  Nxh2  is a crushing blow.   27.g3  Rxf1+  28.Qxf1  Nf3+  -+  27...cxd4  28.exd4  e3 !  29.Bc3  Nf2  and White is toast. Chess can be a simple game at times, just attack ! }
24. Qc2 { 24.d4  cxd4  25.exd4  e3  looks very bad for White. } 24... Ng4
{ 24...Nh4  25.Rf4  g5 !  would pretty much force White to give up the exchange.  26.Rxe4   26.Rff1  Ng4  and we have our normal stuff with the knights.  26...Nxe4  27.dxe4  Rf7  with an almost decisive advantage for Black. }
25. Raf1 Rxf5 26. Rxf5 Qh4
{ 26...Rf8  27.Rxf8+  Qxf8  28.Be1  Qf5  29.dxe4  Qe5  30.g3  and while Black retains a very promising position, there is no obvious breakthrough.   26...Nh4  27.Rf4  Qg5  28.h3  Ne5  is also very promising for Black, and it's very easy for White to go wrong here.  29.Bc3 !  is probably the only way for White to stay on the board. }
27. h3 Nxe3 28. Bxe3 Qe1+ 29. Kh2 Qxe3 30. dxe4 Nf4
{ Although White is a pawn up here, that's really the only good news. Black dominates the dark squares and his knight is clearly superior to the rather irrelevant bishop on c6.   30...Ne5 !?  Just playing by position, is also very nice for Black. }
31. Qb2 Qxe4 32. Bd7
{ Desperately trying to create counter-play in this prospectless position, White accelerates his fate.   32.Rg5  Ng6  33.Rg4  Qe3  ∓  was the only way to stay on the board, although White's position is incredibly depressing. }
32... g6
{ Typical of Magnus, he rarely misses a tactical opportunity to put away his opponent, even in a rapidplay game. }
33. Rf6 Nd3

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 e5
{ 6...Qc7  is the move order that Magnus usually plays and that I recommend in the Rossolimo  4.Bxc6  chapter.  In this game he experimented with the immediate 6... e5. }
7. Be3 b6 8. a3
{ This is a typical plan for White in such positions. By playing b4, he hopes to erode Black's influence over the d4 square, while also creating pressure down the a-file, from the rook on a1. }
8... f5
{ An uncompromising and powerful approach. Black immediately gets on with kingside counterplay. Our repertoire features a very similar position, with the moves ...Qc7 and O-O for White inserted. This concept was likely part of Carlsen's preparation for Caruana that he wasn't able to use in the world championship match.   8...a5  , Shutting down the b4 break, has been most often played in this position.  9.Nbd2  a4  10.Nc4  With unclear prospects.   8...Ne7 !?  is another playable alternative.  9.Qd2  h6  10.b4  cxb4  11.axb4  f5  12.Qc3 !  is perhaps the kind of thing White is looking for. Already he is targeting the weaknesses on e5 and c6. }
9. b4
{ 9.exf5  gxf5  When Black's king looks vulnerable, but White cannot exploit it right now  (Nh4 is not possible as the Black Queen would simply take)  , and eventually Black will play ...Ne7-g6, where he will have a mobile pawn center and excellent chances of gaining an attack on the kingside as well.  White has to continually watch out for ...e4 and ...f4 prods.  In general taking on f5 is never a great option for White. He should try to keep the position closed, as otherwise the bishops will reign supreme. }
9... cxb4 10. axb4 Nh6
{ The knight is heading for the comfortable square on f7, where it will overprotect e5, and can also support a later kingside attack  (Black will eventually attack with ...f4, ...g5 etc.) }
11. Na3
{ 11.O-O  Nf7  12.Nc3  f4 !  13.Bd2  Be6  14.Qe2  g5 !  and Black's position rather plays itself. There is a threat of ...h5, and just going for a sharp attack on the kingside. This is a very dangerous plan for White to face, and it would be very easy for him to go badly wrong here. I have seen some Kramnik games where Black has gone for this kind of early kingside attack in this system, and no doubt Magnus was familiar with them as well.  15.b5  h5 !  16.bxc6  g4  and it already looks as if White is in danger of being steamrolled. I think anyone playing this way would have great practical chances of scoring an early win as Black. Plus, most of your opponents won't have the defensive skills of a 2700 player  (and even in this game, Amin struggles.)  17.Nh2  gxh3  18.Rfb1  and the engine thinks White is ok, but I think most players would take Black in these kind of positions. You are going for mate, so you don't mind White having some pressure on the queenside. }
11... Nf7 12. Qc1
{ White starts to lose the plot around about here. He wants to continue with the plan Ng5, take on f7 and then play Bh6, but this plan is too slow and gets him into trouble !  It was better to hold his nerve and simply play   12.O-O  Be6  when Black has fluid development and clearly a very easy game, but nothing has been decided yet.   12...O-O  13.Nc4  Be6  is another respectable alternative for Black.  Even heading directly for the endgame with   12...fxe4  13.dxe4  Qxd1  Is ok for Black.  14.Rfxd1  Be6  ∞   12...f4 !  13.Bd2  g5  14.b5  h5 !  is probably what Amin feared, and with good reason. Black has every chance of breaking through on the kingside. This is very similar to the earlier variation that we looked at.  Perhaps White is best off playing the flexible   12.Qe2 !?  just awaiting developments. Nevertheless he has a slight problem with his king, as if he goes kingside we already have seen that Black has an oven-ready attack over there, and castling queenside probably isn't going to be an option having played all these weakening pawn moves. }
12... O-O 13. Ng5 Nd6
{ As so often happens in good positions, Black already had a number of good alternatives. Also not bad is the straightforward   13...f4  14.Nxf7  Rxf7  15.Bd2  Qg5  with mounting pressure on the kingside.  16.Kf1   16.g4  Qh4 !  with a threat of taking on g4.  16...Be6  ∓ }
14. Bd2 h6 15. Nf3 fxe4 16. dxe4 Kh7

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ The Rossolimo is a frequent guest in games between Caruana and Carlsen. In this game from 2015, three years before they met in the London World Championship match, a sharp battle evolved from a seemingly solid opening. }
3... g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6
{ Black's traditional way of playing. Often the idea is to reposition the knight via d7-f8-e6-d4. This is a sound strategy, but less dynamic than keeping the option of an early ...f5 open. This game is an excellent example of Black's dynamic counterchances in the Rossolimo, even though the early moves are not identical to our repertoire.   6...Qc7  is our repertoire choice and the setup that Magnus has played frequently in 2019 - see the 4.  Bxc6  Rossolimo chapter for details. }
7. Nc3 b6
{ Not strictly necessary yet, but Black usually has to play it at some point. }
8. Be3 e5
{ This is surprising slip by the World Champion. Black should have waited with this move after castling or prepared it with ...Nd7. }
9. O-O
{ White had the opportunity to play   9.Nxe5 !  Nxe4  10.Qf3 !  f5  11.Nxc6  One of many good moves. Black is in deep trouble now.  Bxc3+  12.bxc3  Qd5  13.dxe4  Qxc6  14.Qg3  White has a large advantage here due to the weakened dark squares in Black's camp. He will never get a safe king in this game any more. }
9... O-O { Now everything is back to a normal position. } 10. a3
{ Caruana elects to play on the queenside. In the theoretical section we have explored similar plans, but White usually delayed the move Nc3 in these lines. In my mind the knight often is better placed on d2, aiming for a later Nc4.  A more common plan for White is   10.Qd2  Qd6  11.Bh6  Nh5  In the theoretical section we explore a similar line, but our approach with the early ...Qc7 has delayed castling, therefore we are able answer the Bh6-idea with ...f6 and a later attack based on ...g5. }
10... Qe7 11. Qb1
{ An ambitious move, but it involves some risk. The queen becomes active on the queenside and is far away from the defence of her king.   11.Qd2  was still possible and more conservative. }
11... Nh5
{ Don't hesitate to get your own play going. Black prepares ...f5 and ...Nf4. }
12. b4 f5
{ This seems too hasty, as it gives White a free hand on the queenside.   12...Nf4  13.bxc5  bxc5  This was a good alternative. Black can still play ...f5 and possibly ...g5 later.   12...cxb4  13.axb4  Nf4  This continuation also seems fine.  14.Bxb6  This more or less forces a draw.   14.Ra3  A fighting choice.  g5  This is the quickest way to make headway against the king.  15.Qa1  g4  16.hxg4  Bxg4  17.Nh2  Qg5  This position is complicated, but certainly OK for Black. Here's a sample line.  18.g3  Bh3  19.Re1  Qg6  20.Rxa7  Rxa7  21.Qxa7  h5 =  The engines see a forced draw from here. I don't, but it's clear that Black has fine play.  14...Bxh3  15.Bc5   15.gxh3  axb6  Is an obvious disaster for White.  15...Qd7  16.gxh3  Qxh3  17.Ne1  Qg4+ =  with perpetual check. }
13. bxc5 f4 14. Bd2 bxc5
{ 14...Qxc5 ?  15.Qb3+  Kh8  16.Qb4  Now Black needs to trade queens and has to stop his kingside play. White is clearly for choice. }

{ Who's faster ? This is certainly a question, but note that Black is going for the king, while White only attacks pawns. }
18. Na4
{ The principled move.   18.Nh2  This looks passive and is duly punished.  f3 !  19.g4  The only move to avoid instant defeat, but still an awful concession.   19.Nxf3  Rxf3  20.gxf3  Bxh3  21.Kh2  g4  22.fxg4  Qh4  Black's attack smashes through.  19...Nf4  20.Bxf4  exf4  A tough call, as all captures are interesting.  21.e5  h5  The comps manage to defend this for White, but it's not fun for a human player. }
18... g4 19. hxg4 Bxg4 20. Qxc5 Qf6 { All forced after 18. Na4. } 21. Nh2
{ Black's attack becomes too strong after this move. Of course the defence was extremely tough to conduct here.   21.Rfb1  This seems to be best, trying to escape with the king via f1 and e1/ e2.  Qg6  22.Kf1  Ng3+ !  23.Ke1   23.fxg3 ?  This loses.  fxg3  24.Ke2  Qh5  25.Rf1  Qh2  26.Qg1  Rxf3 !

21... f3
{ 21...Qg5 !  was even stronger.  22.Nxg4  Qxg4  23.f3  Qh4  Black' attack is decisive according to the engines. This was difficult to assess, of course. Carlsen's move poses serious problems that Caruana ultimately was not able to solve. }

23... fxg2 24. Rfb1
{ This is the decisive mistake, but it was close to impossible to see why and spot the only defence.   24.Rfe1  This holds, because there is a key difference to the game.  Qxg4  25.Qg5  Qxg5  26.Bxg5  Nf4  27.Re3  And White defends, but doing this in a real game is still very difficult to do. }

{ Carlsen has spotted the winning idea now. } 28. Bxg5 Nf4 29. Bxf4
