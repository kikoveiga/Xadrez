1. e4
{ This is the move that I recommend in this book, and which will form the basis of our repertoire. From the black side this is also the move we will most often be confronted with, at least when facing young players or amateurs venturing into competition. }
1... e5
{ What is valid for White is often equally valid for Black. The symmetrical advance of the king pawn is the most natural, and it is this which will actually be the most prevalent among beginners. In the 2nd volume of this work, I will recommend another option for Black, the Scandinavian Defence, which has the merit of immediately breaking the symmetry to quickly obtain an active and dynamic position. However, before embarking on this opening a player without any theoretical knowledge will inevitably have to pass by  1... e5  often just by imitation. }
2. Nf3
{ Again the most natural move, and therefore probably the best. White develops a piece while attacking the e5-pawn. There are other lines of attack, such as the King's Gambit 2. f4 the Vienna 2. Nc3 or the Centre Game 2. d4 , which can give very good results against amateurs, but they will not be treated in this book. Once again, my goal is to provide a targeted repertoire, not an encyclopaedic study of all the openings. }
2... Nc6
{ The other ways of defending the e5-pawn or counterattacking the e4-pawn will be treated in Chapter 3 from White's perspective, needless to say . }
3. Bc4
{ The starting position of the Italian Opening, which is one of the oldest chess openings. Some variations can be found in the analyses of Italian authors from the 17th century, including the famous Gioachino Greco, who we will return to and who will have a central role in the 2nd chapter.  The choice of this Italian Opening is, in my opinion, perfectly appropriate, and therefore recommendable for young players and the not-so-young . Already, it fully meets the three basic opening principles that all beginners should apply: occupying the centre, developing the pieces and quick castling. In addition, thanks to the aggressive position of the c4-bishop aiming at the sensitive f7-square, it may give rise to a great many combinations. For this last reason, the Italian Opening will allow beginners to develop their tactical vision in open positions, which can only be beneficial for their progress. There will always be time later on to switch to the Spanish 3. Bb5 or to other more strategic and therefore more complex openings. }
3... Bc5
{ Still the most logical move. Of course Black can also play   3...Nf6  the Two Knights Defence before developing the bishop. If White then answers  4.d3  or  4. Nc3  and Black continues by  4...Bc5  this will be a simple inversion of moves, but we will see a more aggressive continuation for White to try to counter this Two Knights Defence in the next chapter. After the text move 3... Bc5 , White is at a crossroads. He can play   4.d3  the Giuoco Pianissimo the quietest game , or play more actively by preparing d2-d4 with   4.c3  the Giuoco Piano - the quiet game , the line proposed in our repertoire. But before we examine this Giuoco Piano it seems to me essential to consider the d2-d3 Italian in this first chapter. This is quite simply because every player who has just gone beyond the stage of moving the pieces will inevitably be confronted by it, both with white and with black.   As a first step, rather than precise variations to memorize, it will be very important to understand the three themes that often come up in this Italian with d2-d3:  Early kingside castling even sometimes downright premature ;  The pin of the Nf6 or Nf3 after, respectively, Bg5 or ...Bg4;  The move h2-h3 or ...h7-h6, respectively , before or after castling, to counter the aforementioned pin.  These three themes are closely linked, as we will see in the illustrative games from this chapter.  The first two were played more than 100 years ago. Unlike modern openings, which often evolve with new theoretical discoveries from analysis engines like Fritz, Rybka and others, some variations of the Italian have crossed the centuries and are still relevant in many young players' games, as will see.  Let's go now on an exciting discovery of the Italian Opening, which constitutes a significant part of this work, and thus it begins... pianissimo !   A note from Chessable: The first chapter of this book has many examples from Black's perspective  (mistakes you should avoid as White)  rather than theoretical lines for White, so there will be a few 'informational' variations for you to review before you get onto the drillable variations. }

{ The starting point of a dubious plan, which, however, is very common for young players. Of course, we advise beginners to castle as soon as possible, and it has even been said in the introduction that bringing the bishop out to c4 promoted this principle, but here we are dealing with an exception.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 d6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. O-O
{ Once again, a kingside castling that is premature and doubtful because of the move that follows. }
6... Bg4
{ The famous Giuoco Pianissimo pin ! Now the threat is 7... Nd4, to reinforce the pressure on the f3-knight. }
7. Bg5
{ It was essential to prevent the arrival of the black knight on d4 by   7.Be3  On the other hand, it is too late to try to unpin after castling:   7.h3  Bh5  of course, Black maintains the pin and does not exchange on f3  8.g4  A headlong rush that seriously weakens the kingside, but it is difficult to go back. Black threatens 8...Nd4  or maybe, in the longer term, queenside castling followed by a pawn attack involving ...g5-g4 to open lines and try to exploit the move h2-h3.  8...Bg6  and Black will take advantage of the weakening of the white kingside by castling queenside himself, and then by playing ...h7-h5 with a very strong attack.  One could of course also consider sacrificing a piece for two pawns:   8...Nxg4  9.hxg4  Bxg4  and Black will get strong pressure on the f3-knight after moves like ...Nd4 or ...Qf6. }
7... Nd4
{ The classic continuation after the pin of the f3-knight, Black now threatens to destroy the white kingside. }
8. Nd5 Nxf3+
{ This is normal and logical. We will see in the following games that Black also has a very interesting line with   8...Qd7  and the idea of taking on f3 with the bishop, then, after gxf3, to play ...Qh3, which would be immediately decisive. Nevertheless, when Black is in the role of the attacker - and the pinner - it is stronger to take on f3 with the knight immediately, as happened in this game. }
9. gxf3 Bh3
{ The white kingside is now fatally weakened. In the Megabase 2014, we find this position in about thirty games played in junior championships, which proves its practical importance. Not surprisingly, Black has prevailed in 85% of cases. }
10. Nxf6+
{ White pushes the symmetry up to the point of suicide. The fundamental element of the position lies in the fact that White has castled and Black hasn't. In other words, by taking on f3, Black breaks up White's king position, while by taking on f6 in turn, White merely opens the g-file for the black rook.   10.Bxf6 ?  is as suicidal as taking with the knight:  10...gxf6  11.Re1  Rg8  12.Kh1  Bg2  13.Kg1  Bxf3  14.Kf1  Bxd1  -+  was the very classic conclusion of the game Lebrat-Fernandez, French Junior Championship, Le Grand Bornand 2003. Withdrawing the attacked rook makes more sense, but it does not save the game any more:   10.Re1  h6 !  to unpin the knight and open the way for the queen, or possibly for the rook if White were kind enough to take on f6. White no longer has an adequate defence:  ()  A  11.Bh4  B   11.Bxf6  gxf6  and the attack on the g-file is again decisive. The white king cannot go and hide on h1 because the f2-pawn is en prise;  C   11.Bd2 ?  Nxd5  12.Bxd5  Qf6 !  and we go to g6 to mate !  D   11.Bge3 ?  Nxd5  12.Bxd5  Bxe3  13.fxe3  Qg5  14.Kh1  Qg2#  E   11.Nxf6  gxf6  12.Be3  Rg8  saw the same punishment in the game Prevost-Bourgeois, French National Junior Team Championship 2001/02, as in the Lebrat-Fernandez game, cited previously.  11...g5  12.Bg3  h5  The bishop on g3 is totally helpless in the face of the advance of Black's h-pawn. }
10... gxf6 11. Bh4

{ This time it is Black who is compromised by castling too early and allowing the pin of the f6-knight. }
6. Bg5 d6
{ Black was able to benefit from the fact that he had not yet played ...d7-d6 by returning to e7 with the Bc5, but of course, in doing so he would have offered a free tempo to White, which is never negligible at such an early stage of the opening. }
7. Nd5 { The music is now well known. } 7... Bg4 8. Qd2
{ An idea already glimpsed in the previous game, with colours reversed. The first exclamation mark is for the strength of the move, the second is for its originality, since in this position White usually takes on f6 with the knight. After   8.Qd2  White is now threatening to exchange on f6 with the bishop, and then play 10. Qh6 with a decisive attack on the f6-pawn.To take on f6 with the knight was certainly possible, but much weaker than the text move:   8.Nxf6+  gxf6  9.Bh6  Re8  10.h3  Be6  In the comments to the previous game, at White's 10th move, the position was the same, but with reversed colours. White in the role of the 'pinner' obviously has a tempo more here, but the c6-knight has not yet arrived on d4. Therefore, the f3-knight cannot open the way for the queen with gain of time by exchanging with its counterpart, and so Black can hope to hold the position by playing ...Kh8, just in time before the white queen comes to g4. }
8... Bh5
{ There was no defence against the threat of taking on f6 and the arrival of the white queen on h6:A   8...Bxf3  9.Bxf6  gxf6   9...Qd7  10.Bxg7 !  Kxg7  11.Qg5+  Kh8  12.Qf6+  Kg8  13.gxf3  +-  10.Qh6  Bxg2  11.Rg1  +-   8...Be6  to eliminate the dangerous d5-knight, didn't save the game either:  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Qh6  Bxd5  11.Bxd5  Nd4  what else ?  12.h4 !  with a threat which is both more subtle, and above all much stronger than the obvious 12.Rh3  12...Nxc2+ ?  13.Kd1  Nxa1  14.Ng5 !!  This is the idea of the move h2-h4. The attack on h7 is unstoppable after taking the knight, and the recapture by the h-pawn, the rook will support the queen . }

{ On completing the last three games, let us try to summarize the situation: the Giuoco Pianissimo being symmetric by nature, identical themes can actually occur for both colours, but a tempo more or less for one of the two sides can sometimes modify the manner of handling the position.  If it is Black who has the role of the 'pinner' and White who has castled prematurely, Black must take on f3 with the knight. If it is White who has the role of the 'pinner' and Black who has therefore castled prematurely, White must play Qd2 and take on f6 with the bishop, rather than the knight.  Confused ? In this case, I invite you to carefully reread the comments and analysis of these three games. The effort will inevitably pay dividends, as these positions crop up very frequently in young players' games.  Let us now examine a very instructive theme in the following two games that occurs when one of the sides has castled and tries to prevent the pin by h2-h3 or ...h7-h6, respectively . }

{ Obviously played to be able to castle without having to deal with ...Bg4. }
6... h6
{ A crafty waiting move. White might think that Black continues his policy of symmetry, or the mirror game, to stay with child language, but the move ...h7-h6 does not have the same objective as the move h2-h3 at all... }
7. O-O
{ Even if White seems rid of problems related to the ...Bg4 pin, associating kingside castling with the move h2-h3 is not without danger when the opponent has not yet castled himself. }
7... g5
{ Of course   7...O-O  would have given a totally symmetrical and completely equal position. With the aggressive text move Black immediately tries to take advantage of the weakening of the kingside caused by the move h2-h3 that seemed innocuous at first sight. In fact, the move h2-h3 permits a lever an exchange of pawns on g4 that will allow the opening of lines against the white kingside. With the pawn on h2, such a pawn attack would have much less chance of success. This is a highly instructive strategic theme: complete beginners are sometimes advised to play a quick h2-h3 or ...h7-h6 respectively in the opening, just after castling, to avoid a back-rank mate. Attention ! Such a move can bring about a possible lever that the opponent may be able to try to take advantage of, if he has not yet castled himself, by launching a pawn attack. One must be aware that pawns especially those in front of the king are strongest when they remain together. }
8. Nd2
{ The move ...g5-g4 was strongly threatened and the white position is already very difficult to handle.   8.g4  would certainly have radically prevented the lever in question, but would have constituted too serious a weakening of the kingside. Especially since Black would obtain a possible new lever with ...h6-h5.   8.Nd5  allowed the black attack to proceed unhindered:  8...g4  9.hxg4  Bxg4  The pin eventually returned, but with White's h-pawn missing, and above all with the open g-file. Two factors which make the black position very attractive.  10.c3  The crushing 11... Nd4 move was threatened once again.  10...Rg8  11.b4 ?   11.Kh1  was necessary.  11...Nxd5  12.Bxd5  Qf6 !

8. Nd5 Qg6
{ 8...Qd8  is the normal move, and predominantly played. After  9.c3  the position is equal with chances for both sides. The text move is more active, and perhaps more risky. The idea is to counter-attack the g2-pawn, while setting a trap into which White falls feet first. }
9. Nxc7+
{ An instructive tactical error. White pounces on the Greek gift, but it is a big mistake.   9.O-O  Bb6  allowed Black to calmly defend the c7-pawn with his bishop, and the black queen will then be more active on g6 than on d8. After  10.Nxb6  axb6  11.c3  O-O  Black has a very pleasant position. He can prepare the ...f7-f5 lever after first exchanging the c4-bishop which pins the f7-pawn, by ...Na5 for example , and he will have good prospects on the kingside after the opening of the f-file.After   9.Qe2  Black should not take the g2-pawn on account of 10.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3
{ The Giuoco Piano the calm game . An opening that is misnamed, as we shall see. We will be proposing the Italian Variation for White in our repertoire. It offers good attacking possibilities, especially against poorly or unprepared players, and is perfectly suited to the style of young players who are at ease in tactical variations. In short, nothing like a 'calm game'!  The idea of  4. c3  which might appear illogical to the layman, since it does not develop a piece and even occupies the knight's natural development square is to control the centre with d2-d4. It is an idea found in many lines of the Spanish Opening, but the character of the position here is modified by the presence of the two bishops on c4 and c5. In the main line these two pieces will both find themselves attacked by the opposing d-pawn ! }
4... Nf6
{ The best move, counter-attacking the e4-pawn. Any other move would allow White to realize his plan of invading the centre by  5. d4  without any hindrance. }
5. d4
{ At this point White can still change his plan and play the more modest  5. d3  an interesting variation that even Kasparov has vouched for by playing many times, but which will not be covered in this book. Nevertheless, if any of our readers feels that he has exhausted the d2-d4 Italian, or finds that he meets stronger and better-prepared opponents as he progresses, it could be relevant to branch off into the Italian with 4. c3 and 5. d3. }
5... exd4
{ From now on Black will have to play with the utmost precision to avoid falling into one of the many pitfalls that this variation contains.  A first example:   5...Bb6 ?  6.dxe5  Nxe4 ??  7.Qd5  ... wins a piece because of the threat of mate on f7. A common theme in the Italian. }
6. cxd4 Bb4+
{ Once again, Black has no choice but to move his bishop with gain of time by giving check.   6...Bb6 ?  would be a serious error, which would allow the white centre to get going:  7.d5 !  Ne7  after   7...Na5  8.Bd3  Black faces the unpleasant threat of b2-b4, winning the knight  8.e5  the white centre is a veritable steamroller that flattens everything in its path !  8...Ng4  9.d6 !  Nxf2   9...cxd6  10.exd6  Nc6  11.Qe2  Kf8  12.O-O  +-  10.Qb3 !  Nxh1   10...O-O  11.Bg5  +-  11.Bxf7  Kf8  12.Bg5 !  +- }
7. Nc3
{ The Greco Gambit as the e4-pawn is hanging , named after the famous Italian theorist who analysed it nearly 400 years ago !  This variation, which is also sometimes called the Möller Attack it seems to me more correct to leave the paternity to Gioachino Greco, however , is not only one of the oldest in the history of chess, but also one of the most intensively analysed. During the 20th century it has often been declared refuted, but, just like the Phoenix, it regularly rises from its ashes. Today, with the current state of theory and helped by computers that enable us to approach the Truth with a capital T, we must admit that the Greco Gambit doesn't get a very good press, even if the prolific grandmaster Soltis was not of this opinion and devoted a passionate monograph to it some fifteen years ago.  Objectively, Black does indeed have the means to obtain equality and get out of the coming mass of complications alive. However, the path is sometimes very narrow and contains many pitfalls, especially for those who do not have great experience with this opening.  Once again, the goal is not to prepare the reader to play against grandmasters at the cutting edge of theory when that happens, there will still be time to head for the d2-d3 Italian or even the Spanish , but instead to give him incisive and effective weapons against unprepared opponents. This is certainly the case with the Greco Gambit.  The other possible variation is   7.Bd2  But I don't recommend it, even though it is playable, because after  7...Bxd2  8.Nbxd2  d5 !  Black destroys the white centre and easily obtains satisfactory play. Besides, we have to admit that this variation is much less exciting than the Greco Gambit. }
7... Nxe4
{ Black has little choice and must capture the pawn.The dangers of refusing the gambit by   7...d5  are illustrated by the famous game Steinitz-Von Bardeleben, which you can find analysed in numerous chess books, and in particular in the monumental pentalogy that Kasparov dedicated to his 'Great Predecessors'. Not wanting to produce a pale copy of the Boss's analysis and obviously having nothing to add to it , I will therefore only give the first few moves of the game:  8.exd5  Nxd5  9.O-O !  Be6   9...Nxc3  is even worse here than in the main game:  10.bxc3  Bxc3  11.Qb3 !  Bxa1  12.Bxf7  Kf8  13.Ba3  - because of the absence of Black's d-pawn, the check on a3 is immediately decisive -  13...Ne7  14.Bg8 !  Rxg8  15.Ne5 !  and there's no defence against mate  10.Bg5  Be7  11.Bxd5  Bxd5  12.Nxd5  Qxd5  13.Bxe7  Nxe7  14.Re1  White exerts dangerous pressure on the e-file, and this ultimately proved decisive after some brilliant tactical play from the first official World Chess Champion. The final combination is particularly attractive. }
8. O-O Nxc3
{ Black stumbles into the minefield. It is best to take on c3 with the bishop, as we shall see later in this chapter. }
9. bxc3 Bxc3
{ The decisive mistake in an already compromised position.   9...Be7  would have been met by  10.d5  with a big space advantage for White, which amply compensates the pawn minus. }
10. Qb3
{ 10.Ba3 !  is probably more accurate:  10...d6   10...Bxa1 ??  11.Re1  is winning for White  11.Rc1  Ba5  12.Qa4 !  White, who threatens 13. d5 and 13. Bb5, probably already has a decisive initiative. Nevertheless, the text move has the merit of being more dangerous, more radical, and above all, in the words of our Anglo-Saxon friends, more fun. }
10... Bxa1
{ Black is too greedy. His last chance was to play   10...d5 !  11.Bxd5  O-O  12.Bxf7  Kh8  13.Qxc3  Rxf7  with an approximately equal position. This variation is the main reason that theory recommends Ba3 on the 10th move rather than Qb3. Anyway, in my opinion, and on a purely pragmatic level, the move 10. Qb3 leads to a more forcing line than 10. Ba3 - which is why I recommend it - and it will bring almost 100% success when facing an unprepared opponent. I am confident that an amateur will have great difficulty finding the move ...d7-d5 at the chessboard, if he did not already know it, not to mention the two subsequent moves that lead to equality. Of course, a strong player could find it without a doubt, but he would never take the risk of going into a variation which is 100% bad should White play 10. Ba3. One could argue that the opponent can prepare the 10. Qb3. This reasoning is, however, not... reasonable, since he would go into a losing position in order to play some preparation, and this whole approach is intellectually - and above all chessically - doubtful. Above all, it is pointless to take such a risk just to get an equal position at best !After these transcendental digressions, let's get back to the game. After Black takes the a1-rook, it is now linear and one-way.   10...d5  move at home, if he knows we play }
11. Bxf7+ Kf8 12. Bg5 Ne7
{ Be careful not to be taken aback by the tricky   12...Nxd4  White only has one move, but it is more than sufficient as it forces the opponent's immediate capitulation:  13.Qa3 !   13.Qb4 ??  c5  14.Qxc5  d6  -+  and White has gone astray...;   13.Nxd4 ??  Qxg5  -+   13.Bxd8 ?  Nxb3  -/+  . }
13. Ne5
{ Much stronger than trying to win the black queen with   13.Re1  With the text move White plays for mate ! }
13... Bxd4 14. Bg6
{ The bishop evacuates the f7-square so that the queen can threaten mate there. }
14... d5 15. Qf3+ Bf5
{ Black has no other move. That is why the bishop had to go to g6 and not to any other square. }
16. Bxf5
{ Up to here, the entire game can be found in Greco's analysis, dating from 1625 ! , and the young Pauline Crabie knew this. She only had to find the next move at the board herself, and without taking anything from her merit, it must be admitted that this was not particularly difficult. }

13. Qxf6 Nxf6
{ Black has placed all his hopes on this exchange of queens, but White keeps a very strong attack. }
14. Re1+ Kd8
{ 14...Kf8  was no better, but required greater precision from White:  15.Bh6  Kg8  16.Re5  and now:  16...Nde4   16...Nfe4  17.Re1  f6   17...b6 ?  18.R1xe4 !  +-  18.Re7 !   18.R5xe4 ?

Despite the reduced material White has real attacking possibilities against the black king. There are three reasons for this:  1  an advance in development;  2  a relative lack of protection for the black king;  3  the presence of opposite-coloured bishops. The white bishop can really be very dangerous, either on the a1-h8 diagonal after c3-c4, or on h6.  White can play this position without any risk, and the most that Black can hope for is to split the point. }

{ Black resigned.  It's mate, either on g5, or on e8 if the f6-knight moves. Once again, White, who only used ten minutes on his clock for the entire game as opposed to an hour and a half for his opponent, cannot take much credit: in fact, he simply recited a game played by Greco in... 1620! }

Kxe8   23...Qxe8  24.Rf6  24.Qxg8  Ke7  25.Rh7  +-  21.Rhe3  Nc8  22.Bd3  g6  23.h4  Rg7  24.Qh8  Rg8  25.Qh6 !  White doesn't take the draw, but plays for the attack !  25...Kf7   25...Rg7 ?  26.Bxf5  gxf5   26...Bxf5  27.Re8  +-  27.Rg3  +-  26.h5  with a good attacking position which we will not analyse in more depth, however, for fear of scaring the reader, who might be worried about having to remember all these variations. Just one example of how dangerous the position is for Black:  26...Qf6  27.Re6 !  Bxe6  28.Rxe6  The black queen cannot move because of the capture on g6, which would be decisive.In fact, more than all these variations, what you really need to remember is that White has undeniable practical chances after 14. Nxh7. There are defences for sure, but they will certainly be difficult to find at the board, especially with limited time, for a player who will not be extremely well prepared. Moreover, even when the opponent does find these moves White can still get away with a perpetual, as we have seen.  20.Bb5 !  to stop the black king from escaping via e8, and to menace 21. Ree6  20...Rh8 !  Black's best defence, which visibly forces White to settle for a perpetual after  21.Qxh8  gxh6  22.Qh7  Kf6  23.Rxe7  Qxe7  24.Qxh6  the only serious alternative to   19...Kf8  20.Ree6 !  Bxe6  21.dxe6  Kf8   21...Ke8  22.Rg6 !  +-  22.Rf6 !  Ke8  23.Qh5  g6  24.Qh7  +-   18...Bd7 ?  19.Be2  Rg8  20.Bh5  Kf8  21.Rf6 !!  and it's mate next move ! }

On move 18 White should have played 18. Rh3 ! and Black - 18... Re8 !. Here Black had to play  20... Nf4 21. Bh5 Nxh5 22. Qg6 Kg8 23. Qh7 Kf7  and White has nothing more than a perpetual. }

In particular, he may consider the manoeuvre Re1-e3, with sacrificial ideas on g6. With black, a grandmaster will certainly defend the position successfully, but it will probably not be the case for an inexperienced young player. }
23... g5
{ Black clearly knew the variation until the 22nd move, but, as is often the case, he blunders horribly as soon as he has to think for himself.He had to play   23...Qf8  and White's initiative has fizzled out. }
24. Qxf6
{ 24.Qxf6  No doubt reeling from his terrible blunder, Black resigns prematurely. But it is clear that after  Qf8  25.Qxg5+  Qg7  26.Rg4  Qxg5  27.Rxg5+  Kh8  28.Rh5+  Kg7  29.Rxh4  the tide has begun to turn, even if the game is still far from finished. We conclude our exciting exploration of the Greco Gambit with this game. This game and the previous one, which dealt with the main line of the Möller Attack 9. d5 , were relatively rich in analysis. As already mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the Italian with c2-c3 and d2-d4 is probably one of the most analysed openings in chess history, and we can see that some lines even go well beyond the 20th move. Obviously it is not a question of memorizing everything by heart - just remember the ideas, and in particular the main tactical themes. With these alone you will have an undeniable advantage against a less prepared opponent.   To those who would argue that it seems surprising to recommend a variation in which White has perhaps nothing better than a perpetual if Black finds good moves, I would take the liberty of answering that one must not dogmatically and rigidly accept all the truths set forth by theory, especially for youngsters.   It is true that Black has a few lines that allow him to get equality in this Giuoco Piano. However, we have seen in the first three games of this chapter that this path towards equality was sometimes very torturous and often strewn with many pitfalls that Black can fall into at any time. How many amateur players  (the audience this book addresses)  know all the correct moves in this variation ? Very few, I would bet. And how many would find them at the board ? Even less, surely.   Again, this book is not intended to prepare masters, or even candidate masters, but just to bring ideas and reference points to players who are entering competition, and are putting together their first opening repertoire. In particular by offering them lively tactical positions where an inexperienced opponent will have every chance of going astray. When we see White's success rate with the Greco Gambit in junior tournaments, we can reasonably say that this opening achieves its goal. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6
{ The Two Knights Defence. Perhaps it would be more logical to speak of the 'Two Knights Counter-attack', since Black threatens the e4-pawn with his last move. }
4. Ng5
{ A surprising move, which goes against all the basic opening principles. White neglects his development by moving a piece a second time while most of his other pieces are still in their starting blocks. However, this is justified by the fact that the attack on f7 is not easy for Black to parry.   Of course, White can play more modestly and more classically   4.d3  to transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo after  Bc5  but in this case he loses the opportunity to play the Italian with c2-c3 and d2-d4. This is why I advise the text move, which is much more aggressive but also more risky.   Oddly, while it is one of the openings that have been the most analysed by chess theory together with the Greco Gambit, the Two Knights Variation with 4. Ng5 has no name as such, although in some sources it is called the Fegatello Attack. Which is somewhat inaccurate, since the real and venerable Fegatello normally begins with the sacrifice on f7, which is recurrent in this variation. Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity and also, it must be said, to preserve the rhyme with Greco and Giuoco Piano, I will use the name Fegatello for the move 4. Ng5, like some other authors, and I hope that learned theorists will not hold it against me.   The move 4. Ng5 gave rise to totally divergent opinions in the last century. Tarrasch, the German theorist from the early part of the 20th century, described it as idiotic, while Bobby Fischer considered it the outright refutation of the Two Knights Defence. To each his truth. Objectively, it is doubtless somewhere between these two extremes of opinion. Anyway, it is an active move that conceals a quite subtle trap. A trap that will be daunting for inexperienced players. Just have a look, to be convinced, at the countless number of young players who have fallen victim to it. Young players, or even not-so-young amateurs, as was the case in this game played in a blindfold simultaneous by Paul Morphy, the American prodigy who briefly ruled the chess world in the middle of the nineteenth century. }
4... d5
{ The only reasonable move to defend the f7-pawn. However, later in this chapter we will see another possibility, although it is very risky and not really that sound. }
5. exd5 Nxd5
{ Here is the trap mentioned above into which Black falls so very frequently. If he could take on d5 and parry the threat to f7 so easily, the attack with 4. Ng5 would indeed be idiotic - to use the expression of Tarrasch - and would not have much sense, but this is not the case. As we will see later in this chapter, Black must play 5... Na5 and accept the loss of a pawn in exchange for an advantage in development. After the capture on d5, Black is simply almost lost ! }
6. d4
{ Stronger than the direct sacrifice   6.Nxf7 !?  which is recommended in many books and commonly called the 'Fried Liver Attack', which sounds far less romantic than 'Fegatello'. The immediate sacrifice on f7 is nevertheless interesting and gives White undeniable practical chances. However, after the continuation analysed by Greco him again ! in 1620:  Kxf7  7.Qf3+  Ke6  forced, otherwise White would recover the piece with advantage  8.Nc3  Nce7  the best defence  9.d4  c6  Powerful analysis engines have shown that Black can hope to survive and keep his extra piece. Even if the exact defence will be extremely hard to find at the board with the clock ticking,  (and moreover by an amateur)  an experienced player will not play this line with black because he will know that recapturing the d5-pawn on move 4 is a mistake. In short, a player who is comfortable with tactical variations and who likes to 'surf' on the razor's edge can fearlessly embark on the 'Fried Liver Attack' with a little preparation. However, is it wise to venture into complications that are finally not so clear, when the text move promises a sure advantage without risk ?   6.Qf3 ?  which we frequently encounter in young players' games, is, however, downright bad:  Qxg5  7.Bxd5  Nd4  8.Qxf7+  Kd8  9.Be4 ?  the bishop wants to continue to defend the c2- and g2-pawns, but an unpleasant surprise awaits White,  ...Be6  Oops ! The white queen has no square... }
6... exd4
{ After   6...Nxd4 ?  7.c3  Black will lose one of his two knights, awkwardly aligned on the d-file.  The only possible continuation for Black is   6...Be6  This is a recent attempt to show that the 5... Nxd5 variation is perhaps not necessarily losing for Black. For now, too few games have been played to come to a definitive conclusion, but it is sure that after  7.Nxe6  fxe6  8.dxe5  Nxe5  9.Qh5+  Ng6  10.O-O  White, if not winning, has a much better position. If this is really the best that Black can hope for, perhaps it is better to give up on 6...Nxd5 altogether. }
7. O-O
{ White is now threatening to sacrifice on f7 and get a very favourable version of the Fried Liver Attack. }
7... Be7
{ 7...Be6  with the idea of protecting the sensitive f7-point, does not solve Black's problems, as can be seen in the following game. During a training session, a young student came and asked me what to do after   7...f6  which does not allow a sacrifice on f7, of course. Certainly, without even analysing it is easy to tell that a move such as   7...f6  cannot be a panacea, but it will be much less easy for an amateur player to find the refutation at the board. In addition, no theoretical manual will deal with a move such as   7...f6  in this position, of course, although several youngsters have nevertheless proposed it to me, as they felt the need to prevent the sacrifice on f7. The move   7...f6  is bad, period, and that is obvious, one might be tempted to say, while dismissing this wacky suggestion out of hand. Nevertheless, one of the goals of this book is indeed to try to answer questions from amateurs  (even those that may seem far-fetched !)  and in particular those where we will find no trace of an answer in classical chess books.In this case, it was not so easy to show  (concretely !)  that the move   7...f6  was bad:  8.Re1+  now this was obvious...  Be7  9.Qf3 !  but this was much less so, and it is the refutation of the 7... f6 move and now:  Nb6 ?   9...fxg5  10.Bxd5  Rf8  11.Qh5+  g6  12.Bxc6+  bxc6  13.Qxh7  +-  The black position is in ruins, both in terms of the pawn structure look at the contrast between White's and Black's ! and the safety of the king.  10.Qh5+  g6  11.Bf7+  Kd7   11...Kf8  12.Qh6#  12.Qh3+  f5   12...Kd6  13.Ne4+  Ke5  14.f4#  is a nice mate in the middle of the chessboard  13.Ne6  and the black queen is lost. }
8. Nxf7
{ The main theme of the Fegatello ! The sacrifice is much stronger here than in the Fried Liver Attack since White has already castled and the e-file is open. Venturing onto e6 will consequently be even more problematic for the black king. }
8... Kxf7 9. Qf3+ Ke6
{ Suicidal, but if the king goes back White will recover the d5-knight and have a better position. }

{ The Traxler Gambit. A clever counter-attack devised by the Czech Catholic priest and strong chess player Karel Traxler in the late nineteenth century. Black ignores the threat to f7 and even allows White to take the pawn in two ways: one with check, and the other with a fork of queen and rook ! In some young beginners' games, the   4...Bc5  move may also be nothing but a blunder: developing a piece without seeing that the f7-pawn is attacked ! According to current theory the Traxler defence  (or rather attack !)  , even when played deliberately  (and therefore not the aforementioned blunder !)  , is considered unsound and probably refuted. However, it can be very dangerous and just as unpleasant when you do not know it at all and find yourself facing it for the first time with white.The Traxler has given rise to some very complex analysis but it is obviously out of the question to detail and reproduce that here. It is just important to have some ideas to avoid falling into the many traps, and to know a line that gives White the advantage  (there are several !)  . }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4
{ A dubious move, attributed to a certain Fritz  (a German player from the early 20th century, not the silicon monster !)  , and based on a trap that we meet quite often in young players' games. We have to know it, not to play it, but above all to avoid becoming a victim of it ! At the time this game was played I obviously had no idea of the theory of the Italian Opening. }
4. Nxe5
{ By Jove, my opponent falls into the trap ! I could not believe my eyes.   4.Nxd4 !  is without doubt an easier refutation of Black's opening. After  exd4  5.O-O  White has a big development advantage, and Black has absolutely nothing in return.   4.c3  is also very strong. After  Nxf3+  5.Qxf3  White again has a development advantage, he threatens mate and is ready to play d2-d4 in the centre. }
4... Qg5 5. Bxf7+
{ A move that I had not expected, and that was already outside my field of knowledge. I was actually hoping for   5.Nxf7 ??  Qxg2  6.Rf1  Qxe4+  7.Be2  Nf3#  A nice smothered mate on which the whole variation is based. }
5... Ke7
{ After my first emotions had subsided, I told myself that things were not actually that bad. I cannot castle, sure, but White has both the g2-pawn and the e5-knight attacked. Moreover, if the knight moves, the f7-bishop will be hanging, but that did not take into account an unpleasant surprise. }
6. O-O Qxe5 7. Bxg8 Rxg8 8. c3 Nc6 9. d4
{ White obviously has more than sufficient compensation for the sacrificed piece. He already has two pawns, on strict material terms, but also a very strong centre that will sweep everything in its path, and let us not forget the very insecure black king on e7. }
9... Qf6 { 9...Qxe4 ??  10.Re1  +- } 10. e5 { The steamroller gets under way. }

[White "The Grand Prix Attack Against The Sicilian"]
[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Ready for the pole position: The Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian@@HeaderEnd@@  1.e4 c5  The Sicilian Defence! This is the most popular opening reply to 1.e4, both for amateurs and for grandmasters. On its own, it represents almost 25% of the 5 million games in Megabase 2014, and nearly one game out of two that opens with 1.e4 is a Sicilian.  The reasons for the popularity and the success of the Sicilian are not obvious, however. With his first move Black does nothing for his development. The move ...c7-c5 only serves, in fact, to control the centre and prevent White from invading it by d2-d4.  However, unlike the move ...e7-e5 that has the same initial objective, the Sicilian creates an asymmetric structure from the outset that will offer more chances to the second player. If White chooses to play the main lines of the Sicilian by opening the game with ♘f3 and d2-d4, Black can then count on two positional advantages after the ...c5xd4 exchange: a majority of two pawns against one in the centre, and the semi-open c-file, which will be very useful in the middlegame. Of course, White will not be without pluses as well, and there will follow a sharp fight with chances for both sides.  It is precisely this aggressive character that appeals to aficionados of the Sicilian. Some of them arrive at the chess-board drenched in variations they have sometimes memorized beyond the 20th move. The theory of the Sicilian is indeed much larger than that of any other opening. Just on the Najdorf Variation, which is one among a dozen that make up the Sicilian, the Slovak grandmaster Lubomir Ftacnik wrote a book of over 400 pages in 2010, which will nevertheless be rapidly outdated; such is the speed of theoretical novelties in this area.  Within the limited scope of this book, it is obviously impossible to immerse ourselves in the study of these major variations. It is in any case surely not the priority of a player looking to build a first repertoire.  This is why I will offer you a system that will avoid all the Sicilian main lines. An easy-to-learn system which promises beautiful attacking games, without lots of theory, and which will be playable against all variations of the Sicilian, whether it be the Najdorf, the Dragon, the Sveshnikov, the Paulsen, the Scheveningen and all of the others. I can already see some becoming sceptical and sneering. Yet, yes, yes, such a system exists. Oh, I will not pretend to claim that it is the refutation of the Sicilian and that we will win every time with it. Not at all, obviously. I will just affirm that this system gives balanced chances, but that they become  (almost)  always greater for White against a player who has eaten tons of variations of the Dragon or whatever, but who will have little experience with this secondary line of the Sicilian.  This system is the Grand Prix Attack, which gets its name from the tournament circuit that took place on weekends in Britain. This opening wreaked havoc in the late 1980s in the hands of future English grandmasters Julian Hodgson and Mark Hebden, who won many tournaments while using it exclusively against the Sicilian.  However, just as we must render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, let us also attribute to Greco  (him again!)  that which he has fathered. It is indeed in a game from the Calabrian theorist that the move 2.f4, characteristic of the Grand Prix Attack, appeared for the first time in 1620.  Today the Grand Prix Attack remains very popular with amateurs, and most particularly with juniors. Nevertheless, it happens that it also makes notable inroads among the world’s elite. Players of the highest order such as Anand, Ivanchuk and Adams have practised it repeatedly. The English grandmaster Nigel Short, in line with his compatriots Hebden and Hodgson, has even used it against Gelfand to qualify for the final of the World Championships  (we will analyse this game)  .  For an amateur player, the benefits of a system like the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian are numerous. To recap:   • The Grand Prix Attack offers great attacking possibilities, with many tactical themes, and promises a lively game where White will have every chance of having the initiative.  • The Grand Prix Attack is a perfectly sound system that is regularly used at the highest level  (in other words, not a dubious gambit)  .  • A Sicilian player who has spent hours learning the main lines of his favourite variation  (Dragon or Najdorf, for example)  will always be less comfortable when faced with a secondary system.  • The Grand Prix Attack is possible against every variation of the Sicilian.  • The Grand Prix Attack is above all easy to learn. There are no long variations to memorize by heart and there is actually rather little theory. It is enough to know where to place the pieces, to understand the plans, the classical attacking motifs and typical combinations. In fact, everything that we are actually going to see in this chapter.  Let us turn indeed to the chess characteristics of the Grand Prix Attack. Besides the move f2-f4  (which can occur on the 2nd or 3rd move)  , another pawn move forms the cornerstone of the system. This is the move d2-d3. By playing it, White renounces de facto opening up the game with d2-d4  (at least in the immediate future)  , and leads the game to the family of Sicilians called ‘closed’  (all those where the black c5-pawn will not be exchanged against the d4-pawn)  . If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a diagram will be worth more than a long variation. Let us therefore look at White’s classic pattern of development in the Grand Prix Attack:    You will notice the presence, already mentioned, of pawns on f4 and on d3, two knights on c3 and on f3  (on their natural squares)  , and the king which has castled kingside  (it will very rarely castle queenside in the Grand Prix Attack)  .  The light-squared bishop is on c4, the most aggressive square, but we will see that this is far from being the only possibility. The c1-bishop is, on the other hand, still in its starting blocks for now, and it can sometimes stay there a moment, while waiting for the c1-h6 diagonal to open up after the move f4-f5. Often the e3-square is not appropriate for this bishop, especially when its partner is on c4. If Black manages to play ...d7-d5 under the right conditions, he will win a piece:    After the retreat of the c4-bishop, the move ...d5-d4 forks the c3-knight and the e3-bishop. A tactical trap to remember, which has already claimed many victims.  Regarding diagram 1, we have to say a word about the major pieces. The f1-rook, after kingside castling, is perfectly placed without having to move. It will often have an important mission to fulfil when the f-file is opened after the move f4-f5. The queen, as so often, will have the primary role. It may intervene in the field of action on the kingside via e1 and then h4  (one of the interests of the move f2-f4, which opened the e1-h4 diagonal, thus allowing the passage of the queen)  . It is she who bestows upon herself, most of the time, the task of delivering the coup de grace on the h7-square, or a neighbouring one.   Now let us detail the first four white moves, where the order must be respected as far as possible.  1.e4  Normal. This is the guideline of our repertoire. 68 of the 69 games in this book begin with this move.  2.Nc3  Greco, and later the English grandmasters who popularized the Grand Prix Attack, played f2-f4 on the 2nd move. This move is an important element of the white set-up, but I do not advise it on the 2nd move, since then you have to reckon with the black counter move 2...d5!, which would then take the game away from the paths of the Grand Prix Attack. No need, therefore, to complicate the task by learning additional variations: ♘c3 on the 2nd move has the merit of avoiding ...d7-d5, and has no major drawback.  3.f4  One of the key moves of the Grand Prix Attack. White establishes a strong duo of central pawns  (e4 + f4)  and the f-pawn will have numerous uses.  4.Nf3  Knights before bishops! It is a general principle that must be applied here. White does not yet know which will be the best square for the f1-bishop, while the g1-knight has no other square than f3.  Here is the position obtained after the four initial development moves:    These four almost unchangeable moves will be the starting point for the positions that we will study. Our study will be divided into 4 sections of unequal length, depending on the system adopted by Black.  @@HeaderStart@@I. Black develops his king’s bishop with a fianchetto@@HeaderEnd@@    This is by far the most popular system and the most frequently played against the Grand Prix Attack. Therefore, we shall devote to it – by far! – the greater part of this chapter.  We will see that the f1-bishop will have the choice, depending on circumstances, between the c4-square  (the most aggressive line)  and the b5-square  (the positional line)  .  @@HeaderStart@@II. Black develops his king’s bishop to e7 and adopts the structure known as the ‘little centre’  (...e7-e6 + ...d7-d6)  @@HeaderEnd@@    In this system the f1-bishop can be developed on c4.  @@HeaderStart@@III. Black adopts a French structure  (with ...e7-e6 and ...d7-d5)  @@HeaderEnd@@    The f1-bishop can obviously not be developed on c4, so it will come to b5, or even possibly, in some cases, to g2.  @@HeaderStart@@IV. Black plays an early ...a7-a6 before the development of the f1-bishop  (on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th move)  @@HeaderEnd@@    The f1-bishop cannot come to b5, or even to c4  (because of the ...b7-b5 move that would occur automatically)  . As it has no other option, it will therefore be developed on g2. The game will then transpose into the so-called Closed Variation of the Sicilian where the move ...a7-a6 is not necessarily useful.   This chapter on the Grand Prix Attack will be the longest in this book, but this seems justified to me insofar as the Sicilian will certainly be the opening you will have the most chance of meeting. It is therefore normal to devote the bulk of our effort to it. Keep in mind that, according to statistics, on average you should have one game in two that will be a Sicilian if you start with 1.e4.  @@HeaderStart@@I. Black develops his king’s bishop with a fianchetto@@HeaderEnd@@  As has been mentioned in the introduction, this is the most common mode of development for Black when faced with the Grand Prix Attack, and more generally for all the closed Sicilians. In a certain sense, it is perfectly logical: in the absence of the ...c5xd4 exchange, the c5-pawn obstructs the a3-f8 diagonal and the dark-squared bishop is promised a better future on the long diagonal.  Luckily  (for White!)  , the fianchetto is also the system against which the Grand Prix Attack will be the most powerful. In this section, we will again divide our study into three subsections, always depending on the system adopted by Black.  @@HeaderStart@@A.

{ @@HeaderStart@@A.

This is the basic position of the Grand Prix Attack.   Let us note now that a white bishop on c4 will often play a critical role  (by pinning the f7-pawn)  , but its presence is not essential, as we shall see later. Once the basic construction has been reached, it only remains to eliminate the f6-knight and to exchange the fianchettoed bishop to mate on h7.  Various means will have to be considered to eliminate the f6-knight:  • The simple ♘   c3  -d5.  • If for some reason or other the c3-knight cannot leap to d5  (for example if there is a black pawn on e6)  , White may consider e5  (a clearance sacrifice!)  , followed by ♘   c3  -e4, still with the same idea of exchanging the f6-knight.  • Possible is also fxg6, followed by ♖xf6  (preceded or not by ♗xg7)  .

3... b5 4. Be2
{ The bishop went out a little early and must return home pronto.   4.Bb3  is not possible because of  c4 }

{ The light-squared bishop is now confined to its camp. Too bad, but this is not very serious. As mentioned in the introduction, this is not a piece that is essential for the attack. }

{ The queen heads towards the theatre of operations. } 9... O-O

14. Ng5
{ The Grand Prix Attack in all its splendour ! Note in particular the model arrangement of the bishop on h6, the knight on g5 and the queen on h4. Not to mention the f1-rook, ready to intervene as soon as the f-file opens. }
14... Ne5
{ Black precipitates his defeat by removing one of the protectors of the f6-knight. His position was already compromised in any case. To eliminate the two black knights that mutually defend themselves, White would have played Ne3-g4, and he would then have sacrificed the exchange as in the game. }

White’s plan remains more or less the same as in the previous section: ♕e1- h4, f4-f5, ♗h6, ♘g5 and an attack on h7! The main difference is the absence of the f6-knight. As a result, there is no defender of h7 to eliminate!   Two young female players from the French team played the following two games during the same round of a World Junior Championship. The two young girls had prepared together the morning before the round. Looking for an easy-to-learn system against the Sicilian, we opted, of course, for the Grand Prix Attack. }

{ So far, we have mostly seen young players in action. This is a guideline for the book, anyway: to study amateurs’ games, with their characteristic faults, rather than those of grandmasters, admittedly often free of major mistakes but sometimes a little difficult to grasp for the layman. It is nonetheless always instructive to take a look at the great champions, of course, to see how they treat the opening being investigated.  The Grand Prix Attack is unquestionably much more popular with youngsters and amateurs, due to its very aggressive nature, than with grandmasters who will be more willing – and above all more able – to stay afloat in the quagmire of Open Sicilian main lines  (with d4)  . Nevertheless, it sometimes makes notable appearances at the very highest levels.  In the following two games, we will see Boris Gelfand, a former vice-World Champion, facing the Grand Prix Attack. This provides the occasion to realize that, even for one of the very best players in the world, it is not so easy. Admittedly, he had facing him Nigel Short, World Championship finalist against Kasparov in 1993, and former World Champion Viswanathan Anand. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6
{ Anand is not an unbridled fan of the Grand Prix Attack like Nigel Short, but the Indian World Champion's move order conceals a subtlety on which it is interesting to pause for a moment. Boris Gelfand is a leading expert on the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian, which he plays almost exclusively when he opens with 1... c5. In the Najdorf main lines, Black rarely develops his knight to c6, but rather to d7. As we have already mentioned and which will be seen in more detail in the next game , the black move 2... d6 is not the most precise against the Grand Prix Attack. Better is 2...

A very interesting alternative to ♗c4 when Black has not played ...d7-d6 and seems to want to adopt the construction with ...g7-g6, ...♗g7, ...e7-e6 and a quick ...d7-d5.    White accepts the fact that his light-squared bishop cannot effectively stay on the a2-g8 diagonal if Black reacts correctly in the centre. By developing the bishop to b5, the subtle idea is to combine the traditional plan of attack on the kingside with a positional theme: the exchange on c6 in order to create doubled c-pawns. Black would be well advised to avoid this exchange. If he accepts the doubled pawns and recaptures with the b-pawn, three pawn structures can arise. They will all three be favourable to White, who will then have easy plans to take advantage of them.  @@HeaderStart@@Structure n°1@@HeaderEnd@@    Black has played ...d7-d5, perhaps thinking of undoubling his pawns. This will not be the case. White will push e4-e5 and then focus all his forces on attacking the c5-pawn, which will be very weak.  @@HeaderStart@@Structure n°2@@HeaderEnd@@    This time, Black has played more modestly ...e7-e6 and ...d7-d6, to support his c5-pawn. Nevertheless, White will undermine the protection of the c5-pawn by playing e4-e5  (prepared for the most part by ♕e1)  . Two possibilities afterwards:  1. Black plays ...d6-d5, and we exactly return to the previous structure.  2. Black accepts an exchange of the pawns e5 and d6. In this case, the c5-pawn is again very weak.  @@HeaderStart@@Structure n°3@@HeaderEnd@@    Black has not played ...e7-e6, and he leaves his pawn on d6 to provide the best protection of the c5-pawn. However, with such a structure the g8-knight cannot develop to e7 and will have to settle for the f6-square. White will then return to his first love: the traditional attack on the kingside, based on f4-f5 and ♕e1-h4. The absence of light-squared bishops, as we know, is not critical. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@IV. Black plays an early ...a7-a6@@HeaderEnd@@  The ...a7-a6 move can occur at several points before the f1-bishop emerges.  On the 2nd move:    On the 3rd move:    On the 4th move:    In all three situations it is better to avoid developing the bishop to c4  (let alone b5!)  because Black could then play ...b7-b5, and threaten to trap it by ...c5-c4 if it retreats to b3.  As a result, the bishop has little alternative but to be fianchettoed after g2-g3. The game would then transpose into a Closed Sicilian  (that is its name!)  . Admittedly,  the  Closed  Sicilian  (with g2-g3)  is not really part of our repertoire, and the limited nature of this book does not allow us to treat it in any depth. However, there is a detail of some importance: specifically that ...a7-a6 move. In the Closed Sicilian, the a7-pawn should generally go to a5, and it goes there in one move. In other words, if Black has previously played ...a7-a6, White will have an extra tempo. To measure the importance of this tempo gain, let us already see an example of how things may unfold when White does not have it. }

[White "The King’s Indian Attack against the French"]
[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Comanchero! The King’s Indian Attack against the French@@HeaderEnd@@  1.e4 e6  The French Defence, one of the oldest and most respectable answers to 1.e4. It was thus baptised after a correspondence match between London and Paris which took place from 1834 to 1836, and in which the French had answered 1...e6 to 1.e4. The French Defence has subsequently withstood the test of time. In terms of popularity it is today located 3rd of the defences the most played against 1.e4, following 1...e5 and the Sicilian. The former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik and the later challenger Viktor Kortchnoi both notably made it their main weapon in their respective fight for the title.  Compared to 1...e5, the first Black move in the French   1...e6  seems modest and even passive  (as it restricts the c8-bishop)  , but it contains profound strategic ideas. First and foremost, Black seeks to establish a solid wall on the a2-g8 diagonal, thereby putting paid to all those ultra-fast attacks on the f7-pawn so frequent in the open games. In other words, no more Scholar’s Mate or even our Fegatello Attack from the 2nd chapter.  On the almost automatic response 2.d4 Black will then counter-attack against the e4-pawn by playing ...d7-d5, thereby seeking to provoke the white advance to e5. A closed position will then ensue – which is what Black is usually looking for in the French Defence – where the second player’s chances are in no way inferior. Thanks to the moves ...c7-c5 and ...f7-f6 that he keeps up his sleeve, Black will be able to obtain satisfactory counterplay against the white centre.  Of course, as with the Sicilian, it is not our intention to embark on a study of the main variations of the French Defence. This is undoubtedly fascinating, but let’s leave it to experienced players  (or to those who have the time)  and let us be content, at least at first, to adopt a system that is easy to learn, and above all easy to understand.   The King’s Indian Attack that I am proposing against the French Defence fits perfectly into this framework. As early as the 2nd move, by playing 2.d3 rather than the mechanical 2.d4, White will avoid the main lines and lead Black into positions which will probably be less familiar to him.    The King’s Indian Attack is more a universal method of development than a specific variation. It is characterized by the moves ♘f3, g2-g3, ♗g2, d2-d3, ♘bd2, e2-e4 and 0-0, which can be played in  (almost)  any order. Well, let us say with several different move orders, and not just by starting with 1.e4.   Regardless of the path used, here is the basic position  (the tabiya, to use a chess term!)  to which White should arrive after eight moves.    Experienced players and those with a good memory will immediately recognize the development scheme of the King’s Indian Defence   an opening after  1.d4  . In fact, the King’s Indian Attack is actually only a King’s Indian Defence with colours reversed, and with an extra tempo  (which is not so important)  .  The King’s Indian Attack has several advantages:  • It can virtually be played against every black opening, even without starting with 1.e4   for example with  1.♘f3  or even  1.g3  . However, of course, we will only study it against the French   and by starting with  1.e4!  . Moreover, theory considers that it is against the French that the King’s Indian Attack is the most effective, because of the fact that the c8-bishop has already been closed in by the move ...e7-e6.  • It is easy to play, as there are no major theoretical lines to recite by heart. You just have to know which squares to put the pieces on, and recognize the manoeuvres and thematic combinations that we will study in this chapter. I emphasize once again the fact that the understanding of an opening is much more important than the memorization of lengthy variations. This was true in the previous chapter with the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian. It will be again in the next chapter with the Yugoslav Attack against the king’s fianchetto, and it is just as important – possibly even more so – with the King’s Indian Attack.  • It often gives rise to rich and exciting attacking positions, as we will see.  • It was played by several World Champions, starting with Fischer, who made it one of his main weapons against  the French and the Sicilian, but also by Botvinnik and Vassily Smyslov. Today, grandmasters of the highest order such as Alexander Morozevich or Victor Bologan use it regularly. This is the best proof of the soundness of this opening. Our study cannot be exhaustive, and so in this chapter we will confine ourselves to the three principal modes of development that Black can adopt in the French Defence against the King’s Indian Attack.  I. The classic variation, in which Black castles kingside after having developed the knight to f6 and the  bishop to e7    II. Black develops his bishop to g7, his knight to e7, and castles kingside    III. Black castles queenside    Here we go, and we start quite naturally with the ‘Classic’ Variation, which, as its name suggests, is the most frequently played line. }

{ If Black now trades on e4, White can recapture with the d-pawn without this resulting in the exchange of queens. It is important for him to keep a pawn on e4  (which will advance to e5 in the middlegame)  and not to recapture with a piece on e4. }

{ Here 4.g3 would also be possible and would only be a transposition of moves. }
4... Nc6 5. g3
{ The fianchetto of the bishop is obviously a central theme in the King’s Indian Attack. }
5... Nf6 6. Bg2 Be7
{ When the knight is on f6 this is the best square for the bishop. It would not be much more active on d6, and above all it would then be exposed to the threat of a fork on e5 as soon as White plays Re1  (and perhaps even Qe2, if Black has played ...Qc7 to prevent the threat)  . }
7. O-O O-O
{ Kingside castling is the most natural, but when we have seen the kind of attacks that Black can be subjected to on the kingside, we can understand that he sometimes seeks to castle on the other side.  We will study this possibility in Game 57. }
8. Re1
{ The right square for the rook. It will support the e4-e5 advance, and leave the f1-square for the redeployment of  the d2-knight.  From this position, which is the basic position of the variation  (the tabiya!)  , White’s play can develop as follows:  1. e4-e5 will be the signal for a kingside attack.  2. The d2-knight will be recycled to f1, firstly to allow the c1-bishop to develop to f4 to  (over-)  protect the strong point on e5.   3. The h-pawn will advance to h4. The f1-knight will take advantage of this to get out on h2 and head for g4.  With the pawn on h4, two options are then available to White:   @@StartBlockQuote@@• Continue to advance the h-pawn to h5, and even up to h6 to create holes in the black king position. If Black  halts this advance by playing ...h7-h6 himself, White will prepare the sacrifice of a piece on h6 @@StartBracket@@after Ng4 and Qd2@@EndBracket@@.@@EndBlockQuote@@@@StartBlockQuote@@• Leave the h-pawn on h4 and use it to support the f3-knight on g5. The white queen could then intervene on h5  to threaten mate on h7. If Black plays ...h7-h6 @@StartBracket@@before or after Ng5@@EndBracket@@, numerous sacrifices are again possible,  as we shall see.@@EndBlockQuote@@4. In every case, White can also consider the move c2-c4 in the middlegame to attempt to gain control of the e4-square. This square will often make a decisive contribution to the kingside attack  (see in particular Game 52, involving Bobby Fischer)  .  If he does not react appropriately to all this, Black can quickly find himself crushed by a lightning attack, as we will see. The first game is a perfect example of this and demonstrates the model attack that White can dream of when playing the KIA.  In this game, White is the International Master Mark Dvoretsky. Regarded as one of the best trainers in the world, Dvoretsky is a strong supporter of the King’s Indian Attack, and he regularly advises his students to play it. It is therefore only natural to start with one of his games. }

14... h6
{ If 14... Bxg5 White can either recapture with the h-pawn, with a similar continuation to that of the game  (without the piece less !)  , or with the bishop, with ideas based on Qh5 and Bf6. A theme to be found in Game 53. }
15. Qh5
{ A first thematic and very intuitive sacrifice. Mathilde blindly trusts the coach, who had said during the course that one could sacrifice the knight in  (almost !)  all positions  (sic !)  . As we shall see, this sacrifice was not completely correct, however, and it cannot withstand a rigorous defence conducted by an analysis engine. However, we must put this in context: this game was played by two children of twelve years old  (one of whom had an Elo of over 2000 all the same)  , in limited time, and obviously without the aid of a computer. If we admit that the sacrifice was not correct  (and that chess is not poker !)  , the right move was to wisely retreat the knight to h3, arguing that she had at least provoked the move ...h7-h6, which represents a weakness. White could then have played Qh5, followed by Ng4 and the threat of a sacrifice on h6. With good attacking possibilities, in any case, while Black's counterplay on the queenside won't take shape for a long time. }
15... hxg5
{ Of course, Black has no choice and must accept the challenge. All the more so since the f7-pawn was attacked, and White threatened to play Ng4 anyway, followed by the sacrifice on h6. }
16. hxg5
{ Just as we saw in the previous game, White will try to play Bf3, followed by Kg2, to get a rook to the h-file. }
16... Nd4 17. Ng4 Nf5
{ Black wisely brings a piece back to defend.  The overly greedy   17...Nxc2 ?  offered White some great attacking chances:  18.Nf6+ !  already with a piece less and two rooks attacked, White can no longer hesitate. Taking with the pawn lost immediately:  gxf6 ?   18...Bxf6  19.exf6  Qd7  20.fxg7  Nh7   20...Ng6  21.Be5 !  followed by 22.

The rook twists to get to the h-file. It will achieve this via f4 or f6. White therefore has a very strong attack, and it is unnecessary to burden our discussion by attempting to exhaustively analyse all the variations. One point is certain: for a player who is not a grandmaster the defence will be very difficult at the board, and with limited time.  19.exf6  once more we see the problems for Black ! of having the queen on the same diagonal as the opposing bishop  e5  to give the e6-square to the knight to protect g7  20.Rxe5  Bd6  21.Qh6  Ne6  22.g6  fxg6  23.Qxg6+  Ng7  24.Rh5 !  and the penetration of the queen or the rook on h7 is decisive; }

18... gxf6 19. exf6
{ Perfectly logically, White wanted to take advantage of the vis-a-vis bishop/queen, but at least   19.gxf6  had the merit of recovering one of the two sacrificed pieces while retaining some attacking possibilities:  Ng6   19...d4 ?  20.Be4 !  Bxe4  21.dxe4  Ng7  an original position, to say the least, where two black pieces are voluntarily ! forked by the f6-pawn !  22.Qh6  Ne8  23.Kg2  with a very strong attack  20.fxe7  Nfxe7  21.Bg5  with a very difficult position to play for both sides especially for children of 12 , and even to analyse. With Bf6 on the next move, White has a strong initiative that certainly compensates the piece less. All the more so since she still has the possibility of Bf3 and Kg2 to bring the rook to h1 in reserve. }

31. Rh1
{ The rook finally comes to h1, and White is rewarded for her efforts: mate is unstoppable. A rather extraordinary game. As stated above, it is not a question of thoroughly analysing all the consequences of the various sacrifices nor is it possible ! . These few variations, which are obviously not to be learned by heart, are just meant to show the typical ideas of the King's Indian Attack, and to prove its rich combinational potential. This is indisputable. }

Often in this main variation of the King's Indian Attack, Black may have the idea of playing ...f7-f6, to give himself a little air. The intention is good, but if poorly realized this idea can have detrimental consequences. Admittedly, Black eliminates the dangerous e5-pawn, and thus reduces the white attacking potential on the kingside, but he risks jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire by giving himself a positional disadvantage. After the exchange on f6, the e6-pawn finds itself weakened on the semi-open e-file, on which the white rook is already stationed. Let us see this in a game that pits two of the biggest French under-10 hopes together, respectively our national champion and the runner-up.

1. g3
{ Many move orders are possible to reach the King's Indian Attack. Of course, in our repertoire we recommend playing 1. e4 and to only play it against the French Defence. At least at first. }
1... Nf6 2. Bg2 d5 3. Nf3 e6 4. O-O Be7 5. d3 O-O 6. Nbd2 c5 7. Re1 Nc6 8. e4
{ We finally get to our usual position on the 8th move. } 8... d4
{ After beginning with a neutral move 1. g3 , the game transposed into a French when White played 8. e4, and now we find ourselves in... a King's Indian Defence reversed. This just goes to show that nothing is fixed, and there are many walkways that let you move from one opening to another in the same game. I must say a word  (and even several)  about the exchange on e4 that occurs quite frequently from players who have little experience of the opening. After 8... dxe4 9. dxe4 Black is forced to play 9... e5 as if not White will play it himself and retain the same attacking opportunities on the kingside, thanks to his e5-pawn, while having gained the important e4-square on the way. After the move c2-c3 from White, which will happen at one time or another, we then get the following pawn structure, which seems almost symmetrical. Symmetrical, indeed, but certainly not equal. White has the d5-square, which cannot be challenged by a pawn, while Black does not have the equivalent on d4. In this pawn structure with pieces on,  (needless to say !)  , White has a relatively simple plan. He will abandon his attack on the kingside the pawn structure is no longer appropriate and will manoeuvre to occupy d5, by playing, for example, Nd2-f1   c4  -e3-d5 or Bf1-c4 the light-squared bishop no longer has much to do on the h1-a8 diagonal. An exchange on d5 could allow White to recapture with the pawn and to create a passed pawn that can then be supported by c3-c4. This would prove to be an important asset in all endgames. Occupation of the d5-square certainly does not ensure victory by itself, but it gives White a good positional advantage, particularly since Black has nothing whatsoever to oppose it as long as the c3-pawn defends the d4-square. Now back to the game. }
9. e5
{ Of course ! Otherwise Black plays ...e6-e5 himself, and the position becomes a King's Indian Defence with colours reversed. White's one or two extra tempi then have little value, firstly because the rook has nothing more to do on e1 it should be on f1 to support the f2-f4 break. }
9... Nd7
{ Now we have a classic King's Indian Attack position in which Black has played the move ...d5-d4, which, as we know, is rather unfavourable  (the e4-square is stronger than the d5-square !)  .  Here, best may be   9...Nd5 }
10. h4
{ It would obviously have been more accurate to play   10.Nf1  first, in order to answer Bf4 to ...Qc7. }
10... Qc7 11. Nf1 Rd8
{ Black can take advantage of White's inaccuracy with   11...Ndxe5  12.Nxe5  Nxe5  13.Rxe5  Qxe5  and White has nothing better than a repetition of moves, if he does not want to play with a pawn less:  14.Bf4  Qf5   14...Qf6 ?  15.Bg5  15.Be4  Qh3  16.Bg2 = }
12. N1h2
{ He had to play   12.Bf4  which protected the e5-pawn and prevented ...f7-f6 because of the opposition bishop/queen. }
12... f6 { Black could again take the pawn and force White to repeat. } 13.
exf6 Bxf6
{ There we are. Black now has a backward and therefore weak pawn on the e-file. White has a small positional advantage. }
14. Ng4
{ It wasn't possible to take the pawn immediately:   14.Rxe6  Nde5 !  and White is obliged to give up the exchange. }
14... e5
{ Whether it is on e6 or e5, the pawn remains backward, and therefore always weak. On top of that, White has the beautiful square on e4. }
15. Nxf6+
{ It made more sense to increase the pressure on the e5-pawn:   15.Qe2  Re8  16.Bf4 !  A somewhat original position. The e5-pawn is at the centre of all the attention, 5 times attacked, and 5 times defended. White cannot add an extra attacker for the moment, but Black, for his part, is tied to the defence of the pawn and can undertake nothing. White could then use the e4-square to manoeuvre, or exchange on f6, forcing a recapture by the g-pawn, and then try to take advantage of the weakening of the black king position. }
15... Nxf6 16. Bg5 Rf8 17. Bxf6 Rxf6 18. Ng5
{ White still has the small advantage of the e4-square and, above all, Black does not have any counterplay on the horizon. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@II. Black develops his king’s bishop to g7@@HeaderEnd@@  Black sometimes chooses to develop his knight to e7 and fianchetto his dark-squared bishop in order to strengthen  his king’s future home. Faced with this system White’s plan remains substantially the same, and the attack on the kingside can sometimes even be enhanced due to the weakness caused by the fianchetto  (the f6 and h6-squares can become fragile)  .   Let us find the eminent coach Dvoretsky again with white in this game, and see how he does it. }

The knight on g4 and the bishop on f4 will put pressure on the dark squares. Pressure that may be strengthened by the move Qd2 or Qe3 . White will furthermore play h4-h5 possibly even without preparation and exchange on g6 to create new weaknesses. The recapture with the f-pawn would weaken the e6-pawn, and the recapture with the h-pawn more natural in terms of the pawn structure would allow a strong attack after Ng5 and the passage of the queen to the h-file via g4 and h4;   C.   11... h6  to answer ...g6-g5 to h4-h5 and try to keep the kingside closed.

{ @@HeaderStart@@III. Black castles queenside@@HeaderEnd@@  In view of all the attacks on Black’s kingside that we have observed, he may be tempted – and with good reason – to castle queenside. The game then takes a quite different course. With opposite side castling the facts are clear: it’s a sprint to open lines against the opposing king, and the first to arrive wins.  The positions are balanced, with chances to both sides, but White’s may be the easier to play between players who are not grandmasters  (or even masters...)  . Indeed, White has more levers to open lines on the queenside  (b2-b4, a4-a5 or even c2-c4)  , while Black only has the move ...h5-h4, and can therefore only pass by the h-file.  In many positions the g2-bishop is also found to be a particularly strong defender. }

[White "St. George Attack against the Pirc and the Modern"]
[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Harangue the Dragon! The St. George Attack against the Pirc and the Modern  (King’s Fianchetto)  @@HeaderEnd@@  The Pirc Defence, named after the Yugoslav player Vasja Pirc from the middle of the 20th century, and its very close cousin the Modern Defence, are quite popular among club players, and especially with beginners who want to avoid the complications of 1.e4 e5 and the main variations of the Sicilian.  The strategy of these two openings is relatively simple – this is the reason for their popularity – and can be summarized in a few words: fianchetto the king’s bishop, castle, and then look for play on the queenside by advancing, for example, the c- and b-pawns.  The g7-bishop plays an important role in these openings. It supports the attack on the queenside by exerting strong pressure on the long a1-h8 diagonal, and above all, it provides additional protection to the kingside.  Of course, there are possibilities for Black other than the attack on the queenside. In particular, he can counterattack in the centre by ...e7-e5, just as in the King’s Indian Defence   after  1.d4  , of which the Pirc is in fact the counterpart for 1.e4.  Here are the moves after which the Pirc Defence occurs:  1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6  The Modern is in fact a hyperaccelerated Pirc, since Black plays ...g7-g6 on the very first move.  Since most of the time the g8-knight will be developed on f6 anyway, there is a good chance to transpose into a Pirc. Within the limited scope of this book, we will not go into all the intricacies and we will treat the two openings in the same way.  Against the Pirc  (and also the Modern)  , I suggest one of the most aggressive systems, that will put its finger on the weakness of the black structure, namely the ...g7-g6 move.  Attacks on a king position where no pawn has yet moved require much more preparation and effort than those on a king position where a pawn is no longer on its initial square.  The move ...g7-g6 in the Pirc  (and in the Modern)  , in order to fianchetto the bishop, specifically constitutes a weakening of the kingside – even if this is not obvious at the beginning – and actually provides a target of attack for White. The latter is going to advance the h-pawn  (after having castled queenside, needless to say)  up till h5 to provoke an exchange of this pawn and open the file for the h1-rook. The white attack should thus be much faster – and a lot more dangerous – than Black’s on the other wing.  Pay attention, however, to an important point in this type of attack: a fianchetto can only be defeated if it has previously been emptied of the bishop which is inside. This means that if we are not able to exchange the fianchettoed bishop, it will be quite difficult to checkmate the king.  An example:    In this position White has just captured on h7 and seems to have a strong attack, but this is not the case, and his threats are purely illusory. After ...♔f8 White’s attack is momentarily stalled because he has no means of exchanging the g7-bishop. As a result, it is finally Black’s attack on the other wing that must be considered the most dangerous.   If, on the other hand, White still had his dark-squared bishop  (instead of allowing it to be exchanged for the f6-knight)  , the game would immediately be decided in his favour after the move ♗h6.  We therefore retain from now on that it is very important for White to preserve his dark-squared bishop from any exchange for a knight. To this end, a small pawn move holds a prominent place in the system that we will study. This is the move f2-f3, and it can be played as soon as Black has shown his intention to fianchetto his bishop  (before that, it makes no sense)  .   Please note, therefore, not to play ♘f3 too soon! It will only jam-up the square.  The move f2-f3 has a threefold purpose:  • Overprotect the e4-pawn. Prophylaxis, in view of the black moves ...c7-c6 and ...b7-b5, which will threaten, after ...b5-b4, to attack the c3-knight defending the e4-pawn;  • To be able to develop the c1-bishop to e3 without fearing the move ...♘g4, which would threaten to exchange this bishop which is so important;  • To prepare an attack with the g4- and h4-pawns after castling queenside.  Opposite these multiple advantages, the move f2-f3 also has an obvious disadvantage: it takes the natural development square from the g1-knight, which must now settle for e2  (or h3)  .   As a result, the development of the white kingside is going to be a little bit complicated. Theory says that one can avoid the f2-f3 pawn move while still playing the same plan as that which you will be offered. This is true, and it is even currently one of the most popular systems against the Pirc. However, this obliges us to reckon with the move ...♘g4, and that slightly complicates White’s task. I therefore suggest playing this move f2-f3 anyway. For sure, it will not be a completely lost tempo.  After the move f2-f3, White’s plan can be broken down as follows:  1. Play ♗e3  (without fearing ...♘g4!)  , followed by ♕d2, to prepare the exchange of bishops on h6;  2. Castle queenside;  3. Open the h-file with the h4-h5 pawn lever;  4. Exchange the fianchettoed bishop and penetrate to h6 with the queen;  5. Remove the f6-knight, which defends the h7-square.  There is no order sine qua non for the different stages, some of which can be interchanged.  And of course, we keep an eye on the opponent’s threats on the other side. We will see in particular that White has some defensive moves that should not be overlooked  (like ♔b1 or even ♘c1)  .  This generic attack, valid against all systems with a king’s fianchetto  (like in the Grand Prix Attack!)  , does not have its own name in the Pirc. In his book Une boussole sur l’échiquier  (Olibris)  , the coach Xavier Parmentier has baptised it the ‘Baby’s Smile’ attack, as it is so natural and easy to play. It can also be found under the name of Yugoslav Attack or St. George Attack  (the one we will retain in this volume)  , in reference to the Christian martyr of the same name being represented in the process of slaying a dragon. In the Sicilian, the line where Black fianchettoes his bishop is actually called the Dragon Variation, and has a ‘firebreathing’ bishop on g7.  The St. George Attack could just as well have borne the name of Bobby Fischer, as the American World Champion made it into such a formidable weapon, especially against the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian. One of his formulations in particular has gone down in history: ‘With such an attack, even a 10-yearold could beat a grandmaster. Just play h4-h5, sac, sac, and it’s mate!’.   Of course, this is a bit exaggerated, but when a player who has understood the white attacking themes faces an inexperienced opponent, it is certainly not far from Fischer’s formula. We will see that in the two games from this chapter, where White was a future French grandmaster, who was only fifteen at the time but who already had a very sharp tactical vision. }

[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Spotlight on the Night Attack@@HeaderEnd@@  The gambit  (voluntarily!)  of a pawn in the opening does not always necessarily aim at a violent ultra-fast attack on the opposing king, as was notably the case with the Greco Gambit that we studied in Chapter 2. Sometimes, the sacrifice of a pawn in the first few moves of a game is just intended to gain some positional compensation  (a strong square, a semi-open file, giving the opponent doubled pawns, etc.)  , which he must then exploit. This is the case in the Night Attack, for example, thus prettily baptised by the theoretician Hans Kmoch, because ‘it surprises the opponent’s pieces that are still fast asleep’.  Look at the pawn structure in the following diagram:    Naturally, all the pieces are still on the board, but in this case, it’s just the position of the pawns – especially Black’s – that matters to us.  The white bridgehead  (the e6-pawn)  has just penetrated deep into the black camp and sacrificed itself to disrupt the opponent’s pieces. Black has taken with the f7-pawn. It was hard to leave the white pawn on e6.  In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, White has obtained much positional compensation:  • Black has two doubled pawns  (e7 and e6)  . The e6-pawn is particularly weak, and can easily be attacked by the white major pieces that will inevitably take up position on the e-file. The e7-pawn for its part is useless, and it is unlikely that Black will be able to do anything with it. It is therefore reasonable to estimate that Black has only half a pawn more.  • The e5-square, located in front of the doubled pawns, is a strong square for White. It can no longer be attacked by a black pawn and will therefore be a beautiful outpost for a knight that cannot be chased away.  • The pawn sacrifice following the Night Attack has had a paralysing effect on the black pieces, surprised in their sleep. The f8-bishop, in particular, has been walled up in its crib, in the words of Hans Kmoch, and it will have great difficulty getting out of its shackles. As a result, the h8-rook will also find it very hard to be mobilized. We will see two extreme examples in the first two games of this chapter where these two pieces have remained locked and powerless on their starting squares right until the end of the game.  • Recapturing with the f7-pawn has weakened the h5-e8 diagonal, which is not without consequences, as will be seen. These consequences will be even more dramatic if the move ...h7-h6 was played.    The g6-square is fatally weakened. All this finally at the cost of only one pawn, and even perhaps only half a pawn if one considers that the two pawns on e6 and e7 are hardly worth more than a whole pawn between them. It is not a high price to pay, and White would be wrong to deprive himself if he has the opportunity to achieve the Night Attack.  The Night Attack is not specific to a particular opening. It may notably occur in the Caro-Kann Defence   1...c6  and in the Alekhine Defence   1...♘f6  , which will both be under the spotlight in this chapter. }

{ The Caro-Kann. An opening that is less popular, with youngsters, than the Sicilian, the French and in particular 1... e5. }
2. d4
{ Against the Caro-Kann you can also play the King's Indian Attack see Chapter 5 . However, as ...e7-e6 has not yet been played, the c8-bishop may be developed more easily, in particular on f5 or g4, and as a result, Black will have fewer problems to solve than in the French. }
2... d5 3. e5
{ The Advance Variation, a good choice as a first step. It is useless, for now, to spend hours studying the main lines of an opening that we will ultimately not meet very often to begin with. }
3... Bf5
{ There are other moves in this position, such as   3...c5  but this one makes the most sense and is played almost instinctively by the vast majority of Caro-Kann players. Black develops his bishop outside the pawn chain before playing ...e7-e6. }
4. h4
{ A cunning move that sets two traps, and many inexperienced players have fallen victim to one or the other. }
4... h6
{ Also possible is the move 4... h5 which we will see in Game 63.  The first trap is rather crude:   4...e6 ??  5.g4 !  Be4  6.f3  Bg6  7.h5  and the bishop is trapped Hoffer-Batigne, France tt-jr 2000/01; Neuhauser-Estarellas, France tt-jr 2003/04, and many others .The move ...h7-h6, which is very common in the Caro-Kann, is intended to provide a retreat square for the bishop on h7, so that it can stay on the beautiful b1-h7 diagonal. }
5. g4
{ The second trap is much more subtle. The player conducting the black pieces, even though he had an Elo of nearly 1900, falls right into it. }
5... Bh7
{ Paradoxically he had to repatriate the bishop to d7, as we will see in Game 62.  We will also see the move   5...Be4  (played by a grandmaster with a 2707 Elo!)  , in the next game. }
6. e6 { The Night Attack ! } 6... fxe6
{ Among the many black problems that we detailed in the introduction, high on the list is the weakness of the g6-square. Only the h7-bishop defends it. White must therefore exchange this piece. }
7. Bd3 Bxd3
{ If Black does not capture, then White will take, and the black rook will end up awkwardly on h7. }
8. Qxd3 Kd7
{ Faced with the threatened check on g6, the black king decides to flee immediately, but it will not be safer on the queenside.   8...Kf7  does not solve anything at all:  9.Nf3  Nd7  10.g5 !  and if  10...hxg5 ?  11.Nxg5+  with a quick mate.   8...Nf6  was not really better either:  9.Qg6+  Kd7  10.Nf3  Nathalie Wirig-Christine Ficet, France ch-FRA U20 girls 1999 The arrival of the knight on the strong e5-square will cause great damage.

{ 1-0 A fairly expeditious game. Facing the 1860 Elo player, the conductor of the white pieces was a girl of barely ten years old. Admittedly, she would become French Champion in her age group a few months later. After having seen the Night Attack in the hands of a 10-year-old girl, let us now go right to the other end of the scale with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, the French number 1, against one of the world's best players during the very strong Alekhine Memorial Tournament, played in Paris in 2013. Studying this game in depth would take us too far and well outside the scope of this book. That is why we will only stop to look at some key moments while enjoying the comments from Maxime Vachier-Lagrave  (MVL)  , and we refer interested readers to the analyses that have been published in several specialized magazines, including Europe Echecs number 633 in particular. }

2... d5

Bc4, taking the game into an Italian  (the Giuoco Pianissimo, without c2-c3 !)  or a Vienna   after  3.f4  , or keep several options by playing the neutral development move 3. Nf3. True, if White exclusively plays the Italian with c2-c3, he may find himself on somewhat unknown paths, but it must be said that this will probably also be the case for Black. A player of the Alekhine   1...Nf6  is seldom also a player of 1... e5 on the first move, which is why Black overwhelmingly chooses to play 2... d5 in this position. }

{ The Scandinavian. The opening that will be proposed in the 2nd part of this opus dedicated to Black's defences ! For now, we are on the white side, though, and we will see how to deal with it. }
2. exd5 Qxd5
{ Also possible is the move   2...Nf6  with the idea of taking back with the knight to avoid bringing the queen out too early. We will see that in Game 67. }
3. Nc3 { White gains a development tempo by attacking the queen. } 3... Qa5
{ The most natural square for the queen, but two other retreats,  3... Qd8  and    3... Qd6  are also possible. The second alternative has recently gained some popularity. After    3... Qd6 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 a6  if not,   6.Nb5  can be unpleasant    , White can play  6. g3  to fianchetto his king's bishop. The bishop will be very good on the long diagonal, and after castling White could threaten Bf4, or even Ne5-c4, with a pleasant position. }
4. d4 Nf6
{ Black must be very vigilant with his queen. Many classical traps exist in this variation of the Scandinavian in which the queen has come out prematurely. An example:   4...Nc6  5.Bb5  threat 6. d5  5...Bd7  6.Bd2  Nf6 ??  7.Nd5 !  Qxb5  8.Nxc7 }
5. Nf3 Bf5
{ The natural square for the bishop. We will see the development of the bishop to g4 in the next game. }
6. Bc4 c6
{ A necessary move, sooner or later, to ensure an escape route for the black queen, which will be indirectly threatened following Bd2. After   6...Nc6  7.Bd2  the threat of a discovery is again very unpleasant and many young players have fallen victim to it. One example:  7...e6 ??  8.Nd5  and the black queen has no square Bilel Bellahcene-Tobias Bianchi, France ch-FRA jr 2006 . }
7. Bd2 e6
{ 7...Nbd7  8.Qe2 !  an important move in this variation, as we will see in the game  8...Bxc2 ?  was played in the game Charles Baudson-Anthony Aras, French Junior Championship 2004. Taking the c2-pawn is rarely good in this type of position. Here it is downright bad:  9.Nb5  Qd8 ??  10.Nd6  # He obviously had to play   9...Qb6  but  10.Nd6  followed by the capture on f7, also gave White a decisive advantage. }
8. Qe2
{ A good square for the queen, as we said in the previous note. White plans to castle queenside and then to play Ne5, followed by g2-g4 and h2-h4 to harass the f5-bishop. On e2 the queen is also placed opposite the black king in case the position opens up. On the other hand, the discovery   8.Nd5  Qd8  9.Nxf6  Qxf6  did not give much for now. }
8... Bxc2
{ Far too greedy ! The retreat   8...Qc7  followed by castling kingside is too passive and allows White a strong initiative:  9.O-O-O  Bd6  10.Ne5  O-O  11.g4 !  Bg6  12.h4  and the threat of h4-h5 is very unpleasant.     He had to play  8...Bb4 !  After  9.O-O-O  the position remains balanced. Here again White will try to place his knight on  e5  to play g2-g4 and obtain some play on the kingside. }
9. d5
{ A thematic move to open the centre and exploit the two confrontations Qe2/Ke8 and Bd2/Qa5. In addition, the c2-bishop is unprotected, and this might matter in some variations. }
9... cxd5 10. Nxd5 Qd8 11. Nxf6+ Qxf6
{ 11...gxf6  was no better:  12.Bb5  Nd7   12...Nc6  13.Rc1  +-  13.Bc3 !  attacking the c2-bishop  13...Bf5   13...Bg6  14.Rd1  +-  14.Rd1  e5  15.Nxe5 !  fxe5  16.Qxe5  Qe7  17.Qxe7  the queen was pinned and could not take the h8-rook  17...Bxe7  18.Bxh8  +- }
12. Bb5+ Nd7
{ 12...Nc6  13.Bxc6  bxc6  14.Qc4  +-  Once again, it is the unprotected position of the c2-bishop that is decisive.   12...Kd8  13.Bg5  +- }
13. Bxd7+ Kxd7 14. Ne5+
{ The black king finds itself helpless before the combined attack of the white queen, knight and bishop. }
14... Ke7
{ This leads to a forced mate, but all the retreats were losing:   14...Ke8  15.Qb5  Kd8  16.Qd7  #     14...Kc7  15.Qc4  Kd8  16.Ba5 !  a check to weaken the c6-square  16...b6  17.Qd4  Kc8  18.Qd7  Kb8  19.Nc6  #     14...Kd8  15.Bg5 !  Qxg5  16.Nxf7  +- }

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6

3. d4
{ As will be discussed in the 2nd volume, it is not advisable for White to cling on to the pawn by   3.c4 ?! }
3... Nxd5
{ 3...Bg4 !?  (the Portuguese Variation !)  will be the move proposed in the section dedicated to Black. If the reader finds himself faced with it from the white side, he can refer to this to see what to do, and especially what not to do. }
4. c4 Nb6 5. Nf3
{ It is best to avoid   5.Nc3 ?!  which gives Black too much play after  5...e5 !  6.dxe5  Qxd1+  7.Nxd1  Nc6 }
5... Bg4
{ 5...g6  is also possible, but White has easy development and a slightly favourable position due to his strong duo of central pawns. }
6. c5 { This strong move puts Black in serious trouble. } 6... Bxf3
{ 6...N6d7  7.Bc4  e6  8.Nc3  and White has a more pleasant game;   6...Nd5  7.Qb3 !

Nc2+  10.Kd1  Nxa1  11.Bb5+  ±  9.gxf3  e6  10.Bb5  +/-  White has a pawn more and Black has no compensation. }
7. Qxf3 Nd5 8. Qb3 b6
{ 8...Nc6 ?  9.Qxb7  Ndb4  10.Bb5  ±  The attack on the c6-knight is stronger than the threat of a fork on c2. }
9. Bg5 Qd7
{ 9...h6 ?  10.Bc4 !  c6  11.Bh4  +/-. White is better because of his bishop pair and advance in development. }
10. Nc3 e6 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. Qxd5 exd5 13. c6
{ A pretty tactic which prevents the b8- ?knight from coming out, and which will thus completely tie Black up. }

1. e4 Nc6 { The Nimzowitsch Defence against the king pawn. } 2. Nf3
{ Simpler for our repertoire than   2.d4  which will enter the main lines of the Nimzowitsch. }
2... d5
{ Black stays in the spirit of the Nimzowitsch Defence.   2...e5  would allow White to transpose back into an Italian after  3.Bc4   2...d6  3.d4  would give Black a passive position. }
3. exd5 Qxd5 { We now have a sort of Scandinavian with the knight on c6. } 4.
Nc3 Qa5
{ The position is very similar to that seen in the first game of this chapter. }
5. Bb5
{ White can obviously play   5.d4  but the text move is perhaps even stronger. }
5... Bd7 6. O-O O-O-O 7. Re1
{ Just like in the Scandinavian main lines we saw earlier in the chapter, the black queen is uncomfortably placed on a5. It can be subjected to an attack by a2-a3 and b2-b4. }
7... a6
{ Black attacks the bishop but neglects his development.  It was essential to play   7...Nf6  even if the black queen remains in an uncomfortable situation after moves like a2-a3 and b2-b4, or d2-d3 and Bd2. }
8. b4
{ A semi-open file against the king is worth a pawn ! We have already met this maxim several times. }
8... Qxb4
{ If   8...Nxb4  9.Bxd7+  Rxd7  and  10.Ne5  attacks the rook and the f7-pawn. }
9. Rb1 Qg4
{ The queen strays too far from the king. He had to play   9...Qc5  even if after  10.Bxc6  Bxc6  11.Ne5  White has very good compensation for the sacrificed pawn. }
10. Bxa6 bxa6
{ The semi-open b-file has become a motorway towards the black king. } 11. Re4
{ An original manoeuvre to bring the rook over to the motorway. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qf5  did not enable the queen to return to help protect the queenside:  12.Qe2  Qa5  13.Ra4  ±. }
12. Qe2 Bg4 { 12...Nb8  13.Reb4  ± } 13. Qxa6+ Kd7 14. Rb5 Qg6 15. Rd5+
{ The two white rooks are a model of activity, while the entire black kingside is still back in the garage. The f6-knight, in particular, is still not out. }
15... Ke8 16. Rxg4 { Deflection ! } 16... Qxg4 17. Qxc6+ Qd7
{ Very symbolic: the black queen, which has been harassed throughout the game and alone has played half of Black's moves, is finally forced to sacrifice itself to prevent mate.   17...Rd7  18.Qa8+  and it is mate. }
18. Rxd7 Rxd7 19. Ne5 { Black resigned. } *

1. e4 b6
{ Owen's Defence, from the name of a 19th century English vicar who was one of the first exponents. While the king's fianchetto on the first move 1... g6 enjoys a good reputation, this is strangely not exactly the case for the queen's fianchetto. Nevertheless, this relatively uncommon opening has been regaining popularity in recent years through the efforts of the French grandmaster Christian Bauer, who has devoted a book to it   Play  1...b6!  . }
2. d4 { There is no reason not to take the centre. } 2... Bb7 3. Bd3
{ The move recommended by theory  (and by Christian Bauer !)  as being the best way to protect the e4-pawn. 3.

12. Bb2 d5
{ Transposing into a French type of structure that is frankly unfavourable for Black, but he would be hard pressed to find an active plan anyway.   12...e5  13.d5  also offered White a big space advantage. It was probably necessary to adopt a waiting policy, and not to touch the central pawns for now, but this left White a free hand to develop an initiative in the centre or on the kingside, in particular after the move f2-f4. }
13. e5 Nd7 14. Rc1 a6 15. f4
{ We see how useful the f-pawn is. White has excellent prospects on the kingside and Black does not have the slightest counterplay. }
15... b5

16. Rxc6
{ The future French grandmaster already had good tactical vision at the age of 15. }

Rc8 18. Bxh7+ Kh8 19. Rf3
{ The position of the f-pawn on f4 allows this right-angled rook manoeuvre. }
19... f5
{ Black could not trap the bishop:   19...g6  20.Bxg6  fxg6  21.Qxg6  and the threat of 22. Rh3 is decisive. }
20. Rh3 Bh4
{ In a desperate attempt to shut the h-file.Black had no way to take advantage of the opposition of the rook and queen on the c-file.  After   20...Bb7  21.Qd3  the white queen will participate in the feast on the h-file. }
21. Nf3 Kxh7 22. Rxh4+ Qxh4
{ After   22...Kg8  23.Ng5  White can continue by Qd3-h3, with a decisive attack on the h-file.  Advancing to g6 with   22...Kg6  is no better. After  23.Ng5  here again the queen will join the kingside via d3. }
