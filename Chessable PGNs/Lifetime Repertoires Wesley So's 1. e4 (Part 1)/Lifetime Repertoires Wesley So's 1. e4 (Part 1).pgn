1. e4
{ Hello everyone! First of all, thank you for checking out my 1. e4 Lifetime Repertoire for White. My goal here is to provide the student with a complete set of variations that will hopefully be good enough to last a lifetime!  Chessable  What made me decide to make this repertoire series? I had such a pleasant experience working on my first Chessable course for Fischer Random Chess that it was easy to persuade me to do another one! I also decided to make the 1. e4 Repertoire series because I wanted to explore it a bit more.  In this first course, we’ll discuss all Black variations except for the Sicilian, French and Caro-Kann defences. These will be dealt with in the second course. My 1. e4 repertoire is specifically based on securing a space advantage or quick piece development early on. For example, against the Caro-Kann, Alekhine and 1... Nc6 openings, we typically advance our pawns to d4 and e5, grabbing space.  I used Correspondence Database, Mega Database, and researched the latest games as a reference for this repertoire. For analyses, I mostly used the engine asmFish @@StartBracket@@which is a port of Stockfish@@EndBracket@@.  Take Control  As you can see from the size of the course, this is a tremendous amount of work but hopefully, the results will be as beneficial to you as they were to me. 1. e4 is the most popular first move for White and the reason is clear. With e4, we immediately take control of the very center of the board, and we fight for the initiative right at the beginning of the game.  I tried to make the repertoire as cohesive as possible, to make it easier to learn. I want to stress that understanding is more important than memorization. It will be good to know the typical plans and ideas, where to put the pieces, how to improve your position and so on.   Chess improvement is a continuous learning process, and there are no shortcuts. To get the most out of this repertoire series, the student should not rush, and instead, try to grasp the ideas behind the moves. Increase your understanding with 1. e4 openings. Study model games, study the classics! Play seriously, analyse your games and learn from your mistakes! Understand the essence and ideas behind your variations. Do not rely on memorization. Opening variations come and go, novelties and new computer engines are always updated, but your chess strength and understanding is permanent! It does not matter one bit if you can get an advantage out of the opening, but always fail to convert. Openings are just the first step towards getting good results and improving your rating.  About Me  I learned chess at the age of six. Back then I was relying on chess books for computer engines were not nearly as strong they are now. I became a Grand Master at the age of 14 which made me seventh youngest at the time.  I achieved my highest rating of 2822 during the first half of 2017. It was good enough for #2 in the world back then.  My greatest tournament victories were the Fischer Random World Championship and maybe my Olympiad performance in 2016… there have been several other events memorable for various reasons and not just because I won.   Early Influences  Let me confess that until I was about 15 years I exclusively played 1. e4. After all, it is 'Best by Test' according to Bobby Fischer! The first chess book I ever read was Chess Openings: Traps and Zaps by Bruce Pandolfini and it showed some aggressive openings starting with 1. e4 which very much impressed me. Some of my favourite early books were Attacking with 1. e4  (Emms)  , I probably read this book 10 times over from cover to cover!, Beating the Sicilian  (Nunn and Gallagher)  and The Chess Advantage in Black and White  (Kaufman)  2004  (!)  version. These books helped tremendously in shaping my style, back in the days when computers were not helpful for preparation.  I also read Opening for White according to Anand  (all 14 of them!)  which was written by GM Alexander Khalifman. That was the basis of my repertoire when I was a teenager. It was the best opening series out there at the time. It’s a bit outdated now, but still a great book. Some of these made it to my repertoire as well, in some lines. For example, my recommendation against the Philidor, the Alekhine or the French 3. Nd2 have been recommended in some past opening books. But in general, I prefer to choose the variations myself without getting swayed by other manuals.   Lead by Example  I play 1. e4 in a majority of my games. Especially this year 2020, where most of the games are being held online. There are less tabiyas than on other first move openings, and I can guess better which openings are going to happen on the board.   However, on a competitive level, it is important to switch between several openings, because computers are very strong nowadays! They can analyse all the way to a clear draw easily. And the surprise factor is a very important and underrated competitive tool. A well-prepared surprise can be psychologically unpleasant to face, as the opponent has to rely on his skills and not on memory which less and less players are prepared to do these days.  I can definitely use my recommendations in my own games too! I am pretty confident about the stability and validity of the lines I chose in this 1. e4 repertoire series. Confident enough to play it against anybody. I have played it already in smaller online events, and practice games and I can say that I am very pleased with the results out of the opening.  I hope I can lead by example, and make this repertoire work against the strongest players in the world, when I get the chance to compete against them.  It's Your Turn  I’m not necessarily saying that White gets an advantage in every single line, but in general, I can assure you that you'll most likely get positions that are easier to play, or ones in which hopefully you find yourself on some familiar ground. Over the years millions of games have been played, but even now there are still improvements to be found for both sides.   This is my first repertoire recommendation and I’ll be happy if it stands the test of time. Over my career, I have played many games with 1. e4 and I hope you will have as much fun playing it as I have!  Wesley So,  Minnetonka, Minnesota  August 2020 }

[Black "Owen's Defence (1... b6) #1"]
[Result "*"]

1. e4 b6
{ This is the Owen's Defence. Black prepares to fianchetto his Queen's Bishop on b7, from where it will exert pressure on e4 and on our center. He hopes to create sufficient counterplay to compensate for his lack of space. After all, he allows White to occupy the center firmly with his pawns. The Owen's has a dubious reputation and is currently mostly seen in games with faster time controls. Still White needs to be well prepared with some ideas against it, otherwise it's easy to get too comfortable and lose your way. }
2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3 { The tricky move } 3... f5
{ is as old as the Owen's Defence and has been refuted a long time ago: } 4.

2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3
{ Solidly supporting the e4-pawn and developing the Kingside. White is preparing to castle Kingside quickly and support his center with Nf3, O-O, Re1, c3 etc.   Black is known to be fine in the old main line after  3.Nc3  e6  4.Nf3  Bb4  5.Bd3  Nf6  6.Bg5   6.Qe2  d5  7.exd5  Qxd5  8.O-O  Bxc3  9.bxc3  Nbd7  in this game Magnus Carlsen beat Pavel Eljanov with Black in 2017.  6...h6  7.Bxf6  Qxf6  8.O-O  Bxc3  9.bxc3  d6  10.Nd2  e5  11.f4  In this position, White was having really good results until Black improved with  exf4 !  after which theory shows that White has nothing. }
3... e6 4. Nf3
{ Just for the record, the idea  4.Nc3  followed by Nge2 is also simple and good for White. }
4... c5 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qe2 d5
{ This is the main idea for Black. He aims for a closed French pawn structure hoping to repel White's early initiative. }
7. e5 Nfd7 8. O-O
{ White may also consider  8.Bg5 !?  with the idea to disrupt Black's development or else trade dark-squared Bishops favourably:  Be7  9.Bxe7  Qxe7  10.O-O  Nc6  11.Re1  O-O  12.Nbd2  White has a small but stable edge thanks to his solid space advantage. Later on, he can improve his position with a2-a3, protecting the b4-square. Eventually White will try to attack the Kingside. }
8... Be7 9. Na3
{ This is a nice move. White wants to bring his Knight to b5 to create pressure on the c7 and d6 squares, and if Black prevents that it can go instead to c2, firmly protecting the d4-pawn. }
9... a6 10. Ne1
{ This is a typical idea. White frees up the diagonal e2-h5 and prepares to play Qg4 next, which is the most natural square for the Queen. }
10... Nc6 11. Qg4
{ This attack on g7 is very difficult for Black to meet: he has a choice between weakening the dark-squares on his Kingside with ...g6 or using his King to defend g7. }

2. d4 { One possibility is } 2... e5 { but here I like } 3. dxe5
{ 3.d5  Nce7  is not as clear because Black has easy play and good squares for his Knight on f6 and g6. He also has good control over the dark-squares and the a3-f8 diagonal. I couldn't find a clear cut way on how to get a good position for White. }
3... Nxe5 4. Nf3

4... Nxf3+
{ can be met by the simple recapture of the Queen, but even stronger is } 5.

2. d4
{ This is my recommendation. The idea is not to refute Black's opening, but simply to control the center better and to develop our pieces to their natural squares.   Most opening books and opening materials recommend the move  2.Nf3  which is the other good reply to 1... Nc6. However, I'd rather not give Black the option of playing  2...e5 !  , transposing to normal 1. e4 e5 Openings. }
2... d5
{ This is the main reply for Black and it's his best move. He does not allow White to gain any more space in the center and fights for control of the light-squares. }
3. e5
{ White advances his pawn forward, gaining space for his pieces while limiting Black's mobility. This is my preferred choice as Black's position is cut into two, and the position is relatively simple to play with White.   It is known that it's not so simple to gain an advantage after  3.Nc3  dxe4  4.d5  Ne5  5.Bf4   Black is also fine after  5.Qd4  Ng6  6.Qxe4  Nf6  7.Qa4+  Bd7  8.Bb5  a6  when the arising endgame is approximately equal:  9.Bxd7+  Qxd7  10.Qxd7+  Nxd7  11.Nf3  O-O-O  12.Be3  Nge5 =  Black has ideas of ...g7-g6 or even ...Ne5-g4 attacking White's Bishop on e3. Black has no problems in this position.  5...Ng6  6.Bg3  a6  Black takes away the b5-square from White's pieces. Next he can play ...Nf6 or ...e7-e5, with a completely fine position. }
3... f6 { can be met by } 4. Bb5
{ pinning the Knight and threatening to weaken Black's Queenside pawns at an opportune moment. After }
4... fxe5 5. dxe5 e6

6. Nf3 Ne7 7. c3 { Taking the b4- and d4-squares away from Black's pieces. }
7... Ng6 8. Qe2
{ White's development is harmonious and easy to implement. The pawn on e5 is very annoying and it disrupts Black's ability to develop his pieces freely. }
8... Bc5 9. b4
{ Gaining a tempo by attacking the black Bishop and forcing it to decide whether it wants to remain on the g1-a7 diagonal, or drop back to e7.  White gets a strong initiative in all variations, as we will see in the main course starting from variation 2... d5 3. e5 f6 #8.   One example variation is  9...Be7  10.h4 !  O-O  11.Bd3  leaves Black's Kingside vulnerable as well.  11...a6  12.a3  Bd7  13.h5  Nf4  14.Bxf4  Rxf4  15.Nbd2  White has the possibility to attack the vital h7-pawn later with Bc2 and Qd3. Meanwhile, the pawn on e5 is well protected and the Bishop on d7 remains passive for the time being. }

3... Bf5
{ Play is similar to the advanced Caro-Kann with the Knight on c6 instead of having a pawn there. This has both advantages and disadvantages. With the Knight on c6 Black exerts more pressure on the e5 and d4-square hereby making his counterplay of ...f7-f6 much more effective. On the other hand, his typical break of ...c5 is almost non-existent here and in addition, the Knight can be pinned on the a4-e8 diagonal by Bb5. }
4. c3
{ Solidly defending the d4-pawn and taking away the square b4 from Black's Knight. }
4... e6
{ Black opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for his Bishop and prepares to develop the rest of his pieces. }
5. Nd2
{ The idea of this move is to bring this Knight quickly to action in the Kingside to f3  (preferably after f2-f4)  , which supports White's center and the e5 and g5-squares. While the g1-Knight has other purposes. It will be developed to e2, from where it supports the d4 and f4-squares. That way White can bring all his troops much faster to their ideal squares. }
5... f6 6. f4 Nh6
{ Activating the Knight and preparing to develop his Kingside with ...Be7 followed by O-O. }
7. Ngf3 Be7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O
{ I like this move as White keeps the option to take on f6 or keep the pawn chain on d4, e5 and f4. We have reached what is considered to be probably the main line of the Nimzowitsch Defence 1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e5. Black has a solid but a bit cramped position and both sides have to play accurately as it can be easy to drift and get outplayed in this position. }
9... fxe5 10. fxe5 Qe8 { Black is activating his Queen to the b1-h7 diagonal. }
11. Ne1
{ Controlling the light-squares in White's camp, and preparing to improve the position of his Knight by moving it to d3. }

It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921.

Re1 is even more ambitious than this, as often we have the idea Bc1-g5, forcing Black to decide how he is going to defend the e7-pawn. Later on, this Bishop on g5 can reroute itself to g3 via h4. }

{ Applying maximum pressure on e7, hoping to provoke Black into creating new weaknesses for himself. In the meantime, White will develop his pieces comfortably with Nbd2-e4 or Bg5-h4-g3, etc. }

{ White attacks the Knight, but also indirectly puts pressure on the crucial square f7. Later on, we can try to hit f7 with even more pieces by Ng5 and eventually Qf3. }
5... Nb6 6. Bb3 Bg7 7. Ng5
{ This is the critical line for Black and it leads to complex positions. } 7...
e6
{ Closing the a2-g8 diagonal and protecting the f7-pawn. In the meantime, Black keeps the pressure on e5. This is the main line. }
8. Qf3 Qe7 9. Ne4 dxe5 10. dxe5
{ This is my recommendation instead of the main line 10. Bg5. } 10... h6
{ Black has to play this, as otherwise Bg5 would lead to an early opening catastrophe for him. }
11. Nf6+
{ This is the idea that I'd like to show you. White gives this annoying check, preventing Black from being able to castle and the Knight on f6 controls a lot of squares deep in the enemy camp. }
11... Kf8 12. Qc3
{ Protecting the crucial e5- and f6-squares and preparing to play Be3, Nd2 etc. This variation starting with 10. dxe5 is very rare in practice and not yet well-known. However, in Correspondence games it has been played quite a lot with White scoring an enormous 72%. Though I don't use statistical values as often in chess, I believe that this is a good sign and that this line should be good for White. }

1. e4 Nf6
{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921. Currently, the opening is not very popular. White has proven ways to get a small but stable advantage against it. Nevertheless, some very strong players try it from time to time. }
2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3
{ This is my recommendation, the so-called Modern Variation. It is also the most common variation against the Alekhine Defence.

In this game we'll look at 4... g6 and other alternatives, while in the next games we'll look at the main lines 4... Bg4 and 4... dxe5. }
4... g6
{ This system used to be quite popular. Fischer played it in his Match of the Century against Boris Spassky in 1972. Black fianchettoes his dark-squared Bishop, continuing his development and hoping to counter-attack later in the center with his pieces. }

5... Nb6 6. Bb3 Bg7 7. Ng5
{ Black's main defence is 7... e6, but he could also play } 7... d5
{ closing the position. In return White gets the center and a lot of space there and the Kingside. This is Black's main alternative to 7... e6. There have been a lot of games played with this variation. }
8. f4
{ Seizing space and solidifying the pawn wedge on e5. White could also castle short first, and then play f4 next move. It is a matter of taste. }
8... O-O
{ Black continues his development. Delaying castling does not really bring Black any benefits. }
9. O-O f6 10. Nf3 Bg4
{ In practice White almost always plays 11. h3 here, forcing Black to trade off his light-squared Bishop. However, I like the move }
11. Qe1
{ unpinning the Knight and preparing to bring the Queen closer to the Kingside. Black has to solve some problems still.   For example  11...Nc6  12.c3  fxe5  13.dxe5  e6  14.Qg3  After  14...Bxf3  15.Rxf3  White has a good position. He has the Bishop pair and the simple idea to bring his pieces closer to the Kingside by Nd2-f1 or Bc2, etc.   11.c3  is also a very solid move. White simply supports the d4-pawn and next he wants to develop logically by Be3, Nbd2 etc, supporting the crucial square f3. }

{ This move is an idea of GM Larsen. Black fianchettoes his dark-squared Bishop to prepare castling and additionally puts pressure on the dark-squares in the center. This variation is quite solid and there are quite a few people who like employing this setup as Black. For example, the strong FIDE Master Loren Schmidt  (one of the most stubborn Alekhine proponents today)  comfortably defends this with the black pieces against strong opposition. }

This complex position is very playable for both sides. But as a whole Black has good results here and he also can choose between many different possible plans. }

One example game went  11...Nc7  12.c4  White could have developed normally with 12. Nbd2 or 12. Bg5, but this is even more aggressive.  12...b5  13.d5 !  Breaking through in the center and forcing the play.  13...Bf5  Now White has many possibilities, but I like  14.Nd4 !?  since this forces him to give up his valuable dark-squared Bishop.

The critical line goes  Nd7  7.Nf3  N7f6  8.O-O  Bg4  9.Be2 !?  e6  10.h3  Bh5  11.c4  and I'm confident that White must be better here also. He has a space advantage, with solid pawns on c4 and d4. The plan next is to play Nc3, Be3, and then perhaps grab even more space by playing g2-g4 followed by Ne5. As usual against the Alekhine's Defence, White has more than one way to get a satisfactory position out of the opening. }
6... Bf5 7. O-O Nd7
{ This is the best move-order to try to get rid of the powerful Knight on e5 as fast as possible. }
8. Nf3 e6
{ This is his most common choice. Black tries to activate the rest of his pieces as quickly as possible. }
9. c4 N5f6 10. Nh4
{ A typical move with the Bishop on f5. White attacks the f5- and g6-squares. Black has to give up his Bishop pair as his light-squared Bishop has nowhere to go. }
10... Bg6
{ Hoping that White will take on g6 right away, therefore opening up the h-file and gaining some counterplay on h2. }
11. Nc3 Bd6
{ Now White has many possibilities. He can simply play quietly with  12.g3  or  12.a3  but I'm suggesting the new move }
12. f4
{ Gaining space and threatening to advance further with g2-g4. In addition, he limits the squares controlled by Black's Bishop on d6. }

{ This is the most active move for Black in this position and one of the main ideas behind playing an early ...c7-c6. Black pins the Knight on c3 and threatens to win e4. The normal way to protect the pawn  (5. Bd3)  leaves the d4-pawn slightly more vulnerable and Black then aims to create counterplay in the center with the move ...e7-e5. Additionally, the Queen controls some dark-squares on the Queenside. To be honest, moving the Queen to a5 as early as move 4 looks really dubious to me, and I was very surprised the first time I saw this move. However, we need to pay serious respect to 4...

Qd8 with Black is to catch your opponent by surprise or unprepared. There is not much theory to remember with Black, and he can get a playable and solid position with pawns on e6 and c6. The ideas of the position are easy to remember. On the other hand, with natural moves White can get a small risk-free advantage at the very least. He gets the Bishop pair almost by force and also some space advantage. If White is well prepared then he can even expect for more than a small edge. }

4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 a6
{ This move leads to interesting positions. Black takes away the b5-square from White's Knight and hopes to play on the Queenside with ...b7-b5 followed by Bb7 in some appropriate lines. }
6. g3
{ This is the standard plan for White, especially against 5... a6. White prepares to fianchetto his Bishop on the long diagonal before Black can put his Bishop on b7. From g2, White's Bishop will put strong pressure on Black's Queenside especially if Black decides to castle long. An additional bonus is that White now controls the f4-square, and can put his Bishop there in an appropriate moment to gain time attacking Black's Queen. }

{ Pinning the Knight, while developing his minor pieces. Black is actually planning to castle long and to put pressure on White's d4 pawn. }

4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 g6
{ A modern variation. This move has not been very popular until it was introduced into top level play by GM Vladimir Kramnik in 2009. Since then other Top GMs like Caruana and Nakamura have followed suit. Black plays very flexibly. He wants to play Bg7 and castle short, bringing his King to a safe place before making any decision on how to develop the rest of his pieces. This move can be a very effective surprise weapon specially if White does not have anything special prepared against it. So we'll try to ensure that you have some ideas how to meet this move just in case you meet it over the board. }
6. Nb5
{ This interesting move hits Black's Queen and aims to disrupt his plans. This move also scores best for White in practice. }
6... Qb6 7. a4
{ 7. c4 is also a good choice here but I'll stick to 7. a4. White threatens to harass the Queen with a4-a5, while reserving the a3-square comfortably for White's Knight to retreat.  Black usually opts for 7...a6, but you might occasionally encounter 7...c6 too: }
7... c6 8. a5 Qd8
{ At least in this case the Queen is in its normal position on d8. } 9. Nc3
{ What has White gained from moving his Knight to b5 and back, you may ask? Well, White has gained tempi and advanced his Rook pawn all the way to a5. From a5 it gained a lot of space for White and has taken away the important squares a5 and b6 away from his opponent. You'll see that this far advanced a-pawn will prove to be very annoying for Black later on. }

Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qa5
{ This is the classical main line. It used to be the most popular option without question. In recent years, 3... Qd6 has replaced it at the top level, thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. Black makes use of his early Queen outing and hopes that it can prove useful on a5 by controlling important squares. It is not that easy to attack the Queen on a5, and it can always retreat to c7 or d8 after an eventual ...c6. }
4. d4
{ The normal continuation. White controls the central dark-squares and opens up the diagonal for his dark-squared Bishop. }

3. d4 Nxe4 4. Bd3
{ This move is my recommendation. We immediately challenge the opponent's centralized knight on e4 and we force him to make a decision. We provoke ...d7-d5 first, before capturing on e5, therefore securing that square for our knight. }
4... d5 5. Nxe5
{ Gladly putting our knight in a strong position in the centre of the board. Black has three main options. He can play  5...Be7  ,  5...Bd6  , or challenge our knight right away with  5...Nd7  , which is the main line. }
5... Nd7
{ This is Black's main response in this variation of the Petroff. Black immediately challenges our knight in the centre and develops another piece. }
6. Nxd7
{ This has always been the mainline, as White generally prefers to keep the current pawn structure. }
6... Bxd7 7. O-O Bd6
{ This is the most natural and common move. Black develops his bishop to its most active square, from where it keeps an eye on our  h2  pawn. White's main move in this position is  8.c4  , with a lot of theory, or  8.Qh5  , which is a very concrete variation. Instead of that, however, I am recommending the move  8.Nc3 }
8. Nc3
{ This reaction attracted my attention since it has been played in 2019 by the highest-ranked Russian, Ian Nepomniachtchi. Objectively @@StartBracket@@like in all Petroff lines@@EndBracket@@, it is probably not enough for an advantage.

6. Bf1
{ This paradoxical retreat is White's best reply! He does not want to take on b5 yet, because ...Qxd5 gains a tempo attacking our bishop and the pawn on g2.

Black has to deal with the threat on c6 and a decision must be made.   6.Bxb5  Qxd5  7.Bxc6+  Qxc6  8.O-O  h6  followed by ...Bb7 is an illustrative line.

{ Unfortunately, White has to spend time in order to protect the f3-knight, but we are ready to castle short next move. In this position, Black has many different possibilities. In general, our idea is to prove that we have a better pawn structure, thanks to our kingside majority, and we try to seize control of the e5-square. Meanwhile, we keep an eye on the e-file and, if possible, advance our kingside pawns later, to gain some space.  White has a pawn majority on the kingside in return for having a 3 vs 4 pawns structure on the queenside. This variation has become very popular in recent years. Black would be completely fine here except for three small factors.  First, the bishop on b6 and the knight on c6 are not ideally placed. It will take a while to reroute the dark-squared bishop to an active spot. If it were on d6 already, then Black would be even better. Secondly, Black has to pay constant attention to the crucial e5-square. And finally, our king feels much safer than Black’s. It is not apparent now, but later the black king could get vulnerable if the position opens up. }

{ This line has become very popular lately. It is also clearly the first recommendation of the engine.

Both sides need to play carefully as White lacks development and Black just sacrificed two pawns. }
12. Nxe5

12... Qf6 13. Nf3 g5
{ Black attacks immediately on the kingside. The threats of ...g4 and ...Nf4 shouldn't be underestimated. This position has been played in a few high-level games recently, and the status of the position is very unclear. }
14. c4
{ White kicks the enemy knight to a more suspicious square and we gain tempi by pushing our queenside pawns. I prefer this move over the line  14.g3  f4  , which has not given yet any advantage in practice. }
14... Nf4 15. Bf1 g4 16. d4

18... Nxd4 19. c5
{ Taking on  a5  right away  19.Qxa5  would allow our rooks to be forked with  19...Nc2  . After the text move, we first gain a tempo attacking his bishop. But of course, the position is very concrete and we can't explain the moves yet in general terms. Calculation is required heavily here. }

{ Unfortunately, White has to spend time in order to protect the f3-knight, but we are ready to castle short next move. In this position, Black has many different possibilities. In general, our idea is to prove that we have a better pawn structure, thanks to our kingside majority, and we try to seize control of the e5-square. Meanwhile, we keep an eye on the e-file and, if possible, advance our kingside pawns later, to gain some space.  White has a pawn majority on the kingside in return for having a 3 vs 4 pawns structure on the queenside. This variation has become very popular in recent years. Black would be completely fine here except for three small factors.  First, the bishop on b6 and the knight on c6 are not ideally placed. It will take a while to reroute the dark-squared bishop to an active spot. If it were on d6 already, then Black would be even better. Secondly, Black has to pay constant attention to the crucial e5-square. And finally, our king feels much safer than Black’s. It is not apparent now, but later the black king could get vulnerable if the position opens up. }

{ Unfortunately, White has to spend time in order to protect the f3-knight, but we are ready to castle short next move. In this position, Black has many different possibilities. In general, our idea is to prove that we have a better pawn structure, thanks to our kingside majority, and we try to seize control of the e5-square. Meanwhile, we keep an eye on the e-file and, if possible, advance our kingside pawns later, to gain some space.  White has a pawn majority on the kingside in return for having a 3 vs 4 pawns structure on the queenside. This variation has become very popular in recent years. Black would be completely fine here except for three small factors.  First, the bishop on b6 and the knight on c6 are not ideally placed. It will take a while to reroute the dark-squared bishop to an active spot. If it were on d6 already, then Black would be even better. Secondly, Black has to pay constant attention to the crucial e5-square. And finally, our king feels much safer than Black’s.

White has a pawn majority on the kingside in return for having a 3 vs 4 pawns structure on the queenside. This variation has become very popular in recent years. Black would be completely fine here except for three small factors.  First, the bishop on b6 and the knight on c6 are not ideally placed. It will take a while to reroute the dark-squared bishop to an active spot. If it were on d6 already, then Black would be even better. Secondly, Black has to pay constant attention to the crucial e5-square. And finally, our king feels much safer than Black’s.

3. d4 Nxe4 4. Bd3
{ This move is my recommendation. We immediately challenge the opponent's centralized knight on e4 and we force him to make a decision. We provoke ...d7-d5 first, before capturing on e5, therefore securing that square for our knight. }
4... d5 5. Nxe5
{ Gladly putting our knight in a strong position in the centre of the board. Black has three main options. He can play  5...Be7  ,  5...Bd6  , or challenge our knight right away with  5...Nd7  , which is the main line. }
5... Nd7

{ This is the most active move for Black in this position and one of the main ideas behind playing an early ...c7-c6. Black pins the Knight on c3 and threatens to win e4. The normal way to protect the pawn  (5. Bd3)  leaves the d4-pawn slightly more vulnerable and Black then aims to create counterplay in the center with the move ...e7-e5. Additionally, the Queen controls some dark-squares on the Queenside. To be honest, moving the Queen to a5 as early as move 4 looks really dubious to me, and I was very surprised the first time I saw this move. However, we need to pay serious respect to 4... Qa5, as it has been played thousands of times in practice. }
5. e5

He has to play very precisely, then maybe  (just maybe)  he can equalize. White's position seems to me to be easier to play and on top of that there is not much theory unlike in 5. Bd3. }

8. Bd3
{ Challenging Black's active light-squared Bishop is the best and simplest.   Black has quite a solid position after  8.Bxc3  Qd5  9.O-O-O  and now if he wants he can head into an endgame:  Qxf3  10.Nxf3  e6  with solid control over the light-squares and decent places for his pieces. }

{ White may also play the logical  11. Kf2.

White is preparing to play c2-c4, and to support his pawns on the center with Rfe1 and Rad1. The endgame is easier for White to play as his pawns are better supported, and we have more space.  I guess 11. h3 and 11. Kf2 are of equal value; it’s not clear which is stronger. 11. h3’s only advantage is in the hopes that Black won’t find the best reply 11...h5! Because if he allowed us to play g2-g4, the endgame becomes much better for us. }
11... h5
{ Black must not allow his opponent to expand on the Kingside with g2-g4. } 12.
Kf2
{ White gets ready for an ending, and therefore avoids castling. Here f2 is the best place for the King, as he can easily join actions on either flank and he protects the Kingside pawns. He is also threatening to move his Rook actively on the e-file with Re1. }

{ This is the so-called '150' attack, and is my recommendation against the Pirc Defence. White's play is natural and easy to understand. He plays Qd2  (with the idea to play Bh6)  and then, depending on Black's setup, he can go for normal development with Nf3, Bd3 or opt for the more aggressive setup with f3 and Queenside castling. Usually White does not need to fear the move ...Ng4. After Bg5 it turns out that only Black can have problems there. }
4... Bg7
{ Black can also develop his Queenside first before playing ...Bg7, but it's not clear that approach is advantageous for him. }
5. Qd2 c6
{ This is the main defence for Black. He controls the d5- and b5-squares, preparing to create play on the Queenside by pushing his pawns there, or to put a solid stake in the center with ...Nbd7 followed by ...e7-e5. He also delays castling and waits for an opportune moment to do so. }

10... Qe7 11. O-O Bb7 12. Ne2
{ The Knight is well-placed on g3. It protects the e4-pawn and White frees his c-pawn so that he can play c2-c3 or more aggressively, c2-c4. }

{ This is the main defence for Black. He controls the d5- and b5-squares, preparing to create play on the Queenside by pushing his pawns there, or to put a solid stake in the center with ...Nbd7 followed by ...e7-e5. He also delays castling and waits for an opportune moment to do so. }
6. Nf3
{ White develops his Kingside pieces and prepares to support his center with the move Bd3. This is my recommendation. }
6... b5 7. Bd3
{ White protects his e4-pawn, while also developing the rest of his Kingside pieces. }
7... O-O 8. Bh6 Nbd7 9. Bxg7
{ White has nothing in the variation  9.e5  dxe5  10.dxe5  Ng4  11.Bxg7  Kxg7  this position is fine for Black, as shown in a few games. The point being that  12.Qf4  runs into the nice move  Ndxe5 !  13.Nxe5  Qd6  when thanks to the pin, Black gains back his piece with an excellent position. }
9... Kxg7 10. a4
{ White provokes a weakening of Black's Queenside, before rerouting his Knight with Ne2-g3. }
10... b4 11. Ne2 a5 12. Ng3 e5
{ This is Black's main move. He prevents the idea e4-e5, and he puts a solid pawn stake in the center. }
13. Qg5
{ White threatens to win the pawn on e5, while at the same time Nf5+ is annoying. }
13... exd4 14. Nf5+ Kg8 15. Nxd6 c5 16. O-O Ba6
{ This position arrives almost by force after 13. Qg5. There had been a few games played in this position. The verdict is White retains a stable advantage, thanks to his control of the b5 and c4-squares and his central control. }
17. Nd2
{ This is what White played in the latest correspondence game. He controls the c4-square even further, and he prepares the move f2-f4, gaining space on the Kingside.   17.Nb5!?  is a good alternative, and it looks very attractive. }
17... Nh5 18. f4 Qxg5 19. fxg5
{ White maintains a stable edge in the endgame thanks to his complete control of the Queenside light-squares. For example: }
19... Bxd3 20. cxd3 f6 21. N2c4 fxg5 22. g3
{ Preventing any ...Nh5-f4 counterplay. } 22... Ra6 23. Rxf8+ Kxf8 24. Nb7
{ we are following the game Anokhin,Y -Rudenko,V ICCF email 2017. In the game Black managed to hold the draw, thanks to very stubborn resistance. However, I believe White has a very pleasant endgame. His Knights are on excellent squares, and he has a protected outside passed pawn after taking on a5. }

Currently, the opening is not very popular. White has proven ways to get a small but stable advantage against it. Nevertheless, some very strong players try it from time to time. }

{ This is my recommendation, the so-called Modern Variation. It is also the most common variation against the Alekhine Defence. White hopes that his spatial advantage will be sufficient to give him the more pleasant game. In this chapter we'll look at 4... g6 and other alternatives, while in the next three chapters we'll look at the main lines 4... Bg4 and 4... dxe5. }
4... Nb6
{ This prophylactic move used to be quite popular but now is very rarely seen @@StartBracket@@the Alekhine is a rare opening anyway!@@EndBracket@@. However, we need to take a look at it briefly just in case, and also according to my database GM Hikaru Nakamura has employed it seven times in his career @@StartBracket@@true, most of these were blitz games@@EndBracket@@ so we should give this move the respect it deserves. Black moves his Knight to a safer square, anticipating that White would have attacked it anyway from d5 later with c4 or Bf1-c4. }
5. a4
{ Not giving Black any respite. White threatens to play a4-a5, and if Black prevents this by playing ...a7-a5 himself then later White can use the b5-square for his pieces. }
5... a5
{ This is his only reasonable reply. There is no way he can allow White to gain lots of time by letting him kick away the Knight from b6. }
6. Nc3
{ Developing the Knight while at the same time controlling the squares b5 and d5. }
6... g6 { This is what people mostly play in practice. } 7. exd6
{ And this is the natural reply, asking Black how he wants to recapture on d6.   Worthy of attention is the move  7.h4 !?  in general, when Black plays ...g6 he always needs to watch out for h4-h5. This is interesting too. In the only game where this was played it led to a quick success:  Bg4  8.h5  Bxh5 ?  9.Rxh5  gxh5  10.Ng5  e6  11.Qxh5  Qd7  12.Nce4  Bg7  13.Nxh7  +-  with a winning attack in Poupinel,M -Jaumin,J 2017. It is clear that Black could have defended better, perhaps he should meet h4 on move 7 by playing ...h7-h5 himself. }
7... exd6
{ This move is solid, though it opens the e-file and White can try to exert strong pressure along the open file.  Now White plays a very deep move in my view: }
8. Bb5+
{ White could have played Bd3 right away, but instead he first provokes Black to play ...c7-c6 before dropping back to d3. Later on, Black's Knight on b8 will find it difficult to develop  (as the option...Nb8-c6 is no longer available)  . This is an important manoeuvre to remember. }
8... c6 9. Bd3 Bg7 10. Bg5
{ Provoking ...f6, closing the long diagonal and weakening Black's Kingside squares slightly. }
10... f6 11. Bf4 { Now attacking d6. } 11... O-O 12. Ne4
{ Now the White Knight infiltrates d6.   This is stronger than the automatic move  12.O-O  . }
12... d5 13. Nd6 Qe7+ 14. Qe2
{ White does not mind exchanging Queens, as even then his Bishop pair is quite strong. }
14... Qxe2+ 15. Kxe2 Rd8 16. h4
{ Even in the endgame White can still put pressure on Black's Kingside pawns. }
16... Bf8 17. Nxc8 Nxc8 18. c3
{ White is better, he has the Bishop pair and the possibility to launch an attack by pushing his Kingside pawns. }

1. e4 Nf6
{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921. Currently, the opening is not very popular. White has proven ways to get a small but stable advantage against it. Nevertheless, some very strong players try it from time to time. }

5. Bc4

White can also play more simply by 7. exd6,   or by  7.Qe2  O-O  8.h3  preventing ...Bg4 and here White can expect a small advantage too based on his space advantage and the pawn wedge on e5. Black is solid but slightly worse. }

15. Nc3
{ Bringing the Knight into the game. The Knight is threatening to jump to e4, from which it can go to f6 or d6, and help deliver checkmate. There is no sufficient defence. The best line for him now is to play: }

14. Nxd7+ Qxd7 15. f4

{ 18.Nf3  has also been played, in general with good results, however, the text move is even stronger and more forceful. }
18... Qc6

19. Nc5
{ I like this move, although you have to remember it as it is far from easy to spot it if you've only seen this position for the first time ! Black has no choice but to accept the piece, as otherwise Nxb7 followed by Rd7 is just crushing. }

5... Nb6 6. Bb3 Bg7 7. Ng5

White can also play more simply by 7. exd6,   or by  7.Qe2  O-O  8.h3  preventing ...Bg4 and here White can expect a small advantage too based on his space advantage and the pawn wedge on e5. Black is solid but slightly worse. }
7... e6
{ Closing the a2-g8 diagonal and protecting the f7-pawn. In the meantime, Black keeps the pressure on e5. This is the main line. }
8. Qf3
{ The other main possibility is  8.f4  which looks very attractive, however, I think Black found a clear-cut way to equalize in the crucial variation after  dxe5  9.fxe5  c5  10.O-O  O-O  11.c3  cxd4  12.cxd4  Nc6  13.Nf3  f6 !  14.exf6  Qxf6  15.Be3  Nd5  16.Bf2  Nf4 =  there have been many games played in this line 8. f4, with the current theory evaluating it as OK for Black. }

10... h6

Though I don't use statistical values as often in chess, I believe that this is a good sign and that this line should be good for White. }
12... N6d7

Nxd7+ Qxd7 15. Qxd7 Bxd7 16. f4
{ We've reached an endgame where White is a pawn up. However, for the next few moves he has to play accurately in order to consolidate, as his opponent will be desperately looking for compensation for his sacrificed pawn. }

{ Now 18. c3 is met by Nf3+ with quick counterplay. So, we play first } 18. Nd2
{ covering the f3-square and preparing c2-c3. } 18... Bc6 19. Rf1 h5 20. c3
Nxb3 21. Nxb3
{ The active Knight on d4 has been eliminated, however now Black has compensation based on the Bishop pair. }
21... h4 22. g4
{ Of course we don't let Black open up the h-file. If he can get his h8 Rook into play, say on h3 or on h2, then it is much more difficult for White to try and consolidate his extra pawn. }
22... Bg2
{ Annoying the white Rook and first provoking it to go to a worse position before heading to d5. }
23. Rg1
{ Unfortunately, we cannot play  23.Rf2  due to  Bh3  when the pawn on g4 cannot be defended. }
23... Bd5
{ There had been a couple of games played in this variation by Loren Schmidt. In both games he had Black and in the first game he managed to draw after White chose 24. Nd4. In the second game however White found an improvement: }
24. Kf2 { bringing the Rooks quickly into the game. } 24... Kg8 25. Re1
{ Defending e5 so he can take on g5 next with his f-pawn. Black is clearly suffering in this ending. }
25... gxf4 26. Bxf4 Rf8 27. Rad1 b6
{ And now White found an amazing positional exchange sacrifice, worthy of remembrance: }
28. Rxd5 exd5 29. Nd4
{ After this White is simply dominating. He intends to go next Nf5, or Kf3 and g4-g5, gaining even more space. Almost all of Black's pawns are isolated and in particular d5 and h4 are most likely going to drop soon. He has no counterplay whatsoever. }
29... Rc8 30. Nf5 Re8 31. Kf3 Re6 32. Nd4
{ White soon won in Van Leeuwen,E -Schmidt,L 2016. g4-g5 followed by Kg4 is an unstoppable threat. }

By my count, he has played the Alekhine over a hundred games in his career, defending this opening very confidently against anybody, and achieving very decent results.

Nevertheless, this variation does not look attractive at all for Black. For example, after  23.h4  It seems to me that he simply has a bad ending. }

15. Bxf3 Bf6 16. Qd3
{ This is the best square for the Queen. It controls the b5 and f5-squares while protecting d4. I think White is better here, as he has more space and control over the position. Nevertheless the opponent is solid, and we need to watch out for their possible counterplay with ...b7-b6 or ...e6-e5. }

Open the a-file and trade all the Rooks off the board. Without the Rook, it is easier for him to defend as his pieces get more space to operate. Additionally White always needs to keep an eye on d4.  26.Rxa8  Qxa8  27.Bf3  Bg7  28.Ne2  Qa4  Black has managed to create sufficient counterplay.  29.Kg2  h6  30.Be3  f5  31.Nc1  Kf7  32.Qb3  Qa1  33.Qb4  the position has become very complex and both sides need to play accurately.

1. e4 Nf6
{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921. Currently, the opening is not very popular. White has proven ways to get a small but stable advantage against it. Nevertheless, some very strong players try it from time to time. }

4... Bg4
{ This is the classical main line for Black. He develops his Bishop while at the same time pinning our Knight on f3. He also prepares to play ...e7-e6 and ...Be7, finishing the development of the rest of his pieces. }
5. Be2
{ Logically, we relieve our Knight from the annoying pin.   In the beginning White used to play  5.h3  right away, but then Black found the antidote  Bxf3  6.Qxf3  dxe5  7.dxe5  e6  followed by ...Nc6, which gave him very decent results overall. }
5... e6

In return he remains very solid.  10.c5  Bxf3  11.gxf3  Nc8  12.f4  we have similar play as in the main line, but without the move h2-h3. Later when he starts his Kingside attack, he might be able to use this square later for his Queen or his Rook as a launching square. White scores a whopping 68% from this position. }
8... Bh5 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Be3 d5 11. c5 Bxf3
{ Black gives up the Bishop pair, giving White a difficult choice. Should he allow the enemy Knight to jump to c4, or allow the ruining of his Kingside pawns ? In addition, his Bishop on h5 was not doing much anyway in the closed position, and it could be attacked with gain of tempo by g2-g4 etc. }
12. gxf3
{ White decides to prevent the black Knight from being able to jump on c4.   The alternative is  12.Bxf3  maintaining the flexibility of the White pawns.

The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921.

{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921.

1. e4 Nf6
{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921. Currently, the opening is not very popular. White has proven ways to get a small but stable advantage against it. Nevertheless, some very strong players try it from time to time. }

4... dxe5

5. Nxe5 c6
{ This is the main line of the variation 4... dxe5. Black supports his Knight on d5, while preparing ... Nd7  (now that he no longer fears Nxf7)  . This variation is known to give Black a solid but passive position in the middlegame and in general White has good results here. }
6. Be2
{ White has other moves here such as 6. Bc4, but this move has been well-tested and gives him good results. In my database, it gives White a whopping 64% score against decent opposition. 6. Be2 is a tried and tested line and I see no reason why White should avoid it.   The other move that I was considering to recommend is  6.Bc4  which also makes some sense as White develops a piece while putting pressure on the center. The critical line goes  Nd7  7.Nf3  N7f6  8.O-O  Bg4  9.Be2 !?  e6  10.h3  Bh5  11.c4  and I'm confident that White must be better here also. He has a space advantage, with solid pawns on c4 and d4. The plan next is to play Nc3, Be3, and then perhaps grab even more space by playing g2-g4 followed by Ne5. As usual against the Alekhine's Defence, White has more than one way to get a satisfactory position out of the opening. }

{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921.

{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921.

It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure.

1. e4 Nf6
{ The Alekhine's Defence. It is a provocative opening where Black allows his Knight to be attacked at such an early stage of the game while allowing White to form an imposing pawn mass in the center, but in return Black hopes that he can later undermine and attack this pawn structure. The position becomes very unbalanced, so it's an opening that suits aggressive, fighting players. This opening was first introduced by World Champion Alexander Alekhine @@StartBracket@@additionally one of the Best Chess Players ever, I consider him to be in my Top 5 of all time@@EndBracket@@ in 1921. Currently, the opening is not very popular. White has proven ways to get a small but stable advantage against it. Nevertheless, some very strong players try it from time to time. }
2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3
{ This is my recommendation, the so-called Modern Variation. It is also the most common variation against the Alekhine Defence. White hopes that his spatial advantage will be sufficient to give him the more pleasant game. }
4... dxe5
{ This was Alexander Alekhine's choice when he first played this opening. Black takes on e5 with the idea to simplify the game. Later on, he wants to continue with Nb8-d7, challenging White's Knight on e5. }
5. Nxe5 c6
{ This is the main line of the variation 4... dxe5. Black supports his Knight on d5, while preparing ... Nd7  (now that he no longer fears Nxf7)  . This variation is known to give Black a solid but passive position in the middlegame and in general White has good results here. }
6. Be2
{ White has other moves here such as 6. Bc4, but this move has been well-tested and gives him good results. In my database, it gives White a whopping 64% score against decent opposition. 6. Be2 is a tried and tested line and I see no reason why White should avoid it.   The other move that I was considering to recommend is  6.Bc4  which also makes some sense as White develops a piece while putting pressure on the center. The critical line goes  Nd7  7.Nf3  N7f6  8.O-O  Bg4  9.Be2 !?  e6  10.h3  Bh5  11.c4  and I'm confident that White must be better here also. He has a space advantage, with solid pawns on c4 and d4. The plan next is to play Nc3, Be3, and then perhaps grab even more space by playing g2-g4 followed by Ne5. As usual against the Alekhine's Defence, White has more than one way to get a satisfactory position out of the opening. }

{ called the Portuguese variation. A sacrificial variation where Black gets piece activity in return for his sacrificed pawn@@StartBracket@@s@@EndBracket@@. I see no reason why you should allow this with White, when the variation is rarely played. Nevertheless, I'm convinced that White should be better here.   3...Nxd5  4.Nf3  transposes to 3. Nf3.   3...Qxd5  4.Nf3  transposes to 3. Nf3 also. }
4. f3
{ White accepts the pawn sacrifice. Besides this move White has other good possibilities.   I like the variation  4.Nf3  Qxd5  5.Be2  Nc6  6.O-O  O-O-O  7.Be3  White has a solid control over many squares in return for Black's temporary activity of his pieces. Here Black should play 7... Qf5!?:  7...Qf5  8.c4  e5  9.d5  e4  10.Nd4  Nxd4  11.Bxd4  and we've reached the main line of an interesting variation. There had been some correspondence games played here, ending up mostly in White's favour. I believe this should be good for White too, but the arising positions are complex and since this is not my main recommendation, I'll leave it to the viewers to analyse it further if they wish.   4.Bb5+ !?  is an interesting move too.  4...Nbd7  5.Nf3  The idea is now Black cannot take on d5 actively with his Queen meanwhile White finishes his development on the Kingside.  5...Nxd5  6.O-O  e6  7.h3  Bh5  8.Re1  White should be slightly better here.   4.Be2  is playable, but Black has a very solid position after  4...Bxe2  5.Qxe2  Qxd5  6.Nf3  e6  and he is close to equality. }
4... Bf5
{ Here White plays mostly  5.g4  or  5.Bb5+  . In both cases, he should be doing well. For example: }
5. g4
{ White kicks the enemy minor pieces to a more passive position and gains Kingside space. The white King can possibly find shelter on f2 later on and feel safe. }
5... Bg6
{ 5...Bd7  6.c4  ±  looks really good for White. Black is simply robbed of too much space, not to mention he is still a pawn down. }
6. c4 e6 7. Nc3 exd5
{ 7...c5 !?  Needs to be checked also, when White should just finish his development with either 8. Be3 or 8. Nge2. }
8. g5 { Removing the defender of the d5-pawn. } 8... Nfd7 9. Nxd5 Nc6 10. h4
{ We've reached the main line of the variation. Practice has shown that White is much better in this position. Of course, you'd need to check this variation a bit deeper if you want to play it with either color. Especially on the move numbers 4-7 Black has some weird looking possibilities. }

{ The Scandinavian Defence @@StartBracket@@or Center Counter Defence@@EndBracket@@ is one of the oldest openings in chess. Although it has never enjoyed top-level popularity, it has been played notably by some World Champion level players, including Tarrasch, Spielman, Tartakower and Alekhine.

2. exd5
{ The main move and my recommendation. It is obviously the only move that can trouble Black. }
2... Nf6
{ This is the second most popular way for Black to continue in the Scandinavian. It makes perfect sense. Black wants to avoid losing time in recapturing the d5-pawn by taking it with the Knight instead of the Queen. White now has a large choice. }
3. Nf3
{ This is my recommendation. It's the simplest and most flexible way to meet 2... Nf6. I imagine that you probably will not encounter a lot of Scandinavian 2... Nf6 in tournament play. And 3. Nf3 is the most sensible way to fight for an advantage against it. }
3... Nxd5
{ Recapturing on d5 with the Knight seems like the logical follow up to 2... Nf6. Now Black just wants to finish his development and aim for a solid position. }
4. d4

4... g6 5. c4 Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. h3
{ The simplest and strongest continuation here.   For a while I tried to make  7.c5  work well, however I can't deny the fact that I think 7. h3 is simply stronger than this move.

In the end I decided to opt for 7. h3 instead, as it seems that there White's position is far more pleasant.  13...e6  14.Bf4   or  13...Nd7  14.Bg5  Re8  15.Rad1 }
7... O-O 8. Be2
{ I think this could be the most precise move-order for White, as we will see later.   White can also start with  8.Be3  then Black replies  8...c5   8...Nc6  9.Be2  transposes to 8. Be2.  9.d5  Na6  10.Qd2  e6  here the position is not as clear as I'd like. Black has counterplay on the d-pawn and his pieces are able to develop quickly. In correspondence games Black gets decent results from this position. }
8... c5 9. d5 e6 10. Bg5
{ This is the difference between 8. Be3 and my recommendation 8. Be2: White has this resource, annoying the coordination of Black's pieces. }
10... Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 f6 12. Be3 Na6 13. O-O exd5 14. cxd5 Nxd5 15. Bh6
{ This gives White more than enough compensation for the pawn. In fact, he is probably just winning, because Black’s Rook on f8 has nowhere safe to go: }
15... Re8 { is met by } 16. Bb5 { attacking the Rook and after } 16... Re4 17.
Qb3 Nc7 18. Rad1
{ Black is hopelessly pinned along the d-file and will likely lose material in the next couple of moves. }

9. d5
{ If you don't want to commit to pushing the d-pawn  9.Qb3 !?  is a good option. Then Black should take on d4:  Bxd4  10.Nxd4  Qxd4  11.Nb5  White has good play for the pawn, and interested readers could investigate the position more deeply. For example:  Qe5  12.f4  Qf6   12...Qc5  13.Be3  Qc6  14.Bf3  Qd7  White gained a lot of time kicking around Black's Queen.  15.Na3  c6  16.Qc3  f6  17.b3  +=  White has good compensation for his pawn in the form of the Bishop pair and control over important squares.  13.Nxc7  Nc6 !  14.Nxa8  Nd4  15.Qc3  Na4  16.Qd2  and I believe that White should be better here, however this whole variation with 9. Qb3 is complex for both sides. Therefore, I am recommending 9. d5, as it seems easier to control the game there. }
9... Bf5 10. a4
{ Including the moves a4 and a5 is in White's favour. I believe this is the easiest way for White to seize the initiative.   Also possible is  10.Be3  e6  11.Nd4 !   11.g4  Bxc3+  12.bxc3  Be4  ∞  when things are getting out of control.  11...exd5  12.Nxf5  gxf5  13.Nxd5  when White has a small advantage, but Black could try to hold the endgame after  c6  14.Nxb6  Qxd1+  15.Kxd1  axb6  16.Kc2  c5  17.Bd3  Nc6  +=   If  10.O-O  Black can start to chip away White's center with  c6  . }
10... a5 11. Be3
{ The inclusion of a4-a5 works in White’s favour, compared to 10. Be3,  because the Knight on b6 has one less defender. Black is forced to capture away from the center with ...cxb6 @@StartBracket@@after Bxb6@@EndBracket@@ and White ends up with a strategically better pawn structure. In addition, we secure the b5-square for our pieces. }
11... e6 12. Nd4 exd5 13. Nxf5 gxf5 14. Bxb6 cxb6 15. cxd5
{ Black has a lot of weak squares and a bad pawn structure. The opposite colored Bishops are not enough compensation for those flaws. In addition, his Queenside pawns are fixed. White has a small but stable advantage here. }

Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd8
{ Black simply retreats the Queen to its initial position. This move looks illogical to me, as basically, Black is admitting that he just gave up two tempi in the opening just to open up the d-file. Still, it is not so easy to refute and Black can still rely on a solid if passive position. I know that IM John Bartholomew has recently made a course on the Scandinavian based on the line 3... Qd8, therefore it could get more popular in practice. I guess 3... Qd8 could work as a surprise weapon.

Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd8
{ Black simply retreats the Queen to its initial position. This move looks illogical to me, as basically, Black is admitting that he just gave up two tempi in the opening just to open up the d-file. Still, it is not so easy to refute and Black can still rely on a solid if passive position. I know that IM John Bartholomew has recently made a course on the Scandinavian based on the line 3... Qd8, therefore it could get more popular in practice. I guess 3... Qd8 could work as a surprise weapon.

Recently it has seen a resurgence thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. }
2. exd5
{ The main move and my recommendation. It is obviously the only move that can trouble Black. }
2... Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd8
{ Black simply retreats the Queen to its initial position. This move looks illogical to me, as basically, Black is admitting that he just gave up two tempi in the opening just to open up the d-file. Still, it is not so easy to refute and Black can still rely on a solid if passive position. I know that IM John Bartholomew has recently made a course on the Scandinavian based on the line 3... Qd8, therefore it could get more popular in practice. I guess 3... Qd8 could work as a surprise weapon. There are not so many lines for Black to study, and he can get a very solid position especially if White does not know how to meet it. }
4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bg4
{ This is Black's main defence in the 3... Qd8 Scandinavian. The problem is he lacks space to develop his pieces comfortably and he cannot allow White to play Ne5 and Bc4 so easily as that would lead to an unpleasant position for him.

6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 c6 8. Be3

8... e6
{ White scores very well in this position. In the Correspondence Database, he scores a hefty 83% with the White pieces. In my opinion, the reason for choosing the Scandinavian 3...Qd8 with Black is to catch your opponent by surprise or unprepared. There is not much theory to remember with Black and he can get a playable and solid position with pawns on e6 and c6. The ideas of the position are easy to remember. On the other hand, with natural moves, White can get a small risk-free advantage at the very least. He gets the Bishop pair and also some space advantage almost by force. If White is well-prepared then he can even expect more than a small edge. }

3... Qd8
{ Black simply retreats the Queen to its initial position. This move looks illogical to me, as basically, Black is admitting that he just gave up two tempi in the opening just to open up the d-file. Still, it is not so easy to refute and Black can still rely on a solid if passive position. I know that IM John Bartholomew has recently made a course on the Scandinavian based on the line 3... Qd8, therefore it could get more popular in practice. I guess 3... Qd8 could work as a surprise weapon.

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian Defence @@StartBracket@@or Center Counter Defence@@EndBracket@@ is one of the oldest openings in chess. Although it has never enjoyed top-level popularity, it has been played notably by some World Champion level players, including Tarrasch, Spielman, Tartakower and Alekhine. Recently it has seen a resurgence thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. }
2. exd5
{ The main move and my recommendation. It is obviously the only move that can trouble Black. }
2... Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd8
{ Black simply retreats the Queen to its initial position. This move looks illogical to me, as basically, Black is admitting that he just gave up two tempi in the opening just to open up the d-file. Still, it is not so easy to refute and Black can still rely on a solid if passive position. I know that IM John Bartholomew has recently made a course on the Scandinavian based on the line 3... Qd8, therefore it could get more popular in practice. I guess 3... Qd8 could work as a surprise weapon. There are not so many lines for Black to study, and he can get a very solid position especially if White does not know how to meet it. }
4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bg4
{ This is Black's main defence in the 3... Qd8 Scandinavian. The problem is he lacks space to develop his pieces comfortably and he cannot allow White to play Ne5 and Bc4 so easily as that would lead to an unpleasant position for him. Therefore Black is willing to give up his Bishop pair and hopes to get a reasonable and solid position. }
6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 c6 8. Be3
{ The best and most natural move. Simply defending the d4-pawn and preparing to castle either way. }
8... e6
{ White scores very well in this position. In the Correspondence Database, he scores a hefty 83% with the White pieces. In my opinion, the reason for choosing the Scandinavian 3...Qd8 with Black is to catch your opponent by surprise or unprepared. There is not much theory to remember with Black and he can get a playable and solid position with pawns on e6 and c6. The ideas of the position are easy to remember. On the other hand, with natural moves, White can get a small risk-free advantage at the very least. He gets the Bishop pair and also some space advantage almost by force. If White is well-prepared then he can even expect more than a small edge. }
9. Bd3
{ This move is a good choice. White develops his Bishop and keeps the option to castle on either flank. }
9... Nbd7 10. O-O-O

Still, it is not so easy to refute and Black can still rely on a solid if passive position. I know that IM John Bartholomew has recently made a course on the Scandinavian based on the line 3...

On the other hand, with natural moves, White can get a small risk-free advantage at the very least. He gets the Bishop pair and also some space advantage almost by force.

2. exd5

{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position.

Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd6
{ The Queen retreat to d6 has been growing in popularity in recent years, thanks mostly to Magnus Carlsen's efforts. This could be called the Modern main line of the Scandinavian. The Queen looks odd on d6, as it can be attacked in the near future with either Nb5 or Bf4, however Black hopes to be able to develop his pieces comfortably relatively quickly, while the Queen on d6 does control some squares in the center. }

{ this move has been featured in the Yearbook many years ago, and now it is well-known that this promises White a large advantage.   Before that,  9.Bf4  was the main line, but White realized that he did not have to hurry with that move yet. }

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian Defence @@StartBracket@@or Center Counter Defence@@EndBracket@@ is one of the oldest openings in chess. Although it has never enjoyed top-level popularity, it has been played notably by some World Champion level players, including Tarrasch, Spielman, Tartakower and Alekhine. Recently it has seen a resurgence thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. }
2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd6
{ The Queen retreat to d6 has been growing in popularity in recent years, thanks mostly to Magnus Carlsen's efforts. This could be called the Modern main line of the Scandinavian. The Queen looks odd on d6, as it can be attacked in the near future with either Nb5 or Bf4, however Black hopes to be able to develop his pieces comfortably relatively quickly, while the Queen on d6 does control some squares in the center. }
4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 g6
{ A modern variation. This move has not been very popular until it was introduced into top-level play by GM Vladimir Kramnik in 2009. Since then other top GMs like Caruana and Nakamura have followed suit. Black plays very flexibly: he wants to play ...Bg7 and castle short, bringing his King to a safe place before making any decision on how to develop the rest of his pieces. This move can be a very effective surprise weapon, especially if White does not have anything special prepared against it. So we'll try to ensure that you have some ideas ready, just in case you meet it over the board. }
6. Nb5
{ This interesting move hits Black's Queen and aims to disrupt his plans. This move also scores best for White in practice. }
6... Qb6 7. a4
{ 7.c4  is also a good choice here but I'll stick to 7. a4. White threatens to harass the Queen with a4-a5, while reserving the a3-square comfortably for White's Knight to retreat. }
7... a6 8. Na3 Bg7
{ I generally don't want to highlight a person's bad experience by all means but a strong Correspondence player, Bernhard Fels, played 7... a6 five times in his career, losing all 5 games! Later on, he tried 7... c6 instead, but also lost! That must mean that objectively White's position is much easier to play in these variations. We'll be looking closely at his games and try to understand what are the best plans and ideas for White. }
9. Nc4 { Hitting Black's Queen and making her life miserable. } 9... Qa7
{ The Queen looks horribly placed on a7. I wouldn't want to play this position as Black. It just looks too weird and inharmonious. }
10. Be2
{ Anticipating Bg4 and just preparing to castle.  Bernhard also tried to delay castling for a while: }
10... Bf5 11. c3 Nbd7 12. O-O Rd8 13. Re1
{ But White just plays logical and strong moves. } 13... O-O 14. Bf1
{ As you can see White has firm control over the e-file and the important e5 square. }
14... Rfe8 15. b4
{ Preventing the ...c7-c5 break and maintaining a bind on the position. } 15...
Nd5 16. Bd2 N7f6 17. Nce5
{ Black's position is difficult. He has no counterplay and his Queen is misplaced on a7. The game didn't last long after }
17... Ne4 18. Nxf7 Kxf7 19. Rxe4 Bxe4 20. Ng5+ Kg8 21. Nxe4 e5 22. Bg5
{ leads to a much better position for White as the enemy King is too open and the a2-g8 diagonal is vulnerable. }

{ The Scandinavian Defence @@StartBracket@@or Center Counter Defence@@EndBracket@@ is one of the oldest openings in chess. Although it has never enjoyed top-level popularity, it has been played notably by some World Champion level players, including Tarrasch, Spielman, Tartakower and Alekhine.

2. exd5
{ The main move and my recommendation. It is obviously the only move that can trouble Black. }
2... Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qd6
{ The Queen retreat to d6 has been growing in popularity in recent years, thanks mostly to Magnus Carlsen's efforts. This could be called the Modern main line of the Scandinavian. The Queen looks odd on d6, as it can be attacked in the near future with either Nb5 or Bf4, however Black hopes to be able to develop his pieces comfortably relatively quickly, while the Queen on d6 does control some squares in the center. }

Ne5 and 6. g3, and both are good enough for an advantage too:   6.Ne5  when the line continues  Nbd7  7.Nc4  Qc7  and now both  8.a4  and  8.Qf3  are known to give White the more pleasant play. However, it needs to be checked deeper of course.   Or  6.g3  but here  Bg4  7.Bg2  and compared to the 5... a6 line that we analysed, here Black saves a tempo by not having to play ...a7-a6.  However, I am recommending 6. Be3!? instead. It is still relatively unknown and in many lines, White simply wants to castle Queenside and attack! }
6... Bf5
{ The standard reply for Black. He wants to develop his pieces comfortably and get a standard Scandinavian position with the pawns on e6 and c6. However, we have a surprise waiting for the Bishop. }
7. Nh4
{ Harassing the 'Scandinavian' Bishop right away ! Black is given no time for respite and is forced to make an uncomfortable position. }

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian Defence @@StartBracket@@or Center Counter Defence@@EndBracket@@ is one of the oldest openings in chess.

Recently it has seen a resurgence thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. }
2. exd5
{ The main move and my recommendation. It is obviously the only move that can trouble Black. }
2... Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qa5
{ This is the classical main line. It used to be the most popular option without question. In recent years, 3... Qd6 has replaced it at the top level, thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. Black makes use of his early Queen outing and hopes that it can prove useful on a5 by controlling important squares. It is not that easy to attack the Queen on a5, and it can always retreat to c7 or d8 after an eventual ...c6. }
4. d4
{ The normal continuation. White controls the central dark-squares and opens up the diagonal for his dark-squared Bishop. }
4... Nf6
{ This is Black's most popular reply. It is also the most flexible, as Black can opt to go for different plans still. }
5. Nf3

5... c6
{ which vacates the d8- and c7-squares as possible retreat squares for the Queen, and it controls the light-squares on Black's Queenside. We'll look at this move very deeply as well. However, currently, I think 5... Bf5 has replaced it as the best move. }
6. Bc4 Bf5
{ Black has some other possibilities besides this natural move, but this is clearly Black's best bet. }
7. Bd2
{ The main reply and the main idea for White in this variation. It is simple yet very logical. White counters Black's pressure along the e1-a5 diagonal and pinpoints the vulnerability of Black's Queen on a5. White has other moves here but this move is good enough.   An aggressive possibility is  7.Ne5  e6  8.g4  with the idea to harass the f5-Bishop and gain as much space as possible. It is also good for White.

2... Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qa5
{ This is the classical main line. It used to be the most popular option without question. In recent years, 3... Qd6 has replaced it at the top level, thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. Black makes use of his early Queen outing and hopes that it can prove useful on a5 by controlling important squares. It is not that easy to attack the Queen on a5, and it can always retreat to c7 or d8 after an eventual ...c6. }

6. Bc4 Bf5

7. Bd2
{ The main reply and the main idea for White in this variation. It is simple yet very logical. White counters Black's pressure along the e1-a5 diagonal and pinpoints the vulnerability of Black's Queen on a5. White has other moves here but this move is good enough.   An aggressive possibility is  7.Ne5  e6  8.g4  with the idea to harass the f5-Bishop and gain as much space as possible. It is also good for White. The critical position arises after  8...Bg6  9.h4  Nbd7  10.Nxd7  Nxd7  11.h5  Be4  12.O-O  Bd5  13.Nxd5  Now White has seized the Bishop pair  13...cxd5  14.Bd3  when White has the two Bishops plus a huge space advantage on the Kingside. I believe White is better here as well, so readers can investigate 7. Ne5 further if they prefer it over 7. Bd2. }
7... e6 { This is the main line, but we'll also check other moves: } 8. Nd5
{ This is a typical move in the Qa5 Scandinavian. White forces the enemy Queen back to its starting square and gains favourable exchanges. }
8... Qd8 9. Nxf6+ Qxf6

[Result "*"]

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian Defence @@StartBracket@@or Center Counter Defence@@EndBracket@@ is one of the oldest openings in chess. Although it has never enjoyed top-level popularity, it has been played notably by some World Champion level players, including Tarrasch, Spielman, Tartakower and Alekhine. Recently it has seen a resurgence thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. }
2. exd5
{ The main move and my recommendation. It is obviously the only move that can trouble Black. }
2... Qxd5 3. Nc3
{ The most natural and common response against the Scandinavian. White gains a tempo by attacking the black Queen on its active position. As chess principles remind us: do not move your Queen too early in the game! This is why the Scandinavian is not very popular at the top level. Black has to waste some time putting his Queen on a comfortable square. }
3... Qa5
{ This is the classical main line. It used to be the most popular option without question. In recent years, 3... Qd6 has replaced it at the top level, thanks to the efforts of Magnus Carlsen. Black makes use of his early Queen outing and hopes that it can prove useful on a5 by controlling important squares. It is not that easy to attack the Queen on a5, and it can always retreat to c7 or d8 after an eventual ...c6. }
4. d4
{ The normal continuation. White controls the central dark-squares and opens up the diagonal for his dark-squared Bishop. }
4... Nf6
{ This is Black's most popular reply. It is also the most flexible, as Black can opt to go for different plans still. }
5. Nf3
{ White logically develops his pieces by following the motto: 'develop your Knights before your Bishops'. }
5... Bf5
{ This is most likely the most stubborn defence for Black in the Scandinavian Qa5. This move has become popular recently. People used to play ...c7-c6 right away, but then people discovered that there are some benefits to delaying c6. GM Eric Prie is the biggest supporter for Black. In recent years GM Laznicka, and Mamedyarov have followed suit, playing 5... Bf5 against some strong GM opposition. }
6. Bc4
{ White plays similarly as against 5... c6.   White can play  6.Ne5  too, threatening Nc4 or g4, harassing Black's pieces. He should reply with  6...c6  creating an escape path for the black Queen, when  7.Bc4  transposes to a variation we analyzed from 5... c6.   If  6.Bd2  Black replies  6...e6  when  7.Bc4  would transpose to our line from 6. Bc4. }
6... e6
{ This is Black's idea. He delays c7-c6 for a while and hopes that he can make better use of the tempo. }
7. Bd2 Bb4
{ Black's idea. He is happy to give up the Bishop pair in return for comfortable development. }
8. a3
{ White has other moves too, but what is wrong with grabbing the Bishop pair? }
8... Bxc3 9. Bxc3 Qb6 10. d5
{ White opens up the position for his Bishops before Black can consolidate. He is threatening to take on f6 and ruin Black's pawn structure. }
10... exd5 11. Bxd5 Be6
{ This is what Mamedyarov played against Karjakin in the Sinquefield Cup 2019. Black accepts a very solid but slightly worse ending. }

{ Black controls the g5-square and prevents Ng5 ideas. } 17. b3
{ White controls the c4-square and improves the position of his Bishop.   17.Re7  Rhf8  allowed Black to equalize in the aforementioned Karjakin-Mamedyarov 2019 game. }
17... Rhe8 18. Bb2
{ The ending is close to equal, however I believe that White can still play on. His Bishop is stronger than the Knight and it exerts pressure over Black's Kingside.

If all the Rooks are traded then his King can also come to the center faster than its counterpart. All in all, I think Black still has to prove equality. }
18... Rxe1+ 19. Rxe1 Re8 20. Rd1

{ White has improved his position and Black's pieces are quite stuck for the time being. If Black moves his Knight then White's Rook infiltrates after Rd8, and meanwhile White can improve the position of his King with Kg2 etc. }

1. e4 Nc6
{ The Nimzowitsch Defence. This is a somewhat unusual and very rarely played opening. This move has not been analysed well enough yet, and Black hopes to avoid huge amounts of theory while getting a playable game. }
2. d4
{ This is my recommendation. The idea is not to refute Black's opening, but simply to control the center better and to develop our pieces to their natural squares.   Most opening books and opening materials recommend the move  2.Nf3  which is the other good reply to 1... Nc6. However, I'd rather not give Black the option of playing  2...e5 !  , transposing to normal 1. e4 e5 Openings. }
2... d5

1. e4 Nc6
{ The Nimzowitsch Defence. This is a somewhat unusual and very rarely played opening. This move has not been analysed well enough yet, and Black hopes to avoid huge amounts of theory while getting a playable game. }
2. d4
{ This is my recommendation. The idea is not to refute Black's opening, but simply to control the center better and to develop our pieces to their natural squares.   Most opening books and opening materials recommend the move  2.Nf3  which is the other good reply to 1... Nc6. However, I'd rather not give Black the option of playing  2...e5 !  , transposing to normal 1. e4 e5 Openings. }
2... d5
{ This is the main reply for Black and it's his best move. He does not allow White to gain any more space in the center and fights for control of the light-squares. }
3. e5
{ White advances his pawn forward, gaining space for his pieces while limiting Black's mobility. This is my preferred choice as Black's position is cut into two, and the position is relatively simple to play with White.   It is known that it's not so simple to gain an advantage after  3.Nc3  dxe4  4.d5  Ne5  5.Bf4   Black is also fine after  5.Qd4  Ng6  6.Qxe4  Nf6  7.Qa4+  Bd7  8.Bb5  a6  when the arising endgame is approximately equal:  9.Bxd7+  Qxd7  10.Qxd7+  Nxd7  11.Nf3  O-O-O  12.Be3  Nge5 =  Black has ideas of ...g7-g6 or even ...Ne5-g4 attacking White's Bishop on e3. Black has no problems in this position.  5...Ng6  6.Bg3  a6  Black takes away the b5-square from White's pieces. Next he can play ...Nf6 or ...e7-e5, with a completely fine position. }
3... Bf5
{ Play is similar to the advanced Caro-Kann with the Knight on c6 instead of having a pawn there. This has both advantages and disadvantages. With the Knight on c6 Black exerts more pressure on the e5 and d4-square hereby making his counterplay of ...f7-f6 much more effective. On the other hand, his typical break of ...c5 is almost non-existent here and in addition, the Knight can be pinned on the a4-e8 diagonal by Bb5. }
4. c3
{ Solidly defending the d4-pawn and taking away the square b4 from Black's Knight. }
4... e6
{ Black opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for his Bishop and prepares to develop the rest of his pieces. }
5. Nd2
{ The idea of this move is to bring this Knight quickly to action in the Kingside to f3  (preferably after f2-f4)  , which supports White's center and the e5 and g5-squares. While the g1-Knight has other purposes. It will be developed to e2, from where it supports the d4 and f4-squares. That way White can bring all his troops much faster to their ideal squares. }

1. e4 Nc6
{ The Nimzowitsch Defence. This is a somewhat unusual and very rarely played opening. This move has not been analysed well enough yet, and Black hopes to avoid huge amounts of theory while getting a playable game. }
2. d4
{ This is my recommendation. The idea is not to refute Black's opening, but simply to control the center better and to develop our pieces to their natural squares.   Most opening books and opening materials recommend the move  2.Nf3  which is the other good reply to 1... Nc6. However, I'd rather not give Black the option of playing  2...e5 !  , transposing to normal 1. e4 e5 Openings. }
2... d5
{ This is the main reply for Black and it's his best move. He does not allow White to gain any more space in the center and fights for control of the light-squares. }
3. e5
{ White advances his pawn forward, gaining space for his pieces while limiting Black's mobility. This is my preferred choice as Black's position is cut into two, and the position is relatively simple to play with White.   It is known that it's not so simple to gain an advantage after  3.Nc3  dxe4  4.d5  Ne5  5.Bf4   Black is also fine after  5.Qd4  Ng6  6.Qxe4  Nf6  7.Qa4+  Bd7  8.Bb5  a6  when the arising endgame is approximately equal:  9.Bxd7+  Qxd7  10.Qxd7+  Nxd7  11.Nf3  O-O-O  12.Be3  Nge5 =  Black has ideas of ...g7-g6 or even ...Ne5-g4 attacking White's Bishop on e3. Black has no problems in this position.  5...Ng6  6.Bg3  a6  Black takes away the b5-square from White's pieces. Next he can play ...Nf6 or ...e7-e5, with a completely fine position. }
3... Bf5
{ Play is similar to the advanced Caro-Kann with the Knight on c6 instead of having a pawn there. This has both advantages and disadvantages. With the Knight on c6 Black exerts more pressure on the e5 and d4-square hereby making his counterplay of ...f7-f6 much more effective. On the other hand, his typical break of ...c5 is almost non-existent here and in addition, the Knight can be pinned on the a4-e8 diagonal by Bb5. }

On the other hand, his typical break of ...c5 is almost non-existent here and in addition, the Knight can be pinned on the a4-e8 diagonal by Bb5. }

{ The idea of this move is to bring this Knight quickly to action in the Kingside to f3  (preferably after f2-f4)  , which supports White's center and the e5 and g5-squares. While the g1-Knight has other purposes. It will be developed to e2, from where it supports the d4 and f4-squares. That way White can bring all his troops much faster to their ideal squares. }

{ This move, with the idea to bring the Queen to the Kingside by Qf4-g4 is a rarely implemented idea but a good one to remember. This led to success for White in the game that we'll look at.   There is nothing wrong with the natural  12.Ng3  with the idea to go to h5 and provoke weaknesses. For example, play can continue:  g6  13.h4  Be7  14.h5 !  g5  15.Nh2  our Knight comes to g4 next. From there it controls the f6 and h6-squares and later on, he can open the f-file with f2-f4. Black's counterplay on the Queenside is way too slow, as White can always defend the c3 pawn by Re3-f3 for example, combining attack with defence. }

Additionally, his dark squares in the center/on the Queenside would become very weak: Bf4 would exert strong pressure along the h2-b8 diagonal and White could set-up a deadly battery with Bh2 and Qf4. }
