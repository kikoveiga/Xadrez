1. d4
{ I should mention at this point I nearly always play  1...e6  ,  but 'true' Dutch players will play 1...f5. There are pro's and con's with both moves. If you play 1...e6 then you must be ready for a French Defence opening if White plays  2.e4.  On the plus side, 1...e6 avoids a number of White's sidelines like 2. Bg5 etc.  1...f5 suits our repertoire better but here you need to know what to do against some second move ideas from White.  For ease of this course I have switched from 1...e6 to 1...f5. }
1... f5
{ Here   2.Bg5  is still an annoying move, but we look at the best way to play for Black later on.   2.Nc3  used to scare me, but after filming a DVD for GingerGM with GM Roeland Pruijssers I started to like Black's position after the sequence  2...Nf6  3.Bg5  d5 !   Of course we will also take a look at the London system  2.Bf4  e6.   1...e6  2.g3  f5  3.Bg2  Nf6  4.Nh3  was a setup that used to concern me when writing the 'Killer Dutch' but that fear has passed.  4...Be7  5.c4  O-O  6.O-O  d6  7.b3  c6 !  8.Bb2  Qc7 !  is the correct way to handle White's plan, as seen in N.Pert vs R.Pert, 2015, British Championship. }
2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6
{ This is the most likely position that you reach in the Classical Dutch, so it is one you need to know well! }
7. Nc3
{ 7.b4 !?  is like 7. b3 yet having the pawn on b4 has its downsides. Mainly it is more exposed to attack here, with moves like ...a5 and then after b5 ...c6.   7.b3  This quiet move is one of the trickiest to meet. White wants to control e5 and wait with his Knight on b1 as d2 could be a better square. After some thought I have concluded that  7...a5!  is the best way to proceed. }
7... Ne4
{ The best move!  7...Qe8  8.b3  Ne4  9.Nxe4 !  +=  is yet again a problem for Black as we will see later. Nxe4 is always the move that White should be aiming to play ! }
8. Nxe4
{ The only way for White to fight for an advantage! The current trend is then follow up with...  8.Qc2  Nxc3  9.Qxc3  a5   9...Bf6 !?  is also looked at by me. I want to give you two choices here, which are pretty much equally as good. You must decide going on your own style. 9... a5 allows an exchange of Queens and an ending in the key line, whilst 9... Bf6 keeps the position more tense.  10.b3  Bf6  11.Bb2  Nc6  12.Qd2  e5  13.dxe5  dxe5  14.Qd5+  Kh8  15.Qxd8  Rxd8  16.Rfd1  is a key endgame. }
8... fxe4 9. Nd2
{ The most aggressive square for White's Knight.  9.Ne1  d5  10.f3  Nc6!?  is a relatively new idea that I will be suggesting here  ! }
9... d5 10. f3
{ 10.e3  leads to the same line given in the notes to White's eleventh move after  10...Nc6   10...c5 !?  11.f3. }
10... Nc6 11. fxe4
{ 11.e3 !?  is another line which I predict could become quite popular for White in the future. This is a safer option for White. }
11... Rxf1+ 12. Kxf1
{ This is the current trend at Grandmaster level. Capturing with the king may look odd, but it keeps White's other pieces on good squares.  12.Nxf1  was the older main line but after  12...dxc4  13.Be3  Bd7 !  things are looking fine for Black from a theoretical standpoint. }
12... dxc4 13. Nf3
{ This was discussed on Chess Publishing in length. It is the big test at the moment, but I have found some ways that Black can play without fear. }
13... b5 14. Be3 Qe8 { 14...a6  was seen in the game Ward vs N.Pert. } 15. d5
Nb4 16. a3 Na6 17. b4
{ One of the computers top choices, leading to a very complex position. Black has an equal and dynamic position, just the kind of fun we want in the Dutch! }

14. Nxa8 Bc5 { Increasing the pressure against f2. } 15. Rd5
{ It is easy to go wrong when faced with such a crazy attack even for someone as strong as Wojtaszek. After this move the computer starts to like my position. Let's take a quick look at what the computer suggests as the best defence for White.   15.gxf4 !  is Komodo 12 first choice where it starts to rate the position as being roughly one pawn and a half up  (+1.40)  for White. But then it changes it's mind to a pawn  (+1.10)  all very confusing !  Bf5  is the most logical.   15...e4  16.Be3 !  Bxe3  17.fxe3  exf3  18.exf3  Bf5  19.e4  +-   15...Ng4  16.e3  exf4  17.Rd5 !  +-  16.e4 !  a very hard move for a human to find ! Lets just follow the computers first line of thought.   16.Qb2  Ng4 !  16...Bxe4  17.Qe2  Rxa8  18.Bb2  Bf5  19.Qd2  and things do look good for White. }

fxg3 19. hxg3 Nxg3 20. Rb2 Bf5

{ In this game I had the honour of playing against Boris Gelfand. Boris had just lost the World Championship final to Viswanathan Anand, earlier in that same year. In the sixteen game World Championship, Anand was not able to win with Black against Boris, but of course Anand had not played the Classical Dutch... In actual fact the World Championship match between these two super stars was very closely fought, going to tiebreaks after a 6-6 draw in the Classical section. Each player winning once with White. }

{ To create some mischief on the Queenside. If Black wants to play in this way then it is worth going ...a5 now, before White has a chance to hold the pawns together with a3.   7...Ne4  is another good option, for example,  8.Bb2  Nd7 !?   8...a5  is playable again, but does now allow.  9.a3 !?   9.b5  a4 ! }

{ It seems strange to move this Rook here. A much better idea would have been   14.e3 !  White stops me from ever playing ... f4, therefore keeping some control over the Kingside. Even so, having said all of the above, my position does seem fine if I now undertake some active operations on the queenside. For example:  cxb5   14...Be8 !?  15.Nxb5  Bxb5  16.cxb5  Nd7 =  with a perfectly fine position for Black. }

{ From the game Irina Krush vs. Fiona Steil-Antoni. Fiona is a great friend of mine and here she tries the Dutch. Irina was very crafty in picking a line that would give Fiona chances to go wrong. A line that is very uncommon. }

{ A key moment and a very important lesson for everyone reading this. When you play an opening for the first time, you will often find yourself in situations where the position in front of you is not what you had read in the book or seen on the video. In these cases you must slow down ! Think for yourself and try to find out why your opponents moves are not main line theory. There will normally be a reason why, a reason that makes your opponents moves inferior. That is the case here.   6.Ngf3  is also played, but then the Knight on d2 looks rather misplaced to me. What plan should Black play here ?  d6  7.O-O  Nc6 !  is correct. The White Knight on d2 means that the move d5 loses a lot of its punch. In actual fact it loses a pawn here.  8.d5  exd5  9.cxd5  Nxd5  10.Qb3  Be6 }

This does avoid the endgame if you are worried about it. We take a look at this later on in this course.  10.b3  Bf6  11.Bb2  Nc6  12.Qd2  e5  13.dxe5   13.d5 ?!  13...dxe5  14.Qd5+ !  Kh8  15.Qxd8   15.Nxe5 ??  loses a piece to  Qxd5  16.Bxd5  Nxe5  15...Rxd8  16.Rfd1  Rf8  The idea behind this move is to play ...e4 and then capture the bishop on f6 with the rook, avoiding doubled pawns.   16...Rg8 !?  was a move that I ventured on one occasion. The idea is to take advantage of the open g-file at a later moment. For example,  17.Ne1  e4  I wanted to play this advance before my opponent had a chance to play Nd3.  18.Rab1 ?!  Black has no difficulties after this move. White should have played   18.Bxf6  gxf6  19.Nc2 !  looks to be a bit better for White. His knight has a nice route into the centre e3-d5.   19.f3  f4 !  this was the point behind 16... Rg8 !?  20.gxf4  exf3  21.Nxf3  Bh3  22.Nh4  Rxg2+  23.Nxg2  Rg8  24.Rd3 !

From e8 the rook gives extra protection to the e5 pawn, making it possible to generate counterplay quicker on the queenside with ...a4. The position looks equal, for example,  17.Ne1  a4 !  18.Bxc6  bxc6  19... Rb8  19.f4  exf4  20.Bxf6  gxf6  with an equal game.  17.Ne1  e4 !  Black should play this before the White knight is able to reach d3 from where it can become very active.  18.Bxf6  Rxf6  The position is equal. Black just had to be aware of what White was planning after Rfd1. Saying that, I now went wrong very quickly !  19.f3  White must use this leverage to bring life to his light-squared bishop.  Re6 ?!   19...exf3 !  was a lot simpler, for example,  20.exf3  f4 !?  21.Nd3  g5 =  20.Nc2  Re8   20...exf3  21.Bxf3  Re8  22.Ne3 !  +=  21.Nd4 ?   21.fxe4  fxe4  22.Ne3  ±  21...exf3  22.Bxf3  Nxd4  23.Rxd4  c6  24.Re1  The key to this game was to watch out for the manoeuvre Rfd1, Ne1, Bxc6, Nd3 and then Nc5. 1/2-1/2  (24)  Knott,S  (2382)  -Williams,S  (2461)  Douglas IOM 2005 }

{ A strong idea of English GM Stephen Gordon. White keeps the possibility of playing Qd5+ available. I can not find a fully satisfactory way through this plan...   9.Qc2 !  may also be a problem ! I think White has a very nice advantage in all variations. For example  Nxc3   9...Nc6 ?!  is a dubious sacrifice.  10.Nxe4  Nb4  11.Qb1  fxe4  12.Qxe4  e5  13.dxe5 !  ±  10.bxc3 !  compared to the main line with 7... Ne4 this is a worse version for Black. Black doesn't want a pawn on a5 here.  Nc6  11.e4 !  e5  12.exf5 !  +=  Leaving Black with a tricky decision to make. Both captures on f5 have disadvantages.  Rxf5  this is what I played on the one occasion that I had this position, but it is an ugly move  13.Be3  Qe8  14.dxe5   14.Nd2  ±  just looks horrible for Black.  14...dxe5  15.Nd2  Rf8  16.Rab1  Nd8  17.Rb5  Bf6  18.Nb3  Be6  19.Bd5 ?!  a4  20.Bxe6+  Nxe6  21.Nd2  Qc6  22.Rd5  a3  23.Qd3  Ra4  24.Rb1  e4  25.Qc2 ?   25.Qxe4 !  +=  25...Rxc4  1/2-1/2  (62)  Markus,R  (2584)  -Williams, S  (2466)  Warsaw POL 2005 }
9... Nxc3
{ This is the move that fits in with our system, but it simply does not seem to work here. As it allows White to play e4 without us being able to answer with either ...e5 ! or ...f4 !   9...Nc6 ?!  10.Nxe4  Nb4  11.Qb1  fxe4  12.Qxe4  e5  13.dxe5 !  Bf5  14.Qxb7  +-   9...d5  is the best option, but why not play the Stonewall Dutch then !? }
10. bxc3
{ White is now ready to play the e4 advance. Black's standard way of meeting this is to play... }
10... Nc6 { However, this runs into: } 11. e4
{ Black now has a pretty horrible decision to make. He can either try ...e5 or capture on e4. Both moves are better for White, for example: }
11... e5
{ Is even worse for Black now that White's Queen can gain access to d5.   11...fxe4  12.Qxe4  is to be avoided. }

Ne4 in Blitz games online I would guess that about 80%+ of my strong opponents play Qc2.   8.Nxe4 !  is much more complicated and theoretically worrying }
8... Nxc3 9. bxc3
{ White does some damage to his pawns but keeps the Queen on c2 to help prepare the advance e4 !   9.Qxc3  is the other main option, when we will look at both  9...a5  and 9... Bf6. I like the move 9... a5, but some people might be put off by the following endgame:  10.b3  Bf6  11.Bb2  Nc6  12.Qd2  e5  13.dxe5  dxe5  14.Qd5+ !  which is ok for Black, yet not to everyone's taste. More on this later.  After   9.Qxc3  ,  the alternative is  9...Bf6 !?  ,  Pert's suggestion  (even if I did give this line as far back as 2003!)  . But this also has a drawback, mainly  10.b4 !  where White gains space on the Queenside. }
9... Nc6
{ A basic rule in the Classical Dutch is: 'Black must aim to meet e4 with ...e5 ! or ...f4 !' This move prepares ...e5. }
10. d5
{ Nearly always the move to watch out for when Black plays ...Nc6. It is worth noting the following rule. 'When White has doubled c-pawns ...Nc6 d5 generally becomes a lot less worrying for Black. This is because ...Na5 ! is a good response that takes aims at these weak pawns on the c-file.'   10.e4  e5 !  is looked at in the theory section. }

11. fxe4
{ 11.e3 !?  is a safe way that White can aim for an edge. This is looked at later. }
11... Rxf1+ 12. Nxf1
{ 12.Kxf1 !?  is the current trend. We take a look at this in the theory section. }
12... dxc4 13. Be3 { 13.e3 ?!  e5 ! = } 13... Bd7
{ The Bishop is very flexibly placed on d7 and depending on what White plays it can come out via e8 and then to either g6 or to c6. Black should concentrate on active Queenside play based around b5, Rb8, Na5/Nb4 and even ... Bc6. }
14. e5
{ White has a number of other possibilities in this position. We will take a look at these in the theory section. }
14... Be8
{ This is a good move. It has two main goals: 1  Increasing the pressure against White's d-pawn. Black can now play ...Qd7 and ...Rd8. 2  Black was weak on the b1-h7 diagonal and had to think of a way to meet Be4 and Qc2. Now Black can successfully meet this plan with ...Bg6. }
15. Rc1
{ Is Black's c-pawn strong or weak ? In this game it turns out to be very strong ! }
15... b5
{ Black has ideas of using the Queenside majority. A simple and strong plan for Black here is ...Rb8, ...Nb4, ...Bc6 and ...Nd5. }
16. b3
{ This is a standard way of trying to break up Black's pawns on the queenside, but in this position Black has a typical idea that leaves him with a fine game.   16.Bf2 !?  is interesting and quite similar to Hebden vs Williams, shown later.  Rb8  the standard idea, so the Knight on c6 can move. Normally to b4.   16...Qd7 !?  17.e4 ?!  allows Black's Knight into a very strong square:  Nb4  with ...Nd3 to follow. }
16... Ba3 17. Rc2
{ This is an error after which White gets into some serious problems.  It would have been wiser to have sacrificed the exchange with   17.bxc4 !  . At least this way White gains a slight initiative. Black is still doing well though, for example,  Bxc1  18.Qxc1  Rc8 !  This is the best square for the Rook for tactical reasons. It looks more natural to place the Rook on b8, but having the Rook on c8 allows Black the option of playing ...c5 at some point. Black is now planning to play ...Ne7 and at the correct moment ...Bc6.   18...Rb8 ?!  is correct in principle but runs into some slight problems after  19.cxb5  Nxd4  20.Qc4  when Black can no longer play ...c5   18...Nxd4 !?  may also be ok for Black  19.Bxd4  Qxd4+  20.e3  Qd8  =+  19.Qc3   19.cxb5  Nxd4  20.Qc4  c5 !  is the reason why Black's Rook is well placed on c8  19...Ne7 !  20.Nd2  bxc4  21.Qxc4  Qd7  22.Nb3  Nd5 !  with a slight edge to Black. }
17... Rb8 { Preparing ...Nb4 and getting ready for the opening of the b-file. }
18. bxc4
{ Or   18.Bh3  Kh8 !  19.Bxe6  Bg6  (Black's Bishops do a fantastic job)  20.Rc3  Nxe5 !  taking advantage of the pin on the d-file. Black must be doing well here. }
18... bxc4 19. Qa1
{ Removing the Queen from any tricks on the d-file. We have seen that Black was playing ...Nxe5 in a number of positions, and this is not possible now.   19.Rxc4  allows  Nxe5 !  20.Rc3  Bb2  21.Rb3  Rxb3  22.axb3  Ng4  and Black has serious pressure. }
19... Na5
{ Defending the c-pawn and threatening ...Ba4 in some positions. Black is very active, just what we want in this variation ! }
20. Bd2
{ An error which allows a tactical shot.  It would have been better to have played   20.Nd2  , aiming to meet  Bg6  with  21.Be4  . Black still holds an edge after  Bxe4  22.Nxe4  Qd5  23.Nc3  Qd7  24.Ne4  Qa4 ! }
20... Bb2
{ Taking advantage of some tactical tricks against the pawn on d4. The rest of the game just requires some care on my part and the point is mine. }

{ Another move that White often tries. It should be noted that this can often be met by ...Bg6 !   16.Rxc4 !  would have been the critical test. As White I would have also been in a hurry to eliminate that pawn on c4.  Nxe5  was Black's idea, using the pin.  17.Rc1  Ng4  18.Bf4  Bd6  19.Bxd6  cxd6  20.e4  gaining space, but Black has no worries after  Nf6 }

17... cxb3
{ A very imaginative idea ! Black gives a piece in order to create some very dangerous Queenside pawns.   17...Ba3 !  would have again been my choice. As a rule, it is always worth trying to meet the move b3 with ...Ba3 as in my game against Kojima.  18.Rb1  c3 !  19.Qd3  Bb2  20.Bxh7+  Kh8  White has won a pawn but Black's c-pawn gives full compensation. }

{ Another Dutch another day ! This game was played in one of my favourite tournaments, the Bunratty congress in Ireland. A tournament where the drinking sometimes gets in the way of the chess... }
1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 Ne4
{ I realised that Mark would be well prepared for this line, but I wanted to see what he had ready, fully believing in the opening. I ended up losing the game, but I can't blame the result on the opening. }
8. Nxe4 { Most players who know me are aware of this move ! } 8... fxe4 9. Nd2
d5 10. f3 Nc6 11. fxe4 Rxf1+ 12. Nxf1 dxc4 13. Be3 Bd7
{ As we have seen a number of times before, but now Mark surprised me with a new idea. }
14. Bf2
{ A crafty move. White vacates the e3 square for his Knight and allows the pawn on e2 to move in some positions. I continued with a standard plan but there is another approach that we will look at in the theory section. }
14... b5
{ 14...Be8 !?  looks like the way to proceed and is looked at in the theory section. The idea of this move is to play ...Qd7 and ...Rd8 first. This would stop what happens in the game, White's Knight from entering into play. Only after targeting the d4 pawn should Black play with ...b5 etc. }
15. e5 Rb8
{ This should be dynamically equal, but is tricky for both sides to play !   15...Nb4  briefly occurred to me as an idea. It didn't seem that Black would get full compensation after  16.Bxa8  Qxa8  17.a3  Nd5  18.e4 !  ±  we can now see why it is useful for White to have the Bishop on f2. This allows White to play e4 ! }
16. Nd2
{ Had my bishop been on e8 already then this idea from White would not have been possible due to pressure against d4. }
16... Be8 17. Ne4 { A key position and one where I started to drift. } 17...
Nb4
{ The Knight is not so good on d5 now, as it will quickly be pushed away by e4 !   17...Qd7 !  is correct aiming to play ...Rd8 and hit the pawn on d4. For example,  18.Qd2  Rd8  19.Rd1  a5 =  with equal chances. }
18. b3 Nd5
{ Another bad move. For some reason I only considered Rc1 here, but there is a much stronger option available for White. }
19. Qc2 cxb3
{ Yet another ugly move. With a pawn on b5 the resulting pawn structure is very unpleasant for Black. }
20. axb3
{ A position to avoid ! I have lost any active play and left myself with multiply weaknesses on the Queenside. }
20... a5 { Aiming to confuse matters. } 21. Nc5
{ Simple and good.   21.Rxa5  c5  gets a bit messy, but White must still be better here. }
21... Bxc5 22. Qxc5 a4 { My one hope ! } 23. e4 Nb6 24. bxa4 Nxa4 25. Qb4
{ I am left with very little to do here, so I tried to bring my Knight back around into the game. }

{ 31.Qa6 !  was scary  exd5  32.Qa8  Qxa8  33.Rxa8  Kf7  34.Bxd5+  Ke7  in my calculations I thought I was lost here due to  35.Bc3 ?  but I had missed the tactical blow   35.e6 !  35...Nxe5 !  36.Bxe5  Rc5 =  I wasn't on best form... }
31... Rc8 32. Qa7 b4
{ The tournament situation forced me to play for a win, hence why I tried this rather desperate idea. }
33. dxe6 Rc7 34. e7 Qd7
{ Another error.   34...Qxe7  35.Bd5+  Kh8  and I am still in the game } 35. e6

1. d4 f5
{ One of the most aggressive ways to face 1. d4. A move recently favored by Grandmasters who need to win with Black against 1. d4, such as Fabiano Caruana and Hikaru Nakamura. Hikaru used this move in the last round of the American championships to defeat Jeffery Xiong, a win that got him the title.  The idea of 1... f5 is to gain some control of the center, mainly the e4-square, whilst making progress on the Kingside. Black's f5-pawn will often later help him start an attack on that area of the board. }
2. g3
{ This can be considered to be the main line. White takes the opportunity to place his light-squared Bishop on the long diagonal, a diagonal that has a lot of influence on the position. Other plans will be studied later on in the course. }
2... e6
{ Our main move order. Rather than play ...g6 which is the Leningrad variation, a line that is not looked at in this course, Black aims to normally place the dark-squared Bishop on e7. }
3. Nf3
{ The most natural square for White's Knight but it sometimes also moves to h3. Again, this will be studied later on. }
3... Nf6
{ We need to develop as Black! This is the only sensible square for the Knight. On f6 it gives us more control of the center of the board and, as we will see later on, gives us chances to launch the Knight into e4. }
4. Bg2 Be7
{ The standard square for our Bishop, making it possible for Black to castle, and later on this Bishop will often find a home on f6. This is especially true after the maneuver ...Ne4 and then ...Bf6!? }
5. O-O O-O 6. c4
{ The most common and logical move. White increases his control over some central squares, when his Knight on b1 will develop behind the pawns to c3. }
6... d6
{ The main move and main idea of this course! This makes this Dutch a Classical Dutch. Instead ...d5 is a stonewall Dutch; ...d5 a very viable option but in my opinion a lot less fun and aggressive compared to the Classical Dutch. Why did we play ...d6!? Well our main idea is to try and play the pawn push ...e5! at some point. If Black can get a pawn to f5 and e5 he will be ready to start an attack against White's King.Here are some other pointers to bear in mind now that you have reached the standard set up for Black.    1  Black should really aim to prepare ...e5 before anything else. That is why I recommend plans with ...Ne4! and ...Bf6. The Bishop on f6 prepares ...e5. Black can also place the Queen behind the e5 to support it going forward in this case.  2  Be careful when playing ...Nc6. This is often a mistake as White can react with d5!   As Black we should always aim to meet d5 with ...e5! This is not possible if the White pawn on d5 attacks Black's Knight on c6.  3  Do not worry too much about developing the light-squared Bishop on c8. This Bishop often stays at home until it is able to fly out to an aggressive square like f5, g4 or ideally h3  (after ...Qe8 ...Qh5)  . It is more important for us to first play ...e5!  4  Black should consider ...Qe8 and ...Qh5. The Queen on h5 places some pressure on White's King. This position has given me a lot of fun and great results over the years. I hope that this course can pass on some of that joy to you. }
7. Nc3
{ Sensible development. We are now at what I would consider to be the main line of the Classical Dutch and it is a position you should aim to master in order to gain a better understanding of the opening as a whole. }
7... Ne4
{ After thirty years of playing the Dutch I can now confidently claim that this is the best move for Black. 7... Ne4 achieves two main things.     1  White has a space advantage, so Black aims to swap pieces. This is the correct way to play in a slightly more cramped position.  2  Black frees the f6 square for his Bishop. The Bishop often moves to this square, from where it helps prepare ...e5.    This is a key position, the only way that White can aim for any edge now is to play  8.Nxe4!  a move that is still not seen on most occasions.   Most of the time White will play  8.Qc2  here, which allows Black a very pleasant game. }

{ I have always been of the opinion that it is best to face ones own demons as directly as possible, if that can be done. Therefore we will start this course by looking at the most theoretically complex and demanding system that Black can face. This is also the system that has been recommended to White by most experts for generations, so I see little changing over the coming years. But in this game we will also look at various ways in which you can play the Dutch. It is good to be flexible sometimes ! }
1. d4 f5
{ 1... f5 is the move order that we concentrate on, but 1... e6 may be of interest to French Defence players  (like myself)  as you avoid a number of second move alternatives that White can play. Such as 2 Bg5 and the Staunton Gambit. The issue though is that you should only play 1...e6 if you do play the French Defence, as after 2. e4 you can no longer enter into a Dutch Defence. If that is not the case then always play 1...f5 and ignore this move order in the future.   1...e6  2.e4 !?  is something to be ready for ! }
2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3
{ This is it, the main line. White's Bishop is especially well placed on g2 from where it creates pressure across the whole board. }
4... Be7
{ 4...d6  may also be possible, but I find ...Be7 first to generally be more flexible.   4...Bb4+ !?  is an interesting idea that I have used on a number of occasions. The idea is to try and tempt White into playing 5. Bd2, Let's see why.  5.Bd2 ?!   5.Nbd2 !  is the critical test. White aims to gain the Bishop pair hassle free.  5...Be7 !  White's Bishop is misplaced on d2.  6.Bg2  O-O  7.O-O  d6  This is like the main line, but Black is trying to claim that White's Bishop is misplaced on d2. Why ? Well, there are no plans of b3 or b4 that we should be afraid of and the Bishop on d2 becomes a target, especially in the following line:  8.Nc3  Nc6 !  this now works a lot better.  9.d5 !  otherwise ...e5 from Black.  9...Ne5 !  10.Nd4   10.Qb3 !  is the critical test of this line that we will study later.  10...Nxc4 !  and Black is fine as the Bishop is on d2 rather than c1.  11.dxe6  Nxd2  12.Qxd2  c6  13.Nxf5  Bxe6 = }
5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Nc3 Ne4
{ This is a logical move. White has a space advantage so Black aims to alleviate his position by exchanging pieces with the move ...Ne4. This move also frees the f6-square for Black's dark-squared bishop. I used to think that this was the solution to all of Black's problems. That was until White started to play 8. Nxe4 ! The latter is the only way that White can aim to gain an advantage, but there is still not enough evidence to suggest that the resulting position is equal or even slightly better for White. The position remains unbalanced and is therefore extremely interesting. 7... Ne4 is an easy line to remember and Black's future plans are relatively straightforward compared with Black's other options on move seven.   7...a5  is a move that I have lost faith in.   7...Qe8 !?  is an alternative, yet White remains better in a couple of ways.   7...Nc6 ?!  8.d5  also seems to lead to a White advantage. }

{ We will start off our coverage of the main line with the most common move 8. Qc2 and in this case the continuation 9. bxc3. I have faced this against some very strong players, mainly GM Alexei Shirov. I got a good position against Shirov but went wrong in the middlegame. My view of this line is that it is White who must fight for equality in most variations. }
1. d4 f5 2. g3 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 Ne4
{ This move is my main suggestion. The same as I suggest in my previous book, 'The Killer Dutch', not much has changed in this line but as we will see things have advanced theoretically in the critical line 8. Nxe4 ! }
8. Qc2
{ This is, without a doubt, White's most natural move and I am sure that if you play ...Ne4, you will find that a lot of your opponents will respond with Qc2. This move forces Black to make a decision about his knight on e4 and it also helps White to play e2-e4 at a later stage. Nonetheless, Qc2 is not disconcerting and it seems that Black will obtain a good position in most cases.   8.Qd3  has little independent value as the position will normally transpose after  Nxc3  9.Qxc3   9.bxc3  Nc6  10.e4  e5  is fine for Black.  11.dxe5  dxe5  12.Qd5+ =  1/2-1/2  (12)  Lalic,B  (2540)  -Pert,N  (2460)  Torquay 2002  12...Kh8  13.Qxd8  Rxd8 =  Black's activity easily compensates for the slight weakness of his e5 pawn.  9...a5  will be looked at later on in this course.   8.Nxe4 !  is the critical test. }
8... Nxc3 9. bxc3
{ White will now always have a problem with his c-pawns, but he is threatening to play e4. Do you remember what we must aim to do against such a plan ? We must try and meet e4 with ...e5 or in some cases ...f4.   9.Qxc3  is more logical and common and will be looked at later on in this chapter. }
9... Nc6
{ The best move, preparing ...e5 ! In this case we are not as worried about d4-d5 because of White's pawn weaknesses on the c-file. }
10. e4
{ White continues with his plan.   10.d5  is a very important option. This does leave White very weak on c3 and c4 though.  10...Na5 !  hitting c4.  11.Qa4  White defends the pawn on c4 and attacks Black's Knight on a5. White has to stop Black from playing ... e5, for example,   11.Nd4  e5 !  12.Ne6  Bxe6  13.dxe6  c6 =  White's Bishop on g2 is blocked and the pawn on e6 will be under threat soon. This position must be ok for Black.   11.dxe6  c5 !  Stopping the White Knight from reaching d4.   11...Nxc4  was my suggestion in 'Killer Dutch' and it still looks ok for Black, but not quite as dynamic as 11... c5 !  12.Nd4  d5  13.Rb1 !   13.Nxf5  Bxe6  14.Nxe7+  Qxe7  15.e4  c6 =  13...c5  14.Nxf5  Bxe6  15.e4  +=  White is opening the position up to his advantage.   11...Bxe6 ?!  12.Nd4  +=  Bxc4  13.Nxf5  12.e4  Bxe6  13.Re1  Qd7 =  11...b6  The simplest  12.dxe6   12.Nd4  e5   12...Bd7 =  is also ok and can be seen in one of our introductory games  13.Nc6   13.Ne6 !?  Bxe6  14.dxe6  c6 =  15.Bxc6 ?!  Nxc6  16.Qxc6  Rc8  =+  White's pawns are too weak.  13...Bd7 !  a nice way to enter a very pleasant middlegame.   13...Nxc6  14.dxc6  e4 =  14.Nxd8  Bxa4  =+  12...Bxe6 !  13.Nd4  Bxc4  14.Nc6   14.Bxa8  Qxa8  Black has excellent compensation on the light squares.

Bf8  -+  14...Qd7  15.Nxe7+  Qxe7  16.Bxa8  Rxa8  =+  Black has great compensation for the exchange with his control over the light squares.   10.Rd1  Na5 !?  is interesting, hitting c4.   10...Qe8 !?  11.c5   11.d5  e5  12.c5  b6 =  11...d5  ...b6 is coming. }

11. d5
{ Closing the centre can only benefit Black, as now White will always have extremely weak c-pawns.   11.dxe5  dxe5  12.Rb1 !?  This is how GM Alexei Shirov played against me.  12...f4 !   12...a6  It's easy to overreact when playing strong players. Black should just carry on with his plan.  13.Rd1  Qe8  14.Rd5 !  A typical Shirov plan !  14...Be6 ?  This allows Shirov to sacrifice not a very wise move...  I am still doing well after   14...Bf6  and in actual fact, I may even be better here, for example,  15.Ba3  Rf7   15...Be7  with an equal position  16.exf5  Be7 !  15.Rxb7  Bxd5  16.cxd5  I expect that my opponent was salivating at this point.  16...Na5  17.Rb1  Nc4  18.exf5  White has ample compensation and Shirov plays the rest of the game perfectly.  18...Bf6  19.Nd2  Nd6   19...Nxd2  20.Bxd2  Rb8  21.Rxb8  Qxb8  22.c4  is no improvement for Black.  20.c4  Qh5  21.c5 !

1. d4 f5 2. g3 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 Ne4
{ My main suggestion. The same as I suggest in my previous book, 'The Killer Dutch', not much has changed in this line but as we will see things have advanced theoretically in the critical line 8 Nxe4 ! }
8. Qc2
{ We will start off our coverage of the main line with the most common move 8. Qc2 and in this case the continuation 9. bxc3. I have faced this against some very strong players, mainly Shirov. I got a good position against Shirov but went wrong in the middlegame. My view of this line is that it is White who must fight for equality in most variations.Still, it is, without a doubt, White's most natural move and I am sure that if you play 7... Ne4, you will find that a lot of your opponents will respond with 8. Qc2. This move forces Black to make a decision about his knight on e4 and it also helps White to play e4 at a later stage. Nonetheless, 8. Qc2 is not disconcerting and it seems that Black will obtain a good position in most cases. }

10. d5
{ This is a very important option, but it does leave White very weak on c3 and c4. }
10... Na5 { Hitting the c4-pawn. } 11. dxe6 c5
{ Stopping White's Knight from reaching d4.This option leads to more dynamic positions compared to the decent alternative 11...Nxc4. Care is still needed though.   The problem with 11...Nxc4 is 12 Nd4 d5 13 Rb1! a new move, creating pressure along the b-file. Black is very close to equality here, but I couldn't actually find it! }
12. e4
{ If White is aiming to get anything out of the opening then he must open up the center. This creates threats on the e-file and prepares ideas of e5. }
12... Bxe6
{ Black has ongoing pressure against White's pawn on c4 but he also doesn't need to be in a rush to capture it. }
13. Re1 Kh8
{ A very useful waiting move that also prepares to meet Ng5 with Bg5 in some cases. This is particularly true after ...Nxc4.   This is superior to the computers original suggestion of  13...Qd7.  The problem with 13... Qd7 is that White can play  14.Bf4!  Rae8  15.e5!  gaining a pleasant advantage.   Now the move  14.Bf4  can effectively be met by  14...g5!  and then 15...f4 given a chance, which looks good for Black.  After 13... Kh8 one critical line is   14.e5  Re8!  holding things on the e-file.  15.exd6  Bxd6  16.Rd1  Qe7  and Black has nothing to fear. He will pick up the pawn on c4 and bring his last Rook into play with ...Rae8. This is all new analysis but my computer confirms that the position is equal.  It should also be noted that there has been one game played with 13... Kh8: P.Meister vs Z.Rahman, Sitges Open, 2014. In that game White played   14.h4!?  and now I would suggest the sensible move  14...h6  aiming to stop a White piece from landing on g5. In these positions Black's main aim is to consolidate and then win the White pawn on c4. }

{ My main suggestion. The same as I suggest in my previous book, 'The Killer Dutch', not much has changed in this line but as we will see things have advanced theoretically in the critical line 8 Nxe4 ! }
8. Qc2
{ We will start off our coverage of the main line with the most common move 8. Qc2 and in this case the continuation 9. bxc3. I have faced this against some very strong players, mainly Shirov. I got a good position against Shirov but went wrong in the middlegame. My view of this line is that it is White who must fight for equality in most variations.Still, it is, without a doubt, White's most natural move and I am sure that if you play 7... Ne4, you will find that a lot of your opponents will respond with 8. Qc2. This move forces Black to make a decision about his knight on e4 and it also helps White to play e4 at a later stage. Nonetheless, 8. Qc2 is not disconcerting and it seems that Black will obtain a good position in most cases. }
8... Nxc3 9. bxc3
{ White will now always have a problem with his c-pawns, but he is threatening to play e4. Do you remember what we must aim to do against such a plan ? We must try and meet e4 with ...e5 or in some cases ...f4. }
9... Nc6
{ The best move preparing ...e6-e5 ! In this case we are not as worried about d4-d5 because of White's pawn weaknesses on the c-file. }
10. e4 { White continues with his plan. } 10... e5
{ And we continue with ours! } 11. d5
{ Closing the centre can only benefit Black, as now White will always have extremely weak c-pawns without any activity to show for it. }

Qa4 15. Be4 b6 16. h4 Rf7 17. Bxf5 Rxf5 18. Qe4 Raf8
{ Black is clearly better and can press on both the kingside and on the c4-pawn.   The game D.Haydon-S.Williams, British League 2013 continued:  19.Kg2  Nb7  20.Nb3  Qe8  21.Be3  a5  22.Bg5 ?  Bxg5  23.hxg5  Qg6  24.f3  Qxg5  25.Rh1  R8f7  26.Rh4  Rf4 ?   26...Rxf3  would have won immediately.  27.Rxf4 ?   27.Qxh7+  +-  Rxf4  28.Qe3  Qg6  29.Rh1  h5 ?   29...Rxc4  should still win.  30.Rxh5  Qxh5  ½-½. }

{ I predict that this is the position that you will get in the majority of your games. Especially if your opponent is not prepared ! That has been the case for me anyway. }
9... a5
{ This is my main suggestion and 9... a5 makes a lot of sense. Black stops White from playing b2-b4 and gains space on the Queenside himself. One thing you must be aware of here though is the resulting endgame which comes up.  The endgame should be fine for Black, but if you want to keep more pieces on the board then it may be an idea to take a look at the next game. In the next game we look at an old suggestion of mine  (2002!)   and an idea that Nick Pert has pushed:  9...Bf6 !? }
10. b3
{ This is the most natural move which helps White complete his development. What should Black's plan be ? The plan we are about to look at is very important as it appears in several positions and is an idea that you should remember...  White has a number of other options:   10.Re1  is the old main line that I first researched when playing 7... a5 instead of 7... Ne4  10...Nc6 !  A very complex line that has many pitfalls. Luckily most of the traps are ones that White can fall into !  11.e4  If White can achieve the e4 advance without Black playing ...e5 and Black has to exchange with ...fxe4, White will generally obtain an advantage. For this reason ...fxe4 is not really an option here. Black needs to come up with another plan. Can you think what that plan might be ?   11.d5  is the other move that Black must consider. In this instance Black has enough piece activity to compensate for his inferior pawn structure.  11...Bf6  12.Qd2  this looks best for White, but it is also a rather cumbersome square for the Queen.   12.Qc2 ?  allows  Nb4  13.Qd2   13.Qb3  e5 !  just what we are looking for  13...e5  14.a3  Na6  15.Qxa5 ?  e4 !  16.Nd2  Bd7  -+  ...Nc5 is coming next with a winning position.  12...Ne7  13.dxe6   13.Nd4 ?!  helps Black to play  13...e5  14.Nb5  Bd7  where Black had a small advantage in the game E.Pigusov-S.Atalik, Tan Chin Nam Cup 1997.   13.Ng5  e5  13...Bxe6  14.Nd4  Bxc4  15.Bxb7  Rb8  16.Nc6  Nxc6  17.Bxc6  ,  where the position was roughly equal in the game T.Woodward-S.Williams, British Championship 2003.  11...e5 !  Yes !  12.exf5  Other options include:   12.dxe5  G.Werner-T. Kaimer, Politiken Cup, 2004, continued  12...dxe5  and we can now see just how exposed White's Queen is on c3.  13.c5 !   13.exf5 ?  is not possible as Black can play  13...Bb4  with a big advantage.   13.a3 ?  did little to stop Black's plan !  13...Bb4 !  A nice tactic which leaves Black with a winning position.  14.axb4  axb4  15.Qb3  Rxa1.  13...Bf6  14.exf5  Bxf5  leading back to the main line.   12.d5 ?!  closes the centre which can only benefit Black. R.Almond-F.Castaldo, Arvier 2007, continued  12...Nb4  13.Nd2  c6  14.a3  cxd5  15.cxd5  Na6  and Black already has the advantage.  16.b4  Bd7  17.Nc4  axb4  18.axb4  Rc8  19.Qb3  Bb5  20.Na3  Nc7  21.Be3  Bd7  22.Bb6  Qe8  At last ! Black moves his Queen over to the Kingside and the position is roughly equal.  12...Bxf5  White should now try  13.dxe5  which could lead to some fascinating complications, for example,   13.Be3 ?  This is too passive. I now played ... Be4 against Gallagher and won a nice game.  Be4 ! =  13...dxe5  14.c5 !  White needs to stop ...Bb4. This move also opens the a2-g8 diagonal towards Black's King. The position is now very messy. We will take a look at one possible variation.  14...Bf6 !  Sacrificing a pawn to gain active play for Black's pieces.  15.Qb3+   15.g4  e4  15...Kh8  16.Qxb7  Nb4 !  Black is active enough and this is the type of position that any Dutch player should be happy to have achieved.  17.Nxe5  Nc2  18.Bf4 !  Nxa1  With modern computer programs it seems that this is the way to play. An improvement over what I suggested in 'The Killer Dutch'.   18...g5 !?  is the old line that I suggested which is also ok for Black.  19.Rad1  Nxe1  20.Rxd8  Raxd8  21.Qxc7  Rd1  22.Bf1  Be4 !  23.Bxg5  Bxg5  24.f4  Bf6  with a completely crazy position, but I believe that Black is doing well.  19.Qxa8  Qxa8  20.Bxa8  Nc2  21.Nf7+  Kg8  this seems to be a forced line !  22.Bd5  Nxe1  23.Nd6+  Kh8  24.Nxf5  Bg5 !  More tactics !  25.Nxg7  More !  25...Kxg7  26.Bxg5  Rf5  27.Bd2  Rxd5  28.Bxe1  Rxc5  At last it is time to take a breath ! This is a hard position to evaluate, even for a computer. I slightly prefer Black as the King will quickly come into action via g6, f5 and e4. But maybe dynamically equal is a fair assessment !   10.a3  a4 !  A logical and good move.  I have played   10...Nc6 ?!  in the past, but White may have a small advantage after  11.d5 !  11.Re1  Bf6  This is one of the rare cases when Black can allow White to play e4. The reason for this is that Black has good pressure against d4 and White cannot play b3 and Bb2 to defend this square.  12.e4  fxe4  13.Rxe4  c5  14.Be3  cxd4  15.Nxd4  Na6 !   10.Qc2  Bf6  11.e4  Nc6  12.exf5   12.d5  Nb4  13.Qe2  fxe4  14.Qxe4  exd5  15.cxd5  Re8  12...Nxd4  13.Nxd4  Bxd4  14.fxe6  Bxe6  Black has a very satisfactory position. }
10... Nc6 11. Bb2 Bf6
{ Black is preparing to play ...e5 and there is nothing that White can do to stop it. }
12. Qd2
{ In case of   12.Rad1  I always find it hard to decide where the Queen should go in such positions. e7 or e8 !? Both are ok.  12...Qe8 !  This looks best, to keep ...Qh5 an option.  13.Qd2  White wants to play d5 ! It is Black to play though. What move should Black play here ?  13...e5 !  Of course ! O. Gladyszev-R.Pert, Montpellier 2003, now continued  14.dxe5  dxe5  15.e4  f4 !?  A typical plan. Black was doing well. We can also now see why the Queen may be better on e8 as after  16.gxf4  exf4   16...Bg4 !?  17.e5  Black can play  17...Be7 ! =  Personally I love playing these positions as Black. }
12... e5 { 12...Qe7  13.d5 ! } 13. dxe5 dxe5 14. Qd5+
{ The Black King is pushed offside which can only help White in the endgame. }
14... Kh8 15. Qxd8 Rxd8 16. Rfd1
{ A key position for the evaluation of this variation. Black must watch out for the following plan: Rfd1, Ne1, Bxc6, Nd3 and then Nc5. I originally studied this position with the Pert twins, who thought that this was a good way for White to obtain a small but safe advantage. In actual fact, this position can be quite dangerous for Black but with accurate play, Black should be doing fine. Black has a number of interesting options here. I will list all of Black's sensible options, it seems that there are a number of ways to be ok. If in a rush then just stick to 16... Re8. }
16... Re8
{ This may be the best move. The Rook gives extra protection to the e5-pawn from e8 making it possible to generate quick counterplay on the Queenside with ...a4. The position looks equal, for example,   16...Rf8  This has the idea of playing ...e4 and then capturing the Bishop on f6 with the Rook to avoid being given doubled f-pawns.  17.Ne1  e4 !  Black should play this move before White's Knight can reach the active d3-square.   17...Be6 ?  is a typical mistake  18.Bxc6 !  bxc6  19.Nd3 !  e4  20.Bxf6  Rxf6  21.Nc5  ±  18.Bxf6  Rxf6  19.f3  White must use this break to activate his light-squared Bishop.  19...exf3 !  This is a lot simpler, for example,   19...f4 !?  20.exf3  f4 !?  21.Nd3  g5  is equal.   16...Rg8 !?  I played this strange move on one occasion, but I expect that it is rather too imaginative. The idea is to take advantage of the open g-file at a later stage. For example,  17.Ne1  e4  I wanted to play this advance before my opponent had a chance to play Nd3. Now White should have played  18.Bxf6   18.Rab1 ?!  Black has no difficulties after this move.  18...a4  19.f3  axb3  20.axb3  Ra2  21.Bxf6  gxf6  22.Kf1  Re8   22...f4 !?  23.gxf4  e3  23.fxe4  fxe4.  The position is equal, R.Abayasekera-S.Williams, English Border League 2005.  18...gxf6  19.Nc2 !  +=  This looks to be a bit better for White. His Knight has a nice route into the centre via e3 and d5.  Or   19.f3  f4 !  20.gxf4  exf3  21.Nxf3  Bh3  22.Nh4  Rxg2+  23.Nxg2  Rg8  24.Rd3 !  Bxg2  25.Rg3  Be4  with a roughly equal ending.   16...e4 !  This looks OK for Black.  17.Rxd8+   17.Bxf6 ?  Rxd1+  18.Rxd1  exf3  and Black wins material,  or   17.Ne5 ?!  Rf8  18.Nxc6  Bxb2  ,  and again Black is doing well  17...Bxd8  18.Nd4   18.Ne5 !?  Nxe5  19.Bxe5  a4 !  20.Rd1  Be6  21.f3 !  axb3  22.axb3  exf3  23.Bxf3  c6  24.Rd6  Bb6+  25.Kg2  Re8 =  18...Bf6  19.Rd1  Bxd4  20.Bxd4  Nxd4  21.Rxd4  Be6  22.f3  exf3  23.Bxf3  c6  with an equal game.   16...Be6 ?!  This is the most logical way to play against White's set-up but it may not be the best solution.  17.Ne1 !  This retreat is very annoying; as always, the threat is Bxc6 and Nd3-c5.  17...e4   17...Rxd1  This also looks very sensible:  18.Rxd1  Rd8  was S.Johann-R.Forthofer, Oberliga Sued 2010, but White can claim an edge after  19.Rxd8+  Nxd8  20.e4 !  18.Bxf6  gxf6  19.f3 !  and White is slightly better. }

In actual fact, this position can be quite dangerous for Black but with accurate play, Black should be doing fine. Black has a number of interesting options here.

{ With a roughly equal position. Black does have a slightly weak pawn on e4 but White has a very badly placed Knight on e1. Black can even consider ideas with ...h5 and ...h4!? now softening up the White Kingside.   It is probably best to place the Knight on d7 to f6, from where it has the possibility of quickly getting nearer to attack the White King.  I await more tests of this variation ! }

Originally, I did not believe this idea, as it just looks too odd moving the King to f1 in order to allow the Knight on d2 quick access to f3. Currently Black has enough ways to play against this to hold equality. }
12... dxc4
{ Normally the correct way for Black to continue in this rather complex and obscure variation. By capturing on c4 he creates pressure against White's pawn on d4. White now has two critical continuations: 13. Nf3 and 13. e3.   12...Nxd4 ?!  is not good enough.  13.cxd5  exd5  14.Nb3   14.Nf3  14...Nxb3  15.Qxb3  c6  16.exd5  ± }
13. Nf3
{ This is the computer's first choice and initially the machine slightly favours White, yet it seems that Black can hold the balance with  13...b5.   13.e3  is another key and rather complex line. One of the only lines in this course that it is worth remembering for Black.  13...Na5 !  This move guards the pawn on c4 and makes it possible for Black to play ...c5, attacking White's pawn centre.  The move I would like to play was   13...e5  to get the Bishop on c8 into the game, but the subsequent positions seem to be better for White. For example, play could continue  14.d5  Na5  15.Nf3 !  +=  White has really been relying on this move, the main idea of which is to play Bd2. Things are tricky for Black as he is threatened with annoying moves like Bd2 and Qa4.  14.Qa4 !  This might be the biggest test for Black after e3.   14.Kg1  c5 !  15.d5  Rb8 =   15...Bf6  gets complex after  16.e5 !?  Bxe5  17.Qh5  14...c5  is the most dynamic.  Black does have another worthy alternative:   14...b6 !?  A very tricky move for White to deal with and this looks like a good alternative to 14... c5 to me, for example,  15.Kg1 !   15.Nxc4 ?  Ba6  16.b3  c6  is winning for Black; the move ...b5 will be played in the near future  15...Qd7   15...Bd7  16.Qc2  b5 !?  with a typically unbalanced situation that requires practical tests.  16.Qxd7  Bxd7  17.Nf3  Nc6  seems ok for Black, but I would rather play White with that centre.  15.Nxc4   15.d5  should be met with  b5 !?  16.Qxb5  Bd7  17.Qa6  Black can now draw with  Bc8.  15...Nc6 !  This is better than   15...Nxc4  16.Qxc4  Bd7  17.Kg1  +=  Rc8  18.d5  b5  19.Qc2  Qb6  ,  which looks better for White. I doubt whether Black has enough compensation for the pawn.  16.e5 !  and now Black has to be accurate.   16.d5  Very natural but it doesn't seem as strong as 16. e5 ! 16... Nb4 is now a mistake, instead Black should play  16...b5 !  giving a pawn for active play. This was given my Nick Pert in his Chessbase DVD and is an improvement over a variation that Flear gave.  17.Qxb5  Nb4  with ...Ba6 to come Black has good compensation.  18.Qa4  Ba6  19.a3 !?  Fighting fire with fire !   19.Kg1  Bxc4  20.a3  exd5  21.axb4  dxe4  22.bxc5  Qd3 =  19...exd5   19...Bxc4+  is the same  20.axb4  Bxc4+  and not   20...dxe4  allowing  21.Qb3 !  +-   21.bxc5  was only given by Pert but 21. Qb3 is a lot stronger !  21.Kg1  dxe4  22.bxc5  Qd3 =  after that tactical sequence, Black is ok.  16...Bd7 !  I don't like   16...cxd4  17.exd4  Nxd4  18.Nd6 !  +=  17.Qd1  cxd4  18.exd4  Rc8 =  Black has just enough threats due to White's King being on f1.   13.Nxc4  Qxd4  is fine for Black.   13...b5 !? }
13... b5
{ Natural.   13...Bd7  is also interesting, but White should be a bit better after  14.d5 !  ,  for example,  14...Be8  15.Bf4  exd5  16.exd5  Nb4  17.Ne5.  Now  17...g5  is interesting, but I do not really trust this move, as it seems a little bit too wild, even for me !   13...Bf6 ?!  14.Be3  Bd7  15.b3  +=  Tomashevsky vs Rahman, 2015, FIDE World Cup, Baku. This was one of the first times a player tried 12. Kxf1 !?, but Black clearly shouldn't react with 13... Bf6 ?! }
14. Be3

14. e5
{ This is a logical idea. The fact that I have faced this move three times  (with a 100% score !)  also tends to suggest that you are likely to encounter 14 e5. It now seems that Black has two decent ways of proceeding. I will give both variations, as it is always nice to have choices in life  (and on the chessboard)  .   14.Nd2 ?!  Falls for a nice trick that equalises.  Nxd4 !  A nice tactical shot. For example:   14...b5  15.Nf3   15.a4 !  +=  15...Be8  16.Bh3  Bf7  17.Rc1  a6  18.b3  Ba3  19.Rb1  c3 !  0-1  (37)  Machlik,E  (2053)  -Hauge,L  (2404)  Norway NOR 2017  15.Bxd4  Ba4 !  16.Qxa4   16.Nb3  cxb3  17.axb3  Bb5  =+  16...Qxd4+  17.Kh1  Qxd2  18.Qxc4  Qxb2  19.Qxe6+  Kh8  20.Rf1  Bd6   20...Bf6 !?  was also interesting  21.e5  Qxe2  22.Qd5  Qxe5  23.Qxb7  The most likely result seems to be a draw here, but White has had to play some accurate moves and Black was never in danger.  Rf8  24.Rxf8+  Bxf8  =+   14.Bh3 !?  Another interesting suggestion idea. By placing the Bishop on this square, White applies pressure to Black's pawn on e6. With correct play Black seems to be OK:  and  Qe8  This is always worth considering and now that ...Qh5 gains a tempo it must be worth playing.   14...e5 ?!  Making a break for freedom looks very logical but it is not quite good enough.  15.Bxd7  Qxd7  16.d5  if White tries   16.dxe5  , Black should play  Rd8 !  16...Na5  17.Qc2  +=  15.Nd2  b5 =  this is better than ...Qh5 as it keeps the option of playing ...e5 and exchanging light square Bishops.   15...Qh5 ?!  16.Bg2  b5   16...e5  17.d5  +=  is a bit annoying.  Nd4  17.a4 !   14.Bf2  White's Bishop is often quite exposed on e3, so this is a useful move to play. White also wants to use the e3 square for his Knight. Black should now either aim to gain active play on the queenside with ...b5, .. .Rb8, ...Na5/...Nb4 and ...Bc6. Or try to manoeuvre the light squared Bishop around to a better square.  Be8  this stops Ne3 and Black can aim to play ... Qd7 and ...Rd8 placing pressure on d4.   14...b5 !?  as in Hebden vs Williams also seems ok for Black, but I would prefer 14... Be8 the computers first choice as well.  15.e5  Rb8  Black is doing great.  15.e5  would now be the consistent move.  Qd7 !?  Black is aiming to play ...Rd8 first and only the push the pawns on the Queenside. This way White will be more tied down in the centre of the board.  16.d5  otherwise ...Rd8 and ...b5  Nxe5  17.dxe6  Qb5 !  18.a4  Qb4  19.Ne3  c6 =  Black is at least ok in this complex position, for example,  20.Nf5  Bg6 !  21.Nxe7+  Qxe7  22.Bh3  Rd8  23.Qc1   14.Rc1  This seems like a logical move but it does also encourage Black to continue in standard fashion with ...b5, etc.  b5  This is certainly the move to play as I no longer have to worry about a4. Originally, I assumed that White's central pawn formation would always be stronger than Black's Queenside pawn majority, but this is not always the case, as shown in the game.  15.e5  A very logical idea opening the Bishop.  A much safer and possibly better option would have been to play  Rb8  preparing to play ...Nb4 but without losing the Rook on a8.

{ I can see the line given in this game, 11 e3 !? becoming more and more popular for players on the White side so I think this game is quite important. 11 e3 !? is a simple way for White to play that aims to avoid some of the complications that we saw in the previous couple of games. White aims to use his slight space advantage to squeeze an advantage out of the position. The good news is that the inclusion of the moves 10... Nc6 ! and 11 e3 should benefit Black and Black is equal if not very close to being equal. I have tried to find some ways to spice things up here, but also given some solid possibilities. }

{ In this game David Eggleston, playing Black, finds another possible way to play against an early Nh3...Qe8-Bd8-Nbd7 and finally ...e5. I do not think it is as good as putting the Queen on c7 though due to 9 Nc3 ! }

{ Black can also start with   5...d6  but it makes little difference. Black will play ...e5 but only after he has castled, which is slightly different to some of the other games that we have seen.  6.b3  O-O  and we are back into the main game. }
6. b3 d6 7. Bb2
{ 7.Nf4  sets a nasty trick which I was on the receiving end of  Qe8   7...e5  is also possible in this case:  8.dxe5  dxe5  9.Qxd8  Rxd8 !   9...Bxd8 ?  is the trick  10.Ne6 !  as in Halkias-Williams  10.Nd5  Nxd5  11.Bxd5+  Kf8  =+  and with ...c6 to follow I would prefer to be Black due to the strong pawns on e5 and f5  8.Bb2  transposes to the game. }
7... Qe8
{ A simple plan. Black places the Queen on its most natural square. From e8, the Queen has ideas of swinging out to h5, but more importantly, from e8 the Queen helps prepare the ...e5 advance.   7...c6 !  is a better plan  8.O-O  Black should now play  Qc7 ! }
8. Nf4
{ After this Black is fine, White should have played   8.O-O !  +=  Bd8  9.Nc3 !

8... Bd8 { This is particularly effective when White has already played Nf4. }
9. Nd3
{ Aiming to stop Black from playing ...e5, in the spirit of the Karpov-Short game.

White has to be careful. One mistake and his position could fall apart, for example,  13.exd6 ?

{ Some observations that you should bear in mind.   1  Watch out for move order.  There are various different move orders that White can use. You must always stay on the lookout for what White is actually playing. It is very easy in the opening to go into 'auto-pilot'. This is nearly always a big mistake, but I have found it especially so in the Classical Dutch.    2  Watch out for Ne6.  You must try to avoid allowing the trick that I fell into in my game against Halkias. That trick is the sequence Nf4 e5; dxe5 dxe5; Qxd8 Bxd8; Ne6 ! Always be on the lookout for Ne6 after ...e5.   3  Try to play ...e5 when Whites Knight is on h3.  If White delays playing Nf4 but instead develops with Nc3 ?!, it is nearly always a good idea to advance with ...e5 !, keeping the White Knight stuck out of the game on h3.   4  If White plays an early b3 and Nf4 without Nc3 then you must choose between playing one of the following plans: a  ...c6, ...Qc7 and ...e5. b  ...Qe8, ...Bd8, ...Nbd7 and ...e5. c  A combination of both of the above plans. As you will see in the first line below, Black gains a good position by playing ...c6 and then ...Nbd7 with the idea of going ...e5 next. It really depends on the situation as to what is the correct plan, but if you at least know what plans you should be thinking of, it will no doubt help you play the right one ! As long as you follow these pointers then you should get a good position. }

{ Is normally aimed against the Stonewall Dutch set-up. In that set-up, with Black pawns on c6, d5, e6 and f5, White aims to take complete control of the weak e5-square. White does this by playing Nf4-Nd3 and with the other Knight Nd2-Nf3. Black has not played ...d5 yet, so it should be in his favour to play ...d6 and ...e5, limiting the activity of White's Knight on h3 and taking control of the e5-square. }

{ Some observations that you should bear in mind.   1  There are various different move orders that White can use in this system. You must always stay on the lookout for what White is actually playing. It is very easy in the opening to go into 'auto-pilot'. This is nearly always a big mistake, but I have found it especially so in the Classical Dutch. Most move orders are covered here or in the introductory games.   2  You must try to avoid allowing the trick that I fell into in my game against Halkias. That trick is the sequence Nf4 e5; dxe5 dxe5; Qxd8 Bxd8; Ne6 ! Always be on the lookout for Ne6 after ...e5.   3  If White delays playing Nf4 but instead develops with Nc3 ?!, it is nearly always a good idea to advance with ...e5 !, keeping the White Knight stuck out of the game on h3.   4  If White plays an early b3 and Nf4 without Nc3 then you must choose between playing one of the following plans: a  ...c6, ...Qc7 and ...e5. b  ...Qe8, ...Bd8, ...Nbd7 and ...e5. c  A combination of both of the above plans. As you will see in the first line below, Black gains a good position by playing ...c6 and then ...Nbd7 with the idea of going ...e5 next. It really depends on the situation as to what is the correct plan, but if you at least know what plans you should be thinking of, it will no doubt help you play the right one ! As long as you follow these pointers then you should get a good position. }

{ The White Knight quickly moves into the centre.   7.Nc3 ?!  Black has two good ways to gain equality against this move.  e5  Black immediately stops White from playing Nf4.  The other move that I have tried is   7...c6  , which is slightly more dynamic. In most cases, Black will keep the Queens on the board, which is always pleasant as it makes the position more complex.  8.d5  (Richard Palliser played this advance against me but my position was perfectly playable after the continuation given here)   8.e4  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  10.Qe2  fxe4  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  h6 =   12...Bxh3 ?  13.Qh5  8...e5  9.b4   9.e4  Na6 !?  10.Ng5   10.exf5  Bxf5  11.Ng5  Rc8 =  10...h6  11.Ne6  Bxe6  12.dxe6  fxe4  13.Nxe4  Nc7  14.Qb3  Qc8 =  15.Nxd6 ??

In this game, I relied on the strength of my f5- and e5-pawns. The weakness on d5 was not too much of a worry and I eventually won the game in nice style.  11.Nd5  Nxd5  12.Qxd5+  =+  Kh8  13.b5 ?!  Nd4  ∓  14.e3  Ne2+  15.Kh1  Nc3  16.Qd3  Ne4  ∓  0-1  (45)  Palliser, R  (2175)  -Williams,S  (2335)  Hampstead 1998  8.dxe5   8.c5 ?!  makes little sense here as Black can recapture on d6 with his pawn. The move c5 is usually only good when Black has played ...c6, because then the pawn on d6 becomes weak.  8...Nc6  9.cxd6  cxd6  10.dxe5  dxe5  . I prefer Black's position as his central pawns are very strong.  8...dxe5  9.Qxd8  Otherwise Black will play ...Qe8 followed by ...Qh5 and White's position becomes very unpleasant.  Bxd8 !  We have already discussed the pros and cons of this move earlier on. The Bishop can no longer be attacked by Nd5 and it will also find a good diagonal after the moves ...c6 and ...Bb6 have been played.  10.b3  c6  I believe that Black has a small advantage due to the strength of his central pawns.  11.Ba3  This looks like White's most natural continuation.  White's other options are as follows:   11.Ng5   11.e4  White often plays this move in an attempt to give Black an isolated e-pawn and secure the e4-square for his Knight. On the downside, the move e4 does weaken the d4-square. Black is slightly behind in development. How should he continue ?  Bb6 !  A good plan; the Bishop will be very well placed on d4.  12.Ng5  h6  13.Nf3  fxe4  14.Nh4  Bd4  !.  e4  11...Re8  12.Rfd1  Na6  Black will continue with ...h6 to stop Ng5 followed by ...Bb6 or ...Bc7. Black certainly has nothing to worry about in this position.   7.Qb3  This is an attempt to disrupt Black on b7 and along the a2-g8 diagonal. Qb3 is often an annoying move, yet it strikes me as being a bit artificial here. As long as Black keeps his cool, the Queen is not very well placed on b3 as it can often become a target to attack.  7...c6 !  This is often a good move and it performs two main roles here. 1. It blocks the Bishop on g2. 2. Gains more control of the center, especially the d5 square.  8.Nc3  Na6  When Black has played ...c6 the Knight on b8 bests square is often a6. Even more so when there is a White Queen on b3, as ideas of ...Nc5 gaining a tempo against the White Queen are hanging in the air.  9.Ng5   9.Rd1  Another rather superficial move. A move that is often played against me without any real thought. The Rook is aiming at stopping Black from playing ...e5; but after the next move Black renews the idea of ...e5 and improves his position.  9...Qe8  Often an automatic response to Rd1. The Queen prepares to move over to h5 and more importantly steps out of the way of the Rook on d1. Therefore preparing to play ...e5 at the right moment. ...e5 will come and Black should be happy with the way the opening has worked out.  9...e5 !  10.Rd1   10.c5+  d5  11.dxe5  Nxc5  12.Qc2  Ng4  =+  10...exd4 !?  11.Rxd4  Nc5  12.Qc2  Qb6 = }
7... c6
{ The simplest move.  Black does have some other decent options:   7...e5  is also ok as long as we watch out for Ne6 tricks.  8.dxe5  dxe5  9.Qxd8  Rxd8 !   9...Bxd8  would be a big mistake due to  10.Ne6 !  10.Nd5  Nxd5  and whichever way White recaptures on d5, the position remains roughly equal.  11.cxd5   11.Bxd5+  Kf8 !?  12.Bg2  Na6  13.Nc3  c6  =+  I prefer Black due to his space advantage in the centre and White's ineffective Bishop on g2, 'biting on granite' on the pawn on c6.  11...Nd7 = }

{ Ok, so I have never given this move before. But after doing a lot of research I am coming around to Pinski's  (Classical Dutch - 2002)  way of thinking. He came to the conclusion that ...Ne4 was only worth playing when White is threatening to go e4 ! That is what we are aiming at here, we will play a number of useful moves until that is an option. I must admit that I do think this is the best way to proceed now. It is flexible and more dynamic. It is also a lot simpler, you only have to remember the following. 1  Against anything except Nc3 you will play ...a4 ! 2  Against Nc3 you can wait until e4 is threatened and move in with ...Ne4. As you can see I have kept my previous analysis in below with 8... Bf6, you might be able to find something for Black and it at least will be of use to players who play this line with the White pieces.   7...Ne4  I used to love this move, but with the help of he computer I am losing some faith in it.  8.Bb2   8.Nfd2  d5  in this case with White's Knights getting in the way of each other Black can enter into a good Stonewall Dutch.  9.Ba3  Nc6  10.e3  Bd7  11.f3  Nf6 =  1/2-1/2  (28)  Ivanchuk,V  (2755)  -Sadler,M  (2639)  England 2013   8.Nbd2  Bf6  transposes.

This is a possible way to play but it does look risky ! Black just wants to develop naturally with ...Bb7, Qe7/e8, Nd7 and take it from there.  10.Ne1  Bb7  11.Nd3   11.Nxe4  fxe4  is ok  11...Qe8 !?  12.e3   12.Qc2  Na6  13.b4  c5   13...Rc8 !?  14.b5  Nb8  14.dxc5  Bxb2  15.Qxb2  bxc5  16.a3  Rb8 =  12...Nd7  13.Nxe4  Bxe4  14.f3  Bb7  15.e4  Rd8 !? =  10.Ne1 !  This is the only move that allows White to play for an advantage. As you can see, White's f-pawn is now free to move and eventually, Black will have to make a decision with regard to his Knight on e4.  Other options are less worrying for Black, for example:   10.Qc2  Nxd2  11.Qxd2  e5  12.Rad1   12.dxe5  dxe5  13.Qd5+  Kh8  14.Qxd8  Rxd8  has been seen before.  12...Qe7  was slightly better for Black in the game G.Zetthofer-A. Druckenthaner, Austrian Team Championship 2010  10...Ng5  The downside of this move is that White can now play   10...Nxd2  I originally suggested this move in my first book, Play the Classical Dutch. I noticed that on the Chess Publishing forum, 'caph1' mentioned that he had played this move without success. White can gain an advantage after  11.Qxd2  e5  otherwise White will play d5   11...Bd7  12.d5  12.Bd5+  Kh8  13.Bxc6 !  bxc6  14.dxe5  dxe5  +=   10...d5  This move may not be so bad here but it is an option that most Classical Dutch players would rather avoid. For example,  11.e3  b6   11...Bd7  12.Nd3  Be8  13.Rc1  Qe7  14.Nb1 !?  ±  Is given by Sielecki and seems to be better for White.  12.Nd3  Bb7  13.Nf4  Qd6  Black has a fairly safe and solid position.   10...Nc5 !?  Suggested in the 'Killer Dutch' but improvements have been found for White. The idea is to get the Knight out of the way in order to play ...e5. But this does look artificial and White can gain an edge.  11.e3  White must guard d4.  a5  (it is worth stopping White from playing b4 before the Black Knight has to retreat)   11...Nd7  12.f4  e5  12.f4 !  A move that puts a stop to my plans   12.a3  Nd7  13.Nd3  e5  is ok for Black.  12...Na6   12...Nd7  13.a3  d5  14.Nd3  b6  15.b4  ±  11.f4 !  This is a good move. White is aiming to take control of the e5-square.  Nf7  12.e3  e5  13.fxe5  dxe5  14.d5  Ne7  15.e4  was slightly better for White in P.Tregubov-S.Williams, Reykjavik Open 2006. 1-0  (34)  Jankovic,A  (2584)  -Glek,I  (2408)  Rogaska Slatina 2011   8...b6 !?  Is an idea that Nick Pert gives. The idea is to refrain from ...Bf6 in case Black would like to play ...Nb8-d7-f6 instead. But it does seem that White is better after  9.Ne1 !  opening the Bishop on g2 straight away.   9.Nfd2  Bb7  10.Nxe4  Bxe4  11.f3  Bb7  12.e4   12.Nc3  Nd7  13.e4  fxe4  14.fxe4  Rxf1+  15.Qxf1  e5 =  12...fxe4  13.fxe4  Rxf1+  14.Qxf1  e5 !? =   9.Nc3  Bb7  10.e3   10.Qc2  Nd7  11.Rad1  Nxc3  12.Bxc3  Be4 =   10.d5  Nxc3  11.Bxc3  e5  ∞  10...Nd7 =  9...Bb7  10.Nd3  +=  9.Nbd2  Ndf6  is another way to proceed.  10.Nxe4  fxe4   10...Nxe4  11.Nd2  Nxd2  12.Qxd2  +=  11.Ng5  d5  12.f3 !  c5  13.e3  += }
8. Nc3
{ Stopping 8... a4 which is pretty useful against every other move.   8.Bb2  is the only other main option, as given by IM ChessExplained, but it does allow  8...a4 !?  which is a good way to harass White's queenside. For example,  9.Nc3   9.b4  Sielecki's idea. Sielecki now goes on to say that the Black pawn on a4 is weak and White should be better. I am of the opinion that the pawn on a4 is actually a bit of a nuisance for White. There are constant threats of ...a3 and this gives Black time to place his Knight into the centre. For example,  9...Ne4 !  The most logical move. Black has ideas of ...Nbd7 ...Bf6 and in some cases ...d5. Let's look a bit deeper.  10.a3  Stopping any ideas Black has of playing ...a3 and therefore trying to prove that the pawn on a4 is a weakness. This does lose time though and after   10.Nc3 ??  is a major blunder as now Black can play  10...a3  winning a piece! It is always nice to have such tricks!   10.Qc2  maybe the best try, waiting to see where the Knight on b1 should develop to. It is not enough for an advantage though.  10...b6 !?  10... Nd7 may also be equal, but this is a very interesting move. As White is not placing any pressure on e4, Black takes time to develop his light-squared bishop to the best square possible.  11.Nfd2  d5    =  The position is equal.  10...Nd7 !  The posiiton is equal. Black is planning to simply play ...Ndf6 and ...Bd7. Or ...Nb6 with ..d5!? to follow, aiming to control the c4 square.  11.Nc3  Hitting e4 so trying to stop Black from playing ...Ndf6.  11...Nxc3  The simplest solution. 11...Nb6 and 12...d5 is also interesting and a way to equality.  12.Bxc3  Nf6  Black can now play on the light squares. The plan is ...d5 ...Bd7 etc., for example  13.Ne1  Aiming to find a better square for the White Knight.  13...d5 !  When White can not back up the pawn on c4 with b3, this is is often a good way to control some light squares.  14.c5  Ne4  15.Bb2  Bd7  This Bishop will sit happily on b5. Black can be very content with the way things have gone.   9.bxa4  Qe8  10.Nc3  Nbd7 !  11.Qb3  Nb6  12.Ng5  Nxa4  13.Nxa4  Qxa4 =  Black has the better pawn structure and can be happy.  9...a3  10.Bc1  Ne4 !  Now that White can not control the a1-h8 diagonal so easily this idea is good.  11.Qc2  seems the most logical   11.Nxe4  fxe4  12.Nd2  d5  13.f3  Nc6 =   11.Nb5  d5  12.cxd5  exd5  13.Bf4  c6  14.Nc7  g5 !  15.Be5  Ra5  16.Nxd5  Rxd5  17.Bxb8  g4  18.Nd2  Rxd4  -+  0-1  (26)  Szeberenyi,A  (2411)  -Varga,Z  (2519)  Zalakaros 2001  11...Nxc3  12.Qxc3  Bf6 =  with the standard plan of playing ...Nc6 ...Qe7   e8  and ...e5 with a good game. }
8... Qe8
{ A good square for the Queen, it will either move to g6 to control e4 or h5 to attack. As this is pretty new stuff it is pretty unclear as to what White's best way to proceed is    8...Ne4 !?  is a move that I am pretty fond of. The game now goes into variations of my 'Old Faithful' a line which normally starts 7... a5 8 b3 Ne4. This is a very interesting way to play and by playing in this move order Black avoids the critical line 7... a5 8 Re1 ! Let me now share some old and new analysis.  9.Bb2   9.Nxe4  is less popular now. The moves ...a5 and b3 seem to help Black. For example,  fxe4  10.Nd2   10.Ne1  d5  11.f3  dxc4 !  12.bxc4  e5  13.d5  exf3  14.Nxf3  Qe8   14...Bc5+ !?  15.Kh1  Nd7  looks like fun for Black.  15.Bb2  Nd7  16.Kh1  Qh5  17.e3  Bd6 =  0-1  (55)  Hartston,W-Levy, D Praia da Rocha 1969  10...d5  11.f3  e3 !?   11...a4 !?  12.Nb1  c5  13.Bxe3  cxd4  14.Bxd4  Nc6 =  is a promising pawn sacrifice.   9.Qc2  Nxc3  10.Qxc3  Bf6 =  followed with ...Nc6 and ...e5 leads us into the main lines with 7... Ne4 8 Qc2.  9...Nxc3 !?  A simple move. Black aims to meet e4 with ...f4 !? Leading to fun positions to play.  10.Bxc3  Nd7 !?   10...Qe8  was my favourite old move, but I now consider ...Nd7 to be more flexible.  11.Qc2  aiming for e4.  Qe8  moving to the Kingside and meeting e4 with .. .f4 !?  12.e4  f4 !  with ideas of ...g5 etc. The important thing here is to try and keep lines in the centre closed.  13.e5   13.Rae1 !?  aiming to play e5 and capture on e5 with a piece. This seems to be critical at the moment.  Qg6 !?  placing the Queen on a more active square before moving forwards with ...e5 !   13...e5  14.gxf4 !   14.dxe5  dxe5  15.Nxe5 ?!  Nxe5  16.Bxe5  f3  17.Bh1  Bh3  =+  14...exf4   14...Rxf4  15.dxe5  Qg6  16.Kh1  15.e5 !  dxe5  16.Nxe5  Nxe5  17.Rxe5  +=  This is why it is might be a good idea to play ...Qg6 first.  14.Qd2  e5  15.dxe5  Nxe5  16.Bxe5  dxe5  17.Nxe5  Qh6  18.Qd5+  Qe6  with some compensation for the pawn, I am not sure if it is quite enough though.   18...Be6  19.Qxb7  +=  13...dxe5  14.dxe5   14.Nxe5 ?  Nxe5  15.dxe5  f3  ∓  16.Bh1  Bd7  14...Qh5  with an unclear and interesting position. }

8. a3

8... Bxc3+ 9. Qxc3 Nh5
{ Another typical plan. White has weakened the e1-h4 diagonal so I take advantage of this by starting an immediate attack. It is worth noting that if White's Queen was still on c2 then this attack would be irrelevant as Qf2 would be possible. }

{ So what happens if White avoids g3 and Bg2 ? At top level this is rather rare, but seen quite often lower down. I would suggest a plan based on ...d6 ...e5 and ...g6 ...Bg7 if possible developing the Bishop to a nice square. But first lets introduce ourselves to White's possibilities. }
1. d4 f5 2. c4
{ 2.Nf3  e6  3.Bg5 !?  is quite popular and looked at.   2.Bf4  will be looked at later }
2... e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3
{ 4.Bf4  is a version of the London system.   4.Bg5  aims to cause some problems by pinning the Knight on f6.  Bb4   4.Nf3  Bb4 !?   4.Qc2 !?  is another interesting try, with a quick e4 on the cards. }
4... Be7
{ 4...b6  used to be my main move against any set up where White doesn't play g3. This is still fine, but for this course we are mainly concentrating on a quick ...d6 and ...e5 from Black. I thought that I would keep this as a possibility for you though as it is very logical. So lets take a quick look at it here.  5.Bd3  Bb7  6.f3  Following   6.Nf3  Bb4  Black will soon install a Knight on the e4-outpost.  6...Nh5 !  as soon as f3 is played I do recommend playing this move. It creates some threats by allowing the disruptive ...Qh4+ !  7.Nge2  Here   7.Nh3  makes sense, so White can play Nf2.  Qh4+  White keeps things tidy with   7...g6 !?  is interesting aiming to place the Bishop on g7.  8.Nf2  however after  Nc6  9.a3  g6 !  10.g3  Qe7  11.O-O  Bg7 =  Yakovich, Y-Shtyrenkov, V Salekhard 2007, look fine for Black,  7...Bd6 !  The most aggressive square for the Bishop.  8.O-O  Qh4  A nice brutal way of playing, hence why I think this variation might appeal to a number of people.  9.f4   9.g3  Nxg3 =  9...Nf6  Now the Knight heads to e4 or g4.  10.d5 !?  and now in Alonso Rosell,A - Gleizerov,E Donostia ESP 2010. Black should have played  10...Na6 ! =  in order to bring it to c5. }
5. Bd3 O-O 6. Nge2 d6
{ A simple set up that fits into our whole opening plan. Black wants to simply play ...e5, like in most of our other variations. }
7. Qc2 { Hitting f5 and trying to stop ...e5. } 7... g6 { 7...c5 !? } 8. e4 Nc6
9. a3 e5 { as in our first introductory game, so let's move there ! } *

2... e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3
{ Play can often transpose after this move, for example,   4...Be7  5.g3  We will look at what might happen if Black plays an early ...Bb4. I do not like playing this move unless White has moved his Knight to c3. The reason for this is that against ...Bb4+, Nd2 is normally a good response and Black will no longer be able to double White's pawns on the c-file. Marin,M: 'Aronian does not seem too keen to allow the Stonewall, possibly under the influence of the game'  White has also tried:   4.Bg5  Bb4 !   4...Be7 ?!

4... Bb4
{ Again, Black can play ...Be7 but the move 4... Bb4 makes more sense as White cannot play c3 or Nd2. When White cannot meet ...Bb4 with Nd2 or c3 then it is often a good move. Marin,M: 'The opening has turned into a Nimzo-Dutch hybrid, supposed to be fine for Black, but still complicated. The reader should compare with the lines examined in my pseudo-Owen article for CBM 166. The main difference is the early commitment of Black's Queen. ' }

{ We must now take a look at a opening that is gaining a lot of followers. The London System. An easy to play opening. On the plus side for Black, if White blindly plays his normal set up, without thinking against the Dutch. White can quickly fall into a bad position, as the Dutch gives many active ideas against the London. Two of the questions that I get asked the most are the following: People who play the London System, ask me, 'What should I play against the Dutch ?' And then there are the Dutch players. They often ask me, 'What do I do against the London System ?' So in this chapter I will try to do some deep analysis of a couple of variations and ways of playing. Not just to satisfy people who have bought this course from the Black perspective but also people who have bought my products on the London System. }
1. d4 e6 { 1...f5  is our move order } 2. Nf3 f5 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. e3
{ The start of the London System. I am going to suggest a new and simple plan against the London. A plan that is quite rare, but I am not precisely sure why. Let me break down the first stage of our plan. 1  Aim to play ...b6 and Bb7, gaining control over the long diagonal. 2  Play ...Bd6 !? This is an interesting way to immediately challenge White, and it is also very simple for us to play. We will discuss further plans a bit later on. }
4... b6
{ With this Black aims to control some central squares with the Bishop. } 5.
Bd3 { Other options are discussed in the trainable section. } 5... Bb7 6. Nbd2
Bd6
{ Or new and funky idea ! White must now decide to either capture the bishop or not. }
7. c3
{ 7.Bxd6  cxd6  is rather critical. Let me break down some important pointers for you to know after this exchange. 1  We must stop White from playing c4 and d5 ! as this plan would kill our Bishop on b7, as we can no longer play ...c6 to attack White's pawn on d5. 2  For the reason above we often play ...d6-d5 ! 3  Our Knight on b8 is our only problem piece. This guy should aim for the e7 square. On e7 it guards the central square d5 and can be moved over to attack White on the Kingside with ...Ng6 !?, So we play ...Nc6 and normally follow up with ...Ne7. }
7... Bxf4 8. exf4 c5
{ is ok, but as we see in the teachable section I prefer ... Nc6 and ...Ne7 ! }
9. O-O O-O 10. Re1 Nc6 11. Nb3 Qc7 { Black is very solid and has no problems. }

1. d4 f5
{ 1...e6  of course avoids all this nonsense, but you must be prepared for  2.e4 }
2. e4
{ The Staunton Gambit. A very popular idea at club level and also very dangerous to the unprepared player. On the plus side, Black has a lot of fun in the following variations as well, often turning the tables and starting deadly attacks against White's King. I would recommend you take a look at all the following lines, some things do need to be remembered but in general the set up in the main line that you're going for is pawns on d7,e6 and f5 with a dark-squared Bishop on g7. }
2... fxe4 3. Nc3 { 3.f3  allows  d5 } 3... Nf6

As a rule I would always refuse capturing on f3 and accelerating White's development.  4...d5   4...exf3 ?!  5.Nxf3  is just what White is looking for. Lots of open lines and the attack.  5.fxe4 !  this simple move looks to be White's most interesting possibility, as after   5.Be3  A simple developing move which has only been seen twice.  e6 !  aiming to counterattack with ...Bb4.   5...Bf5 ?  allows  6.g4 !  Bg6  7.g5  Nh5   7...Nfd7  +=2  8.fxe4  +=  8.fxe4  dxe4  9.Be2  +-  6.fxe4  Bb4 !  a new position and promising one for Black.  7.e5  Ne4  =+  Black is ready to castle and play ideas with ...Qh4+.   5.Bg5  Bf5 !?

Black can continue with 12...c6 ...Bc5 and eventually ...Kc7 with an equal yet fun game. A very interesting line which deserves more practical tests. }
4... Nc6
{ After going through every possibilty that Black has in this position I can confidently state that this is not only the best move available for Black but also the most fun ! It is the main line. I have suggested other moves in the past, but the positions that can be reached after 4... Nc6 are just so much fun ! Let me convince you with some variations.   4...c6  Was my orginal suggestion for this course, and a move that I really wanted to make work ! This idea has also been suggested on other websites and in other books. For example, Glenn Flear gives it a '!' on the cutting edge theoretical opening site 'Chess Publishing'. It was then a rather nasty, yet eductional shock, when a Chessable reader pointed out that Black could be in trouble in the following line.  5.f3  d5  6.fxe4  dxe4  7.Bc4  Nbd7  8.Nge2  Qa5  9.Qd2  b5  (given '!' in various places)  10.Bb3  b4  11.Na4 !  This little move 11. Na4 with the idea of meeting  11...Ba6  with  12.a3 !  is a new idea, and credit must be given to user 'Gavgav77' for finding this novelty. After extensive research I was unable to find a satisfactory response to this idea. I spent a lot of time looking at  12...e5 !?  yet after  13.O-O  exd4  14.Nxd4 !  Bxf1  15.Rxf1  ,  I tried to make something work for Black. The problem was, just look at Black's weak King ! I always suggest variations that I would play, and in this case I would not play this line as Black so I can not suggest it.  So, I did some more research  (here it is !)  and started to like the look of 4... Nc6, the main line. Here are my changes and suggested ways that Black now plays against the Staunton Gambit. I hope you agree with me that the following varations are a lot of fun and offer exciting ways for Black to play. }
5. d5
{ 5.f3  is a standard gambit move and the main problem against 4... c6. In this case though it falls short as Blacks Knight on c6 stands well.  d5  I spent a lot of time trying to make   5...e5  (work, but didn't like)  6.d5  Nd4  7.f4  !?N  6.fxe4  Nxe4  This looks best. Swapping pieces often helps the defender.  7.Nxe4  dxe4  and because of the pressure against d4 Black is doing fine. For example,  8.d5  Ne5  9.Qd4  Nf7  This manoeuver again.  10.Be3  e5 !  And Black's pieces come to life with easy equality. }
5... Ne5
{ The Knight will remain here until it is forced to move, then it will retreat to f7. }
6. Qe2
{ This move can now be considered the main line and has become more popular at top level. Historically the main line used to be 6. Qd4, which we will also look at, but it does appear to be less scary for Black.   6.Bxf6  This releases the tension too quickly and Black is in a very good position after  exf6  7.Nxe4  f5 !  Do remember this move ! It is often the way for Black to play in this sharp Staunton Gambit.  8.Nc3  Bc5  Black is better. With castling ...d6 and ...Qf6 coming up. The position is also very easy for Black to play, which is always a good thing !   6.Qd4  This is the old main line, but it has long been known that Black is comfortable after  Nf7  The Knight retreats and forces White to make a decision about the Bishop on g5.  7.Bxf6  Again the main line.   7.Nh3  is better than its reputation but still not scary. The simplest way to equality is now  e5  8.dxe6  dxe6  9.Qxd8+  Nxd8  with ...Bd7 and ...Bc6 and an equal game.   7.h4  is logical. The Bishop on g5 is a strong piece and White shouldn't give it up without a fight.  e5  meeting a wing attack with a central attack. 7... c6 was also possible but this is the simplest and sometimes simple is good !  8.dxe6  dxe6  9.Qxd8+  Nxd8  with equality. Black can play ...Bd7 ...Bc6 and ...Nf7 with a nice game.   7.Bd2  has been tried but it is one of White's worse options due to  c6 !  Another key idea in the Staunton ! This move often gives Black great play. That is certainly the case here.  8.dxc6  bxc6  9.Nxe4  e5  Black already had a big advantage in Ushenina vs Wenjun, 2013, 0-1. The Black centre is mobile and ready to roll !  7...exf6  8.Nxe4  Be7  The safest even though ...f5 is also good. In these positions I really do not think that Black has anything to fear. The position is very solid and the dark-squared Bishop has great potential. In the long run it does seem that Black has all the positional trumps, that is why 6 Qe2 strikes me as a more scary try from White.  9.O-O-O  O-O  Black is ready to play ...f5, ...d6 and ...Bf6 with a great game. That is why White played  10.Ng3  in Kravtsov vs Vyzmanavin, 1997, 0-1.  d6  Renewing the 'threat' of ...f5 and after  11.f4  Black even played  c5  time to open up lines towards White's King.  12.Qc3  Nh6  and with ...f5 ...Nf6 and ...b5 to follow Black was one happy guy ! }
6... c6
{ The best reply and one way to take advantage of the fact that White has not played Qd4. Now that the Knight on e5 is not attacked Black has time to remove White's annoying pawn on d5. }
7. O-O-O cxd5 8. f4
{ The latest test for Black.   8.Bxf6  has been played by Radjabov but it offers White nothing. Radjabov - Danielsen, 2000, continued  gxf6  9.Qh5+  against other options Black will play ...e6.  Nf7  10.Qxd5  e6  Black has a very strong centre, yet the King can be a target. This is typical for this variation !  11.Qxe4  And now the simplest would have been  f5  With mutual chances. Black will play ...Bg7 and castle Kingside.   8.Nxd5  This logical move is under rated. It may even be one of White's best tries ! I now suggest making some exchanges with  Nxd5  8... e6 is much more common but I am not a fan after White's most active move 9. f4 !?  9.Rxd5  Nf7  It makes sense to attack the Bishop on g5.  10.Qxe4  Nxg5  11.Rxg5  and now I feel that  g6  is best, with ideas of attacking on the long diagonal and with ...Bh6. This is very double-edged stuff and things remain sharp after  12.Nf3 !?  sacrificing for the attack.  Bh6  13.Kb1  Bxg5  14.Nxg5  e6  with a wild game. I would like to see more test here ! This is unchartered water, which the computer feels is equal. Black should aim for ...Qe7, ...Re8 and eventually the unravelling of his Queenside with ...Rb8, ...b6 and ...Bb7. }
8... Nf7 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Rxd5
{ The most promosing idea for White, as the Rook has more squares to move to.   10.Nxd5  e6  11.Qxe4   11.Nc3 !?  Qc7 !?  Another possibilty was   11...f5  but this allows  12.g4 !  With 11... Qc7 !? Black returns the pawn and gains active counterplay with his dark-squared Bishop. I prefer this way of playing, rather than trying to hang on to an extra pawn.  12.Qxe4  This must be critical. White guards his pawn on f4 and centralises his Queen.  f5  13.Qf3  This seems best. White can also try moving the Knight on c3 in, but Qf3 keeps all options open.   13.Nd5  is the most aggressive try that White has, but it is also the least worrying for Black.  Qa5 !  The most active move.  14.Qe2   14.Nf6+  This may look worrying but amounts to nothing after  Ke7  15.Qd4   15.Nd5+  allows  15...Qxd5 !  and Black gains the advantage.  Bg7  when White has nothing better than to exchange Queens, which will always help Black due to his better structure and two Bishops.  16.Nd5+  Kf8  17.Qb4+  Qxb4  18.Nxb4  a5  19.Nd3  b6  Black is slightly better with the two Bishops in an open position and a very strong pawn centre. I would now finish my development as Black with ...Bb7, then centralise with ...Ke7, play on the c-file with ...Rac8, ...Rc7 and ...Rc8 and eventually push forwards with my central pawns. The future holds a lot of fun possibilities for Black.   13.Nb5  is another try and this time Black should play  Qc5 !  this seems like a nice central square for the Queen. It is also a good idea to stop White from playing 14. Qc4 which supports Nc7+.  For example, bad would be the natural   13...Qa5 ?  14.Qc4  and White would be better.  14.Qd3  Bg7  15.Nf3  O-O  16.Rg1  a6  17.Nbd4  Nh6 !  stopping g4 for now and therefore holding up White's attack on the Kingside. This position looks very exciting for both players. Black will continue with ...b5, ...Bb7 and given a chance ...Be4. The dark-squared Bishop on g7 will always be a pain for White's King. I would evaluate things as being dynamically equal, just what we want when playing 1... f5 !  13...Bg7  Such a beautiful Bishop !  14.Nge2  O-O   14...h5  stopping 15. g4 looks interesting to the human eye, but the computer program frowns at such an idea.  Things are very critical now, as White can play  15.g4 !  fxg4   15...Qc6  doesn't work due to  16.Qg3 !  Qxh1  17.Bg2  and White's Queen will prove to be stronger than the two Rooks.  16.Qxg4  d5 !  An important move as Black's Queen needs to defend along the 7th rank.  17.Nb5  Qe7  18.Rg1  Qf6  we reach a very exciting and sharp position. Both sides have chances. All this is new stuff and hasn't been played before, my computer gives things as equal yet I would like to see some more investigations into this position. Black should be aiming to play ...Kh8 and then ...e5, opening things for the two Bishops.  11...f5  Yet again we see Black aiming for this structure. The pawn formation on d7, e6 and f5 is hard to break down.  12.Qe3  Bg7   12...Bh6  has been played before, but this Bishop is much more logically placed on g7.  13.Nf3  O-O  14.Nc3  With mutual chances. The safest way for Black to continue now is 14... Qb6, but 14... Qf6 is more exciting.  Qf6  The most fun way to proceed ! Black wants to gain some of the centre with ...d5 and even ...d4 later.   14...Qb6  was another option, but life becomes a little more dull without Queens on the board.  15.Rg1  Logically aiming to attack with g4.  d5   15...b5  was also very tempting, but this is the safest way to go. The position is yet again very exciting and offers chances to both sides. Black can attack with ...b5 or in a more restrained manner with ...Bd7 and ...Rac8. }
10... b6
{ This looks best. Other options included  10...e6   and the as yet untried  10...b5 !?  For this course I pick something in the middle of solid and crazy ! 10... b6. I am not sure what that is in the middle of, mind you... }
11. Nxe4
{ 11.g4  is an interesting idea as well. But who can turn down the chance to checkmate in one move with a Knight  ?! }
11... e6
{ Care needed !!! Please do not fall for   11...Bb7  12.Nf6#  checkmate. That would be most embarrasing ! This position has not had many outings so is room for improvement for both players. The one game I could find in this variation now continued }
12. Qe3
{ I would have thought   12.Nf3  to be more natural. When a good response to gain the f8 square for the King would be  12...Bh6. }
12... Bb7 { This is as yet untried and looks best. Play could continue: } 13.
Rh5 Qe7 { Time to bail out to the Queenside ! } 14. Nf3 O-O-O
{ With equal chances. White has more space but Black is very solid. I would be looking at playing ...f5 and ...Bg7 with the build up of an attack against White's Queenside. }

{ The Staunton Gambit. A very popular idea at club level and also very dangerous to the unprepared player. On the plus side, Black has a lot of fun in the following variations as well, often turning the tables and starting deadly attacks against White's King. I would recommend you take a look at all the following lines, some things do need to be remembered but in general the set up in the main line that you're going for is pawns on d7,e6 and f5 with a dark-squared Bishop on g7. }
2... fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 { Again the main and most critical move. } 4... Nc6
{ After going through every possibilty that Black has in this position I can confidently state that this is not only the best move available for Black but also the most fun ! It is the main line. I have suggested other moves in the past, but the positions that can be reached after 4... Nc6 are just so much fun ! Let me convince you with some variations.   4...c6  Was my orginal suggestion for this course, and a move that I really wanted to make work  ! This idea has also been suggested on other websites and in other books; for example Glenn Flear gives it a '!' on the cutting edge theoretical opening site 'chess publishing'. It was then a rather nasty, yet eductional shock, when a Chessable reader pointed out that Black could be in trouble:  5.f3 !  d5  6.fxe4  dxe4  7.Bc4 !  and theoretically Black is in in trouble at the moment.  So, I did some more research  (here it is !)  and started to like the look of 4... Nc6, the main line. Here are my changes and suggested ways that Black now plays against the Staunton Gambit. I hope you agree with me that the following varations are a lot of fun and offer exciting ways for Black to play. }
5. d5 Ne5
{ The Knight will remain here until it is forced to move, then it will retreat to f7. }
6. Qd4
{ This is the old main line, but it has long been known that Black is comfortable after the following move: }
6... Nf7
{ The Knight retreats and forces White to make a decision about the Bishop on g5. }
7. Bxf6 { This is the main line. } 7... exf6 8. Nxe4 Be7
{ The safest, even though  8...f5  is also good. In these positions I really do not think that Black has anything to fear. The position is very solid and the dark-squared Bishop has great potential. In the long run it does seem that Black has all the positional trumps, that is why 6. Qe2 strikes me as a more scary try from White. }
9. O-O-O O-O
{ Black is ready to play ...f5, ...d6 and ...Bf6 with a great game. That is why White played }
10. Ng3 { This was played in Kravtsov vs Vyzmanavin, 1997, 0-1. } 10... d6
{ Renewing the 'threat' of ...f5. } 11. f4 c5
{ Here Black even played this daring move: time to open up lines towards White's King. }
12. Qc3 Nh6

1. d4
{ 1.Nf3  f5  2.e4 !?  The so-called Lisitsyn Gambit  (or the Pirc-Lisitsyn Gambit)  can be very dangerous if Black is unprepared. I am going to recommend a plan where Black returns the pawn in order to gain the initiative.  2...fxe4  3.Ng5  As mentioned earlier, this opening is similar to the From Gambit  (1 f4 e5 2 fxe5 d6)  . White is planning to play d2-d3 and if Black captures the pawn then White can obtain the initiative. Therefore, I would suggest that Black does not capture on d3 but instead plays:  3...Nc6 !?  This rarely-played move seems to be Black's simplest route to equality. It avoids a number of tricks and Black aims to gain a big centre. I prefer this move to ...Nf6, as Black can often attack the White Knight on g5 by playing ...Be7. This move would not be possible with a Knight on f6.  4.d3  e3 !  This is one of the main points behind Black's opening play. Black returns the pawn but stops White's light-squared Bishop from reaching the aggressive d3-square. In addition, Black will continue with ...e5, gaining space in the centre.  5.Bxe3  e5  Play has transposed to a variation that White can obtain after 3... e5 but by playing 3... Nc6, Black has limited White's options. In this position, White can choose from the following moves:  6.c4 !?  This move is a rather positional approach to the opening but it does make some sense. White strengthens his control of the centre and temporarily stops Black from playing ...d5. This approach is not too worrying for Black but he must ensure that he does not slip into too passive a position.   6.f4  This move is just a bit too wild ! Black needs to keep his calm and concentrate on the centre. For example, the game R.Levit-A.Zaitsev, USSR Team Championship 1962, continued:  exf4  7.Bxf4  Qf6  8.Qc1  d5  9.Nc3 ?   9.Be2  was a better move but Black really has nothing to fear after the simple  Bc5  9...Bb4  10.Bd2  Bc5  Black can claim a slight advantage.   6.Qh5+  This move does not achieve a lot. K.Robatsch-B.Larsen, Moscow Olympiad 1956 continued:  g6  7.Qf3  Qf6  An exchange of Queens would favour Black due to his strong centre.  8.Qg3  Nge7  9.Nc3  h6  10.Nge4  Qf7  11.Nb5  Nf5  12.Qf3  d5  Black has a big advantage.   6.g3  This is the safest way for White to play and this set-up does make a lot of sense. White wants to control the centre and especially the d5-square by playing moves like Bg2, c4 and Nc3.  Be7  It makes sense to develop in this way as Black puts extra pressure on White's Knight on g5.  You could also consider playing   6...Nf6  , but 6... Be7 looks more precise  7.Bg2 !  White does not need to protect the knight on g5. I have found one example of this move which was played in the game S.Simjanovski-E.Remete, European Individual Championship 2009.  Other options fail to impress and would give Black a very easy game, for example:   7.h4 ?!  seems pointless to me as Black will gain a very strong centre. For example,  Nf6  8.Bg2  d5  9.d4  Bg4  10.Qd2  h6  11.Nf3  when Black was better in M.Diaz-T.Friot, French Team Championship 2000   7.Bh3  d5  8.Ne6  Bxe6  9.Bxe6  Nf6  with an equal position. Black plans to play ...Qd6 and ...O-O when he has compensation for White's Bishop pair in the form of his strong centre  7...d5   7...Bxg5 ?!  is met by  8.Qh5+  when White will gain the Bishop pair with a small advantage. I do not see any reason why Black should not gain some space in the centre of the board  8.O-O   8.c4 ?  is premature since Black can stop White from castling by playing  Bb4+ !  8...Bf5 !  This allows Black to meet Qh5+ with ...Bg6 in some positions and Black has ideas of castling Queenside. Play could continue:  9.f4  Bxg5  10.fxg5  Nge7  The position is equal. Black has a nice control of the centre and will shortly manoeuvre his King to safety. On the other hand, White does have the Bishop pair.   6.Be2  This move actually helps Black as White no longer has the option to play Qh5+.  Be7 !  It would be silly to weaken Black's position on the light squares by playing ...h6, so instead Black aims to kick White's Knight away and develop a piece at the same time.  7.Nf3   7.f4 ?  exf4  8.Bh5+  g6  9.Nxh7  Ne5 !  and Black is winning   7.Bh5+ ?  g6  8.Nxh7  Kf7 !  9.Qf3+  Kg7  when White's Knight is stranded on h7   7.h4  Nf6  8.Bh5+  g6  9.Bf3  h6  10.Ne4  d5  when Black's control of the centre gives him the advantage  7...Nf6  8.d4  exd4  9.Nxd4  O-O  10.O-O  Nxd4  11.Bxd4  d5  With an equal position in A.Zude-C.Lutz, German Championship 1997.   6.d4 !?  This seems like a thematic move as it is a direct way of playing against Black's set-up. Black has to tread with care now but as long as he does, he will find himself with a good position. For example:  exd4  7.Bd3  Threatening 8 Qh5+.  Nf6   7...dxe3  is possible, but it does allow White to play Qh5+ and we cannot let our opponent have so much fun !  8.Bf4  Bb4+  9.c3  Qe7+  10.Kd2 !  White tries to mix things up.  dxc3+  11.bxc3  Bd6 !  this is an improvement on   11...O-O ?  12.Qb3+  d5  13.cxb4  which was rather embarrassing for Black in the game W.Richter-A.Hasse, Correspondence 1975  12.Bg3  Nd8 !  Black wants to move his Knight to e6 and then castle, thus giving him a good position. Black should be happy with the outcome of this opening.  6...Nf6  7.Nc3  Bb4 !  Thomas had remembered my first book well ! By playing 7. ..Bb4 ! Black insists on advancing with ...d5. I now had a long think and decided to play:  8.Nge4  White has also tried   8.Be2  but this does little to stop Black's plan of playing ...d5. Black quickly gained a good position in H.Pilaj-E.Berg, World U-18 Championship 1999, after  d5 !  9.cxd5  Nxd5  10.Nge4  O-O  11.O-O  Nf4  8...O-O  The idea behind 8 Nge4 was to stop Black from advancing with ...d5.   8...d5  now looks suspicious as White can play  9.Nxf6+  gxf6  10.Qh5+  with an attack  9.Be2  The position is roughly equal but let's see how things developed.  Nd4  Black tries to simplify matters.  10.O-O  Bxc3  11.bxc3  Nxe2+  12.Qxe2  Nxe4  13.dxe4  Qh4  14.f3  Black has little to fear as a move like ...Qe7 would hold the position together. }
1... f5 2. h3
{ Although the move h3 looks rather odd, it makes perfect sense for the following reason: Black has just played ...f5 which temporarily weakens the Kingside so White decides to act quickly in order to take advantage of this weakness. A plan involving g4 is sensible here as it will open more lines on the kingside.  As far as I am aware this line was introduced into play by Korchnoi, I recommend that Black strikes in the center. Meeting a wing attack with a central attack.   2.g4  If Black is well prepared then this advance should not work. It is important to remember to re-sacrifice the pawn with ...g3 after White has played h3.  fxg4  3.h3  against   3.e4  Black should counterattack with  e5 !  when he has nothing to fear, for example,  4.dxe5  Nc6  5.Qxg4  d6  3...g3 !  This important counter-sacrifice weakens White on the dark squares, especially g3. White would love to have his h-pawn firmly placed on h2 now !  4.fxg3  Nf6  5.Nc3  d5   2.f3 !?  This is a very rare move which may catch a few people out. It is worth considering if you want to play in a non-theoretical way against the Dutch.  e6 !?  the point behind White's play is that after   2...Nf6  White can gain the initiative by playing  3.e4  for example,  fxe4  4.fxe4  Nxe4  5.Bd3  d5  6.Nf3  Nc6  7.O-O  with an attack. As usual, I would prefer to avoid this sort of position for Black. It is much more fun to be the player who is doing all of the attacking !  3.e4  fxe4  4.Nd2  or   4.Nc3  Bb4 !  whilst White should definitely avoid playing   4.fxe4 ??  Qh4+  4...Nc6 !  5.Nxe4  Nf6  With an equal game.   2.Nf3  e6  3.e4 !?  Black has to tread carefully as this is a very dangerous sacrifice. I am going to recommend a line which I originally suggested in Play the Classical Dutch.   3.d5 !?  This is an interesting idea that disrupts Black's development.  exd5  This is my preferred approach. Black's pieces often gain some activity after this capture; however, you must be willing to sacrifice a pawn.  4.Qxd5  d6  5.Ng5  The most testing move.  White has also tried   5.g3 ?!  but this allows Black to develop without any problems; for example,  Nf6  6.Qd3 ?!  Na6  7.Bg2  Nc5  8.Qe3+  Be7  9.O-O  O-O  10.c4  Nfe4  and the position is equal.  5...Qe7  6.Nxh7  c6  Black can also reserve this square for his Knight on b8, for example,   6...Rxh7  7.Qxg8  Rh4  8.Qb3  Nc6  with good counter play.  7.Qb3  Rxh7  8.Qxg8  Rh4  In exchange for a pawn, Black has very active pieces and a good chance to generate a successful attack against White's King. For example:  9.Qb3  Na6  10.Qe3  Re4  11.Qd2  Nb4  12.Qd1  Rd4 !?  13.Nd2  f4  14.a3  Nd5  15.c3  Ne3 !?  16.fxe3  Qh4+  17.g3  fxg3  18.Bg2  gxh2+  19.Kf1  Qf6+  20.Ke1  Qh4+  21.Kf1  - A.Miles-A.Vaisser, Elista Olympiad 1998.  3...fxe4  4.Ng5  Nf6  5.f3  h6   5...c5 !?  Black counter attacking in the centre of the board, is a way to avoid being greedy.  6.Nh3  exf3 !?  7.Qxf3  Bd6 !  8.Nc3  O-O  9.Bd3  Nc6  =+  White's King is in a much danger as Blacks.   2.Qd3 !?  I have never had to face this yet however my recommendation is 2 .. e6  e6 !  is the move here.   2...g6 ?!  3.h4 !   2...d5  3.Bf4 !  Nf6  4.e3  e6  5.Nf3  c5   5...Be7  6.Be2  O-O  7.O-O  Ne4  8.h3  c5  6.c4 !   6.c3  Nc6  7.Nbd2  Be7 =  Bauer,C -Philippe,C Ajaccio 2007   2...d6 ?!  3.Nc3  3.e4 !?  In a match on chess.com I got the worse of it with Black.   3.c4  Nf6  4.Nf3  b6  5.Nc3  Bb7   3.g4  is still not very dangerous, but it does make more sense now than on move 2  fxg4   3...d5  4.gxf5  exf5  5.Bg2  4.h3  g3 !  the best, White cannot gain any development advantage   4...gxh3 ?!  5.Bxh3  is what White wants   5.Nxh3  may be even better  5.Qxg3   5.fxg3  d5  6.Bf4  c5  7.e3  Nc6  8.Nf3  Nf6  =+  Kortschnoj,V -Volokitin,A Novi Sad 2009  5...Nf6  6.Nf3  c5  7.Nc3 !   7.c3  Nc6  8.Bg2  d5  9.Ne5   9.Nbd2  Bd6  10.Ne5   10.Qxg7 ??

2... h6

{ Has always been one of the most worrying moves for me and I still think that it is a good option for White. I will though, hopefully convince you, that Black is fine after ...h6 and ...g5 advancing on the Kingside. }
2... h6
{ A 'kick' move. With 2... h6 Black is basically saying, 'You will not come into my territory !'  If you are looking for something more solid, then I can suggest   2...Nf6  Black allows White to double his pawns in the hope that his two Bishops will spring to life later on. With careful play, this line should offer Black an equal game. I won't delve too deeply into the variations, as I have already mentioned that this type of position is very solid. Let's take a look at two examples of this.  3.Bxf6  is the most natural move.   3.e3  . This kind of approach can hardly be dangerous. I.Sokolov-S.Agdestein, Oslo 1996, continued  e6  4.Bd3  Be7  5.Ne2  O-O  6.O-O  Nd5 !?  7.Bxe7  Qxe7  8.a3  Nf6  and Black has a very comfortable position. He can either aim to take control of e4 by playing ...b6 and ...Bb7, or he can consider the standard plan of ...d6 followed by ...e5.  3...exf6  4.e3  g6  (this is a solid way to give extra protection to Black's pawn chain)  5.h4  d5  (Black relies on this move in order to take firm control of the centre)  6.c4  Be6  7.cxd5  Bxd5  8.Nc3  Nc6  9.Nge2  Bf7  10.g3  Bd6  11.Bg2  O-O  12.a3  Ne7  13.Nf4  c6  14.Nd3  a5  15.Qc2  Qb6  16.O-O  Bb3  . Black has a very pleasant position with no weaknesses. Furthermore, he also has the option to play ...c5. We have been following the game A.Grischuk-A.Moiseenko, Russian Team Championship 2005. }
3. Bh4
{ We now have a rather strange situation. White's Bishop is in danger of being trapped but in doing so, it will weaken Black's King. Saying that, we are brave Dutch defence players so we must play the most critical variation !  Or:   3.Bc1 !?  An idea of English Grandmaster, Stephen Gordon. White has lost some tempo but places his Bishop on the safest square, figuring that the move 2... h6 has just weakened Black's light squares too much. This is certainly an interesting idea, but I do not believe that it should give White any advantage. Black can now take more control of the center with ...Nf6  Nf6  developing a piece and stopping any annoying checks on h5.  4.e3  seems to be the biggest test. White is aiming to jump into the weakened light squares, especially the hole on h5 with the Bishop on f1.  e6 !?  allowing the check on h5 and continuing in unique fashion...  5.Be2  consistent, White aims for a disruptive check on h5.  Bd6 !?  a rather peculiar square for Bishop, but we also see the Bishop finding this square in lines against the London System.  6.Bh5+  otherwise Black will castle  Ke7  7.Nc3  g5 !  one of the advantages of the 2..h6 systems is this push. Black gains space, but in this case also threatens to win a piece with ...g4. When the light square Bishop will be trapped.  8.Be2  to avoid ...g4  b6  developing the Bishop to a good square on b7. A very weird position ! Black's king seems to be in a terrible situation but it remains quite solid behind the central pawns. We must also consider where White will find safety for his King. If White castles Kingside it runs into a ready made pawn storm, and it is very hard to castle Queenside here. There is a traffic jam of pieces in the way. All in all, this position remains equal and interesting.   3.Bf4 !?  Is a rare yet very logical move. White is trying to prove with this loss of tempo that Black's ...h6 move is really just a weakening move. Weakening the light squares, especially g6. Black does not need to panic though as the gain of tempo he will receive when playing ...e5 or sometimes ...g5 can guarantee him a decent game. I would suggest that Black should play moves such as ...e6 ...d6 and then prepare ..e5.  Nf6  4.Nc3  A logical developing move.   4.e3  White opens the window for his Queen on d1. This could well be critical and now Black has to play in a very imaginative manner to maintain equality.  e6 !?  our 'normal' move, but in this case with a strange idea attached...  5.Be2  White see's the weakened light squares and aims for them ! Bh5+ is now the main concern for Black.   5.c4  allows Black to play  Bb4+ =  as White can no longer block the check with c3. Black has already gained equality as he will castle next with no problems.   5.h4 !?  makes some sense, trying to play h5 and take a grip of the g6 square.  Be7  Originally I wanted to try and play ... g6 as to meet h5 with ...g5, but this idea simply left the pawn on g6 to weak. It is better to play like this, ignore White's plan on the Kingside and aim to counter in the center as quickly as possible.  6.h5  otherwise why h4 !? White is pinning his hopes on occupying the g6 square, but Black can play around this  d6  aiming to play ...e5 as quickly as possible. Every tempo counts !  7.Nf3  Ng4 !  A strange looking yet logical move. Black no longer has to fear the move h3, so this makes sense. The two important roles this move does are: 1. Protect the h4 square. This stops White's intended plan of Nh4 and Ng6. 2. Start preparing the ...e5 break. With ...Nd7  (be careful of ..Nc6 as White has d5)  ...Bf6 to follow or ...Qe8 etc. White wont be able to stop this logical push.  8.Nc3  developing in a sensible way.  O-O  9.Be2  Bf6  preparing ...e5  10.O-O  Qe8 ! =  why not place the Queen on a natural square that attacks White's pawn and prepares ...e5 !? The position is equal, White has enough development to not be in any real danger. On the other hand Black has a number of things to be happy about.   5.Bd3  is a standard developing move. I would suggest that Black sticks to a plan of aiming for ... e5 here, with the move  d6  6.Nf3  g5 !  why not !? Now that there is no danger of White sneaking in a check on h5 this move seems very logical.  7.Bg3  Bg7  with an equal game. Black can castle, develop normally and in a dream world play ...e5 and ...f4.  5...d6  N  It takes a brave man to play such a move ! With this the Black King has to take a trip, but Black is banking of the fact that he will gain some tempo by eventually breaking with ...e5.  6.Bh5+  the only logical way to play.  Nxh5  7.Qxh5+  Kd7 !  a weird and wonderful idea of Roeland's ! Magnus Carlsen would be proud. I know this looks all wrong but after studying this chapter you will become accustomed to this idea. The idea of moving the King, yet keeping control of the center.  8.h4  otherwise Black will play ...g5 at some point gaining some valuable space.  Qe8  it is best to kick the White Queen away. An exchange of Queens will help Black as then the loss of castling rights means nothing.  9.Qf3  stopping ideas of .. b6.  Kd8  such a fun idea to play ! The King and Queen swap places, there is an actual opening name for that, which I am not going to mention here. This position does require practical test, but my chess engine does approve of Black's creative play.  10.Ne2  e5 !?  And why not ! I am going to stick my neck out and say this is equal. Black has moved his King yet gained counterplay by taking control of the center. Black can aim to push forwards with ..e4 or simple continue developing his bits.  4...e6  the safest option. Black plans to develop the Bishop on f8 and castle quickly. I was tempted with ...g5 but it looked far too loosening. This approach is sensible and equal.  5.e3  Bb4  this is often a good square for the Bishop when White has placed a Knight on c3. Black has the lingering idea of doubling White's pawns with ... Bxc3.  6.Bd3  d6  with the standard idea of preparing ...e5. This is so often a good plan in this line as when ...e5 is played it will gain a tempo by attacking White's Bishop on f4.  7.Nge2  O-O  8.O-O  Nc6  and ...e5 will follow with an equal game. }
3... g5
{ Off we go ! This brave move must be played ! Yes the Black King becomes weak but Black also gains space and threats on the Kingside. }
4. e4
{ The most aggressive and dangerous move. We must now trod with fear.  White can also play safe with the less aggressive   4.e3  when Black should respond by stopping the check  Nf6  5.Bg3  d6  Aiming for an eventual ...e5.  6.h4  It makes sense for White to play this. White is trying to force Black into moving a Kingside pawn and in the process make a minor concession   6.Be2  is not a problem. As we have seen against 3 Bf4 we can often move our King in this variation. For example,  e6 !?  creating a nice fortress of pawns in the center of the board.  7.Bh5+  Nxh5 !  the simplest solution, Black exchanges some wood off  (or plastic !?)  making any threat to his King less dangerous. After all, in order to checkmate, one needs pieces !  8.Qxh5+  Kd7 !  the 'standard' square for the Black King once it is checked.  9.Nc3  Qe8 ! =  This is the way for Black to arrange his pieces. When I would say the Black King is safe, after all, it has a mountain of pawns in front of it to defend it. The position is equal. Black has misplaced his King, yet gained a space advantage.  6...Rg8  maintains some squares on the Kingside. I prefer this to ...g4 which creates a hole on f4. A hole that White's Knight on g1 can head towards.  7.hxg5  hxg5  Black aims to play: ... Nc6 ...Qe7... Bd7, or with ...a6 ...Bb7 ... Nbd7. And finally O-O-O. Lets just take one look at a game in this, so as not to confuse ourselves.  8.c4 !?  gaining some territory on the Queenside.  Na6 !?  I am not sure this is entirely necessary, but it is an interesting idea. Black wants to play ...c5 and then bring the Queen out to attack White's Queenside. 8... c6 !? would be a more refrained way of trying to achieve the same plan.  9.Nc3  c5 !?  here it is, Black's aggressive idea.  10.Be2 ?!  this seems a little passive and Black must now be doing fine.  Qb6 !  the main idea. From b6 the Queen places pressure on b2 and d4.  11.Qd2  defending b2.  cxd4 !  the main aim of this move is to divert White's pawn on e3. As then ...f4 becomes possible.  12.exd4  f4  →  Black's position was to be preferred in Urkedal,F -Vovk,A Fagernes NOR 2016. With ...Bf5 and ...Rc8 to follow Black had gained great activity for his pieces, whilst locking in some of White's pieces. }
4... Nf6
{ The best and simplest move to learn !   4...Rh7 !?  was an old suggestion of mine, but it does seem that we get attacked in numerous variations here !   4...Bg7 ?!  is a main line, but I do not like it because of the following complex variation.  5.Bg3  fxe4   5...f4 ?!  falls into a trap  6.Bxf4  gxf4  7.Qh5+  Kf8  8.Qf5+  Nf6   8...Ke8  9.Be2 !  ±  9.e5  +=  6.h4  d5  7.hxg5  Nc6   7...hxg5 ?  8.Rxh8  Bxh8  9.Qh5+  8.Bb5  e6   8...Bf5  9.Be5 !   9.Qh5+ ?

Kd7  11.Be5  hxg5  12.Qxh8 !  now looks very strong.

5. e5
{ 5.Bg3 ?  is too meek and Black can gain a useful pawn advantage after the simple  fxe4   5.Be2 ?!  is often an idea that White might try, but here Black just needs to avoid getting mated on h5 with 5... e6 when Black will the Bishop on h4 leaving White with insufficient compensation.  e6 }
5... e6
{ Black wants to capture back on f6 with the Queen and not a pawn. It is important to remember in this variation to not to be in a rush to snap the White Bishop on h4 off the board. The Bishop is not going anywhere, and it is better to develop some pieces first }
6. Bg3 { 6.exf6  Qxf6  7.Bg3   7.Qh5+  Qf7  7...f4  Transposes } 6... f4
{ Trapping the White Bishop for good ! There a number of options for White here, in what is an extremely complex situation. }
7. Bd3
{ A good developing move, Black is often advised to not be in a rush to grab the Bishop on g3 in this line. Only capture it when needed. There are other options though and things can get quite complex. For that reason, let's try to verbally explain what Black is trying to achieve here. 1  Avoid getting checkmated :  2  Give the Black King some space to move to. This can be done by playing ...d5 and ...c5. 3  Attack White's center, with ...d5 and ...c5. 4  Do not be in a rush to capture White's Bishop on g3. It is not running away and capturing it will open up the Rook on h1.   7.Bxf4 ?!  is a little premature  gxf4  8.exf6   8.Bd3  d5  Transposes to 7. Bd3  8...Qxf6  9.Qh5+   9.Nc3  is a sensible developing move, when Black should reply in kind.  Nc6  d4 is often a pawn to target.  10.Nb5 !?  Kd8  the King often moves here anyway, so this is not such a concern.  11.Nf3  a6  away !!  12.Nc3  Bg7  =+  again hitting d4. Black's position is to be preferred, he has a strong pawn mass and pressure against the center.  9...Qf7  an exchange of Queens should help Black as his King is more exposed.  10.Qxf7+  Kxf7  with an equal position. I would take Black due to the Bishop pair and stronger pawn center.   7.exf6  seems a little premature and rushed. Yes, White wins the piece back but in the process loses a lot of the potential that his position had. The pawn on e5 did a great job a restricting Black's position.  Qxf6  8.Bd3  Nc6  developing and attacking.  9.Qh5+  Kd8  10.Nf3  Nxd4 !  It is best to be brave. That is actually a tag line for the Dutch as an opening !  11.Nxd4  Qxd4  Black has won a pawn, and I would say that his King is still fairly safe. It does have a shield of pawns in front of it !  12.O-O  aiming for quick development, at any cost.  fxg3  it is time to capture the Bishop, as now hxg3 does not open up the Rook on h1. That Rook has moved.  13.hxg3  Qxb2 !?  Thank you ! Best to be brave... It is now clear that White must checkmate, anything else will lead to a winning material edge for Black.  14.Nd2  d5  A rather messy position where I would take Black. White has good practical chances but a computer would always win as Black. Black should aim to continue by developing the Bishops. To d6 and d7, and then using the extra pawns to roll forwards ...e5 ...e4 etc. }
7... d5
{ This is a must ! The Black King needs the d7 square. It is also important to take a firm grip in the center of the board. }

{ I would consider this to be critical. It is funny how both sides are not in a hurry to capture their opponent's minor pieces, it is more important to maintain the pressure. With this move White aims to move some of his pieces, mainly the Knight on g1, into the weakened squares on the Kingside.   8.exf6  is a logical looking move, yet it does release the tension a bit soon. Now Black has the f6 and d6 squares available for his pieces. With correct play Black should have nothing to fear.  Qxf6  9.Qh5+  White had a number of other options but this check looks very logical. Why not force the opponent to move his King  Kd8  the idea is to eventually play ...c5 and shuffle the Black King to c7.  10.Nf3  developing and looking at the placing the Knight on the e5 square.  Nc6  controlling e5 and placing pressure against White's center. This is where Black's counterplay comes from, it comes from pressure in the middle of the board.  11.c3  White is advised to defend d4.   11.O-O ?!  is a very risky move. White throws away his center in the hope of quick development and a quick attack. Black has sufficient resources though.  Nxd4  and why not !  12.Nbd2  Bd6  a good solid square. We can see that Black's pieces have a lot of freedom, now that there is no pawn on e5 controlling some squares.  13.h4  White needs to try and open up the position in the attempt at creating some attacking chances. Otherwise White will be lacking any compensation.  fxg3  it is now correct to capture the Bishop. Otherwise White would be able to keep it, by manoeuvring it to h2.  14.fxg3  this position may look a bit dangerous for Black, with the open f-file etc., but White doesn't actually have any threats as the next move demonstrates.  Bd7 !  a simple developing move, that gives options of hitting the White Queen with ...Be8.  15.Nxg5 ?  just simply doesn't work.   15.Rae1  bringing the last White piece into the game is a better try but Black is doing very well after  Nxf3+  it is often a good idea to make exchanges when being material up.  16.Nxf3  Qg7  moving off the f-file with a great position. The Black King is well defended and White has no obvious way to create any attacking chances.  15...hxg5 !  when Black is winning.  11...e5 !  is a very logical and aggressive move. Black opens the position, which could be a bit risky whilst the King remains on d8, but in this case it is more important to free the Black pieces.  12.dxe5  this pawn must be captured as ...e4 was a threat.  Nxe5  13.Nxe5  Qxe5+  and now White should move his King  14.Kd1  Bd6 =  with an equal game. Black is ready to play ...c6 and ...Kc7 when his King is very well protected. Better protected then the White King !   8.Bg6+  doesn't make much sense now. The Black King will likely have to move anyway and the White Bishop on g6 is now rather exposed.  Kd7  we can now see why it was important to have played 7... d5. The Black King has move space to walk into.  9.exf6  Qxf6 =  and White will have to lose a tempo by moving the Bishop on g6. Black has a good game, the plan will be to attack d4 and finish developing. }
8... gxf4 9. Nh3
{ As far as I can tell this is a Novelty and a very interesting one for White. The Knight brings itself into the battle via f4. The following positions are very exciting and still rather unclear. I have checked everything with Komodo 10 who assures me that Black is fine, but you do need to have nerves of steel to play this line as Black ! Saying that, if you do not have nerves of steel why are playing the Dutch opening !?   9.exf6  is a move that rarely should worry Black.  Qxf6  10.Qh5+  Kd8  11.Nf3  Nc6  we have seen this theme before. Black develops and attacks the center.  12.c3  Rg8  using the open g-file. Black's pieces have great potential.  13.O-O  Bd6 =  Who is attacking who ? In actual fact it seems to me that Black has very good chances against the White King with the open g-file. Again this is another example of a variation in this course that is unexplored, I hope that is something that excites you rather than scares you !  (even though being scared a bit is probably a good thing, it keeps you alive !)  Let's chat a bit about some of the main ideas Black has in this position. 1. One very important idea here is ...e5 ! This opens the position more, so is risky to both Kings. One of the main ideas with ...e5 is to develop the light square Bishop. ...Bg4 ! being the obvious square. 2. If opening things up is too scary an idea then you can play in a more cautious manner with ...Bd7 and ...Be8 ! 3. ...Qg7 g3 ...fxg3 hxg3 ...Bxg3 ! be careful when playing this though as White does not have to capture on g3 but can play Kg1 sacrificing a pawn and then continuing with Rg1 gaining great play down the g-file.  14.Nbd2  the most obvious developing move  Qg7  With 'an idea'.  15.g3  e5 !   15...fxg3  16.hxg3  Bxg3  17.Kh1 !  hands the attack over to White.  16.Nxe5   16.dxe5 ?  Bg4 !  Nxe5  17.dxe5  Bg4  18.Qg6   forced as  18.Qh4+  runs into  ...Be7  trapping the Queen  Bxe5  with an equal game. }
9... c5
{ Giving our King more space on c7, whilst attacking the center of the board. }
10. Nxf4
{ Bringing the Knight into the action.   10.exf6  gives Black a rather free hand, as now the Queen can develop via f6 and the dark square Bishop via d6.  Qxf6  11.Qh5+  Kd8  ∞  Black is better. The King will sit safely on c7 and Black's minor pieces have good squares to move to ...Nc6 ...Bd6 and ...Bd7. As so often in this variation Black also benefits from having more pawns in the center of the board. }
10... cxd4 11. O-O
{ Logically developing quickly.   11.exf6  again frees Black's position.  Qxf6  12.Qh5+  Kd8  13.Ng6  Bb4+ !  saving the dark square Bishop and creating problems for the White King.  14.c3  other options allow ...Rg8 with a fine game for Black.  dxc3  15.Nxc3  Bxc3+  this is not forced but why not capture a pawn and force the opposing King to run !?  16.bxc3  Qxc3+  17.Ke2  Qb2+  The White King must now take another step forwards.  18.Ke3  Qb6+  with an immensely complicated position where Black is not worse. A number of these variations have taken me a long time to prepare, simply for the fact that it is all new material, material that has yet to tried in any real games. As you have now seen the ideas, you should now have an advantage over your opponents !  19.Kf3  otherwise Black has at least a draw.  Qd4 !  a key move, activating the Queen. Black will follow up with ... Qf6+ ...Rg8 and hopefully ...Nc6 to e5 or d4. My computer gives this position as equal, and what an exciting battle lies ahead ! }
11... Ne4
{ Is very good analysis that was shown to me by GM Roeland Pruijssers. Why does Black play this move ? It is simple really, this saves the extra piece ! Yes, White will now gain an attack but if the attack fails Black will win because of his extra material. A do or die situation that has very few practical tests, I think a fair assessment of this position is 'dynamically equal'. Both sides have there pluses and White probably has enough energy in the position to keep some compensation. This is all new analysis, and that is something that is both scary and exciting. Two emotions you will get used to when playing the Dutch... }
12. Qh5+
{ Now that White can not win his piece back it is time to start checking the Black King. Luckily for Black, he has prepared for this eventuality with the moves ...d5 ! and ...c5 ! Both of these pawn moves have not just attacked White's center, but also given the Black King an escape route.   12.f3 ?  blocks the White Queen in and after  Nc5  Black's position is to be preferred. The Queen will come to g5 and Black will be able to start an attack against the pawn on e5 and White's King down the g-file.   12.Bxe4  eliminates the Knight and leads to some crazy positions..  dxe4  13.Qh5+  it is time to chase the Black King. Black would otherwise play ...Qg5 and stop this check.  Kd7  14.c3   14.Rd1 ?!  seems logical, but it also helps move Black's King in the right direction.  Kc7  often the safest square for the King in these variations.  15.Nc3  Nc6  Komodo 12 prefers Black here, but the position remains very complex. It does seem that as long as Black can keep his pawn on d4 it will be hard for White to break through. What ideas would Black be trying to achieve here ? 1. If given a chance try to play ...Qg5. An exchange of Queens will only improve Black's chances. This is because the Black King is in more danger than White's King, so get rid of White's most powerful piece. In the ending, Black's two Bishops should come in power. 2. The Black King should hid on b8. This does block the Rook on a8 in but Black can create enough counterplay with his other pieces. 3. Develop both Bishops. One to d7 and the other to e7 or g7. 4. Use the g-file. ...Rg8 activates another Black piece. All in all a very exciting and fresh position. I would like to see more games in this line and according to my research I will be taking the side of the Black pieces, thank you !   14.Nd2  Kc7  15.Nxe4  Nc6  ∞  14...Nc6   14...d3 !?  15.Nd2  Qg5  should also suffice  15.cxd4  Kc7   15...Qg5 !?  16.Nc3  Kb8   16...Bb4  17.Rad1  a5  ∞  An interesting position and fun to play for either side. 2 Bg5 h6 3 Bh4 g5 4 e4 GingerGM }
12... Kd7 13. c4
{ A logical move from White. This is what I call a 'crowbar' move. c4 is aimed at opening up the center of the board, as that is where Black's King resides. Pawns are often useful 'crowbars' as they cost little and can be sacrificed for the greater gain. }
13... dxc3
{ Black had to decide which d-pawn to keep. It makes sense to leave the pawn on d5, this pawn is the Black King's main defender. This pawn is supported well by its brother on e6, which creates a mini pawn chain. A line of defence that Black must rely on. }
14. Nxc3 Nxc3
{ This is now forced as otherwise White would have captured on e4. A capture on e4 would force Black to play ...dxe4 exposing the King on the d-file. }
15. bxc3 Kc7
{ Finally the Black King finds some safety ! What a crazy line ! This has never been reached in a competitive game yet, but I am confident about Black's chances. Black has the following ideas: 1  Develop the Queenside and castle 'by hand'. This can be done by playing ...Nc6 ...Bd7  (or ...b6 and ...Bb7)  ...Rc8 and ...Kb8 2  Use the Black Queen. A move such as ...Qg5 looks appealing but we must watch out for White's reply Qf7 !+.  even though we can then reply ...Qe7, which may lead to an immediate draw by repetition after Qh5 ...Qg5 etc  A better square looks like g7, so ...Qe7 and . ..Qg7 is a good way to attack the White pawn on e5 and prepare play down the g-file. 3  Keep the center as closed as possible. If White ever tries c4 we should reply with ...d4 ! The more lines towards our King we keep closed, the safer our position becomes. My chess engine  (Komodo 12)  gives this position as being slightly better for  (-0.32)  , which must be a good sign ! }

{ An idea of English Grandmaster, Stephen Gordon.

{ Developing the Bishop to a good square on b7. A very weird position ! Black's king seems to be in a terrible situation but it remains quite solid behind the central pawns. We must also consider where White will find safety for his King. If White castles Kingside it runs into a ready made pawn storm, and it is very hard to castle Queenside here. There is a traffic jam of pieces in the way. All in all, this position remains equal and interesting. }

9. Nc3 Qe8
{ This is the way for Black to arrange his pieces. When I would say the Black King is safe, after all, it has a mountain of pawns in front of it to defend it. The position is equal. Black has misplaced his King, yet gained a space advantage. }

This opens the position more, so is risky to both Kings. One of the main ideas with ...e5 is to develop the light square Bishop. ...Bg4 ! being the obvious square. 2  If opening things up is too scary an idea then you can play in a more cautious manner with ...Bd7 and ...Be8 ! 3  ...Qg7 g3 ...fxg3 hxg3 ...Bxg3 ! be careful when playing this though as White does not have to capture on g3 but can play Kg1 sacrificing a pawn and then continuing with Rg1 gaining great play down the g-file. }

A do or die situation that has very few practical tests, I think a fair assessment of this position is 'dynamically equal'. Both sides have there pluses and White probably has enough energy in the position to keep some compensation. This is all new analysis, and that is something that is both scary and exciting.

{ Komodo 12 prefers Black here, but the position remains very complex. It does seem that as long as Black can keep his pawn on d4 it will be hard for White to break through. What ideas would Black be trying to achieve here ? 1  If given a chance try to play ...Qg5. An exchange of Queens will only improve Black's chances. This is because the Black King is in more danger than White's King, so get rid of White's most powerful piece. In the ending, Black's two Bishops should come in power. 2  The Black King should hid on b8. This does block the Rook on a8 in but Black can create enough counterplay with his other pieces. 3  Develop both Bishops. One to d7 and the other to e7 or g7. 4  Use the g-file. ...Rg8 activates another Black piece. All in all a very exciting and fresh position. I would like to see more games in this line and according to my research I will be taking the side of the Black pieces, thank you ! }

{ Now that White can not win his piece back it is time to start checking the Black King. Luckily for Black, he has prepared for this eventuality with the moves ...d5 ! and ...c5 ! Both of these pawn moves have not just attacked White's center, but also given the Black King an escape route. }
12... Kd7 13. c4
{ A logical move from White. This is what I call a 'crowbar' move. c4 is aimed at opening up the center of the board, as that is where Black's King resides. Pawns are often useful 'crowbars' as they cost little and can be sacrificed for the greater gain. }
13... dxc3
{ Black had to decide which d-pawn to keep. It makes sense to leave the pawn on d5, this pawn is the Black Kings main defender. This pawn is supported well by its brother on e6, which creates a mini pawn chain. A line of defence that Black must rely on. }
14. Nxc3 Nxc3
{ This is now forced as otherwise White would have captured on e4. A capture on e4 would force Black to play ...dxe4 exposing the King on the d-file. }
15. bxc3 Kc7
{ Finally the Black King finds some safety ! What a crazy line ! This has never been reached in a competitive game yet, but I am confident about Black's chances. Black has the following ideas: 1  Develop the Queenside and castle 'by hand'. This can be done by playing ...Nc6 ...Bd7  (or ...b6 and ...Bb7)  ...Rc8 and ...Kb8 2  Use the Black Queen. A move such as ...Qg5 looks appealing but we must watch out for White's reply Qf7 !+.  even though we can then reply ...Qe7, which may lead to an immediate draw by repetition after Qh5 ...Qg5 etc  A better square looks like g7, so ...Qe7 and . ..Qg7 is a good way to attack the White pawn on e5 and prepare play down the g-file. 3  Keep the center as closed as possible. If White ever tries c4 we should reply with ...d4 ! The more lines towards our King we keep closed, the safer our position becomes. My chess engine  (Komodo 12)  gives this position as being slightly better for  (-0.32)  , which must be a good sign ! }

When the Knight on c3 moves, White will also be able to play the pawn break c4 in some positions.   It is always a good idea to give yourself more options of pawn breaks, even if you do not play them it gives your opponent something to think about! }
9... O-O 10. Ne2
{ White continues with his plan. Without this idea it is not clear what White does, whilst Black with move his Queen to either c7 or e8 and then aim to plonk the Knight on f6 into e4, a great square for the Black Knight. }

{ Sensible development and with possible ideas of playing ...Nb4 at the right moment. }
11. Bf4
{ This makes positional sense and we see similar ideas being played in other opening variations.   the Tarrasch French with  3...Nf6  springs to my mind  White is aiming to exchange the Black pieces that control the outpost on e5, in this case Black's dark square Bishop on d6.   We do not need to fear this though as Black has his own squares to enjoy, mainly e4! }
11... Bxf4 12. Nxf4 { and now I like } 12... Ne4
{ A lovely central square for the Knight and Black also prepares to move the Queen to f6.   The Queen is well placed on f6 from where it controls some key central squares e5 and d4. Black is also preparing a very aggressive idea... }
13. c4
{ Now that White is placing d5 under some pressure it makes sense for Black to keep his Queen in range of the d5 pawn. }
13... Qd6
{ Attacking White's Knight and preparing the following middlegame plan.  1  ...Bd7 ...Be8 ...Bh5  (again a standard idea in the French Defence)   2  ...g5! with ...g4 or even ...f4 to come.  3  The Rook Swing! ...Rf6 ...Rh6 taking aim at the h2 pawn.  I would prefer Black's position here. }

{ What happens in this game is a very common occurrence for me. White plays his Reti set up, without any concern to what Black is doing. Black builds up a big attack and BANG ! Make sure you become aware of my plans in this game as they will really help you to many victories. }
1. Nf3 f5 2. d3 Nc6 3. g3
{ A scared move. I already think that Black is equal and I even prefer being Black in these set ups. Things are like a reversed Grand Prix attack where White's King is target number one. }

8. Bg5
{ White wants to eliminate the Knight on f6 and gain more control of the d5 square. Other options are looked at in the theory section. }
8... f4
{ interesting inspiration over the board. In the future I would probably play   8...Ng4  though, which is a new move. Maintaining my Knight for later, for example  9.Bxe7  Nxe7  10.h3  Nf6  11.c5  Kh8  12.Rc1  h6 =   8...h6  9.Bxf6  Bxf6 =  is also very sensible with ...g5 coming. }
9. Rb1
{ 9.gxf4  was critical, I assumed that I would get great compensation after something like  Nh5  10.Bxe7  Nxe7  11.fxe5  Nf4 !  when White has to be very careful. This still looks like a very nice attacking position for Black to me. }
9... Ng4 10. Bxe7 Nxe7 { I was very happy here. } 11. d4 fxg3

16. Qxd5+ Kh8 17. Rbd1 c6 18. Qc5 Bf5
{ White may just about be ok here, but there is always going to be a looming threat around his King and in the game he felt the pressure. }
19. e4 Be6
{ My main idea is to distract the Queen away from f2 and then play ...Rxf3 ! }
20. Rd2 Rae8 21. Qxa7 { A massive blunder   21.b3  was best } 21... Rxf3 *

[Black "Theory 1: 1. Nf3 f5 2. d3 Nc6! 3. e4 e5!"]
[Result "*"]

1. Nf3
{ A starting move for the Reti opening. One of the most commonly played openings. I have always enjoyed playing the Dutch against 1 Nf3. The main reason for this is that Black will often be able to play ...e5 without a fight, and then start one of our normal attacks against the White King. Saying that, White has a number of ways to try and unsettle us early on, the main attempt being 2 d3. We must learn some theory, then we can face the future with confidence. }
1... f5
{ You should push this pawn with confidence ! I have found that White can already fall into the wrong mindset after facing 1... f5, as my game with Glenn House shows. When playing 1 Nf3 White often has an idea about what his first ten moves will be, and playing them in a blind manner against a typical Dutch set up with ...e5 can put White on the backfoot immediately. }
2. d3
{ This move was made trendy by a certain Magnus Carlsen. White aims to play e4 and challenge Black in the center. I love it when White plays in a quieter manner with g3, as you can see from my game against Glenn House. }
2... Nc6
{ This is another very exciting way of playing against 2 d3. Black's main idea is to advance in the centre with ... e5 ! Some of the following variations remind me of the King's Gambit, which is quite crazy as the Classical Dutch hardly ever resembles the King's Gambit ! Currently, 2... Nc6 is doing very well from a theoretical point of view and this would be my suggested way that you play against 2 d3. Moskalenko also takes a look at this move in his excellent book on the Dutch, 'The Diamond Dutch'. 2... d6 used to be a favourite of mine, but I have lost confidence in it now. White has two sensible ways of playing against 2... Nc6 !? }
3. e4
{ This is certainly the most dangerous move and Black must be well pre-paired from this position. On the plus side, so must White ! Things can become quite critical and one bad move will often leave either side struggling. Both sides will now aggressively fight for control of the center.   3.d4 !?  is a weird move. Losing a tempo to try and prove that the Knight is bad on c6, as now White has ideas of playing d5 harassing that Knight. I am rather doubtful about how good this plan is though, as we will see that even when White achieves his plan of playing d4-d5 Black has equality.  e6  This move keeps the position dynamic, and it also fits into our Classical Dutch set up. 3... d5 is also possible, but you have to be willing to play a Stonewall Dutch then.  4.g3  This set-up with d3-d4 and g3 maybe the best way for White to try and achieve something from the opening. White is waiting to play c4 and then d5. White is waiting as to avoid an annoying ...Bb4+, which is the correct response against an immediate c4.   4.c4  trying to force the move d5 looks like the most logical plan, otherwise it must be asked why White has lost a tempo.  Nf6  standard development, allowing White to achieve his aim of playing d5.  5.d5  the most critical, this has been White's plan all along.   5.g3  is rather slow  Bb4+ !  the general rule in this variation where White has lost a tempo with d3-d4, is to play ...Bb4+ when given a chance.  6.Nbd2  hoping to play a3 and gain the Bishop pair, but also creating a traffic jam of White pieces.   6.Bd2  is a more forcing move, Black has nothing to fear after  Bxd2+  7.Qxd2  keeping c3 for the Knight.  O-O  8.Nc3  d6  Black is now ready to gain a great game with ...e5 against most moves. To stop this White can try  9.d5  but now Black has a strong and exciting reply  Ne4 !?  10.Nxe4   10.Qc1  is rather passive, Black can answer this is a couple of good ways.  exd5  11.cxd5  Nb4  →  being the most active. When the threat of ...Nxc3 and ...Nxd5 is hard to stop. Black is pushing for the advantage in this position.  10...fxe4  11.dxc6  exf3 =  with an equal and interesting game. Black will gain a strong center after  12.exf3  bxc6  with ...e5 to follow I prefer Black's position.  6...O-O  7.Bg2  d5 !?  in this case I fully approve of this idea. Black simply plays in the center and prepares to play ...Ne4 with a good game. For example,  8.O-O  Ne4 !  9.c5 !  seems best, threatening to trap the Bishop on b4 in some lines and gaining Queenside space. Black can maintain equality with   9.e3 !?  is a restrained way of playing, but rather slow. I would now take the time to gain Queenside space with  a5  stopping any ideas White had of ever playing a3 and b4. Black can now decide whether to develop the light square Bishop via ... b6 and ...Ba6 or to the Kingside with ...Bd7 ...Be8 and ...Bh5.  10.c5 ?!  is now a bit slow and should be met with  b6 !  when Black takes the initiative on the Queenside.   9.cxd5 ?!  has been tried before, but this move takes the tension out of the position and with it any chance White had of gaining an advantage.  exd5  10.a3  Be7  ...Bd6 loses a pawn to Qb3.  11.Nb3  a5 !  this is so often a good move in the Dutch !  12.a4  b6  =+  1/2-1/2 Bukavshin,I -Bernadskiy,V St Petersburg 2014 I prefer Black's position. Black has a beautiful Knight on e4 and another Knight maybe jumping into b4. A long term plan would be something like ...Nb4 ...Be6 and then to use the Queenside pawn majority with ...c5 !  9...Bxd2 !  this should be played before White has chance to play Nb1 ! When a3 would trap the Bishop on b4.  10.Bxd2  b6  hitting out against White's pawn structure and allowing ...Ba6 in some cases.  11.cxb6   11.b4  is met with  11...Qf6  12.e3  Ba6  with equality.  axb6  Black now has the better pawn structure, which is always pleasant !  12.h4  to secure the f4 and g5 square. White had other options but this move looks sensible. Black's general plan now is to use his better pawn structure in aiming to play ...c5. This can come after positioning the pieces correctly.  Qe7  A good central square for the Queen.  13.Bf4 !  one of the reasons for playing h4, now Black can not dislodge the Bishop with ...g5.  h6 !?  still aiming to play ...g5 !  14.Qc1  with two ideas in mind. Stop ...g5 and attack on the c-file.  Bb7  15.Qe3  Na5  preparing the way for ...c5 and in some cases ...Nc4. The position is roughly equal, yes Black has the better pawn structure but White has a great dark square Bishop.   5.a3  is aiming against ...Bb4 but loses another tempo. Surely too many tempo's to hope for an edge.  d6  5... d5 must also make a lot of sense, but lets stick with our standard plan.  6.Nc3   6.b4  aims to make use of the a3 move. Black should counter this wing attack by developing and preparing the ...e5 push.  g6 !  now that the a1-h8 diagonal has opened up, this move makes a lot of sense. The Bishop is most active on g7.  7.Bb2  Bg7  Black's extra tempo looks handy here. The Knight on c6 is not badly placed.  8.e3  O-O  9.Nbd2   9.Nc3  has also been played, but this has the downside on interfering with the Bishop on b2.  e5 !  it is time ! White now played  10.d5  in Danielian,E -Hoang Thanh Trang Hersonissos GRE 2017. Black was doing fine after  e4 !?  11.dxc6  exf3  12.Qxf3  bxc6  13.Qxc6  Bd7  14.Qf3  f4 !?  =∞  an aggressive move. Black has sacrificed a pawn in order to open up things towards the White King. Both 14... a5 and 14... Ne4 offered Black very good play for the pawn as well.  9...Qe7  when there is no point aiming to swing the Queen over to h5 this is the best square for the Queen. Black is now ready to advance with ...e5 ! It is also useful to vacate d8 for the Knight on c6. A manoeuvre that I have had much success with is ...Nd8 and then ...Nf7. The Knight is well placed on f7.  10.c5  seems sensible. White should use the extra space that has been created on the Queenside.   10.Be2  e5  ...Nd8 and ...Nf7 first was also possible.  11.b5  e4 !  often a good reply to b5.  12.bxc6   12.Ng5  Nd8  is fine for Black.  12...exf3  13.Bxf3  bxc6  14.Bxc6  Rb8  15.Rb1  f4 !  often ...f4 facilitates an attack, and White must be very careful here. For example,  16.Qe2  Bg4 !  softening up White's position. Black has a strong initiative after  17.f3  Bd7  18.Bxd7  Nxd7  19.exf4  Qf7  when the natural  20.g3 ?  is a mistake due to  Rfe8  21.Ne4  c6  and ...d5 next nets a piece for Black.  10...b6 !?  but the fact is that Black is better developed compared to White, so moves like ...b6 opening the position up will favour Black.  11.Qc2  bxc5  12.bxc5  dxc5  =+  Black can be entirely satisfied with how the opening has gone.  6...Be7  Aiming to simply play ...O-O and ...e5. 6... Ne4 !? was also interesting but maybe not quite enough for equality.  7.d5  otherwise Black will play ...e5 with immediate equality.  Ne5  the structures leading from d5 ...Ne5 can often be beneficial to White, but here Black is a couple of tempo up due to d3-d4 and a3. These extra tempo will give Black a good game.  8.g3  White tries to finish his development, whilst finding the best diagonal for the light square Bishop.  O-O   8...Nxc4  allowed  9.e4 !  9.Nxe5  as now   9.Bg2  would lose a pawn to  9...Nxc4  dxe5  10.Bg2  exd5  11.cxd5 =  Bd6  Black must be happy with the way things have gone. The plan will now be to finish development and get on with either some pawn advances in the center ...f4 or ...e4, or a typical Kingside attack with ...Qe8 ...Qh5 ...f4 etc.  5...Bb4+ !  is a very useful check which helps accelerate Black's development. This check also makes ...Ne7 much more desirable as the Knight wont block the Bishop in on f8. Black should have no problems after this check.  6.Bd2  other options can be met with ...Ne7 and Black will be doing well.  Bxd2+  7.Qxd2   7.Nbxd2  allows  ...Ne7  and equality. White's pawn on d5 may even become a weakness.  Ne4  you should be used to flinging your trusty steed into this square by now !  8.Qd1  Ne7  the most active square, applying some pressure to d5.  9.dxe6  other options will be met with ...O-O and even ...d6. Black would have a very comfortable game.  d6  is the simplest way to equality. Black will pick up the pawn on e6 with good development. I did look at   9...d5 !?  for quite some time, but lost faith in it after the sequence  10.cxd5  Bxe6 !?  11.dxe6  Qxd1+  12.Kxd1  Nxf2+  13.Ke1  Nxh1  When it looks like Black's Knight on h1 will become trapped. Saying that, this could be an area you may have fun researching yourselves.  10.Nbd2  White can't hold on to the pawn, as Nd4 will always be met with a well timed ...c5 push.  Bxe6 =  and Black can be very happy with the way that the opening has gone. Black is ahead in development with a solid hold of the central squares. I would be looking at playing ...O-O ...Nc6 and ...Qf6 ! here. I may even follow this up with ...g5 !? All fun and games !  4...Nf6  Simple development if often best.  5.Bg2  d6  Black plans ...e5 quickly, giving him a nice position. 5... d5 was another good move, but then you have to settle in for a Stonewall Dutch middlegame. 5... Be7 allows 6 c4 ! when any ...Bb4+ loses its appeal, due to the lose of tempo.  6.c4 !  is correct, aiming to play d5. This is stronger than in some previous variations as Black can no longer play . ..Bb4 +.   6.O-O ?!  seems a bit slow to me, as now Black will play ..e5 without any problems.  Be7  7.c4  e5 !  yes please !  8.d5  otherwise Black may well play ..e4 with an advantage in the center.  Nb8  I nearly always recommend placing the Knight back on b8 after d5. This is because it has the best future from b8, from b8 it can travel via a6 to c5, which gains more control of the weakened e6 square.  9.Nc3  My computer program seems to prefer White in these types of positions, but I am far from being convinced. If White does nothing Black can build a big attack with the standard plan ... O-O ...Qe8 ...Qh5 ...f4 ...Bh3 ...Ng4 and checkmate to follow on h2. Yes this plan does work ! give it a go !  O-O  10.Ng5  The only way to try and place some pressure on Black's set up.  Na6 !  we can now see why I like ...Nb8. The Knight heads to c5 or c7 in some cases after the pawn push ...c6. From both of these squares the Knight guards e6.  11.Rb1  h6  time to force a decision.  12.Ne6  Bxe6  13.dxe6  c6 !  taking some squares under control.  14.b4  Nc7 !  when White will struggle to keep material equality.  6...e5  is the key response, when Komodo now gives  7.d5 !?  Nb8  the position looks unclear to me. If White can quickly take advantage of the e6-square then he may be able to generate a good initiative, but I am not sure if he can do so. In theory I am happy to get this closed pawn structure as it gives Black good long term chances on the Kingside, but it does all depend on whether Ng5 and Ne6 will hit us hard. The computer prefers White and if this kind of position is not to your taste then I would suggest 5... d5 playing a Stonewall one tempo up.  8.Ng5  must be critical.  Be7  9.Ne6  again this must be the real test.  Bxe6  10.dxe6  c6 !  trying to control the Bishop on g2.  11.Qc2  fighting for control of the light squares.  e4 ! =  with equal chances, but White has more to prove in the position. This is because Black has the simple plan of playing ... Qc8 and ...Qxe6 going a pawn up. I would certainly feel happy sitting on the Black side of the board here.   3.g3  is really not worrying as we saw in House vs Williams. Please take a look at that game to see how Black should proceed when White plays in a slow manner. }
3... e5
{ The point behind ...Nc6 ! Black responds in King's Gambit style, offering a pawn but in return gaining the middle of the board. White now has a couple of options, with 4 Nc3 being the most popular: }
4. Nc3
{ This is the position that you are most likely to reach after playing 2... Nc6. As 4 Nc3 is by far White's most popular choice, as long as you are well prepared, you can face the future with confidence in this position.   4.d4 !?  And now we have reached the Vienna Game, albeit via a very strange move order ! This position more often occurs, with colours reversed  (but tempi exactly the same !)  , after the sequence of moves: 1 e4 e5 2 Nc3 Nf6 3 f4 d5. I suggest that you take a look at that opening to know what to play here, but as I have faced this a couple of times now I will share some of my findings with you. This is one of the times in this course where I am going to give you more than one idea as Black. This is because my research has found more than one interesting idea.  fxe4  The main move. This would be my suggested move to you guys, I am now going to show you a fun gambit line for Black. A line that I am sure will give you a lot of success, even if it is not 100% sound.   4...exd4 !?  is also interesting. Like a reversed King's Gambit ! This is a very rare move in the Vienna should may well take your opponent by surprise.  5.Nxd4   5.e5 !?  is an attempt at discoordinating Black's position. Black is fine after  Qe7   5...d6 ?!  allows  6.Bb5  Bd7  7.e6  Bxe6  8.O-O  when White has a big attack.  6.Bf4   6.Bg5  Qe6  doesn't change things much.  d6  fighting in the center.  7.Bb5  White reacts with quick development.  dxe5  8.Bxc6+   8.Nxe5 ?  runs into  ...Qb4+  winning a piece.  bxc6  9.Nxe5  The most active try.  Ba6 !?  Fighting fire with fire ! White's King can no longer castle.  10.Qxd4  with one crazy position ! I would suggest  Qd6  here which is given as equal by my computer program, but as you can tell there is a lot of room for your own research here.  5...Nf6 !?  this move occurred to me as a way of entering into a line of the Kings Gambit that I play with White, yet this time we are Black !  6.exf5   6.Nxf5  d5 !  looks like decent compensation for Black.   6.Nxf5  d5 !?  6...Bc5 !?  we have now transposed to 1 e4 e5 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 exf4 4 Nf3 Nf6 5 Bc4 Nxd5 6 Nc3 !? a line which offers White chances of an advantage. I do find it so peculiar how so many of these lines transpose from White to Black. Very confusing for both sides !  7.Nxc6  dxc6 !  Is the weird idea, first mentioned  (for the White pieces !)  by Thomas Johansson in his book, 'The Fascinating Kings Gambit', it is certainly very interesting. For example, one line runs.  8.Qxd8+  Kxd8  9.Bd3  Re8+  10.Kf1  Ne4 !  gaining the two Bishops.  11.Bxe4  Rxe4  12.Bg5+  Ke8  13.Nd2  Rb4  with an interesting and equal middlegame.  5.Nxe5  d6 !?  as in my introductory game against Almasi. This is a very interesting option. The more standard move would be 5... Nf6. If you want to study that move, I would suggest you take a look at it from the White side, as it is the main line of the Vienna Gambit.  6.Nxc6   6.Qh5+ ?!  is considered dubious by theory and for good reason.  g6  7.Nxg6  Nf6 !  Often a move to remember in this little tactic exchange.  8.Qh4  Nxd4  9.Nxh8   9.Na3  Nf5 !  with advantage to Black.  Nxc2+ =+  and the tactics favour Black here.  6...bxc6  7.d5  before Black has a chance to play ...d5.  Nf6  8.Nc3  Be7  Black is aiming for ...O-O ...Qe8 ...Qg6 and good attacking chances on against White's Kingside. For example, then the light square Bishop on c8 can join in the fun on g4 or h3.  9.Bc4   9.dxc6  allows d5 ! with instant equality.  O-O !?  Here we go !  10.dxc6+  Kh8  11.O-O  Qe8 !  with an attack as we saw in my game against Almasi. The computer does not agree that the compensation is quite good enough but I would be very happy having this position again. Practically White has to defend very well. The simple idea is ...Qg6 and then either ...Bh3 or ...Bg4 to f3. I am sure this way of playing will trick a lot of opponents out !   4.exf5  Is an important move as it demonstrates Black's main idea. It should also be added that I believe this capture is one of the less critical options. Black will gain equality quite easily with precise play.  d5 !  taking the center and threatening to capture back the pawn on f5.  5.g4  the most logical and greedy move ! White does not want to part with his extra pawn. This is like some lines of the Kings Gambit, yet a better version for Black ! Why is that ? Well, there is no Black Knight on f6  (often in the Kings Gambit there is a Knight on f3 in such positions)  meaning Black's next move becomes much stronger.   5.d4  A typical counter for White in the center and White's best option in this position. In actual fact this is the only move that keeps equality for White !  e4  Securing a strong center. This is the simplest way to guarantee a good game. 5... Qe7 !? is an interesting novelty that some of the more imaginative of you might like to experiment with.   5...Qe7 !?  6.Ne5  Nxe5  N  as far as I can tell a novelty ! A very sensible one though, Black needs to eliminate this strong Knight on e5. The position has previously seen 6... Bxf5 but this allows 7 Bb5 and then it becomes a bit of a mission for Black to rid himself of the beast on e5.   6...Bxf5  7.dxe5  Bxf5  This position is fine for Black. I am actually surprised that my program gives it as 0.36 for White  (after a minute it drops to 0.03!)  , which I find hard to believe with those strong Black pawns on d5 and e4. Let's play out some more moves to see how things could develop.  8.Be2  Qd7 !  trying to gain the maximum from the position. Black wants to castle Queenside at the correct moment and combine this with pressure in the center.  9.O-O  d4  yes please ! I would enjoy such a position. Black will play ...O-O-O ...Ne7 ...Nc6 with a great game.  5...h5 !  A typical way to break up White's Kingside pawns. Black already has the initiative and advantage !  6.gxh5  What else should White play ?   6.g5  doesn't attack a piece so Black can simply play  6...Bxf5  with the advantage.  Bxf5 =+  Black has a great position. Control of the center, easy development and White's pawn structure is horrid, for example,  7.Bg5  Be7  8.Nh4 ?  was played in J.Laurent-A.Gorovets, Lille 2013, where Black missed the immediate win  missing  Bb4+ !  9.c3  Qxg5  10.Nxf5  Qxf5  11.cxb4  Nf6  even though Black is still a pawn down, Komodo 12, gives this as -2.32 for Black ! White's position is a shambles and Black has numerous targets to attack. Ideas for Black include ...Rxh5 ...Rf8 and checkmate on f2 ...Nd4 etc. If you are not convinced by Black's position here, go and buy another course ! }
4... Nf6 { The best move, we need to develop after all ! } 5. exf5
{ Against other moves Black will develop the Bishop on f8 play ...d6 and castle Kingside with a promising game. }
5... d5
{ We now see the main reason why Black avoided playing ... d6. Black can now play ...d5 in one move, saving a tempo. White must act quickly otherwise Black will simply capture the pawn on f5 and maintain a fantastic center. }
6. d4
{ The best way to cause Black some headaches, but the lose of tempo with playing d3 and then later d4 means that White won't get any advantage.   6.Nh4  is a rather greedy option, but the only way that White can hang on to his pawn on f5. It does also score heavily for White in my database  (+3 from 4 games !)  , this shouldn't put you off though as Black has a number of promising options, for example,  (d4 ! N)  a novelty but a very logical and good one ! The point is this forces White's Knight to a passive square as Ne4 gets met with ...Bb4+ when Black gains the advantage.  7.Nb1  there are no better squares !  Be7 !  simple and good. Black just wants to castle and then play ...Nd5 with a great game.  8.Be2  O-O  9.O-O  Nd5  10.Nf3  Bxf5  =+  and Black is doing very well. }
6... exd4
{ The simplest and best option. 6... e4 ?! is slightly dubious due to 7 Nh4 when Black's compensation is somewhat lacking. }
7. Nxd4 Nxd4
{ Again, simple if the best way. Black captures to win the pawn on f5 back. }
8. Qxd4 Bxf5
{ A critical position for the evaluation of this opening. On all current evidence and computer calculation, Black can look to the future with confidence. It is worth remembering that in a number of lines the Black King is best placed on f7 after a check on the e-file. Let's take a look at some variations to get a better feel for the position. }
9. Bg5
{ The most common, but maybe not best.  White has also tried   9.Bb5+ ?!  aiming for quick development, but this falls short:  c6  10.O-O  Bxc2  Brave but correct as White was threatening Qe5+  11.Bg5  Be7  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Rae1+  Kf7  again we see the King hiding on this safe square.  14.Qd2  Bg6  . Black had a big advantage and went on to win in P.Batchelor-N.Pert, British Championship 2014   9.Bf4 !?  is one of the computers top moves and might become the main choice of players in the White position here. It has only been played three times but going on current evidence does seem to be the most critical option.  c6  There are other options but this is the safest move. Black reinforces his center and prepares to finish his development. I wouldn't recommend   9...Bxc2  here as  10.Nb5 !  looks quite scary for White.  An option you might like to explore is   9...Qe7+  with the idea  10.Be2  O-O-O  11.Qxa7  Qb4  leading to some crazy complications.  10.O-O-O  White is ahead in development and must aim to use that to create problems.  Be7  guarding the e-file and preparing to castle.  11.Qe5   11.f3  O-O  (21)  Movsesian,S  (2657)  -Galyas, M  (2421)  Germany 2014 was completely fine for Black.  11. Qe5 is now the only way White can keep some pressure against Black's position, but Black is ok after  Qd7  12.Re1  Kf7 !  The Black King often moves here in this variation. Black after all can castle by hand with ...Rhe8. 0-1  (66)  Rachela,M  (2400)  -Bosiocic,M  (2562)  Sarajevo 2010 now continued  13.Qd4  Rae8 =  with equality. Black took control after  14.Bd3  Bxd3  15.Qxd3  Rhf8  16.Re2  Bc5  17.Rhe1 ?  losing a pawn  Bxf2  18.Rf1  Rxe2  19.Nxe2  Bb6  ∓  Black was a free pawn up and went onto win   9.Bd3  simplifies the position and can not be a test of Black's opening strategy.  Bxd3  10.Qxd3  c6  11.O-O  Be7  12.Bg5  O-O =  0-1  (48)  Borisov,S  (2014)  -Malaniuk,V  (2523)  Sochi 2014   9.Qe5+ ?  well done on your check sir...  Qe7  the exchange of Queens helps Black as he has the stronger center in the middlegame and now doesn't have to worry about his King.  10.Qxe7+  Bxe7  =+  0-1  (43)  Carlhammar,M  (2318)  -Hillarp Persson,T  (2547)  Gothenburg 2011 }
9... Bxc2
{ It is best to be brave; other options allow White to castle Queenside. This stops that and bags a pawn in the process ! }
10. Rc1 { Black would otherwise play ...Be7 and ...O-O. } 10... Bg6 11. h4
{ A new move from the 'Hawk' but it does not change the evaluation of the position, which is everything is fine for Black.  White has also tried:   11.Qe5+ ?!  but in some ways this just helps Black after  Kf7  Black was better in J.Gdanski-M.Bartel, Polish Championship 2010 ...Bd6 is coming and the tactical try  12.Nxd5 !?  leaves Black slightly better after the tactical sequence  Qxd5  13.Rxc7+  Kg8  14.Bc4  Qxc4  15.Rxc4  Re8  =+   11.Bxf6  is also better for Black:  Qxf6  as a rule Black is always happy to exchange Queens in this variation.  12.Qe3+  Qe7 !  13.Qxe7+  Kxe7 !  with a nice tactical idea in mind  14.Nxd5+  Kd7  and the pawn on c7 can not be captured so Black's two Bishop should give him the advantage.  15.Rxc7+ ?   15.Nxc7 ?  Rc8  winning a piece.  Kd6  16.Bc4  Be4 !  ∓  winning material.   11.Bd3  is one of the better options but Black is ok after  Be7  finishing development should be Black's key idea.  12.O-O  O-O  13.Bxg6  hxg6  14.Bxf6  Bxf6  15.Qxd5+  Qxd5  16.Nxd5  c6  17.Nxf6+  gxf6 =  a rather forcing variation leading to a drawish endgame. }
11... h6 { 11...Be7 !?  12.h5  Bxh5  13.Bd3  Bf7  =+ } 12. Qe5+
{ Trying to avoid the simplifications, but in the process entering tactics that should benefit Black.   12.Bxf6  Qxf6  13.Qxf6  gxf6  14.Nxd5  O-O-O  and Black would be slightly better. }
12... Kf7
{ The safest square for the Black King ! There are now ideas of placing a Rook on e8 at some point. }
13. h5 { Logical. } 13... Bh7 14. Nxd5
{ White must act before Black has a chance to play ...Bd6. The position looks very scary for Black, but with a bit of care it is White who must be on his guard.  but there was a better option in }
14... Bd6
{ 14...c6 ?!  was played in J.Hawkins-N.Pert, British Championships, 2014 but  14...Bd6 !  enters into favourable tactics for Black. For example }
15. Bc4
{ Trying to confuse matters, Black just needs to keep his cool...   15.Bxf6  allows some favourable exchanges for Black.  Bxe5  16.Bxd8  Raxd8  Black has two Bishop and a development advantage.  17.Bc4  Bxb2  showing no fear !  18.Nxc7+  Ke7  19.Rd1  Rxd1+  20.Kxd1  Kd6  and Black is clearly better }
15... Bxe5 16. Nxf6+ Ke7
{ The key move ! Black's King steps into another discovered check, yet heads to d7 where it will be safe. }
17. Nd5+ { There is nothing better. } 17... Kd7 18. Bxd8 Raxd8
{ Black's two Bishops give him the advantage. With ...c6 and ...Rhe8 to come all the winning chances are on Black's side. }

{ A starting move for the Reti opening. One of the most commonly played openings. I have always enjoyed playing the Dutch against 1 Nf3. The main reason for this is that Black will often be able to play ...e5 without a fight, and then start one of our normal attacks against the White King. Saying that, White has a number of ways to try and unsettle us early on, the main attempt being 2 d3. We must learn some theory, then we can face the future with confidence. }
1... f5
{ You should push this pawn with confidence ! I have found that White can already fall into the wrong mindset after facing 1... f5, as my game with Glenn House shows. When playing 1 Nf3 White often has an idea about what his first ten moves will be, and playing them in a blind manner against a typical Dutch set up with ...e5 can put White on the backfoot immediately. }
2. d3
{ This move was made trendy by a certain Magnus Carlsen. White aims to play e4 and challenge Black in the center. I love it when White plays in a quieter manner with g3, as you can see from my game against Glenn House. }
2... Nc6
{ This is another very exciting way of playing against 2 d3. Black's main idea is to advance in the centre with ... e5 ! Some of the following variations remind me of the King's Gambit, which is quite crazy as the Classical Dutch hardly ever resembles the King's Gambit ! Currently, 2... Nc6 is doing very well from a theoretical point of view and this would be my suggested way that you play against 2 d3. Moskalenko also takes a look at this move in his excellent book on the Dutch, 'The Diamond Dutch'. 2... d6 used to be a favourite of mine, but I have lost confidence in it now. White has two sensible ways of playing against 2... Nc6 !? }
3. d4
{ is a weird move. Losing a tempo to try and prove that the Knight is bad on c6, as now White has ideas of playing d5 harassing that Knight. I am rather doubtful about how good this plan is though, as we will see that even when White achieves his plan of playing d4-d5 Black has equality. }
3... e6
{ This move keeps the position dynamic, and it also fits into our Classical Dutch set up. 3... d5 is also possible, but you have to be willing to play a Stonewall Dutch then. }
4. c4
{ trying to force the move d5 looks like the most logical plan, otherwise it must be asked why White has lost a tempo. }
4... Nf6
{ standard development, allowing White to achieve his aim of playing d5. } 5.
d5 { the most critical, this has been White's plan all along. } 5... Bb4+
{ is a very useful check which helps accelerate Black's development. This check also makes ...Ne7 much more desirable as the Knight won't block the Bishop in on f8. Black should have no problems after this check. }
6. Bd2 { other options can be met with ...Ne7 and Black will be doing well. }
6... Bxd2+ 7. Qxd2
{ 7 Nbxd2 allows ..Ne7 and equality. White's pawn on d5 may even become a weakness. }
7... Ne4
{ you should be used to flinging your trusty steed into this square by now ! }
8. Qd1 Ne7 { the most active square, applying some pressure to d5. } 9. dxe6
{ other options will be met with ...O-O and even ...d6. Black would have a very comfortable game. }
9... d6
{ Is the simplest way to equality. Black will pick up the pawn on e6 with good development.  I did look at   9...d5 !?  for quite some time, but lost faith in it after the sequence  10.cxd5  Bxe6 !?  11.dxe6  Qxd1+  12.Kxd1  Nxf2+  13.Ke1  Nxh1  When it looks like Black's Knight on h1 will become trapped. Saying that, this could be an area you may have fun researching yourselves. }
10. Nbd2
{ White can't hold on to the pawn, as Nd4 will always be met with a well timed ...c5 push. }
10... Bxe6
{ and Black can be very happy with the way that the opening has gone. Black is ahead in development with a solid hold of the central squares. I would be looking at playing ...O-O ...Nc6 and ...Qf6 ! here. I may even follow this up with ...g5 !? All fun and games ! }

4... Nf6 { Simple development if often best. } 5. Bg2 d6
{ Black plans ...e5 quickly, giving him a nice position. 5... d5 was another good move, but then you have to settle in for a Stonewall Dutch middlegame. 5... Be7 allows 6 c4 ! when any ...Bb4+ loses its appeal, due to the lose of tempo. }

{ I nearly always recommend placing the Knight back on b8 after d5. This is because it has the best future from b8, from b8 it can travel via a6 to c5, which gains more control of the weakened e6 square. }
9. Nc3

3. e4

This position more often occurs, with colours reversed  (but tempi exactly the same !)  , after the sequence of moves:   1.e4  e5  2.Nc3  Nf6  3.f4  d5  I suggest that you take a look at that opening to know what to play here, but as I have faced this a couple of times now I will share some of my findings with you. This is one of the times in this course where I am going to give you more than one idea as Black. This is because my research has found more than one interesting idea. }
4... fxe4
{ The main move. This would be my suggested move to you guys, I am now going to show you a fun gambit line for Black. A line that I am sure will give you a lot of success, even if it is not 100% sound. }
5. Nxe5 d6
{ as in my introductory game against Almasi. This is a very interesting option. The more standard move would be 5... Nf6. If you want to study that move, I would suggest you take a look at it from the White side, as it is the main line of the Vienna Gambit. }
6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. d5 { before Black has a chance to play ...d5. } 7... Nf6 8. Nc3
Be7
{ Black is aiming for ...O-O ...Qe8 ...Qg6 and good attacking chances on against White's Kingside. For example, then the light square Bishop on c8 can join in the fun on g4 or h3. }
9. Bc4 { 9 dxc6 allows d5 ! with instant equality. } 9... O-O { Here we go ! }
10. dxc6+ Kh8 11. O-O Qe8
{ with an attack as we saw in my game against Almasi. The computer does not agree that the compensation is quite good enough but I would be very happy having this position again. Practically White has to defend very well. The simple idea is ...Qg6 and then either ...Bh3 or ...Bg4 to f3. I am sure this way of playing will trick a lot of opponents out ! }

1. Nf3
{ A starting move for the Reti opening. One of the most commonly played openings. I have always enjoyed playing the Dutch against 1 Nf3. The main reason for this is that Black will often be able to play ...e5 without a fight, and then start one of our normal attacks against the White King. Saying that, White has a number of ways to try and unsettle us early on, the main attempt being 2 d3. We must learn some theory, then we can face the future with confidence. }
1... f5
{ You should push this pawn with confidence ! I have found that White can already fall into the wrong mindset after facing 1... f5, as my game with Glenn House shows. When playing 1 Nf3 White often has an idea about what his first ten moves will be, and playing them in a blind manner against a typical Dutch set up with ...e5 can put White on the backfoot immediately. }
2. d3
{ This move was made trendy by a certain Magnus Carlsen. White aims to play e4 and challenge Black in the center. I love it when White plays in a quieter manner with g3, as you can see from my game against Glenn House. }
2... Nc6
{ This is another very exciting way of playing against 2 d3. Black's main idea is to advance in the centre with ... e5 ! Some of the following variations remind me of the King's Gambit, which is quite crazy as the Classical Dutch hardly ever resembles the King's Gambit ! Currently, 2... Nc6 is doing very well from a theoretical point of view and this would be my suggested way that you play against 2 d3. Moskalenko also takes a look at this move in his excellent book on the Dutch, 'The Diamond Dutch'. 2... d6 used to be a favourite of mine, but I have lost confidence in it now. White has two sensible ways of playing against 2... Nc6 !? }
3. e4
{ This is certainly the most dangerous move and Black must be well prepared from this position. On the plus side, so must White ! Things can become quite critical and one bad move will often leave either side struggling. Both sides will now aggressively fight for control of the center. }
3... e5
{ The point behind ...Nc6 ! Black responds in Kings Gambit style, offering a pawn but in return gaining the middle of the board. White now has a couple of options, with 4 Nc3 being the most popular: }
4. Nc3

3... e5
{ The point behind ...Nc6 ! Black responds in Kings Gambit style, offering a pawn but in return gaining the middle of the board. White now has a couple of options, with 4 Nc3 being the most popular: }
4. Nc3
{ This is the position that you are most likely to reach after playing 2... Nc6. As 4 Nc3 is by far White's most popular choice, as long as you are well prepared, you can face the future with confidence in this position. }
4... Nf6 { The best move, we need to develop after all ! } 5. exf5
{ Against other moves Black will develop the Bishop on f8 play ...d6 and castle Kingside with a promising game. }
5... d5

6. d4
{ The best way to cause Black some headaches, but the lose of tempo with playing d3 and then later d4 means that White wont get any advantage. }
6... exd4

9. Bg5 { The most common, but maybe not best. } 9... Bxc2

10. Rc1 { Black would otherwise play ...Be7 and ...O-O. } 10... Bg6 11. h4

12. Qe5+

1. Nf3
{ A starting move for the Reti opening. One of the most commonly played openings. I have always enjoyed playing the Dutch against 1 Nf3. The main reason for this is that Black will often be able to play ...e5 without a fight, and then start one of our normal attacks against the White King. Saying that, White has a number of ways to try and unsettle us early on, the main attempt being 2 d3. We must learn some theory, then we can face the future with confidence. }
1... f5
{ You should push this pawn with confidence ! I have found that White can already fall into the wrong mindset after facing 1... f5, as my game with Glenn House shows. When playing 1 Nf3 White often has an idea about what his first ten moves will be, and playing them in a blind manner against a typical Dutch set up with ...e5 can put White on the backfoot immediately. }
2. d3
{ This move was made trendy by a certain Magnus Carlsen. White aims to play e4 and challenge Black in the center. I love it when White plays in a quieter manner with g3, as you can see from my game against Glenn House. }
2... Nc6
{ This is another very exciting way of playing against 2 d3. Black's main idea is to advance in the centre with ... e5 ! Some of the following variations remind me of the King's Gambit, which is quite crazy as the Classical Dutch hardly ever resembles the King's Gambit ! Currently, 2... Nc6 is doing very well from a theoretical point of view and this would be my suggested way that you play against 2 d3. Moskalenko also takes a look at this move in his excellent book on the Dutch, 'The Diamond Dutch'. 2... d6 used to be a favourite of mine, but I have lost confidence in it now. White has two sensible ways of playing against 2... Nc6 !? }
3. e4
{ This is certainly the most dangerous move and Black must be well prepared from this position. On the plus side, so must White ! Things can become quite critical and one bad move will often leave either side struggling. Both sides will now aggressively fight for control of the center. }

{ The English Opening. Do not fear this move ! My experience has shown that I often get a very good Dutch set up against the English, this is because White will often allow us to play ...e5 in one move rather then two. For that reason I am suggesting we play a clever move order. A move order where we avoid ...e6 and go for ...d6 and ...e5 immediately. If we get lucky then a Kingside storm will engulf the White King. : }
1... f5 2. Nc3
{ There are lots of different move orders that White can try, so you must be on your guard. The key things to remember are: 1  Aim for ...d6 and ...e5. People who play the English will often play their first ten moves without thinking, allowing us to get our ideal set up. 2  Keep on guard for the move order, in some cases White may play d4 taking us back into main lines. }
2... Nf6 3. g3
{ The most 'traditional' move.   3.d4  e6  takes us back into main lines  and   3.Nf3  d6  is similar. }
3... d6
{ Aiming for ...e5 in one move. This is the simplest idea, as we can often save a tempo on achieving our main idea ...e5 ! }
4. Bg2
{ Sticking to the English set up.   4.d4 !  has some independent value. For example,  e6  is the normal move.   4...e5  is also possible but does allow White to enter into an ending after  5.dxe5.  5.Bg2  Be7  6.e4  This is the only move that I would be wary of. Other options lead us back into areas of this course that we have already looked at. White has achieved something small here, as we have played ...d6 rather than ...Be7. The downside of this is that the move ...d5 loses some of its punch. That is why I am going to suggest another approach. One that involves ...e5 and not ... d5.  fxe4  7.Nxe4  O-O  Now we are ready to strike.  8.Ne2  This seems sensible. Developing a piece and preparing to castle.  e5   8...Nxe4  may be be possible, but White looks comfortable after  9.Bxe4  d5  10.Bg2 !  9.O-O  Nxe4  10.Bxe4  Qe8 !  With our standard way of attacking. ...Qh5 ...Nd7 to c6 may even be possible. It maybe true that White has some small edge here, but nothing that should scare us too much. }
4... e5 { In one move, thanks ! } 5. e3
{ This is one of the better set ups that White can play. The Knight on g1 will come to e2 and must importantly White has options of playing f4 ! which will hold up an attack on the Kingside.   5.d3  transposes to one of the first games in this course. Sowray vs Pert ! This is just what we want to see, for example,  Be7  6.e4  This maybe best in my opinion.   6.Nf3  allows our normal plan as we saw in House vs Williams.  O-O  7.O-O  Qe8 !  with the attack.  6...c6 !  it is a good idea to cover d5, in order to stop White from playing Nd5. Black is now aiming to play ...O-O ...Na6 to c5 or c7 ...Qe8 ! etc for example,  7.Nge2  O-O  8.O-O  Na6 =  The Knight will either go active on c5 or re-route via c7.  9.d4  Qe8 !  If you are unaware of this move by now, go back to the start please...  10.a3  fxe4  Opening lines for the Bishop on c8.  11.dxe5  dxe5  12.Nxe4  Nxe4  13.Bxe4  Nc5  =+  Black's pieces had sprung to life in 0-1  (28)  Varberg,K  (2230)  -Gulko,B  (2615)  Copenhagen 1996 }
5... Be7 6. Nge2 O-O
{ 6...c6  is similar to the main line. It is more important to try and play ...e4 and ...d5 with a great centre. For example, 0-1  (39)  Spraggett,K  (2550)  -Vaganian,R  (2625)  Montpellier 1985, continued  7.d4  O-O  8.O-O  Na6  9.Rb1  Nc7  10.b3  e4 !  11.Bb2  d5  and Black was slightly better. }
7. O-O c6
{ This makes sense here, controlling d5 and aiming to just develop. Black can also consider playing ...e4 and ...d5 taking control of the center of the board. }
8. b3 Na6
{ Black completes his development before committing to any attacking ideas. 7... Qe8 to h5 was also tempting, but this is the more 'mature' way to proceed ! }
9. d4 { White has to commit at some point. } 9... e4
{ This is often a positionally desirable move, as it blocks any sunlight that was given to White's Bishop on g2. Black would love to support the pawn on e4 with ...d5 so... }
10. d5 { The downside of this move though is that Black can now jump into c5. }
10... Nc5
{ With an equal game. Black has two main plans, either advance on the Kingside with ...g5 !? or he can also play on the Queenside with ...a5 ... Bd7 and ...Rc8. Both plans are simply and good. }
11. Ba3
{ Giving up this Bishop looks wrong to me.   11.f3 !  was a better try. } 11...
Qa5 12. Bxc5 Qxc5
{ And I prefer Black, as in: 0-1  (56)  Georgiev,K  (2623)  -Vallejo Pons,F  (2707)  Riyadh KSA 2017. }
