1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3
{ The Smith-Morra gambit. White sacrifices a pawn to accelerate his development and open the c and d-files. }
3... dxc3
{ 'The best way to refute a gambit is to accept it.' - Wilhelm Steinitz   Black can decline the gambit with  3...Nf6  , transposing into the Alapin after  4.e5  Nd5  , but if the Smith-Morra gambit is unsound, why not accept it  ? }
4. Nxc3
{ White's compensation for the pawn lies in his lead in development and central space advantage. White's developmental plan is Nf3 followed by Bc4 and O-O, usually followed by Qe2, developing the dark-squared bishop  (Be3, Bf4, or Bg5)  and occupation of the open d- and c-files with Rfd1 and Rac1. White hopes in his positional pressure on the d and c-files to secure compensation for the pawn if he doesn't have a knockout blow due to his lead in development.   One of Black's main problems in the Smith-Morra Accepted is his queen. Where to develop it ? If Black leaves it on d8, it is often harassed on the d-file  (after Qe2 and Rd1 followed by e5 to open the d-file)  . ...Qc7 isn't ideal because it is on the open c-file  (after Rc1 this can be dangerous)  , ...Qb6 is met with Be3, and ...Qa5 is also too exposed after Bd2. In the Scheveningen mainline, the safest option for Black's queen is ...Qc7-b8, but this impedes queenside development, helping White secure long-term compensation. White's compensation can be very dangerous, especially if Black doesn't effectively solve the question of how to develop his queen.   However, Black has his advantages as well. For one thing, Black is currently up a pawn. Black also has a central pawn majority, which is often used to help protect Black's king in the Sicilian, buying him time to catch up on development. White also has weakened the d4-square as c3 is no longer possible, this weakness becomes relevant in some middlegames and endgames where Black survives as the d4-square can become an outpost. If Black solves the primary problems of how to survive the opening, catch up on development, safely develop his queen, and reduce the effectiveness of White's e5-break, Black will be well on his way to consolidate his extra pawn. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bc4 Nge7
{ Black plans to refute the gambit with a quick ...Ng6, ...Be7, ...a6  (preventing Nb5)  , and castles. With Black's kingside knight on g6 instead of f6, White's e5-break is less dangerous. With White's key idea to fight for a middlegame initiative out of the question, Black will soon aim for rapid queenside expansion with ...b5, ...Bb7, ...Rc8, and ...Na5, where Black will be the one fighting for the initiative and White won't have sufficient compensation for the pawn.    'The gambiter must throw a wrench with Bc1-g5!, temporarily halting Black's machinations, but after ...h6 or ...f6, the plan is once again set in motion. Naturally, such an aspiring vision has attracted some of the game's top assassins - Kamsky, Nakamura, Gashimov, Shabalov, Van Wely, and even Kasparov, to name a few. Therefore, ...Nge7 is, without a doubt, the professional's choice.' - IM Marc Esserman (Mayhem in the Morra, page 156).    Esserman was referring to this line with the  6...a6  7.O-O  Nge7  move order and goes on to show convincing analysis that White is doing fine in the  6...a6  variation. But why  6...a6?  Does Black really need to prevent  Nb5?  My analysis suggests that this is not urgent, and considering that White needs something concrete to fight Black's plan, the extra tempo can come in handy to help Black consolidate. }
7. Bg5
{ As clarified on the previous move, 7.Bg5 is forced. If Black can complete his plan without being interrupted by Bg5, White will not have anywhere near full compensation for the pawn.   7.Nb5  Ng6  and White doesn't have enough compensation for the pawn.  Bg5  prepares  Nb5  because Black's e7-knight would be pinned. }
7... h6
{ Preparing to meet Bh4 with ...g5  (unpinning)  , followed by ...Ng6 and rapid development to follow. 7...f6 isn't as strong because it weakens the b1-h7 diagonal, offering White long-term compensation and chances to later open the position with Nd4 followed by f4-f5 or the thematic Nd5 sacrifice. Though 7... h6! was played once by GM Hikaru Nakamura in a bullet game, it has still not yet been tested by masters in FIDE rated games.   The main reason why  7...h6  has been underestimated is that White can play  8.Nb5  , which IM Marc Esserman recommends for White in his book 'Mayhem in the Morra'. Even Stockfish, without proper guidance, prefers White. However, the complications after  8...d5!  objectively favor Black. White can retreat his dark-squared bishop instead of  8.Nb5  , but retreating is less critical and allows Black to consolidate rather quickly if he knows the lines. These variations are explained in the theory section. }

But if you expect to get a good result with it at the higher levels of serious tournament competition, and think the logical outcome of a game after using it is only a draw for Black with perfect play, we express our condolences.

For a model game in this variation, see Edward Farrington vs. Vladimir Lazarev.) }
8... d5 9. exd5
{ 9.Bf4  Ng6  and Black is much better. The following variations are not all forced for Black but illustrate how Black can obtain an advantage. At bare minimum, Black will obtain the bishop pair.  10.exd5   10.Bc7  Bb4+  11.Kf1  Qf6  Black has the initiative.   10.Nc7+  Ke7  11.Bg3□  dxc4  12.Nxa8  e5∓  Black has excellent compensation for the exchange. White's a8-knight will likely be won in the long run because it is trapped; after the trade of queens Black can develop his light-squared bishop followed by ...Kc8-b8-xa8.  10...Nxf4  11.dxc6  Bb4+  12.Kf1  Qxd1+  13.Rxd1  O-O  =+  Black is better due to his bishop pair and superior piece activity. }
9... hxg5
{ Stockfish initially claims that White is much better here because of his lead in development but ultimately changes its mind, concluding that White has no way to exploit his dynamic advantage and that Black's static advantages  (bishop pair and central pawn majority)  are more important. Note the classic anti-gambit strategy: giving back the pawn to obtain a positional advantage. }
10. dxc6
{ 10.dxe6!?  A tricky line, intending to win Black's queen with Nd6+. Black can sacrifice it for more than enough compensation.  10...Bxe6  11.Nd6+  Qxd6  12.Qxd6  Rd8!  ∓  Black currently has 2 minor pieces and the initiative for his queen. White's exposed queen and hanging Bc4 will allow Black to win a third minor for his queen in the near future.  The simple   12...Bxc4=+  is also strong, but White can fight for equality with  13.O-O-O  where White has better piece activity than after 12... Rd8. I prefer to harass White's queen with ...Rd8 before White can castle long, as White can't castle long with the d8-rook cutting through Ke1's path.  13...f6  It's worth mentioning that even here Black is fighting for the advantage as 3 minor pieces is often better than the queen and Black also has the bishop pair. White has no way to exploit his dynamics, though they are preventing White's position from immediate collapsing.  13.Qc5   13.Qg3?  13. Qc5 is stronger. White should defend his hanging bishop.  13...Nf5  A zwischenzug, preparing ...Bxc4 by unblocking Bf8. Now ...Bb4+ is a possibility.   13...Bxc4  14.Qg4∓  Also favors Black but 13... Nf5 is stronger because ...Bb4+ becomes a possibility.  14.Qxg5  Bxc4-+  Black has a decisive initiative. The immediate  15.Qxf5  loses to  15...Bb4+  13...Nf5  Black continues to harass White's queen. White has nothing better than giving back the queen with 14. Bxe6.  14.Bxe6   14.Qb5  loses to  14...Bb4+  15.Kf1  Nd6  Black obtains a third minor piece for the queen.  16.Qxg5  Bxc4+  17.Kg1  O-O  -+  Black has a decisive initiative.  14...Bxc5∓  White will regain the piece by playing 15. Bxf5, but Black will have a better endgame due to his massive lead in development. White lost a lot of time moving his queen. Black has many moves which keep a large advantage such as 15... Nd4, 15...Ne7, 15...g6, 15...Ke7, and 15...O-O }
10... Nxc6
{ 10...Nd5  is an interesting and relatively unclear alternative. Black is likely not worse in the complications, but this is not my main recommendation because it's not clear if Black is able to force an advantage. If you would rather play  10...Nd5  , feel free to analyze this position with the engine. Here are some lines to help give some idea of what should be checked.  11.c7   11.Bxd5  Qa5+  12.Nc3  exd5  and Black is the one who sacrifices a pawn  (the d5-pawn)  for compensation. How the tables have turned! Note how Black is the one who can fight for the initiative here due to his active bishop pair.  13.Qxd5  Not forced, but it's worth showing what happens if White accepts the pawn sacrifice.   It's also worth analyzing  13.Qe2  Be7  14.cxb7  Bxb7  15.O-O  Kf8  with a double-edged position.  13...Qxd5  14.Nxd5  Bd6  and White has to deal with  ...bxc6  ,  ...g4  ,  ...f6  (followed by ...Kf7)  (, ...Bb4, etc. Black's rooks are likely to get to the center faster and if Black wins his pawn back then he will have the initiative for free.)   11.O-O  bxc6  12.Bxd5  exd5  13.Re1+  Be7  and  14.Nbd4  can be met with  14...Qd6   or  14...Bd7  11...Bb4+  12.Kf1  Qf6  13.Bxd5  exd5  and the complications are only beginning. }
11. Qxd8+
{ 11.O-O ?  Bd7  Black has a powerful initiative due to the open h-file and his threat of ...g4. White can trade queens with  12.Nd6+  Bxd6  13.Qxd6  g4  14.Ne5  Nxe5  15.Qxe5  Qb8∓  but Black gets a much better endgame than he would have gotten after 11. Qxd8+. In this case, Black has the initiative and an extra pawn. }
11... Kxd8 12. O-O-O+
{ 12.Nxg5?!  Bb4+  13.Nc3  Ke7  Black has freed his dark-squared bishop before playing  ...Ke7  , getting a better version of an already favorable endgame.   12.Rd1+  Bd7!   12...Ke7  isn't as accurate. If Black plays the same way as he does in the 12.0-0-0 mainline he could get into trouble because of a concrete nuance.  13.Ng5  g6  14.Nd6  f6?   Black still has equality if he plays  14...Ne5!  15.Nxc8+!  Rxc8  16.Nxe6  If White's king was on  c1  , Black would win a piece by moving his c6-knight out of the way  (...Ne5 is the most accurate way of doing this, although many knight moves win)  , attacking the pinned  Bc4  and threatening  ...Rxc4+  , following up with  ...b5  if White protects his c4-bishop. This tactic doesn't work here because White's king is not on the open c-file, so Black isn't able to yet force White's g5-knight to retreat. Black wants to be able to play  ...f6  to reduce White's activity and to prepare  ...e5  with  ...Nd4  . Because  14...f6  doesn't work, this plan does not work here.  13.O-O   13.Nxg5  Ne5!  Black attacks White's c4-bishop and will prevent White from castling with  ...Bb4+  next. This resource would not work due to  14.Nxf7+?  Nxf7  15.Bxe6  if White had castled queenside, because  ...Bb4  wouldn't be check and  Rhe1  will win back the sacrificed material with interest  (Black will likely play ...Ne5 to defend the d7-bishop but Rhe1 would remove the defender)  , but  ...Bd7  works if White plays  12.Rd1+  instead of  12.O-O-O  Black can play  13...Be7   or  13...a6  (with a better endgame. White will soon play Nd6, Black will exchange knights and play ...Ke7. Soon, Black will bring his rook to the d-file and can remove his bishop from the open file with ...Be8)  (also protecting the f7-pawn that White will soon threaten with Nxg5)  . Black has a better endgame due to his more active king. Stockfish 10 64 evaluates the position after  13...Be7  to be -0.52 at depth  30. A sample variation could be  14.Nd6   14.Rd3  Kc8  White has nothing better than  15.Nd6+  anyways.   15.Rfd1  Be8  is likely to transpose after  16.Nd6+  15...Bxd6  16.Rxd6  g4  17.Ng5  The following is a sample continuation. Black has alternatives which also give an advantage.  17...Be8   17...Rf8  is also favorable  18.Rfd1  a6  Black prepares  ...Rh4  by preventing  Bxe6  followed by  Nxe6  due to the possibility of Black playing  ...Kb8-a7  .  19.Be2  Rh5  20.Nh3  Kc7  21.Bxg4  White wins the pawn back but Black has better activity.  21...Rh4  22.Bf3  Rd8  Black will trade a pair of rooks and has the advantage due to his superior piece activity and superior king activity.  14...Bxd6  15.Rxd6  Ke7  16.Rfd1  Be8  17.Ng5  Rh4!  Black should consolidate his d4-outpost and superior king activity with correct play. A promising plan seems to be  ...e5  (strengthening Black's control over d4 and preparing to use it as an outpost for the c6-knight)  (with ...Rd8)  (challenging White's d-file dominance)  where only Black can fight for a win.  18.b3  e5!  '-0.57' - Stockfish 10 64, depth  30.    Stockfish also claims that Black can keep the advantage with other moves, such as  18...Ne5  or  18...Rg4  . }
12... Ke7
{ White has a lead in development, but not enough open lines to exploit it. Black's static advantages  (bishop pair, central pawn majority, pressure down the h-file)  are more important. For starters, White will have to spend a tempo on Nxg5 to win his pawn back, and soon White's queenside pieces can be chased away with tempo  (...a6 and ...b5)  . It's worth mentioning that Black has the d4-outpost due to his central pawn majority  (Black can later play ...e5 to support the d4-square)  , a direct consequence of White having earlier sacrificed his c-pawn. }
13. Nxg5 g6
{ Preparing ...Bg7 followed by ...a6 and ...Nd4. Black also has the option of playing ...Bh6, although this is less thematic because Black wants to fight for the d4-square. }
14. Nd6
{ White tries to obtain the initiative as compensation for Black's bishop pair. For starters, he is attacking Black's f7-pawn.   14.h4  Bg7=+  Black can exploit the main Morra weakness  (the d4-square)  with ...a6 and ...Nd4.   14...Bh6  is also better for Black.   14.f4  Bg7  is similar to 14.h4 Bg7.   14.Kb1  Bg7   14.Rhe1?!  is well met by  14...Rh4!   14...Ne5  is also better for Black but not a clear win.  where White has to retreat with  15.Ne4   because  15.Bb3  allows  Bh6!  16.f4  Rxf4!  with a winning position for Black.  15...Rxh2  Black is up a pawn with the bishop pair and initiative.  ...Bh6+  will come soon and Black will develop his queenside after playing  ...a6  and  ...b5  . }
14... f6
{ Trying to chase away White's g5-knight.  The simple   14...Ne5  also favors Black. }
15. Ngf7
{ 15.Nf3  is too slow. Black will consolidate his d4-outpost, space advantage, and bishop pair  (White can get rid of the bishop pair with Nxc8+ but this helps Black develop)  with  15...e5  .  Black can also keep his advantage with the developing   15...Bh6+  or 15... Bg7.   15.Rhe1  Concretely aiming for counterplay due to the tactic Nxc8+ followed by Rxe6+ as ...Kf7 runs into discovered attacks.  15...Bh6  This concrete approach favors Black.  Black also has the advantage after the simple   15...e5  threatening ...fxg5 as ...Kf6 will be possible.  16.Nge4  Bh6+=+  Black consolidates. White can win back the bishop pair only at the cost of allowing Black to consolidate different positional advantages: superior king activity and cental space. Notice how Black's central e5-pawn supports the d4-outpost.   16...Rxh2  is also at least equal for Black.   15...fxg5??  16.Nxc8+  Rxc8  17.Rxe6+  Kf7  18.Rxc6+  wins for White.  16.Nxc8+  Raxc8  17.Rxe6+  Kf8  18.Rxf6+  Ke8  and White has no satisfactory way to save his hanging g5-knight because h4/f4 runs into ...Ne7, winning the c4-bishop. }
15... Rh4
{ Black will take over the center with ...e5 and ...Nd4/...Rd4 and can resume development with ...Bd7 and ...Bg7. White's piece coordination is awkward and Black has superior king activity. }

White also has the standard compensation due to his lead in development and pressure down the c/d files.  'Loek desperately wanted to play 10... Be7 and castle to safety, but after a strained think decided that preventing the unpleasant Na4 with 10... b5, while leaving his king in the center, was the lesser of the two evils.

6. Bc4 e6
{ The Scheveningen setup is one of the mainlines. Black blunts White's light-squared bishop, intending to rapidly develop his kingside and later prevent e5 with ...e5. Black delays ...e5 to avoid tactics on the a1-h8 diagonal long enough to catch up on kingside development. }
7. O-O Be7 8. Qe2 Nf6 9. Rd1
{ Qe2 and Rd1 is standard against the Scheveningen, especially since Rd1 creates an x-ray on Qd8. Now Black must deal with White's threat of e5, as Black can't recapture with his queen on the d-file. }
9... e5
{ The main move. Black prevents White from playing e5 at the cost of weakening the d5-square.   9...Qc7?!  Concretely inaccurate.  10.Nb5!  Qb8  11.Bf4!  Black's d6-pawn is in trouble and Black has to make a concession. These tactics are available to White because he has such a huge lead in development and Black allowed White to create more threats with gain of tempo.  11...e5   11...Ne5  12.Nxd6+!  Bxd6  13.Rxd6  White has the bishop pair, a lead in development in an open position, and Black has weak dark-squares.

Black also has to deal with White's threat of Bxf6 where ...Bxf6 loses Black's d6-pawn.   9...Bd7  10.Nb5  Qb8  11.Bf4  is similar to 9...

White is currently threatening Nxd7 followed by Bb5 or Bd6, so Black should give back the exchange to help his king escape the center. Stockfish claims that best is  15...O-O  where White will win back the exchange and keep some advantage with  16.Nxd7  Nxd7  17.Bd6 }
10. Be3
{ White develops a piece and protects his main weakness  (the d4-square)  in preparation for ...Bg4.  It's worth pausing here to explain the pawn structure. The e4 vs. d6-e5 structure is known as the Boleslavsky structure and is a thematic Sicilian structure which is especially common in the Najdorf. Black's main weakness in the Boleslavsky structure is the d5-square, his secondary weakness is his backward d6-pawn. In the Najdorf, Black often can compensate for this weakness by playing a quick ...Be6, controlling d5  (Black generally doesn't go for the Boleslavsky structure after White has already played Bc4 because Bc4 helps control the important d5-square, so Black already has a worse version here)  , and trying to prepare the ...d5 break  (getting rid of both of Black's weaknesses and leaving him with a central pawn majority)  . Often the ...d5 break is unachievable, but Black still often gets sufficient counterplay down the c-file with ...Rc8 and ...b5-b4.   Neither condition for counterplay  (sufficient control over d5 or a queenside initiative)  is met for Black here because White dominates the d5-square and has a lead in development. Since White sacrificed the c-pawn, he can fight for the c-file more effectively than Black due to his lead in development. This is a dream Boleslavsky structure for White for only the cost of a pawn. This structure is so thematic and the dream version so good for White that sacrificing a pawn for a good version of this structure can even be found in other openings, like the Zaitsev variation of the Ruy Lopez  (model game: Viswanathan Anand vs. Rustam Kasimdzhanov, 2007)  . Black's extra pawn is backward and White has positional domination for the pawn, so Black needs something concrete. }
10... O-O
{ Black usually castles here to remain flexible about how he will develop his light-squared bishop until the next move, since Black is sure that he wants to castle but both ...Bg4 and ...Be6 are plausible candidate moves for Black's light-squared bishop. }

White has excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn and is the one fighting for the advantage as he has a dream Boleslavky structure. White would love to trade light-squared bishops  (without playing Bxe6 because ...fxe6 shores up the d5-square)  because d5 would be weaker, so he isn't scared of 12...Bxc4 13.Qxc4. In the meantime, White prepares to play b5  (another idea is a4 followed by Bxe6 and Qa2, ...Qd7 can be met by Na4-c5 or Na4-b6 if Black has played ...a6)  and Black is the one fighting to equalize.   11...Bd7  Black doesn't want to commit his bishop to e6 or g4 yet and prepares to expand on the queenside.  12.a3  a6  13.b4  b5  14.Bb3  Be6  Black's idea is that Bxe6 followed by Qa2 is no longer dangerous because White can't meet ...Qd7 with Na4. Therefore, White should advance in the center.  15.Nd5  Bxd5  16.exd5  Black's early ...b5 and lost time makes a big difference, White can recapture with the pawn and dominate the c-file and c6-square.  16...Nb8?  One mistake and White crashes through.   16...Na7  might be defensible for Black, but White has enough compensation for the pawn due to his bishop pair, space advantage, and lead in development.  17.Nxe5  dxe5  18.d6  Bxd6  19.Bc5  Bxc5  20.Rxd8  Bxf2+  21.Qxf2  Rxd8  22.g4  a5  23.g5  Nfd7  24.Qxf7+  Kh8  25.Qe7  Rf8  26.Qxf8+  Nxf8  27.Rc8  Esserman, Mark - Bartell, Thomas, 1-0, 2009 }
12. h3 { White will soon win the bishop pair or force Black to unpin. } 12...
Bh5
{ 12...Bxf3  13.Qxf3+=  Black's extra pawn  (the restrained and backward d6-pawn)  is nearly useless while White positionally dominates due to his lead in development, bishop pair, control over the d5-square, active rooks, etc. White can continue pressing for the advantage with Qe2 and a3-b4. }
13. g4 Bg6 14. Nh4
{ White has at least enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn because he has a dream Boleslavsky structure where he dominates d5 as well as his lead in development. White can follow up with Nxg6  (winning the bishop pair)  or Nf5  (occupying an outpost)  where Black is under pressure. Black might have theoretical equality here, but he if he does, he is the one who has to prove it. }

White needs something concrete against this approach, and he has it.

{ 6...b5  7.Bb3  Bb7  8.O-O!  b4   8...d6  allows  9.Ng5  with ideas of f4-f5  9.Nd5!  gives White a powerful initiative. Objectively, he has at least sufficient compensation for the knight, according to IM Marc Esserman's book, and I don't have sufficient reason to disagree. }
7. O-O Nc6
{ 7...b5  This move order is less accurate. Since Black hasn't played ...Nc6 yet, White has the extra option of playing Nd4.  8.Bb3  Ra7   8...Nc6  9.Qe2  transposes into the mainline.  9.Be3  Rd7  10.Nd4!  with either f4-f5 or a piece sac on e6. This can be combined with Qh5 and Black's king will be unsafe when the center opens. }
8. Qe2 b5 9. Bb3 Ra7
{ The Chicago defense. Black doesn't want his queen to be harassed on the d-file after the e5 break, so he prepares to block the d-file with ...Rd7. Black hopes that with e5 defused, White won't have any effective way to open the position, giving him time to complete development and consolidate his extra pawn. The problem with the Chicago defense is that it delays kingside development too long and the e6-pawn is weaker with the rook on d7. White can open the position in the Chicago defense without e5, his primary weapons are Nxb5  (this sacrifice pries open the a4-e8 diagonal and White is likely to win his material back after Ba4, Nd4, and Rac1)  and targeting the weak e6-pawn  (after Ng5, this can be hit by piece sacs or f4-f5)  . }
10. Be3 Rd7 11. Rac1
{ Threatening Nxb5.  Esserman's   11.Rfd1  is also strong. I think Rfd1 is less flexible than Rac1 because if White chooses the Ng5 and f4-f5 plan then White's rook will already be developed on f1  (the f-file is likely to open)  . Rac1 is useful regardless of the plan White chooses  (the main alternative plan is to go for the Nxb5 sacrifice)  . }
11... Bb7
{ White was threatening Nxb5 followed by Rxc6.   11...Na5  12.Nxb5  is a thematic and strong sacrifice.  White can also keep it simple with   12.Bc2  where White's compensation remains and Black also has to deal with ideas like b4 followed by a4 or the Nxb5 sacrifice.  12...Nxb3  13.axb3  and Black's best option is to accept that White has won his pawn back while keeping the initiative with  13...Bb7  because   13...axb5  loses to  14.Qxb5  Bb7  15.Bb6  Qa8  16.Ra1  Qb8  17.Rfc1  with Bc7 and Bxd6. }
12. Ng5
{ White prepares f4-f5-xe6 and has at least sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn due to his lead in development, open lines, and White's possibility of destroying the f7-e6 pawn chain  (with either f4-f5-fxe6 or a piece sac)  .   12.Nxb5!?  axb5  13.Qxb5  Nge7  14.Ba4  e5  15.Rfd1  is also dangerous and likely sound. }

{ The Taylor Defense. Black prepares to play ...Nf6, ...Bg4, ...Bxf3, and ...Ne5, liquidating. With 2 pairs of minors off the board, Black hopes that White won't have full compensation for the pawn.   6...Nf6?!  doesn't yet work because of  7.e5!  dxe5?!   7...d5?!  8.Bb5  Nd7  9.Qxd5±   7...Ng4!  8.exd6  exd6  9.O-O  +=  White will likely win the d6-pawn with an advantage due to his superior piece activity.

He'll win his pawn back with Nxe5 and rapidly develop his pieces while Black's king will be chased away with Nc7+. Note that Nb5 would not have been possible if Black had played ...a6 already; this is why ...a6 prepares ...Nf6.  9...Kd7?  illustrates some of the danger that Black is in.   9...Rb8  is best but White is still much better after  10.Nxe5  10.Nxe5+  Ke8  11.Nc7# }
7. O-O
{ 7.Bg5?!  Nf6  8.Bxf6  gxf6  9.O-O  e6  White has insufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. White has a lead in development, but Black has the bishop pair. The engine gives a Black advantage, IM Jeremy Silman prefers Black, the master-games database gives Black a plus score, and the lichess non-master games database gives Black a plus score. }
7... Nf6
{ Now that Nb5 has been prevented, Black can play ...Nf6 without fearing e5.   7...Bg4?  Black can't play ...Bg4 safely until ...Nf6 is played.  8.Bxf7+  Kxf7  9.Ng5+  Ke8  10.Qxg4+-  White has won his pawn back with a decisive initiative. }
8. Bf4
{ Interrupting Black's ...Bg4-xf3 and ...Ne5 plan, as White can meet ...Ne5 with Bxe5 and harass Black's queen on the d-file.   8.h3?!  e6!  is a Scheveningen up a tempo, as h3 isn't relevant if ...Bg4 isn't a threat.   8.Bg5?!  e6  9.Qe2  h6!  Black can take over the initiative, harassing both bishops with ...b5 and ...g5, followed by rapid development. White has insufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn.   8.Qe2?!  When Black plays ...Bg4-xf3, White will have to lose a tempo moving his queen again. It's better to delay the queen development to have an extra tempo if Black makes the ...Bg4-xf3 exchange.  8...Bg4  9.Rd1  e6  10.h3   10.Bf4  Qb8  scores well in master-games  (4/5 for Black)  and the engine gives Black a small edge.   10...Nh5  is the engine's main suggestion, claiming that White has no compensation for the pawn because Black can also fight for the initiative and Black is well developed.  10...Bxf3  11.Qxf3  Be7  12.Bf4  is a worse version of 8.Bf4 Bg4 9.h3 Bxf3 because White played captured on f3 in 2 moves instead of 1  (Qe2-xf3 instead of Qxf3)  . }
8... Bg4
{ 8...g6?!  9.e5!   9.Qb3!?   8...b5?!  9.Bxf7+!  Kxf7  10.e5!  Black has to give back the piece as retreating his f6-knight allows Qd5+ and ...dxe5 allows Nxe5 and Nxc6.   8...e6  9.Qe2  Be7  10.Rfd1  transposes into the Scheveningen.  10...Qc7  White can play a normal move like Bb3 or Rac1 with compensation, but  11.e5!?  Nh5  12.Bg5  Bxg5   12...dxe5  13.Bxe7  Qxe7  14.Nxe5  13.Nd5  is dangerous for Black, even if he's objectively better. However, Black can survive the complications with accurate play.  13...Qd8  14.Nxg5  Nf4  15.Qf3  Qxg5  16.Nc7+  Kd8  17.Nxa8  Nxe5  18.Qg3  Qxg3  19.hxg3  Nxc4  20.gxf4  This endgame probably favors Black objectively, but he had to walk a tightrope to get here, and White could have obtained standard compensation by playing 11.Rac1 or 11.Bb3.   8...e5!?  is an interesting alternative to 8...Bg4 which is worth exploring. Provided that Black is okay with the alternatives to 9.Ng5, this might be worth trying because Black has a sound and practical exchange sacrifice.  9.Ng5!  is probably objectively best, though for the unprepared player, best might be to just take the down-a-tempo Scheveningen with 9. Be3.   9.Be3!?  Be7  This is a Scheveningen down a tempo, as White usually wants to play Be3 in one move instead of two. I'm not sure how theoretically significant this is, but Black probably can equalize easier and if he really knows the structure well, fight for a theoretical advantage.   9.Bg5?!  Be7  White will have to lose a tempo on h3 to deal with ...Bg4 and ...Nd4, giving Black enough time to develop. The d5-square isn't enough compensation for the pawn here, especially since Black can play ...Be6 and is well developed.  9...exf4  10.Nxf7  Qe7  11.Nxh8  Ne5∞  This position has been reached in 4 master games as of now, Black scored 3/4. Stockfish 10 at depth 33 suggests that Black has full compensation, giving 3 lines that White has '0.00': 12.Bb3, 12.Rc1, and 12.Qa4+.  'Black has terrific compensation for the sacrificed exchange - that knight on e5 is an octopus. White must find quick counterplay, else he will be steamrolled on the kingside. The position is very complex, even for analyzing with an engine. After analyzing it somewhat carefully, I believe chances ( with best play ) are balanced, but apparently, this is not the type of game white aimed at when employing the Morra.' - IM Panayotis Frendzas }
9. h3 { Forcing Black's bishop to make a commitment. } 9... Bxf3
{ 9...Bh5  10.g4!   10.Qb3  is dangerous, but not objectively best, if Black knows everything. Black can obtain an advantage with correct play.  10...Qd7  11.Be2  Bxf3  12.Bxf3  Nd4  13.Qd1  e5  14.Bg5  Be7  15.Bxf6  Bxf6  16.Bg4  Ne6  17.f4  h5!  18.Bf5  g6!  if Black has memorized up to this point, he should be fine. The resulting complications likely favor Black.  19.Nd5  otherwise White will be statically worse without much counterplay.  19...Bd8  20.Bxe6  fxe6  21.fxe5  exd5  and the piece sac is likely unsound.  22.Qxd5  Rf8  White has a minus score in practice and the engine tends to fluctuate between equality and a serious Black advantage. There might be an improvement on this line, but the onus is on White to find it.  10...Bg6  11.e5  dxe5  12.Nxe5  White has full compensation for the sacrificed pawn in the resulting endgame due to his superior piece activity and pressure on the queenside open files. For example,  12...Nxe5  13.Bxe5  Qxd1  Black should trade queens because his queen can be targeted in the middlegame on the c and d-files.  14.Rfxd1  with Bf1-g2, Rac1, and f4. Nb5 is also a dangerous idea. }
10. Qxf3 e6
{ 10...Ne5?  11.Bxe5  This exchange is why White played Bf4 earlier.  11...dxe5  12.Rfd1  White has a decisive initiative. Black's queen has no safe squares and White can soon advance with Nd5. }
11. Rfd1
{ White threatens to play e5 and has the initiative. White has compensation for the sacrificed pawn in the form of his bishop pair, lead in development, and pressure on the c/d files. I'm not sure what the current theoretical status of this line is, but it's probably a fight between 'White has enough compensation' and 'Black is slightly better'. The Taylor Defense is playable for Black and if Black is really well prepared he might be able to fight for a theoretical advantage, but he can get more with the variation 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 Nge7 7.Bg5 h6! }

7... Ng6 8. h4
{ White sacrifices a pawn in order to deflect the d8-queen from the c7-square, increasing the effectiveness of Nb5. White is hoping that h5-h6 will allow him to increase his initiative. This interesting novelty was shown to be by the Chessable user plaule. }
8... Be7
{ The simplest path to an advantage.   8...Bc5  leads to interesting complications that probably favor Black, but I would prefer to keep it simple because Black has a static advantage. The Black bishop is safer on  e7  and helps defend the kingside.   8...Nxh4  is playable, but White gets a lot of compensation after  9.Nxh4  Qxh4  10.Nb5  Rb8  .   10...Qd8?  11.Bf4  For example,  11.Be3  Be7  12.g3  Qf6  13.e5  Qf5  14.Bd3  Qh3  15.Be2  Qf5  16.Bd3  with a draw. Black is the only one who can be objectively better after  8...Nxh4  , but he has to play accurately in order to obtain the advantage, if the advantage is even there. Black should be happy with the extra pawn that he has and attempt to neutralize the White initiative instead of grabbing a pawn and increasing it. }
9. h5 { The only consistent follow up. } 9... Nge5 10. Nxe5
{ Avoiding the exchange is similar in nature but gives Black the extra option of ...Nxf3+ and White is unable to play f4 without exchanging on e5. }
10... Nxe5 11. Be2 O-O
{ White has insufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Black will resume development  (...d6, either ...b6 and ...Bb7 or more likely ...a6 and ...b5 with ...Bb7)  . h6 can be met with ...g5! with ...f6 and ...Kh8 to come in the near future. If White delays h6 too long, Black can prevent it with ...h6. As long as he rapidly develops and follows the above plan without blundering material, Black should have the advantage. }

These complications are covered later in this chapter.   8...b6  followed by  ...Bb7  might be an improvement on  8...Be7  , as Black saves a tempo by not playing  ...Be7  because after  Nd6+  he will capture anyways. }
9. Nd6+ Bxd6 10. Qxd6 Qe7
{ I had initially written the following comment after 10...Qe7:  'Black is slightly better because he is ahead a pawn and White has no clear way of using his lead in development. White has no pawn levers, while Black will finish his development and utilize the e5-square for his knight. It's worth mentioning that if White avoids the trade of queens with 11. Qg3, Black should not play ...a6 and ...b5 because White would have Be3-c5 ideas (Black no longer has a dark-squared bishop), so he should prefer to develop his light-squared bishop with ...b6 and ...Bb7 in order to keep the c5-square under control.'However, I no longer agree with this comment as patricevezeau.0 showed me a concrete equalizer for White. The following line is the equalizer.   11.Qg3  O-O  12.h4  f6  13.h5  Nge5  14.Nxe5  Nxe5  15.Bb3  b6  16.Bf4  White's energetic play has given him at least equality.  I previously hadn't taken 7.0-0 seriously because neither IM Marc Esserman or IM Hannes Langrock considered it a serious option for White and it was very rare at master level  (Black won all 5 games)  . I thought that Black should be able to consolidate his setup with ...Ng6. This claim is true, if White doesn't have a concrete idea. Unfortunately for Black, he does. Nb5 is the concrete idea. 8...Be7 is too big of a concession - it allows White to win the bishop pair and equalize as a result. 8...b6 might be an improved version because Black can develop his queenside and be up a tempo when White plays Nd6+, but I don't think Black should allow Nd6 given the dynamic resources that patricevezeau.0 and his engines  (Stockfish and LeelaZero)  found after 8...Be7. The alternative 8...d6 gives Black the advantage, but play becomes extremely concrete after 9.Bg5 Qd7 10.Nbd4.   Is it worth learning the complications after 8...d6 to obtain the advantage, or are you okay with 8...Be7 and obtaining equality against accurate play and an advantage if White doesn't know the line? You decide. 8...Be7 is marked as an alternative. Learn this line and pause the later variations on 8.0-0 in this chapter if you are satisfied with 8...Be7. If you want to learn how to obtain an advantage against 8.Nb5, pause this variation and learn variations on 8...d6, which are in this chapter after this variation and the other alternative 8...b6. }

White's most dangerous idea to prepare the Bxh6 sacrifice with Qd2 or Qc1. }
14. Qc1

{ Forced.   18.N3h4  d5  gives Black a central initiative with equal material. }
18... Qxe7
{ Material is equal but Black has the initiative. This is another '0.00' position where Black is objectively better due because he is the one with a dynamic advantage/attacking chances against the opponent's king. Generally speaking, only the side with dynamics can be objectively better in 0.00 positions as the engine sees enough dynamics to at hold the balance but sometimes misses candidate moves or longer-term dynamic resources. AlphaZero  (and possibly LeelaZero)  doesn't share this weakness. See the 'ZeroZeroZero' section in the book 'Game Changer: AlphaZero's Groundbreaking Chess Strategies and the Promise of AI' by GM Matthew Sadler and WIM Natasha Regan for more on this topic. Here are some variations to back up my claim of a Black advantage.   19.Kh1  White prepares  g3  as  ...Nh3  wouldn't come with check.  19...Kh7  Black prepares for  g3  by defending his h6-pawn. Black will follow up with  ...f5  .   19...Kg7  is also strong, though after  20.Qe3  f5  White might have some counter-chances because  ...fxe4  can be met with  Qxe4+  .   19.g3  a6  20.Bc4   20.gxf4  axb5  21.fxe5  According to Stockfish,  21...dxe5  ,  21...Kh7  , and  21...Ra6  all give Black the advantage.   21.Kh1  Black has the initiative and an objective advantage.  21...Qf6  followed by  ...Rc4  is best, but  21...Kh7  intending  ...Rg8  is also a strong way to obtain an advantage.   21.f5  Kh7  with  ...Rg8+  ,  ...b6  and  ...Bb7  ,  ...Ra4  , etc.  20...b5  21.gxf4  bxc4  Black has the initiative and an objective advantage.

{ 'A bottomless pit opens, full of stars.

After ...Bxf3 and gxf3, the White king has no defenders and Black has three coordinated pieces attacking as ...Bh6 can be played at any moment. It is not unusual for Stockfish to evaluate many of the following variations as '0.00' if it isn't at a high enough depth or getting sufficient human guidance to know better. It is well known within some circles that '0.00' positions generally favor the attacker, especially if he has long-term compensation or a long-term attack. In this case, '0.00' means that Black can force a draw at will but is the only one who has an objective reason to play for more. 'The computer evaluation 0.00 generally means something close to the following: White has sacrificed material and no clear path to an advantage is available, but he can force a draw if he wants to, for example with a perpetual. it does not mean that nothing is going on in the position. For correspondence players, things are obviously a bit more complicated, as they will almost certainly be facing a computer-accurate defense! Here the following idea is useful. Look at the position with a human eye (Turn off the engine! Put the position on the board...) and find ideas that look dangerous. Then analyze them with the engine. You will find that not all 0.00 positions are defensible for the side with extra material. You just need to get past the horizon.' - GM John Shaw (Playing 1.e4 - Caro-Kann, 1...e5 and Minor Lines)'A couple of months ago, I was reviewing an excellent middlegame book of extremely complicated positions analyzed by a world-class grandmaster. The author mentioned a few times when the crisis in a particular position was at its highest that his engines were assessing the position as 0.00. Judging from his comments, he wasn't completely sure what to make of such an assessment which didn't always tally with his intuitive or practical feeling about the position. Any chess player who has analyzed complicated positions seriously with an engine running in the background will recognize this scenario. You summon your inner genius, think up a brilliant double-pawn sacrifice to set the board on fire... and your engine responds with an evaluation of 0.00 and a best line ending in you forcing a bizarre repetition of moves. And it's not just one engine: they all want you to force a repetition (though the ways to do so often vary). It's perhaps the most irritating and obstructive thing that these otherwise fantastic engines do during analysis. If an engine thinks that a draw by repetition is the best course, it's not going to chip in with interesting suggestions anymore. It's all on you to think of something and challenge the engine and force it to look outside its closed path. The meaning of these 0.00 evaluations is something puzzling. At the point when the possibilities should be boundless, a draw by repetition is apparently the best option. However, if you attempt to take on the engine and prove it to be wrong, then you often end up losing... or discovering more repetitions. The engines are just too strong and can usher away any of your objections. You can imagine therefore that I was intrigued when playing through games between AlphaZero and Stockfish to see many 0.00 evaluations whizzing past my eyes as my engines analyzed in the background.''AlphaZero's was normally the only dissenting voice: in positions assessed at 0.00 by the engines, its evaluation was often positive for itself. Putting that together with the score AlphaZero was making in such positions, it made me wonder whether a new chapter had been opened on 0.00 evaluations. (...) It would then be unsurprising if a percentage of such narrow 0.00 paths were in fact better for the attacker, and not holding for the defender.' - GM Matthew Sadler (Game Changer: AlphaZero's Groundbreaking Chess Strategies and the Promise of AI) }

You just need to get past the horizon.' - GM John Shaw (Playing 1.e4 - Caro-Kann, 1...e5 and Minor Lines)'A couple of months ago, I was reviewing an excellent middlegame book of extremely complicated positions analyzed by a world-class grandmaster. The author mentioned a few times when the crisis in a particular position was at its highest that his engines were assessing the position as 0.00. Judging from his comments, he wasn't completely sure what to make of such an assessment which didn't always tally with his intuitive or practical feeling about the position. Any chess player who has analyzed complicated positions seriously with an engine running in the background will recognize this scenario. You summon your inner genius, think up a brilliant double-pawn sacrifice to set the board on fire... and your engine responds with an evaluation of 0.00 and a best line ending in you forcing a bizarre repetition of moves. And it's not just one engine: they all want you to force a repetition (though the ways to do so often vary). It's perhaps the most irritating and obstructive thing that these otherwise fantastic engines do during analysis. If an engine thinks that a draw by repetition is the best course, it's not going to chip in with interesting suggestions anymore. It's all on you to think of something and challenge the engine and force it to look outside its closed path. The meaning of these 0.00 evaluations is something puzzling. At the point when the possibilities should be boundless, a draw by repetition is apparently the best option. However, if you attempt to take on the engine and prove it to be wrong, then you often end up losing... or discovering more repetitions. The engines are just too strong and can usher away any of your objections. You can imagine therefore that I was intrigued when playing through games between AlphaZero and Stockfish to see many 0.00 evaluations whizzing past my eyes as my engines analyzed in the background.''AlphaZero's was normally the only dissenting voice: in positions assessed at 0.00 by the engines, its evaluation was often positive for itself. Putting that together with the score AlphaZero was making in such positions, it made me wonder whether a new chapter had been opened on 0.00 evaluations. (...) It would then be unsurprising if a percentage of such narrow 0.00 paths were in fact better for the attacker, and not holding for the defender.' - GM Matthew Sadler (Game Changer: AlphaZero's Groundbreaking Chess Strategies and the Promise of AI) }

{ Considering that Black can draw at will and is fighting for a win while White is fighting for a draw, I'm claiming a Black advantage. But is this advantage sufficient for a decisive attack or can it be consolidated into a static advantage ? Explore the following variations to find out. Black has many alternatives in the variations that follow, but I tried to give the best ones for Black in order to show his advantage. }
22... Bg7
{ Black prepares to include his knight in the attack without hanging the dark-squared bishop. The advantage of 22... Bg7 over 22... Bh6 is that the f7-pawn isn't hanging with check if the Black bishop is on g7.   22...Bxd1  23.Rxd1  is also playable. is also playable. Stockfish fluctuates between equality and a Black advantage. Black is pressing for sure, but he probably doesn't have serious winning chances in a top-level computer assisted correspondence game. Maybe there is an advantage to be found here, but I'm not as convinced by it as  22...Bg7  as Black trades a powerful attacker for a less useful defender. After all, White will be forced to weaken his light-squares after Black plays  ...Bf3  .   Black is at least equal after the alternatives  22...Kg7  ,  22...Be6  ,  22...Nf4  ,  22...Bf3  ,  22...Kg8  ,  22...Bh5  ,  22...Be2  , and possibly other moves. Black is still able to force a draw at will and might have an advantage in the alternatives, although against a computer it can be hard to prove and know where the advantage is without deep analysis. If it says something, Stockfish 10 evaluates the position as better for Black after  22...Bf3  and equal after the alternatives, but this shouldn't be accepted without scrutiny if you are a top-level engine assisted correspondence player. To simplify this file, I won't be mentioning all of the Black alternatives from here on out. Analyzing for the absolute truth in all the alternatives beyond here is probably only relevant for computer assisted correspondence players, especially since Black has the advantage after  22...Bg7  . }
23. Rxd6
{ 23.Rd3  White intends to give back material with Rg3  (allowing ...Nf4-e2+)  , reducing the Black assault ratio.  23...Nf4  24.Rg3  Ne2+  Black has the initiative with approximately equal material and is objectively better. For example,  25.Kh1  Nxg3+  26.hxg3  Qd2   26...Qh6+  27.Kg1  Qd2  28.Qxa7  Qxb2  29.Rf1  Be6  30.a4  Qd4  31.Qa8  d5  32.exd5  Bxd5  Black is pressing, but with careful defense and computer assistance White is likely able to hold the draw.  27.f3  Qh6+  A useful in-between move to get the queen to the e3-square without losing time. It's important for the Black queen to be on e3 in order to defend the a7-pawn.   27...Be6  is playable, and Black is pressing here too, but White is a lot closer to equality after  28.Qxa7  as he can get counterplay with his passed a-pawn.  28.Kg1  Qe3+  29.Kh2  Be6  30.Rd1  Other moves allow ...d5 followed by ...Qh6+ and ...e4  (with the idea of ...Bd4+ and ...Qh1+)  .  For example,   30.a4?!  d5  31.exd5  Qh6+  32.Kg1  e4  33.Qxa7  exf3  34.gxf3  Qd2  35.Kh1  Bxd5∓  and Black has a powerful initiative that is most likely decisive with best play.  30...Qb6=+  Black is better. His bishop pair is worth at least as much as the rook and two pawns and the White queenside pawns are weak. The White king is possibly weak if Black gets the ...d5 break in later and Black can activate his dark-squared bishop with ...Bh6.   23.g3?  Too weakening. 23. g3 is a false '0.00'  (at low depth)  , Black is objectively winning.  23...Nh4  24.h3   24.gxh4  Qg6  25.h5  Bxh5+  26.Kf1  Bf3  27.Rd3  Qg2+  28.Ke1  Bg4!  29.f3  Be6  30.Qxa7  Qh1+  31.Kf2  Qxa1-+  Black has a decisive initiative, ...Qxb2+ is a threat and Black will activate his bishop pair with ...Bc4 and ...Bh6.   24.Rd3  Nf3+  25.Kg2  Qh5  26.h4  Nd4∓  with ...Bf3, ...Qg4, ...Nf5, ...Bf6  (or ...Bh6)  , possibly a piece sacrifice on h4, maybe ...f5-f4, etc.  24...Bxh3  25.Rd3  Qg4!  26.Qd8   26.Kh2  Bg2!  the point behind ...Qg4.  27.gxh4  Bxe4  28.Rg3  Qxh4+  29.Rh3  Qxh3+  30.Kxh3  Bxa8-+  26...Ng6  27.Re1  Bg2!  -+  Black has a winning initiative.

23... Nf4
{ This is recommended by Stockfish  (evaluating it at -.87 at depth 29)  . At human level, White is likely to get quickly crushed after both 23... Bf3 and 23... Nf4, but Stockfish finds concrete defensive resources which allow him to stay in the game. Even if White can draw this  (which isn't clear)  , the lines that I discovered here are too interesting to hide...   23...Bf3  is a simpler option, leading to a small Black advantage with correct play which leads to a small Black advantage after the following forced moves.  24.g3  Qg4  25.Rd3  Nh4  26.Qd8  Bxe4   26...f6  is an interesting alternative, but it's probably only going to lead to a draw by perpetual check after the following three only moves for White  27.Qd7!  f5  28.Qe7!  Bxe4  29.Rd7!  Nf3+  30.Kg2  and Black has nothing better than giving a perpetual.  27.Qxh4+  Qxh4  28.gxh4  Bxd3=+  Black is pressing in this endgame due to his superior pawn structure and bishop pair. Black will activate his king with ...Kg6 and activate his g7-bishop with ...e4. It's difficult for White to advance on the queenside due to the pressure on the long diagonals. Black's only weakness is the a7-pawn, but this is easily protected by ...a6. With careful play White is probably able to hold, but Black is playing for two results here. }

Can White defend ?  42.h4  Ne3!   42...Ne1  43.g5  fxg5  44.hxg5  Nd3  45.g6  Nxf2  46.Qxf2  Qd7  47.Qh4  gives White more defending chances than 42... Ne3.  43.Kh2  Qd4  44.Kh3  Nd5  45.h5  Nf4+  46.Kh4?   46.Kh2!  might draw, though it's still not fully clear. If this is true, Black should prefer  42...Ne1  or a different improvement  (Stockfish suggests many moves around here that supposedly give Black the advantage)  . An example variation could be  46...Qxb2  not forced - there are many alternatives and there might be a win in one of them.  47.h6!  Qb1  48.Qh4!  Nd3  49.Rg2!  Ne1  50.Qxf6!  Nxg2  51.Qd6+  Qd3  52.Qxd3+  Bxd3  53.Kxg2  Ke3  54.Kg3  with a draw.

This is not correct, Black's attack should win with best play.   50.Rxe2+  Kxe2  51.Qh2+  is easily winning for Black, there is no perpetual after 51... Kf1 or 51... Kd3.  50...Qg6  51.Qe1+  Ke3  52.Qc1+  Kxf3  53.Rf1+  Bxf1  54.Qxf1+  Ke3  55.Qe1+  Ne2  56.Qa5  Kf4  57.Qd2+  Kf3-+  47...Qd6  and Black's initiative is most likely decisive. For example,  48.Kg5   48.g5  Qd4  49.Kg3  Qd8  50.Kh4  Qe8  51.Rxe2+  Nxe2  52.h6  Ke3-+  with ...Nf4 or ...Qe7-b4 with ...e4.  48...Ne6+  49.Kh4  Qd8+  50.Kg3  f4+  51.Kg2  Ng5  52.Qh4  e4  53.fxe4  f3+  54.Kh1  Ke3  55.h6  Qa5  56.b4  Qxb4  57.Qxg5+  Kxf2  58.Qh4+  Ke3  59.Kg1  Qb1+  60.Kh2  Bd3  61.Qg3  Ke2  62.g5  Bxe4-+  Black's f-pawn and attack against the White king will likely end in a quick checkmate.  37...Nf3+  38.Kg2  Nxh4+∓  39.Kg1   39.Kg3  Nxf5+  40.Kg2   40.Kg4  Kxf2  Black's passed pawns and attack against the White king gives Black a decisive advantage.  40...Be4+  41.Kg1  Nh4-+  Black's position is winning. A sample continuation could be  42.b4  f5  43.a4  Nf3+  44.Kg2  f4  45.Ra2+  Nd2+  46.Kh3   46.Kg1  Bb1  47.Ra3  e4  46...Bd5  47.Rc2  e4  48.Kg4  e3  49.fxe3  fxe3  50.h4  Be4  51.Rc3  Kf2  52.Rxe3  Kxe3  with a technical win - Black can win all of the White pawns and checkmate with the B+N.  39...Bxf5  40.a4   40.Rc1  Be4   40...Nf3+  41.Kg2  Be4  42.Rc3   42.Kg3  with ...f5-f4.

O-O, Black has a plus score at amateur level  (lichess.org)  and both Esserman and Langrock dismiss 7. O-O as inferior. However, the Chessable user patricevezeau.0 convinced me that White has some concrete resources after 7... Ng6 8. Nb5 which should be considered as serious from the theoretical point of view, as if Black isn't careful, White might be able to equalize.   7.Nb5  Ng6  8.Nd6+?!   8.O-O  d6  transposes into  7.O-O  8...Bxd6  9.Qxd6  Qe7  10.Qg3?!

Black can choose to take advantage of his delayal of castling with  10...h5  followed by  ...h4  (if White plays h4 then he can try one of the other two resources)  or take advantage of White's delayal of castling with either  10...Qb4+  or  10...d5  . }

{ Black prevents Nd6+.   I had previously recommended  8...Be7  , as I was not scared of  Nd6+  . My recommended line continued  9.Nd6+  Bxd6  10.Qxd6  Qe7  with the comment 'Black is slightly better because he is ahead a pawn and White has no clear way of using his lead in development. White has no pawn levers, while Black will finish his development and utilize the e5-square for his knight. It's worth mentioning that if White avoids the trade of queens with  11.Qg3  , Black should not play  ...a6  and  ...b5  because White would have Be3-c5 ideas ( Black no longer has a dark-squared bishop ), so he should prefer to develop his light-squared bishop with  ...b6  and  ...Bb7  in order to keep the c5-square under control.' However, patricevezeau.0 did deep analysis at a high depth with the engines LeelaZero and Stockfish, concluding that if White plays very energetically he will have enough play to obtain at least equality. The line where White equalizes runs  11.Qg3  O-O  12.h4  f6  13.h5  Nge5  14.Nxe5  Nxe5  15.Bb3  b6  16.Bf4  and I agree that White has sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. For this reason, I would like to prevent White from playing  Nd6+  . I'd analyzed  8...d6  before publishing the course and concluded that Black was better, but I also thought that Black was better after  8...Be7  and chose the simpler option. I was wrong about  8...Be7  , so Black should learn the complications after  8...d6  if he wants to obtain the advantage.   Stockfish at a high depth thinks that Black can also fight for the advantage with  8...b6  , but I'd rather prevent  Nd6+  . Why give up the bishop pair unless you gain something concrete in return  ? }

10. Nbd4
{ White's plan is to target the c6-knight with Bb5 and Rc1. White might also harass the g6-knight with h4-h5. In the lines that follow, Black has many alternatives which give him at least equality, but I wanted to give the theoretically strongest line in order to prove a Black advantage.   According to Stockfish, all of White's compensation will evaporate with a loss of a tempo - he needs concrete play. If White plays a slow move like  10.Re1  , he will have no compensation for the sacrificed pawn and Black will play  ...a6  ,  ...h6  , and  ...Be7  with a solid position and extra pawn. The d7-queen doesn't prevent Black from developing his light-squared bishop because Black is able to play  ...b5  followed by  ...Bb7  .   10.h4  is too slow.  10...a6  11.Nbd4  Be7  other moves give Black the advantage as well, but there is no need to stop  h5  .  12.h5  Nge5  White has failed to obtain the concrete play he was aiming for and does not have sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Black will castle and finish his queenside development next.   10.Rc1  a6  11.Nbd4  Be7  one of many moves that give Black the advantage. Black is okay with the exchange on  e7  because White doesn't have  Bb5  or  Nb5  . }
10... h6
{ Black prepares to play ...Be7.   10...Be7  is playable but after  11.Bxe7  Black will have to retreat his g-knight with  11...Ngxe7  and this gives White enough activity for compensation. Black would like to be able to play  ...Nge5  if needed. }
11. Be3 Be7
{ Black prepares to castle kingside. As previously mentioned, White needs concrete dynamic resources to prove compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Otherwise, Black will castle followed by developing his queenside  (...a6 and ...b5, ...Bb7, ...Rc8, possibly ...Nxd4 or ...Nge5)  . As a general rule in the lines that follow, a loss of a tempo for White means losing all of his compensation for the sacrificed pawn. }

White's most dangerous idea to prepare the Bxh6 sacrifice with Qd2 or Qc1. }
14. Qc1

{ 'A bottomless pit opens, full of stars. Stars uncountable, a bottomless abyss.' - Mikhail LomonosovBlack sacrifices his rook to start a kingside attack and damage the structure in front of the White king with ...Bxf3. After ...Bxf3 and gxf3, the White king has no defenders and Black has three coordinated pieces attacking as ...Bh6 can be played at any moment. It is not unusual for Stockfish to evaluate many of the following variations as '0.00' if it isn't at a high enough depth or getting sufficient human guidance to know better. It is well known within some circles that '0.00' positions generally favor the attacker, especially if he has long-term compensation or a long-term attack. In this case, '0.00' means that Black can force a draw at will but is the only one who has an objective reason to play for more. 'The computer evaluation 0.00 generally means something close to the following: White has sacrificed material and no clear path to an advantage is available, but he can force a draw if he wants to, for example with a perpetual. it does not mean that nothing is going on in the position. For correspondence players, things are obviously a bit more complicated, as they will almost certainly be facing a computer-accurate defense! Here the following idea is useful. Look at the position with a human eye (Turn off the engine! Put the position on the board...) and find ideas that look dangerous. Then analyze them with the engine. You will find that not all 0.00 positions are defensible for the side with extra material. You just need to get past the horizon.' - GM John Shaw (Playing 1.e4 - Caro-Kann, 1...e5 and Minor Lines)'A couple of months ago, I was reviewing an excellent middlegame book of extremely complicated positions analyzed by a world-class grandmaster. The author mentioned a few times when the crisis in a particular position was at its highest that his engines were assessing the position as 0.00. Judging from his comments, he wasn't completely sure what to make of such an assessment which didn't always tally with his intuitive or practical feeling about the position. Any chess player who has analyzed complicated positions seriously with an engine running in the background will recognize this scenario. You summon your inner genius, think up a brilliant double-pawn sacrifice to set the board on fire... and your engine responds with an evaluation of 0.00 and a best line ending in you forcing a bizarre repetition of moves. And it's not just one engine: they all want you to force a repetition (though the ways to do so often vary). It's perhaps the most irritating and obstructive thing that these otherwise fantastic engines do during analysis. If an engine thinks that a draw by repetition is the best course, it's not going to chip in with interesting suggestions anymore. It's all on you to think of something and challenge the engine and force it to look outside its closed path. The meaning of these 0.00 evaluations is something puzzling. At the point when the possibilities should be boundless, a draw by repetition is apparently the best option. However, if you attempt to take on the engine and prove it to be wrong, then you often end up losing... or discovering more repetitions. The engines are just too strong and can usher away any of your objections. You can imagine therefore that I was intrigued when playing through games between AlphaZero and Stockfish to see many 0.00 evaluations whizzing past my eyes as my engines analyzed in the background.''AlphaZero's was normally the only dissenting voice: in positions assessed at 0.00 by the engines, its evaluation was often positive for itself. Putting that together with the score AlphaZero was making in such positions, it made me wonder whether a new chapter had been opened on 0.00 evaluations. (...) It would then be unsurprising if a percentage of such narrow 0.00 paths were in fact better for the attacker, and not holding for the defender.' - GM Matthew Sadler (Game Changer: AlphaZero's Groundbreaking Chess Strategies and the Promise of AI) }

{ Black has the initiative and White is unable to take the offered bishop due to ...Qxf3 followed by ...Nf4. Black has an abundance of attacking ideas such as ...Qg5, ...Nf4/...Nh4, ...Bh6, etc. This initiative is enough for Black to force a draw by perpetual check at will, but is it enough for an objective advantage? See the 21.Qxa8 advanced theory section for more details. }

{ Just like in 21. Ng5+, I won't be mentioning every alternative that Black has which gives him at least equality. There are too many for it to be worth listing - just turn on your engine and count the '0.00's. In these, Black is the only one who can be better - the computer is finding concrete defensive resources for White and sometimes there is a way around those. }
21... Bxf3
{ Black is playing for an attack against the king with a draw in the pocket  (via perpetual check)  and chances to play for more  (even against many engine suggestions)  . White has no way to play for more than a draw and is trying to defend. Therefore, I claim a Black advantage. Is this advantage decisive or can it be consolidated into a static advantage ? This is the question that the following variations attempt to answer. The analysis isn't completely comprehensive and there might be improvements somewhere, but it goes to show that Black is pressing even if White plays like a computer and that '0.00' doesn't always mean draw. White fails to hold many of the following '0.00' positions. The onus is on White to prove that he can equalize.   After many false trails  (and 20+ hrs of analyzing with the computer)  , I believe that I found ways for White to defend against Black's advantage and hold a draw, at least in the following 'recommendations'. Black has many alternatives, of course, and White is playing for a draw in every line. Many engine '0.00' lines can't be held by White, but some can. Not every advantage is decisive with best play and I also don't think this one is, but forces White to find some accurate defensive resources, and sometimes the defensive resources that Stockfish declares '0.00' on aren't sufficient. }

{ This is probably a more accurate move order. If White castles, Black can avoid the 'LeelaZero compensation' variation.   LeelaZero's discovery is that after  8...g5  9.Bg3  a6  White is able to play  10.h4!  and the complications after  10...g4  11.Nd4  h5  12.Nxc6  Nxc6  13.O-O  are probably acceptable for White, despite Stockfish's skepticism. The burden of proof is on White to show compensation, but it seems like with accurate play it is there. Therefore, it is best to avoid the  h4  lines. Credit to the chess.com user FM catask for bringing this variation to my attention. }

{ Black has transposed into my previously recommended variation without allowing h4.   Black should delay advancing his d-pawn in order to avoid giving White a target down the d-file.

For a model game in this variation, see Edward Farrington vs. Vladimir Lazarev.

For more details on how to play this position, see the  8.Bh4  theory.   The most critical move is  8.Nb5!  threatening  Nd6  checkmate.  8.Nb5  is the main reason why  ...a6  tends to be played before  ...Nge7  at master level.

Black has the initiative due to White's exposed g3-bishop and will continue the kingside pawn storm next. Black is also up a pawn !   12.h3  is passive. Black could resume development with ...Bg7  (where White has no compensation for the sacrificed pawn)  or even continue his pawn storm with  12...g4  13.hxg4  hxg4  14.Nh2  and give back the pawn to open the kingside and dominate the light-squares. For example,  14...Bg7  15.Nxg4  Qg5  with ideas of ...Nf4 and ...Nd4.   15...Nce5  followed by ...b5, ...Bb7, ...Rc8, and ...Qb6/...Qg5 also gives Black a powerful initiative.  12...g4  13.Bxf8  Kxf8  Black is up a pawn and has the initiative. White's pieces are ineffective in the center because White has no pawn levers and Black can pawn storm on the kingside. It is easy for Black to finish his development  (...b5, ...Bb7, ...Rc8, ...Kg7)  , so White has no compensation for the sacrificed pawn or Black's initiative.   11.Qd2  g4!  12.Nd4  Qg5  forces White to lose time retreating or trades queens into a pawn down endgame. Black had other favorable options  (like ...b5, ...Nce5, and ...h5 among others)  but this is the simplest.

11... d6
{ Black should not accept the offered knight because it would open the e-file against Black's king and White's pieces would finally have open lines to exploit the lead in development. Black plays ...d6 in order to defend White's Nc7+ threat. It is okay for Black to play ...d6 now because Nd5 interfered with the d1-queen's pressure on the d6-pawn, so it would be harder for White to exploit the weakness. }
12. Ne3 Be7
{ White has insufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn and Black is on the verge of consolidating as he will rapidly develop with ...O-O, ...b5, ...Bb7, ...Rc8, and ...Nce5 and has ideas of pawn storming on the kingside to fight for the initiative.   12...h5  is an interesting option to fight for the initiative. White would be forced to play  13.h3  and other than developing moves like ...Be7/...Nce5  (which also give Black the advantage)  , Black could give back the pawn to obtain the initiative by playing  13...g4  14.hxg4  h4  15.Bh2  h3  and White is the one who has to defend. }

{ White has a lead in development, but not enough open lines to exploit it. Black's static advantages  (bishop pair, central pawn majority, pressure down the h-file)  are more important.

It's worth mentioning that Black has the d4-outpost due to his central pawn majority  (Black can later play ...e5 to support the d4-square)  , a direct consequence of White having earlier sacrificed his c-pawn. }

{ Black increases his control over the d4-square, the main weak point of the Morra.  'Only a keen eye can spot the one true defect in White's starting position: the d4-square.

14... Rh4 15. Bb3 Bh6 16. f4 Rxf4 17. Nxe6 Bxe6 18. Kb1 Rd8 19. Rxd8 Kxd8 20.
