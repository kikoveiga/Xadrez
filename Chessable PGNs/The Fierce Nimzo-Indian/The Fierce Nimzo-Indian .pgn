1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ Welcome to The Fierce Nimzo-Indian!  In this course, I'll present to you my favorite defense against 1. d4: the Nimzo-Indian. I personally always struggled with finding a good opening against 1. d4 that suited my style: I want to play something sound, but not boring or drawish. An opening that allows me to fight for a win with Black! If this is what you are looking for, you have come to the right place.  I truly believe that the Nimzo-Indian is the perfect weapon to fight 1. d4: it is strategically complex, resilient enough and has scope for playing it in a dynamical way. I love its flexibility and the attacking positions that it gives me. And I hope that after studying this course, it will also become your favorite weapon!  What can be expected in this course?  • The variations are analysed by constantly using the neural network of Lc0  (Leela Chess)  and the depth of asmFish  (latest version, often analysing till depth 45)  , with the focus on searching for the truth of the positions. The aim was always to find a position with some sort of imbalance, giving the possibility to fight and play for the win!  • Strategic guides are offered to understand the ideas for both sides and to help your decision-making in unfamiliar territory.   • Focus on complex and unbalanced play to create more chances to play for a win in your games.   • Many novelties to try out.   • Great variety of positions to enhance your knowledge of typical positions, structures and tactical patterns. I really hope that after studying this course, you have not only mastered the Nimzo-Indian, but have also learned a lot of ideas that you can apply in other openings/positions as well!  • Alternative suggestions have sometimes been presented to choose according to your goal for the game. For example, sometimes I give a sharp and a more quiet alternative, or two options that you can choose between, to avoid preparation from opponents.   I also often added extra analysis, that is not trainable but included in the reference sections at the beginning of each chapter. Those will give you a full overview of all the variations in a chapter, plus some extra lines that you can look into if you are interested.   • Model games with annotations.   How is the course structured?  After this introduction chapter, there will first be a quickstarter guide. Here you will get a basic overview of all of the variations in the course and already get a good understanding of what to do in most positions. I highly recommend you to study it!  After that, it is time to look at the actual theory chapters. In the first and second chapter, we'll start with the important move of 4. Qc2, also known as the Classical Variation. In general, we will start with the most common moves and only cover White's less frequent tries at the end, so you will immediately start learning what is most relevant.   The first chapter starts with the main line of  4.Qc2  O-O  5.a3  Bxc3  6.Qxc3  b6.  Although this option is the most frequently played, it hasn't @@StartBracket@@recently@@EndBracket@@ been covered that much in literature or multimedia, as the modern focus often is on set-ups involving the move  ...d5.  This variation can give rise to very interesting play, and has been the backbone of the repertoires of players on club levels as well as at the very top. Thanks to the innovative ideas of modern engines, there's a lot fresh territory to be covered here!  See here.   The second chapter concludes  4.Qc2  O-O  with coverage of  5.Nf3  d6!?   and  4.Qc2  O-O  5.e4  d6!?   as well as the less common moves set-ups  4.Qc2  O-O  5.Bg5  ,  5.f3  and  5.g3.  The option of playing ...d6 against 5. Nf3 and 5. e4 has not been covered in literature to my knowledge, and should provide for entertaining play compared to the more solid options Black normally plays.  Find out more here.   In the third chapter there will be coverage of  4.e3  , the currently most popular move named after Akiva Rubinstein. I'll propose to go  4...O-O  and then against  5.Nge2  the move  5...c6  , which often involves placing the bishop on  c7  and even involves lines with sacrificial play. This is a very exciting variation and I expect you will have a lot of fun games there!  See for example this line.   Against the most popular line of  4.e3  O-O  5.Bd3  , I'll suggest  5...c5  , introducing the dynamic Keres variation, which will start after  6.Nf3  b6!?.  Of course, the less popular but still solid option of  6.Ne2  will also be covered in detail.   The fourth chapter contains suggestions against  4.Nf3  , which is also sometimes mentioned as the Kasparov variation. It's convenient for us that we can often transpose to other lines by playing  4...b6  and this chapter will cover White's most common moves either leading to transposition or moves that have some individual value.  See here.   In the fifth chapter, we'll dive right into  4.Bg5  , also named the Leningrad variation. Black has the convenient option of transposing to suggestions already mentioned before by also replying  4...b6  in this case. In this chapter, we'll deal with all the moves White commonly plays before transposition.  Check it out here.   Against the more aggressive line of  4.f3  , that has several names attached to it, we'll play aggressive too by playing  4...c5  5.d5  and now we delay the pawn move on the flank @@StartBracket@@...b5@@EndBracket@@ for one move by playing  5...d6.  The positions will become very entertaining and there will be many new suggestions along the way in Chapter six. Study this chapter well!   In chapter seven, we'll deal with the ancient but still aggressive Sämisch variation:  4.a3.  Black can play for an attack on the c4-pawn by playing  4...Bxc3+  5.bxc3  b6  , while keeping a close watch at White's aggressive intentions. I'll suggest a scheme on how to deal with White's intentions as well as how to combine this with the attack on the queenside. The ideas in this variation will be recurring throughout this whole course, and you will get acquainted with them in the General Considerations later in this Introduction chapter already.   Moving on to playing the bishop to  d2  on the fourth move:  4.Bd2  . Although this move may look modest, it is actually a good practical weapon and has regularly been popping up in games on the elite level. It also has been recommended lately by the latest version of Stockfish, but frankly I don't see any problems after my suggestion in the main line, and for reasons of efficiency, a lot of our theoretical preparation will transpose to the Rubinstein variation since combining Bd2 and e3 is quite logical.  You can find the lines here.   In chapter 9, we'll focus on the so-called Spielmann variation starting with  4.Qb3.  Although it lost quite a share of popularity over the last decades, it is good to be aware of how to deal with this set-up. The best move looks to be  4...c5  , and there's plenty of attacking chances in the main lines.  See here.   The theoretical part will be finished by covering the rare moves in chapter 10. Although you might not even face them in your entire career, a quick look at it won't cause you to be surprised at the board as you will be ready to meet any sensible move White can play!  The course will end with a discussion of model games with annotations, to get an even better feeling for the thematic ideas and structures in this opening, although it of course never hurts to continue your journey by looking at recent games in these lines.  I am very interested in hearing your feedback and suggestions for this course - so feel free to leave a message on the course forum, and I'll do my best to respond to everything!  Last but not least, I want to thank everyone who supported me in the creation of this course. It has been truly invaluable.   I hope studying this course and trying the variations in your own  (online)  games will bring you a lot of joy - it was certainly a pleasure for me to create it!  Maaike Keetman,  October 2020 }

{ In this informational line, I'd like to dive into the strategic ideas that both sides use in the first moves of the Nimzo-Indian, as the decisions that are made here impact the variations later on as well. }
1. d4
{ Yes, we already start at move one! White seizes space along the d-file, and attacks the important e5- and c5-squares. The eternal strategy of controlling the central squares of the board continues with the intended e2-e4 on the next move. }
1... Nf6 { Black logically prevents it and now controls d5 and e4. } 2. c4
{ If White prepares e2-e4 with  2.Nc3  Black would play  2...d5  and the fight for e4 didn't go as planned. White can fight for the square e4 by attacking the d5-square first. }
2... e6
{ Going ...d5 now doesn't work that well as White would capture it and follow up with e2-e4. Starting with 4. Nf3 and only then follow up with e2-e4 is equally possible and also gives White an advantage. The move 2... e6 opens the diagonal for the bishop and supports ...d5 or ...Bb4 on the next move. }
3. Nc3 { White would like to continue his central strategy with e2-e4. } 3...
Bb4
{ Black develops and pins the knight to control the e4-square. The pressure on c3 disrupts White's natural development a bit as Black is ready to take on c3 at an opportune moment. However, such exchanges in chess are extremely important and have long-term repercussions. If Black is willfully ready to give up the bishop pair, we should clearly understand the reason why. This is because in chess literature @@StartBracket@@for example the works of Larry Kaufman or John Watson@@EndBracket@@ compelling arguments are made why the bishop pair is actually better than two knights.   Well, in the majority of positions in the Nimzo-Indian, Black hopes to inflict a doubled pair of pawns on c3 and c4. White could play set-ups that prevent such a weakening of the structure, but generally these efforts take time, thereby increasing Black's advantage in development. Moreover, Black tends to use set-ups that are a bit more closed and limit the effectiveness of the bishops, and in general the knights will feel more at home in such positions.   In other words, Black only tends to exchange on c3 if there is another structural and/or dynamical advantage in return. In a lot of the repertoire suggestions, White's pawns will be doubled and this is a good moment to discuss the contours of this kind of a struggle. }
4. a3 { This is one example of where the pawns get doubled. } 4... Bxc3+ 5.
bxc3
{ Black created long-term weaknesses in White's pawn structure, and didn't lose any time by retreating the bishop for example to e7. These weaknesses tend to have a lasting impact throughout the whole game, and the pawns have lost some of their flexibility. Additionally, they are more difficult to move because when they do, several weak squares are left behind. In some lines such as the 4. g3 variation, White even sacrifices a pawn with c4-c5 to get rid of the doubled pawn. In a lot of variations, we play ...b6, which makes it harder for White to push ahead with c4-c5 as, in this case, Black can simply capture it.  This brings us to another strategic concept for Black: if one of White's ideas is to play c4-c5, Black should definitely consider making sure the pawn never moves there in the first place. In many lines of the repertoire, Black advances his own c-pawn to prevent this. This creates contact with the d4-pawn: Black may capture on d4 and expose the doubled pawns to an attack on the c-file. Furthermore, after fixing the pawn on c4, it can be targeted by ...b6, ...Ba6 and ...Na5.   Nevertheless, Black should be aware of White's bishop pair as bishops tend to flourish in open and semi-open positions. White's dark-squared bishop is unopposed, meaning he's best off placing the pawns on light squares in accordance with Capablanca's rule. This makes the unopposed bishop stronger in the attack while at the same time limiting the remaining black bishop. For that reason, White is not reluctant to exchange light-squared bishops. In a lot of the lines we'll therefore see White placing the pawns on d5, e4 and f3.   In light of all this, Black should take the role of White's dark-squared bishop seriously. In general, Black is happy to exchange one of the bishops as they lose some of their strength if they are not paired. The placement of the pawns on light squares to complement the dark-squared bishop is an important part of White's central strategy, and most of White's efforts will be to either increase the control over e4 by adding supporters or exchanging Black's defenders. Black must respect this strategy and fight just as hard for the center as well by either attacking it or controlling the space behind it.   As Black gained contr ol over e4 after playing ...Nf6, White can try to prepare play in the center by f2-f3, and rather aggressively play e2-e4 on the next move. In some lines, Black is able to take advantage of this early advance by playing ...Nh5 with the threat of ...Qh4+ and ...f5 to counter White's advance, although in other lines this may not be in Black's interest. Apart from using the f-pawn, White can also prepare the advance of the e-pawn with his minor pieces like in the 4. e3 @@StartBracket@@Rubinstein@@EndBracket@@ variations or Classical lines of 4. Qc2. We'll certainly see how many flexible ways White has at his disposal, for example the knight on g1 that goes to h3 and back to f2 in order to support e4.   White’s aggressive plan of pushing e4 and advancing the pawn even further means that Black must have knowledge of how to correctly play in the center. There are several ways to do this. For example, one way could be to blockade the e4-pawn, like in 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4 d6, where later on ...e6-e5 is played, stopping the e-pawn in its tracks. In the 4. e3-lines, it is common that Black isolates the d-pawn, and then blockades the square in front of it. In the next chapters, we'll certainly see what ways Black has at his disposal to fight in the center.   I hope this strategic overview is useful and provides you with a good foundation to start learning the Nimzo-Indian! }

{ I thought it would be fun to start this course with Nimzowitsch's first win with this opening, so here we go! }
1. d4 e6 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ In his book about Nimzowitsch, Per Skjoldager has notes from Nimzowitsch himself about this move. Nimzowitsch writes that he first came across this move in 1913/1914 @@StartBracket@@and indeed, he played it once in 1914 but didn't return to the opening until this game@@EndBracket@@ and that Tartakower called this 'The ideal Queen's Gambit'. Instead of actually playing ...d5, Black claims that the threat is stronger than the execution and will wait a bit before playing it. }
4. Bd2
{ Not one of the main moves these days, but a respectable variation.   4.Qb3  Nimzowitsch faced this move 10 out of 34 times, while these days it has gone out of fashion. A clear example of how theory changes over time! }
4... O-O 5. Nf3 d6
{ Nimzowitsch awards himself an exclamation mark for this move, saying that this move 'can only be made by someone who thoroughly understands the position'. You will see the move ...d6 instead of ...d5 a lot in this course, so I guess that means we will all have a very deep understanding of the positions here!   According to Nimzowitsch, the idea is to wait and see what White will do with his bishop on f1.   It has to be said though that in this specific position, I'll be recommending the move 5... b6 as you will see in chapter 9. }
6. e3 b6
{ White has made clear that he will develop his bishop to d3 @@StartBracket@@or e2, but d3 is more logical@@EndBracket@@. Therefore, Nimzowitsch is fine with playing ...b6 as there are no longer any ideas for White to fianchetto his bishop and oppose the long diagonal. }
7. Bd3 Bb7 8. Qc2 Bxf3
{ A daring but interesting manoeuvre according to Nimzowitsch. I will generally advise against such captures in this course, as the opened g-file will give White good attacking chances. Instead, we will try to get variations where Black is the one who is attacking! }
9. gxf3 Nbd7 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 c6

12. O-O-O d5 13. e4 g6

14. cxd5 cxd5 15. e5 Nh5 16. h4 a5

{ White understandably wants to open lines with f5, but he forgot about his own safety. }
19... b5
{ A well-timed attacking move. White is now regretting not playing the propylactic move Kb1 earlier and has trouble meeting ...b4. }
20. Bxb5
{ The most logical move, but Black has a very surprising trick now.   20.Kb1  b4  21.axb4  axb4  22.Bxb4  Qd8  Black is down two pawns, but the open files towards the king should give plenty of compensation. }
20... Rab8
{ 20...Nc5 !  A beautiful move that was sadly not spotted by Nimzowitsch.  21.dxc5  What else? The knight was coming to e4.  21...Qxc5  Now the deadly ...d4 is threatened and the bishop on b5 is also hanging, which means that Black wins back the piece with a lot of activity and threats towards the white king.  22.Bd7  Rc7  does not really change the situation. }
21. Be2 Nb6
{ Leaving the knight on h5 en prise! But the attack is more important than material. }
22. Kd1

{ A very harmonious square for the knight: not blocking the bishop on b7. } 10.

{ Very consistent: White is aiming for e4. } 10... h6
{ In many lines, it is useful to toss this move in and chase away the bishop before undertaking action. }
11. Bh4 c5
{ Black often has to decide between going ...c5 or ...e5 to attack the center. You can use this as a guideline to decide: with a pawn on e3, we like to play e5 to open the e-file. In this case however, it is clear that White will go e2-e4 when the e-pawn will be stable - and as Black rather avoids a stable center for White, ...c5 to counterattack seems sensible. }
12. e4
{ 12.e3  This makes very little sense, as White has played  f3  to prepare the e4-push.  12...cxd4= }
12... Rc8
{ Here we see one of the disadvantages of the Qc2xc3 manoeuvre: the queen is often vulnerable on c3, and we will often aim to use the pin of the c4-pawn by pushing ...b5 or ...d5 at some point. }
13. Bd3
{ The most popular move. In the theory section, we also look at  13.dxc5  when I propose the interesting  13...Rxc5  !?.  See here. }
13... cxd4
{ Opening up the c-file and making room for the knight to come to c5. } 14.
Qxd4 Nc5
{ Black now has the surprising idea to play ...e5, and go to e6 with the knight. All of this comes with tempo. }
15. Be2 e5
{ And Black blockades the center and aims to get the knight to e6. Note that the d5-square is weakened now, which is often a concern in these Sicilian type of positions. However, the knight on d2 is badly placed to take advantage of this. All of these moves were played by Karjakin against Carlsen in 2011 and Black soon got a promising position. See here. }

9. Be2 { The main move. } 9... Ne4
{ The same idea as in many other lines: once again, the key square is e4. } 10.
Qc2 Nd7 11. O-O f5
{ This is an important set-up for Black which will be recurring throughout the course. Black establishes some advantage in space on the kingside which may later help with building up an attack there. Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6.   These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn.   White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one at e4, and play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2.   In this Quickstarter, we'll look at 12. Ne1 and 12. b4. }
12. Ne1
{ This retreat is mainly to neutralize the knight that is on White's half of the board by f2-f3. Although going to e1 looks rather passive, White does not allow Black to exchange on d2 and play can become sharp. }
12... Qh4
{ This is my main recommendation and it is probably the best move objectively speaking. However, the lines are quite complex and it may be a little too sharp for your taste. If that's the case, you can look at the calmer alternative 12... c5 which I analyse here. }
13. f3 { This is White's usual reply: sticking to the plan. } 13... Ng5
{ A strong square for the knight, and there will often be ...Nh3+ or ...Nxf3+ sacrifices. The key idea is to bring in the rook by means of ...Rf6-Rh6. The theoretical lines here are very exciting, so make sure to study them well! }

Structurally, Black often tries to set the pawn majority on the queenside in motion, and make sure White's pawns in the center do not move further up the board. Black can also borrow an idea of the lines in the 4. f3-variation where we play for ...Nh5 and ...f5 on some occasions. }

{ Black does not show his hand in the center yet and chooses a flexible move. }
5. Ne2 { White intends to play a2-a3 quickly to recapture with the knight. }
5... c6
{ This move has become quite popular in recent years. The idea behind it is that Black can retreat the bishop to c7 where it stands well. We are not scared of the center that White can build up - on the contrary, we are going to attack it or use it to open up the game. This variation has strong potential to get double-edged positions and even piece sacrifices. }

d5 { Fighting back in the center. } 9. cxd5
{ This has been the most popular move but it rather helps Black to develop freely in the center and on the kingside. }
9... exd5
{ This structure outlines several Black's potential ideas on the kingside: ...h5 followed by ...h4 is played often, the knight on d7 is likely to go to f8 later and maneuvered to e6 or g6 later on, and the one from f6 already is ready for ...Ng4. The queen can be placed on squares like for example h4, g5 or d6 depending on circumstances. Also, not uncommon is to play ...g6 and ...Kg7, and use the h-file  (after ...h4xg3)  like in the games Kraemer - Fedorchuk, 2017 and Klapwijk - Ernst, 2018. Let's take a look at a few more moves: }

7. Bh4 e5
{ A very exciting move. Out of almost 1000 games, this has only been played 9 times! Black scored a stunning 7,5 out of 9 and 5 of the black players were above 2600, so this is definitely a serious move.   Instead, most players opted for calmer moves such as  7...c5  ,  7...O-O  or  7...Bxc3.  The advantage of playing e5 though is that it opens up the e-file, and we will often play ...Qe7 to use that file and then castle queenside. What's so pleasant about 7... e5 is that the most logical move of 8. dxe5 is actually not so good for White! But on top of that, other tries are also fine for us, so it is just a very strong move not only psychologically but objectively as well. }
8. dxe5
{ Clearly the most logical test. Black is giving up a pawn, so White should seriously consider taking it - especially since it also attacks a pinned knight! }
8... Bxc3
{ It is important to first damage White's structure before going  g5  , since after  8...g5  White can play  9.Qb3  when our pieces are hanging. }
9. bxc3 g5 { The point, as otherwise we would just lose a piece. } 10. Bg3
{ Taking on  f6  would not help White, as after  10.exf6  gxh4  we will get back the pawn on f6 right away, and can then play ...Nc6 and castle. If White ever tries to castle kingside, the opened g-file could prove very useful for our rook! }
10... Nh5
{ We are currently down a pawn, but our pieces are active and White has two doubled pawns - and since we will soon take on g3, he will have 3  (!)  doubled pawns. The e5-pawn in particular is a target. Let's look at some replies by White. }
11. e4
{ Grabbing the center, but now White can't maintain his pawn surplus.   11.e3  is another try and is covered in the theory, but we'll reply in the same way. }
11... Nxg3 12. hxg3 Qe7
{ Attacking the pawn on e5, which can only be defended by giving up the e4-pawn instead. Thanks to the strong plan of going ...Na6 and ...O-O-O with active play, I would prefer Black here! }

For this reason, I have analysed two different set-ups for Black: either to take on c3 with the bishop, or to play 7... exd5 which is my main recommendation. Take a look at 7... Bxc3 as well though if you are interested! }
7... exd5

8. cxd5 a6 { We have to defend the pawn on b5 after all. } 9. a4
{ The best try.   Mamedyarov opted for  9.a3  but after  Ba5  he went  10.a4  after all. There was a downside though: now Black had the chance to play  b4  and Rapport won a fantastic game.  Check it out here! }

11. Nge2 a5
{ The a-pawn may seem a bit weak, but it is now safely protected by the bishop and I don't see any way for White to win it. }
12. Ng3 O-O

5... Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 b6 7. Bg5
{ Pinning the knight is by far the main move and makes a lot of sense, as we can not solve the pin by putting a bishop on e7.   7.Nf3  This is the second most popular move after 7.Bg5. White can choose to play without Bg5, although it is by far the more critical and common try.  7...Bb7  In this position, the most frequent moves in descending order are 8.e3, 8.g3 and 8.Bg5.  8.e3  This is an important, critical line. White intends to follow up with Be2, 0-0, b3/b4 and Bb2 and open the position for the bishops. White usually doesn't mind Bxf3, as that would open up the g-file and give him counterplay against our king. So, we should not take on f3 for now and instead decide on what to do in the center: 8... d5, or 8... d6?   8.g3  The kingside fianchetto is the second most popular move. White used quite a bit of time in the opening and it's up to Black to make something out of his lead in development.  8...d6  I analysed both 8. .. c5 and 8... d5 as well, but ultimately decided on this move as it will transpose to a line that will be covered in 5. Nf3. I added analysis of 8... d5 to the reference section though, in case you are interested.   8...d5  Compared to 8...c5, this is an easier way of playing so this is why I am showing this one as an extra option @@StartBracket@@with light annotation@@EndBracket@@ besides 8... d6.

Nf3.  10...a6 !?  This is the interesting move that I cover there.   8.Bg5  Playing this is logical as the dark-squared bishop can't interpose the pin. This position could of course also have occured by playing 7.Bg5 Bb7 8. Nf3. However, most White players prefer to leave the knight on g1 to keep the option of playing f2-f3 at some point.  8...d6  Preparing ... Nbd7 and supporting a later ...c5. From this position, either 9.Nd2 or 9.e3 has frequently been played.  9.Nd2  White pinned the knight on f6, and now builds up in the center similar to what we stated in the general considerations, adding supporters to the center while at the same time subtracting defenders. The way is now clear for the e-pawn and possibly the f-pawn to march up the board.   9.e3  Nbd7  White has mostly played 10.Be2, closely followed by 10. Bd3. To make things easier, we can reply to 10.Be2 and Bd3 in the same way. 10.Nd2 is the third option and transposes to 9. Nd2 Nbd7 10.e3.  10.Be2  against this move, as well as against 10.Bd3, there are several good answers. There's an option of moving away the queen from the pin with ...Qe8 with ideas of ...Ne4. There's also ...Rc8 to play ... c5. A more aggressive approach is to play ...h6 and ... g5 followed by ...Ne4 and ...f5.   10.Bd3  h6  Black can start to play aggressively to break the pin and use the e4-square. A calmer, also recommended alternative is to play 10... c5. For example, 11. O-O Rc8 12. Nd2 cxd4 13. exd4 d5 is a good option for Black. You will see those set-ups a lot in the 4.e3 chapter later in this course.  11.Bh4  g5  We can now set up an agressive pawn structure.  12.Bg3  Ne4  13.Qc2  f5  This position is important as it could also arise via 5.Nf3-variations.  14.O-O  White could also castle long, but Black is in good shape as he will soon open the c-file after ...Qf6 and ... c5.  14...Qf6  15.b4  White tries to fight on the queenside, but we'll put a stop to it.  15...c5 =  This position was reached in Balutescu - Willow, e-mail @@StartBracket@@2014@@EndBracket@@.  16.Rad1  Rf7 !  Prophylactically defending the knight, in case the d-file opens up after moves like Bxe4 and dxc5. Now Black can continue by doubling the rooks on the f-file, and play ...h5 to attack, although capturing on g3 is very possible as well.  10...h6  11.Bh4  g5  Against 10.Be2 we go for the same aggressive play as after 10.Bd3. For illustrative purposes, here I will show what we can do if White castles long.  12.Bg3  Ne4  13.Qc2  f5  14.O-O-O  White is a little uncertain of the pawns on the kingside, so castling long is not unlogical. However, the king is not safe here either.  14...Qf6  With complex play. Black can play for ...f4 if White is not careful, and ...c5 is on the cards.  9...Nbd7  White has mostly played 10.f3 in this position, followed by 10.e3 which could arise via transposition from 8. Bg5; 9. e3 and 10. Nd2.  10.f3  One of the ideas was to use the f-pawn in building up the center. This line is sometimes used by Magnus Carlsen and Garry Kasparov also tried it a few times.   10.e3  Looks a bit on the slow side. Note that 10.e4 would be met with ...h6 with the idea of ...g5.  10...h6  11.Bh4  e5  White has lost some time with his Nf3-d2 manoeuvre, so it is interesting to open the e-file and try to exploit that the king is still in the middle.  12.Bd3  exd4  13.Qxd4  Forced, as taking with the e-pawn runs into the unpleasant ...Re8+. However, at the moment White's pieces are not coordinating well and f3-e4 is not happening anytime soon.  13...Qe7  14.O-O   14.Bf5  Treatening Bxd7.  14...g5  15.Bg3  Nh5 =  With multiple ideas of taking on g3 or playing the knight back to g7, and play for ...Rae8 and f5.  Rae8 =  Black is about to expand with kingside play. We have our typical idea of playing g5, Nh5 and f5, trying to launch an attack.  10...h6  11.Bh4  c5  We will see this theme again later in this chapter: with a pawn on e3, we like to play e5 to open the e-file. In this case however, it is clear that White will go e2-e4 when the pawn will be stable - and as Black doesn't like stable centers for White, ...c5 to counterattack in the center seems sensible.  12.e4   12.e3  This makes very little sense, as White has played f3 to prepare the e4-push.  12...cxd4 =  Rc8  Eyeing the queen on c3. White has mostly played 13.Bd3, as well as the less popular 13.dxc5.  13.Bd3   13.dxc5  is the less critical option compared to 13.Bd3. Most players have recaptured with the knight on c5, which after 14. Bxf6 @@StartBracket@@d5 was threatened@@EndBracket@@ Qxf6 15.Qxf6 gxf6 leads to a balanced endgame that often has resulted in a draw. White players are not after such positions straight from the opening so they have opted for 13. Bd3 more and more. The possible endgame after 13...Nxc5 is of course a possible solution for your play, but I'd like to add a second option to play a more dynamic middlegame.  13...Rxc5  This seems to be an interesting option as we like to keep the c-file open so we can pressurize the pawn on c4. The structure suddenly is reminiscent of the typical Hedgehog set-up versus the Maroczy bind. As White is underdeveloped, this seems to be a favourable version for Black.  14.Qd4  This was played by Korchnoi, to put pressure on d6 and take measures against ...Nxe4 and ...b5/d5.  14...Ne5  N  15.O-O-O  The pawn on d6 may come under attack now, so we have to prepare for that.  15...Qe7  Preparing Rd8 when the pawn will be defended.  16.Nb3  After a move like 16. Be2, we can just protect the pawn with 16... Rd8 with an equal position.  16...Rc6 =  This is another way to protect the pawn. We will double on the c-file and prepare for a b5/d5 push, just like Black typically wants in a Hedgehog.  cxd4  14.Qxd4  Nc5  Black has the surprising idea to play ...e5, and go to e6 with the knight. All of this comes with tempo. We follow the game between Carlsen and Karjakin from 2011 in which Black's set-up made quite an impression.  15.Be2  e5  This weakens the d5-square, which is often a concern in these Sicilian type of positions. However, the knight on d2 is badly placed to take advantage of this.  16.Qf2  Ne6  The knight is superbly placed on e6 as it can go to both d4 and f4.  17.O-O  g5  Gaining even more control over the f4-square.  18.Bg3  Nh5  19.Rfd1  Nd4  20.Bd3  Nf4  The knights occupy the outposts beautifully like the textbooks tell us to do.  21.Qf1  Qf6  22.Bf2  Nde6  23.Bc2  In the aforementioned Carlsen - Karjakin game, Black played 23... Qg6 now.  23...h5  =+  Black has a good position. He might play ...g4 and ...Ng5, while g3 by White has been discouraged.  8...d6  Black aims at playing ...Nbd7 and .. .Ne4. The variations after this move are quite theoretical and complicated, but Black has possibilities for a creating a strong attack. The move 8...d5 is also given as an alternative if you expect this position to be played and want to be flexible between either 8...d6 or 8...d5. It has to be said that if White plays 4.Qc2 with 5.Nf3, we answer that with 5...d6 @@StartBracket@@you will find out more on this in the next chapter@@EndBracket@@. If White then plays 6.a3, we play 6...Bxc3+ 7.Qxc3 b6 and if White then does 8.e3, we have already commited to playing d6 and don't have the 8...d5 option anymore. This means that we are forced to learn this 8...d6 line anyway, so I suggest you study it well and not only study 8... d5! In the current position, White has mostly played 9. Be2, as well as 9.b4 that has also been quite popular and transposes to 8.b4. Less played alternatives are 9.Bd3 and 9.b3.   8...d5  I will present this move as an alternative way of playing. Although consistent play with ...d6 followed by ... Ne4 and ...f5 gives Black interesting opportunities on the kingside, there is a lot of theory to learn and it's quite complex for Black. The text move has been more popular recently, for example in games by Wei Yi. The idea is to open up the center and go for ...c5 next. White has played in descending order of frequency: 9.b3, 9.b4 and 9.Be2.  9.b3  is the most frequent move.   9.b4  a5  Trying to open up the a-file, as White lacks in development.  10.b5  c5  11.bxc6   11.dxc5  Ne4 !  Taking back on c5 with the pawn would be very undesirable, as it leaves White with a strong passed pawn. The knight solves our problem with an intermediate move.  12.Qc2  Nxc5  13.Bb2  Nbd7 =  Next up is Rc8 and we can consider taking on c4 at the right moment, followed by placing a piece on e4. If White captures on d5, we will always take back with the bishop. Trying to prepare e5 is also an idea, for example by playing f6. The bishop on b2 would then lose all of its power.  Nxc6  12.cxd5  Qxd5  =+  Black is active and is definitely in good shape here.   9.Be2  is maybe a bit passive by White. Black is about to act energetically.  9...Ne4  10.Qc2  dxc4  Capturing on c4 is often a good idea after White has moved the bishop, as he is forced to lose a tempo now.  11.Bxc4  c5  We're not slowing down - time to open up the center once again.  12.O-O  cxd4  N  13.Nxd4  A logical recapture, as taking on d4 with the pawn gives White an isolani. This can be strong when White has a lot of activity to compensate, but that's not the case here.  13...Nd6  14.Bd3  e5 !  A nice move, as 15. Bxh7+ Kh8 16. Nb3 g6 would trap the bishop.  15.Nb3  Qh4 =  Protecting h7 and setting up an attack. If you want a draw, you can take on g2 and take the perpetual with Qg4+, but if you want to play for more, f5 and getting more pieces to the kingside will give Black good chances.  9...Nbd7  Typical moves for White in this position are 10.Be2 and 10.Bb2.  10.Be2   10.Bb2  c5  11.Rd1  This was played in Xiong - Wei, 2019. White is trying to eye our queen for a change.   11.Be2  Rc8  Once again, eyeing the queen.  12.O-O  cxd4  13.exd4  dxc4  14.bxc4  b5  We immediately attack the hanging pawns. This transposes to the main line of 10. Be2.  11...Rc8  12.Be2  Ne4  N  Wei Yi opted for 12...dxc4 instead.  13.Qc2  dxc4  14.bxc4  cxd4  =+  White's structure is damaged and we will have a solid advantage. We can push e6-e5 at the right moment, and sometimes play Nd6 to attack the pawn on c4.  c5  11.O-O  Rc8  From this position, White has mostly played 12.Bb2 and 12.a4. These lines are important to study as they are critical, especially 12.Bb2.  12.Bb2   12.a4  Preventing our b5-push.  12...dxc4  13.bxc4  Qc7  Prophylactically getting away from the d-file, where White will place one of the rooks, as well as adding pressure to the c-file.  14.Rd1   14.Bb2  This was played in a game between Vitiugov - Karjakin @@StartBracket@@2009@@EndBracket@@.  14...Bxf3  15.gxf3  White is unable to take with the bishop, as that would lose the pawn on c4.  15...cxd4  16.Qxd4  e5  17.Qh4  Rfe8  18.Kh1  Qd6  N  Karjakin played Nf8 right away. This move aims to attack the weak pawns on the queenside, with ...Qb4 soon as an idea. If White prevents this with Bc3, we can play ...a5 to block the pawn on a4 and attack it with ...Nc5 at some point. ...Nf8-g6 remains a sensible option as well.  Bxf3  is very similar to 14.Bb2.  15.gxf3  cxd4  16.exd4  White could of course take with the queen just as in the previous line, but the hanging pawns are also an option.  16...Rfd8 =  All of our pieces are well-placed to attack the pawns. First up is rerouting the knight to g6, and start attacking the weakened kingside. White may have the bishop pair, but it is known that knights are excellent in positions with weakened pawns.  cxd4  13.exd4  dxc4  14.bxc4  b5  We immediately attack the hanging pawns. This transposes to the main line of 10.Be2. We immediately attack the hanging pawns. This transposes to the main line of 10. Be2.  15.c5  Kasparov said about this position in his book Kasparov vs. Karpov Part four 1988-2009 that although White has the two bishops and a protected passed pawn, Black on the other hand has a very strong blockading point at d5, enabling him to keep the b2-bishop shut in.  15...Nd5  16.Qd2  Bc6 !?  This is good prophylaxis against White's idea of playing a4. In Kasparov's notes in his book that was just mentioned, he thinks that Black has easy play via ...a5, ...Rb8, ...h6 to prevent Ng5-e4-d6 @@StartBracket@@although he thinks this is not so terrible@@EndBracket@@, and perhaps later push b5-b4. Also, he mentions it's not easy for White to come up with a plan and that Black's trumps are more weighty, and the endgame will be welcomed by Black. An example from practice is the game Maiorov - Gascon del Nogal @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@ which illustrated Black's strengths in the endgame.  9.Be2  We have arrived at the main move.   9.Bd3  This is not often played compared to 9.b4 or 9.Be2, but it is still a natural move. White doesn't mind getting doubled pawns, as the open g-file may give additional dynamic opportunities.  9...c5  This is a familiar move to us, and a strong one. If Black were to play 9...Ne4, he would soon get in a transposition to 8...Ne4 where there are a lot of theory and games. As 9.Bd3 is a relatively rare move in White's play after 8...d6, I don't think it's useful to study all that theory. This is why 9...c5 is a good move to get into less explored territory.  10.O-O  Nbd7  Now we are ready to play Rc8 and take on d4, exploiting the position of White's queen. Since White has developed most of the pieces, the only logical moves for him are 11.b3 or 11. b4 to be able to play Bd2.  11.b3  A more modest option, protecting the c4-pawn.   11.b4  cxd4  We just follow our plan.  12.exd4  Controlling the center, but now we can inflict doubled pawns.   12.Nxd4  Ne5  Immediately showing White the downside of taking with the knight: the pawn on d4 did the important job of controlling the e5-square.  13.Be2  Rc8  Now we are ready for d5.  14.Qb3  d5  15.cxd5  Bxd5  After the knight moves, Black can consider ...e5 to attack White's knight.  12...Bxf3  13.gxf3  Nh5  We immediately start manoeuvring our pieces to the kingside.  14.Kh1  Qf6 =  Black has the idea of playing ... Nf4 and place a rook on the c-file.  11...Rc8  12.Bb2  cxd4  13.Nxd4  13. exd4 would again run into 13... Bxf3.  13...Nc5  Now there are no pawns on either b4 or d4, so our knight can enjoy the c5-square. From there, the knight can jump to e4.  14.Be2  e5  We have seen this move before: since the knight can't use the weakened e5-square, this move works.  15.Nf3  In the game between Yudasin - Psakhis @@StartBracket@@1999@@EndBracket@@, Black repeated moves with 15... Nfe4, but White declined. That was very costly for him, as White later lost the game. So this is a possible continuation to aim for a threefold repetition if that's in your interest.  15...Ng4 !?  The preferred choice if you want to play on. Black has ideas such as ...f5, supported by ...Nce4 for example.   9.b3  This is not a critical move and Black can resume play on the c-file, combined with ...Ne4 and ...f5 later on.  9...Nbd7  10.Bb2  c5  11.Be2  Rc8  All the moves in this line have been seen before and will be seen many more times, not only in this chapter but in the whole course.  12.O-O  Ne4  13.Qc2  cxd4  14.exd4  f5 =  We're familiar with this structure and the plans of putting pressure on White's kingside.   9.b4  This early offensive on the queenside comes second in popularity.  9...a5  Provoking the pawn forward and creating the opportunity to play on the queenside in some variations. White has played either 10.b5 or 10. Bb2 here.  10.b5  Closing the position is the most popular reply by White. And understandably so, as we have just seen what happens if White allows us to open the position!   10.Bb2  White doesn't mind us taking on b4.  10...Ne4  11.Qc2  gives Black interesting play as the b4-pawn is unprotected after a few moves. Let's see:   11.Qb3  Now the b4-pawn is protected and the play is different compared to 11. Qc2.  11...Qf6  N  is interesting as the queen can put a bit of pressure on White's kingside with ...Qg6.  12.Be2  Qg6  13.g3  Nd7  =+  Black is well placed whereas White has somewhat weakened his light squares. To further highlight this, we should try to exchange bishops. It is thus not surprising that after 14. O-O even a move like Qh5 is strong. Then Black can try to exchange the light-squared bishop by taking on b4, take on a1 and move the knight so Black can take on f3.  11...axb4  12.axb4  Rxa1+  13.Bxa1  Na6  And now the pawn on b4 is unprotected.  14.Qb3  We are going to see a very nice combination now, so pay attention!   14.Qb2  happened in an old game between Plachetka - Adamski @@StartBracket@@1983@@EndBracket@@. White is clearly dreaming of a mate on g7, but this will never happen if we stay alert.  14...Qa8  We will follow the same plan against 14. Qb3. Now Nxb4 is threatened!  15.d5  15...f6  ∓  White has tried to mate us, but alas - we prevented it and not his position is falling apart with both the b4- and d5-pawn under attack.  14...Qa8  15.Bb2  Nxb4 was threatened, but now that the bishop moved away, everything is fine for White. Or is it?  15...Nxb4 !  A surprising blow! White is underdeveloped and we can exploit that by giving up a piece in exchange for open files. Judit Polgar missed this opportunity in a rapid game versus Karpov, but it was spotted in a correspondence game between Fernandez Medina and Villarreal in 2013.  16.Qxb4  c5  Now if the queen moves, we have Qa5+.  17.dxc5  There are a few queen moves to stop the upcoming Qa5+: 17. Qxb6 and 17.Qb5. If 17. Qxb6, then 17... Rb8 spells major problems for White. After 17. Qb5 Bc6 gives White the same problems as before.  17...bxc5  18.Qb3  The final option to prevent Qa5+ is 18.Qa3. But then the black rook will unpleasantly enter White's position after 18... Qxa3 19. Bxa3 Ra8.  18...Qa5+  19.Kd1  Bc6  White can't catch a break: we threaten Ba4 now. Our initiative is really amazing!  20.Kc1  Ba4  21.Qa3  Rb8  All our pieces are contributing to the attack now. Rb3 is now a threat, and the pawn on f2 is also hanging in case we want it. We're still a piece down for a pawn, but this is barely noticeable!  22.Bd3  Rb3  23.Qxb3  Bxb3  24.Bxe4  Bxc4  ∓  Although Black didn't manage to win in the correspondence game between Fernandez Medina - Villareal @@StartBracket@@2013@@EndBracket@@, the position is excellent for Black.  10...Nbd7  11.Bb2   11.Be2  We can follow the same plan here.  11...Ne4  12.Qc2  f5  13.Bb2  would transpose to 13.Be2.  13...Ng5  Ne4  This is a recurring theme throughout the Nimzo-Indian: since White is missing the knight on c3, we can put our knight on e4 @@StartBracket@@usually winning a tempo on the queen@@EndBracket@@ and support it with a future ...f5. After that, we have a lot of potential to attack on the kingside.  12.Qc2  f5  Now either 13.Be2 or 13.Bd3 have been popular. Transposes to:  13.Be2  Protecting the knight already, in anticipation of 13... Ng5. Not that we let it stop us.   13.Bd3  One correspondence player, Jacek Mroczek, played this move 12@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ times in 2009.  13...Ng5  Putting pressure on f3, immediately starting the kingside play.  14.Nxg5  Qxg5  15.O-O-O  All 12 games of Mroczek reached this position - apparently he liked it a lot at the time! In fact, there are no other games in this position, only games from him. White gladly sacrifices the pawn on g2 for play against our king, so naturally we refrain from taking there. Mroczek faced 15... Rae8, 15.. . Rac8 and 15... c6 here, but I like one of those moves best.  15...c6 !  I find this move most to the point: White has castled long, so we should open the position on the queenside to attack him! Simple, right? Mroczek faced this move 3 times and... lost all of them!  16.bxc6  Bxc6  17.d5  White is also trying to attack, and opens up the diagonal for his bishop. He is also trying to undermine the defense of the pawn on f5.  17...exd5  18.h4  Continuing the plan: White wants to win the f5-pawn, but we won't let him.  18...Qh5  Keeping the pawn protected, and blocking the march of White's h-pawn.  19.Be2  Chasing our queen away so h5 is possible after all. If White plays 19. cxd5, we can play 19... Bb7 and try to exploit the opening of the c-file.  19...Qf7  20.h5  h6  A common motif in many positions: blocking the pawn when it gets to h5. Allowing h6 would make White's bishop on h2 very happy.  21.Rh3  Mroczek tried this in the first game, but learned that the plan of Rg3 can be stopped easily.   21.Rhg1  Nc5  22.Bf3  Rac8  23.Rxd5  Ne4  24.Bxe4  fxe4  25.Rxd6  Ba4  -+  21...Rfc8  Finally we have some time to work on our own attack again!  22.Rg3  Ne5  ∓  The only way to stop the attack on g7, but a good way. White has no easy way to continue the attack and we are taking over the initiative.  13...Ng5  14.d5  Trying to block the bishop makes sense. 14. Nd2 was played in an old game between Portisch and Timman. Timman fearlessly took on g2 and played very energetically, which ultimately gave him a great win. This game is annotated in the model games section.   14.O-O-O  Ne4  N  With the king on the queenside, we don't want to open the g-file by taking the knight. Instead, we go back to the strong e4-square where we attack the f2-pawn now. Black has a good position, and if given the chance will try to open the c-file by ...c6.  14...Nc5  Showing the downside of playing d5: we get the c5-square for our knight and Black is fine. In the game between Kleimenov - Popov, e-mail @@StartBracket@@2014@@EndBracket@@, the game went a bit different than usual.  15.h4  Again the march of the h-pawn.  15...Nge4  16.h5  e5  Closing the bishop's diagonal seems wise. Without the bishop's influence, h6 isn't as problematic for us so we can allow it now.  17.h6  g6  =+  With a fairly closed position, which should favour or excellently placed knights. One idea for the future is to play ... Bc8 and ... f4 @@StartBracket@@but be careful when executing this, as it does open lines towards our king!@@EndBracket@@.  9...Ne4  We will play similar moves as before.  10.Qc2  Nd7  11.O-O  f5  This is an important set-up for Black which will be recurring throughout the course. Black establishes some advantage in space on the kingside which may later help with building up an attack there. Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6. These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn. White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one at e4, and play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2. The most frequent move is 12.b4 which has the idea of a queenside offensive combined with d4-d5 and opening a diagonal for the important dark-squared bishop, followed by 12. Ne1 and more occasionally 12. Nd2 and 12. b3.  12.b4  The main move. White immediately grabs space on the queenside and aims to fianchetto his bishop. Of course, we will try to attack on the kingside like in the other variations.   12.Ne1  This retreat is mainly to neutralize the knight that is on White's half of the board by f2-f3. Although going to e1 looks rather a bit passive, White does not allow Black to exchange on d2 and play can become sharp. Although objectively 12...Qh4 is probably the best move, I must warn you that it can be a bit too theoretical and sharp for your taste as it involves @@StartBracket@@multiple@@EndBracket@@ pawn sacrifices and long variations, although it is of course exciting to play. If that scenario frightens you, you can look at the analysis of the more calm alternative 12...c5. You can pick whatever suits you best!  12...Qh4  Now we are getting into crazy complications!   12...c5 !?  Playing in the center.  13.f3  White continues his plan. If 13. b4, then 13... Rc8 is fine.  13...Ng5  Most players have retreated to f6, but that prevents our rook and queen from coming to f6.  14.b3  Was played by Yu Yangyi against Alekseev  @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@.   14.b4  N  This is one of White's main ideasin all of these lines, so we should definitely check it.  14...Rc8  Supporting our pawn structure before continuing the attack.  15.dxc5   15.Nd3  Qe7  White put more pressure on c5 - and we defended the pawn extra.  16.bxc5  bxc5  Capturing towards the center is usually the way to go. The pawn on d6 will support a future ...e5 push.  17.Rb1  Ba8  ∞  I find the position very unclear. We can take on d4 and try to attack the hanging pawn structure, and sometimes we can follow that up with ...e5.  bxc5  Again recapturing towards the center.  16.b5  Rf6  Now that the tension in the center is gone, we can redirect our attention towards our upcoming kingside attack.  17.a4  White will try to get something on the queenside - a classic 'who will be fastest?' race.  17...Rh6  18.a5  18...Qf6  ∞  We can play in the center with ...e5 and possibly ...f4 at some point, fueling our attack. As I don't see how White can get something real on the queenside, I don't mind having Black here!  14...Nf7  N  Making some room for the queen.  15.Nd3  15. Bb2 wasn't as appealing for White now, as it runs into 15...

Qxa1 18. Bb2 and the queen is trapped.

Rb1 the bishop on b7 can't retreat to a8, leaving us slightly uncoordinated.  18.Bd2  Going to b2 would again run into Qg5.  18...e5  ∞  We have a strong center to compensate for our bishop pair.  13.f3  This is White's usual reply: sticking to the plan.  13...Ng5  Again going to g5, leaving room for the rook to join the attack via f6. White has tried a lot of different moves in this position. We will examine 14.c5, 14.

In these structures, Black tries to use White's lagging development by using the pinned e-pawn for tactical opportunities.

The queen was misplaced on c3 and White directs her to our king instead.   14.Ng3  Nd4  Both sides are trying to get their knights to the ideal position.  15.Qe3  Kh8  This idea has been mentioned before and is a standard move in such positions.  16.Nh5  White is trying to launch an attack, but he just lacks firepower.  16...Rg8  ∓  Black controls the situation and can start his own attack on the queenside.  14...Nd4  15.Qh6  Kh8  16.h4  So far we are still following the game Van Wely - Kramnik. Instead, Kramnik opted for 16.Nxd4 against Ponomariov but did not achieve more than a draw. A trade on d4 is not something we should fear: we will recapture with the c-pawn and end up with a superior bishop compared to the white counterpart. The protected passed pawn on d4 will always be a strong trump.  16...Rg8  N  This is a good defensive move, making it possible to play .. .Rg6 at a certain moment and preventing Ng3 for the moment.

The threat is Nxd5, and if White defends against that, we can continue with a6/b5/c4 and just push the queenside pawns.  bxc5  This is the strongest way to recapture: by taking towards the center, Black strengthens his control over the central dark squares. The d4-square is now particularly weak, and one idea is to play Ne5-c6-d4.  13.Bd3  a5  Stopping b4, gaining even more control over the dark squares.

Black is in great shape.  exd5  19.Qf5  Bxc4  20.Bxf6  Qxf6  21.Qxf6  gxf6  =+  As we have seen before, we don't mind this crippled pawn structure if we have an extra pawn!   15.b3  Trying to protect the pawn on c4 in advance, but we will play our typical d5 break anyway.  15...Nxd3  16.Qxd3  d5  17.cxd5  Qxd5  18.Qxd5  Bxd5  19.Rab1  e5 =  The position is just equal.   15.b4  Nxd3  16.Qxd3  d5  17.cxd5  Qxd5  18.Qxd5  Nxd5  In this case, we recapture with the knight, as there is no hanging pawn on b3.  19.e4  Ne3 =  Ba6  16.b3  The only way to stabilize the pawn on c4, but now we break open the center again.  16...Nxd3  17.Qxd3  d5  18.Rfd1  dxc4  19.Qc3  Qe7  20.b4  e5  20...Rfe8 is also an option here, with the idea of Nxe4.21. e5 Ne4 22. Bxe7 Nxc3 23. Nxc3 Rxe7=  21.a4  Bb7 =  White can not claim any advantage here: if anything, Black is the one who can press with the extra pawn. }
9... Nbd7 10. Qc2
{ This is the most common queen move, the other option being 10. Qd3. This move frees the c3-square for the knight, and on c2 it is slightly less vulnerable than on d3 @@StartBracket@@no Ba6@@EndBracket@@ and it also does not stand in the way of a future Bd3 move.   10.Qd3  After this move, Black has a lot of different options. He can choose a more solid continuation with 10...Ba6, preparing ...d5 and after a couple of exchanges, the resulting positions are rather simplified and with precise play by Black, it will likely head towards a draw. As this is not in the spirit of a fighting repertoire, I tried to look further. 10... e5 seemed like a good continuation and some variations were quite interesting, but it also had a more drawish tendency with some repetition of moves options for White down the line. That's why I decided on a suggestion of Re8 and manoeuvring the knight on d7 to f8 and g6. From there, it attacks the bishop on h4 @@StartBracket@@that ends up there after we have played h6@@EndBracket@@ and supports a central pawn push. This keeps the game more tensed and full of possibilities.  10...h6  We first play this move. The bishop will drop back to h4, and when we execute our plan of Re8-Nf8-Ng6, we win a tempo because the bishop on h4 will be under attack.  11.Bh4  Re8  The rook will come in handy on the e-line in some lines. This is the first step in preparing Nf8-g6, so we aren't bothered anymore by the pinning bishop.  12.Nc3  Nf8  13.f3  White could have played this move earlier already: the idea is to play e4. The advantage is that after Ng6, the bishop can now drop back to f2. White also prepares to develop his light-squared bishop and perhaps even castle short.   13.O-O-O  Because the bishop on b7 is putting pressure on g2 all the time, White has a hard time developing his bishop on f1 @@StartBracket@@unless he plays f3 at some point, which is covered as well@@EndBracket@@ and thus castling. This is why he sometimes tries to castle queenside. We will aim to open things up on the queenside to attack this king.  13...Ng6  First we continue our plan.  14.Bg3  d5 !?  So far, this move has only been seen in a correspondence game in 2010. The idea is very simple: we try to open things up on the queenside. We will later play c5 as well to open even more lines. Meanwhile, White's attack is not starting yet. Note that we play d5 now, as we don't care anymore about attacking g2 - preventing White from developing his kingside is less important when he has decided to just castle queenside.  15.cxd5  exd5  16.Qc2  White's queen is in the way of the bishop on f1, so this moves prepares to develop it to d3.  16...c5  Here we go! With a king on c1, it is only natural to try to open the c-file. We can later play Rc8 for example.  17.Bd3  cxd4  18.exd4  Ne4  The knight on c3 is a strong defender of the king, so we aim to remove it. Black is playing very systematically: every move is consistent with the plan of attacking on the queenside.  19.Kb1  Rc8  20.f3  Nxc3+  21.bxc3  Nf8 =  and Black will regroup his pieces to put pressure on White's compromised king position. The knight can go to e6, the queen to d7 and the bishop to c6, aiming to go to a4 at some point. Surprisingly, all of these moves were already played in the correspondence game from 2010. Black even won that game @@StartBracket@@which is quite unusual in correspondence chess@@EndBracket@@, so there are definitely chances here! Please see model games for the remaining moves of the game.  13...Ng6  14.Bf2  At the moment White is threatening e4, so playing ...e5 is not that ideal right now @@StartBracket@@even if it's by far the most common move here@@EndBracket@@. It looks interesting to now play for ...Ba6 and ...d5, as the queen on d3 might be targeted to gain time.  14...Ba6 !?  Black is now sort of threatening to go d5, so e4 is now too slow.  15.Qc2   15.b4  White is annoyed by the bishop on a6 and aims to drive it away with b4-b5. We do not let this scare us:  15...d5  16.b5  Bb7  17.cxd5   17.Be2  a6  Opening the a-file, as the pawn on a3 is now a weakness.  18.O-O  dxc4  19.Qxc4  axb5  20.Qxb5   20.Nxb5  c6  21.Nc3  Ba6  ⇆  Nd5  Black doesn't mind exchanging some pieces here, as he has slightly less space. Also, similar to positions with an isolani, it is useful to exchange the light pieces but to keep the heavy ones on, in order to best attack the weakness on a3.  21.Qb2  Nxc3  22.Qxc3  Ba6  Exchanging another light piece, in line with our strategy. This also eliminates the bishop pair for White, leaving Black with a knight versus a not so strong bishop.  23.Bxa6  Rxa6 =  and after defending c7 with ...Ra7 and ...Qe7, Black will put pressure on the a-pawn.  Nxd5  18.e4  Nxc3  19.Qxc3  f5 !?  with an interesting, unbalanced position. White definitely has to be careful with his king still in the middle.  d5  White stepped out of the pin, but we still play d5 as it prevents e4 and gives us the option to trade light-squared bishops.  16.Qa4  Bxc4  17.Bxc4  dxc4  18.Qxc4  e5  19.O-O-O  White is dreaming about opening that d-file for his rook, but we won't let him...   19.d5  White wants to play e4 next to establish a mighty centre. Naturally, we will stop that from happening!  19...e4 !  We don't mind sacrificing a pawn @@StartBracket@@temporarily@@EndBracket@@ to stop White's plans and gain a nice square on e5 for our knight.  20.Nxe4  Nxe4  21.fxe4  c5 !  White can't take en passant on c6, as then the knight lands on e5 with tempo, with the deadly Nd3+ next.  22.O-O  Qe7  =+  We are still a pawn down, but our knight has a fantastic square on e5 and we can easily win back the pawn on e4 if we want to.  19...e4 =  With an equal position, where Black can think of moves like ...Rb8 and use his pawns on the queenside to attack the white king. }
10... c5
{ With a queen on c2, this move increases in strength. The opened c-file can be used to attack the vulnerable queen. }
11. Rd1
{ White is still planning to play Nc3. However, he wants to be able to answer any ...cxd4 move by Rxd4, as capturing with the pawn would be undesirable for White. He would much rather have the d-file half-open, as then there can be some pressure on the d6-pawn. }
11... Qc8
{ This is an interesting option compared to placing either the queen on c7 or e7, although they are perfectly playable as well. The advantage is that this move is a lot less popular and might not be so well-known by your opponents. It has been played by strong grandmasters such as Harikrishna, Volokitin, Meier and Van Wely. The main idea behind the move is that the queen is protected on c8, in case the c-file gets opened completely @@StartBracket@@after ...d5@@EndBracket@@. This can be useful in some variations as we'll soon see. }
12. Nc3
{ It seems White has favoured this move in recent years.   12.f3  This move and its underlying ideas should be familiar by now.  12...h6  This is a good moment to throw in h6. It is often difficult to understand when to play this move, but in this case it is useful for a concrete reason: on h4, the bishop does not protect e3. This means that after playing ...d5 exd5 Nxd5, there is the threat of Ne3!  13.Bh4  13...d5  Opening up the center. Usually when you are ahead in development, this is a good idea. White's pieces are a bit uncoordinated at the moment and will find it difficult to deal with this situation.  14.cxd5   14.Bf2  was played in Bu - Onischuk.  14...dxc4  15.Qxc4  Ba6  Another perk of having the queen on c8! The bishop is annoying on a6 once again, as moving the knight will lead to Bxf1, and losing castling rights.  16.Qc3  Qb7  Making room for Rac8, while keeping an eye on the centre from a distance.  17.e4  Rac8  18.Qd2 ?!   18.Qb3  cxd4  19.Bxd4  Nc5  Black is slowly activating all his pieces, while White is still struggling to do the same.  20.Qe3  Rfd8  21.Ng3  Bxf1  and White has to play very carefully not to end up worse.  Rfd8  19.Nc3  Bxf1  20.Rxf1  Ne5  =+  The c4-square is very attractive for the knight. Instead, Onischuk opted for 20...cxd4 against Bu in 2005.  21.Qe2  cxd4  22.Bxd4  Nc4  ⇆  Black is active and White's king will need some time to get to safety @@StartBracket@@Kf2-Kg1@@EndBracket@@. Black has no problems at all.  Nxd5  15.Qd2  Although Larsen said: 'Long variation, wrong variation!', in this case it is worthwhile to study the lines as it was part of a theoretical discussion in Mamedyarov - Meier @@StartBracket@@2012@@EndBracket@@, and a few correspondence games. I have managed to find some improvements over those games that should give Black good chances.   15.Kf2  cxd4  Here we see why the queen needed to be protected @@StartBracket@@as this move was not possible would she have been on c7@@EndBracket@@.  16.Nxd4  e5  =+  White's coordination is very bad and he will struggle a lot here.  17.Qxc8  Raxc8  18.Nf5  Rc2+  19.Kg1  e4  =+  Opening up the position and giving Black a pleasant advantage.  15...f5 !  Black prevents e4 while gaining space and some attacking chances.  16.dxc5  Nxc5  16...Ne5!? is a very interesting novelty that could be investigated further, if you like.  17.b4  Na4  The knight may look a bit weird here, but it has good chances of getting to c3.  18.Rc1   18.Bg3  N  This could be an improvement for White, but so far it hasn't been tried.  18...Qd8  Redirecting the queen to f6, where the dark squares will be controlled nicely.  19.Nd4  Qf6  20.Bc4  Rad8 =  Definitely not a boring position! I would say that chances are about equal here. Black can play f4 and try to get an attack going.  Qe8  In this case we go to h5 @@StartBracket@@made possible by our earlier f5 move@@EndBracket@@.  19.Nd4  e5  20.Bb5  Probably the best move, but now the position gets very sharp.   20.Nb5  N  Another novelty, but not a scary one.  20...Qh5  21.Bf2  Rad8  =+  And again, we have great attacking potential.  20...Qh5  3 pieces are hanging: two white ones, and one black knight...  21.Nc6   21.Bxa4  Qxh4+  Looks more than fine for Black.  Nac3 N  An improvement over the Mamedyarov-Meier game from 2012, where 21...Ndc3 was chosen. The knights seem much more actively placed this way.  22.Bf2  Kh7 !  Careful: White was threatening Bc4! This propylactic move prevents any pins and keeps the advantage. White is unable to take on c3, as after capturing back on c3 we will have Rac8, winning the knight on c6 after a subsequent Qe8.  23.Bc4  Bxc6  24.Bxd5  Nxd5  25.Rxc6  Rad8  26.O-O  e4  =+  A nice move as now the pawn on e3 will be weak, and the bishop a bit unhappy. Black is slightly better. }
12... cxd4 13. Rxd4
{ The expected recapture. If White takes back with the e-pawn, amongst others Black can play ...Re8 and try to open the position. }
13... d5 14. Be2
{ White is trying to complete his development, but this comes at a cost: the c4-pawn will be hanging.   14.cxd5  Not all players want to sacrifice a pawn, so this is a logical move.  14...Nxd5  Thanks to the queen on c8, the knight on c3 is now pinned.  15.Bd3  Attacking h7 and protecting the queen on c2 so ...Nxd5 can be played.   15.Rc4  Black has several interesting options now. I will keep 15...Qe8N as the mainline, but will also offer the fascinating 15... Nc5 move in the reference section.  15...Qe8  N  This move is a novelty, as people have only opted for Qb8 or Nc5 so far. The queen will be well-placed here though: after f6, she will have some options along the e8/h5 diagonal. This line is much easier to play than the 15...Nc5 option and perhaps objectively stronger as well.   15...Nc5 !?  I encourage you to look at the lines here, as they are highly interesting. However, I found that there are a lot of possibilities to study and that it might be a little on the complex side. I have only annotated these moves lightly, as it's not the main recommendation. If you like it though, feel free to analyse it a bit further yourself and have fun with it!  16.b4  Ba6  17.b5  Bb7  18.Na4  is probably White's best option.   18.Bd3  Threatening Bxh7+, but this is easily taken care of.  18...h6  19.Bh4  a6  ∓  Opening the queenside will give Black an advantage. He will just take on b5 and play Ba6 next.   18.Be2 ?  This drops the g2-pawn.

Although the rook on c7 is active, this looks good for Black.  19.Bc4  White immediately tries to get rid of the strong bishop, but this means he loses his bishop pair.   19.Bg3  Nc5  Now the rook is not so strong after all.  19...Bxc4  20.Qxc4+  Kh8  Black prefers to keep the queens on for now and does not go Qf7.  21.Bg3  Nc5 =  The position is objectively equal although practically, Black might be slightly for choice.

The knight is clearly better placed than the bishop.  15...h6  16.Nxd5   16.Bh4  Nxc3  ∓  Bxd5  This is a topical correspondence position: I count 5 correspondence games, as well as an OTB game.  17.e4 !?

{ This is the Classical Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. White's aim is clear: he protects his knight, so we won't be able to take on c3 and ruin White's structure. Usually, White will follow up with 5. a3 and then after Bxc3+ take back with the queen. The downside is that this is a bit time-consuming, and White will often be behind in development, especially with his kingside pieces.   4.

I hope the ideas that are explained here help you with understanding the theoretical moves and will be useful guidelines that you can use in your games! }
4... O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 b6
{ Although only a couple of moves have been played, it's important to note that we can already discuss the contours of the struggle. What ideas will be implemented by both sides?   White has used two moves with the queen to prevent Black from doubling the pawns, and later on the queen might be vulnerable on the c-file @@StartBracket@@for example after ...c5 and ...cxd4 with a rook on c8, followed by a pawn move on the b- or d-file@@EndBracket@@. Also, the queen might need to move again after a future ...Ne4. So, White has lost some valuable time in the opening.   White has the bishop pair, and we already know the importance of White's dark-squared bishop from the General Considerations. Therefore, White's natural plan is to open up the game and clear the center of pawns. The knight on g1 is used flexibly, mostly to support central play. In some cases it might come to f2 via h3, but usually it goes to f3 or e2.   This knight could also be used well on c3 via e2, and therefore the queen on c3 voluntarily steps away @@StartBracket@@again!@@EndBracket@@ to d3 or c2 to make room for the knight. From there, the knight helps in the center and does not stand in the way of the f1-bishop anymore. In case the knight went to f3, it sometimes goes to the d2-square, supporting e4 even more. The bishop on f1 typically goes to d3 to support central play.   White typically uses the dark-squared bishop on c1 either to @@StartBracket@@1@@EndBracket@@ place it on b2 after playing the b-pawn either to b3 or b4, with the idea of putting pressure on the long diagonal, or @@StartBracket@@2@@EndBracket@@ place it on g5 as Black lacks a dark-squared bishop and can't naturally break the pin with ...Be7, adding to White's control over the e4-square. In very rare cases, the bishop will actually take on f6, either if Black has to recapture with the g-pawn or White can profit from temporarily having the queen on f6.   White's king will typically go to the kingside, although it might get caught in the center if it waits too long. In some lines, White wants to put pressure on d6 by castling long and opening the d-file, at the cost of counterplay by the black major pieces on the b-file.   White's pawns: White often has a strong presence in the center, by either playing f3 and e4, or first playing e3 on its own, and possibly later following with f3, when e4 is on the agenda again. As Black challenges White's center with ...c5 in these lines, White has the possibility to take on c5, opening the d-file to put pressure on d6. Black typically recaptures with the b-pawn, and Black can create counterplay against the b2-pawn @@StartBracket@@that got weakened after a2-a3@@EndBracket@@, and in some lines Black can even sacrifice the d6-pawn for that kind of counterplay. White has to consider that Black may recapture with a piece @@StartBracket@@if possible@@EndBracket@@ instead of recapturing with the b-pawn. White can also play dxc5 to prevent Black from taking on d4, as Black would follow up with ...d5 on the next move.   Black's pieces: Black has a lead in development in this case and therefore aims to keep the positions more fluid. After a future ...c5 and ...cxd4, Black has strong counterplay on the c-file. Black can use the rook on a8 to place it on c8, and use the bishop on c8 to place it on a6 @@StartBracket@@attacking c4@@EndBracket@@ or b7. Also, sometimes the bishop might come to d5 to use the pin on the c-file versus the queen. The knight on d7 can be placed on f8 after ...Re8, and later on it will go to g6 and the problem of the bishop on the h4-d8 diagonal can be addressed.   Black's pawns: Black will address the bishop on g5 by playing ...h6 in a lot of lines, and it is not always clear whether it is to Black's benefit to do so. In the majority of cases, Black will actually play ...h6, and in very rare cases analysis will show that it is better not to include it as the bishop on h4 @@StartBracket@@after ...h6@@EndBracket@@ could come to g3. In only a few instances Black will actually follow up with ...g5 as it usually makes Black's king too vulnerable. Logically, by playing ...h6 there is less of an issue with back-rank problems, but moving pawns in front of the king will have possible disadvantages @@StartBracket@@in the long term@@EndBracket@@.   Black can use the c-pawn to capture on d4, and if White recaptures with the e-pawn, Black can play ...d5 and in some lines, the idea of playing against an isolated pawn with ...dxc4 starts to make sense. Black can use the a-pawn to play ...a5 and possibly ...a4, making the pawn on b2 even more of a target, or to prevent White from playing b4. If White captures on c5, Black either recaptures with the b-pawn or with a piece, like the rook on c8 or the knight on d7. Of course, recapturing with the rook keeps the advantage of future pressure along the c-file.   Tactical ideas: In some cases, Black can resolve the pin by the bishop on g5 by playing ...Ne4 @@StartBracket@@or occasionally ...Nd5@@EndBracket@@, hitting the queen on c3 and the bishop on g5, and this can either give concrete advantages or simplify the position. Of course, it entirely depends on the position, and the idea adds strength if Black can capture the e4-pawn in one go or attack more pieces down the line, or rather if White can attack more material in the mean time. Also, the pawn on c4 might be subject to tactical ideas, either taking it directly, or following up with a pinning motive. }

Nxc5 is of course a possible solution for your play, but I'd like to add a second option to play a more dynamic middlegame.   13.d5  leads to a similar pawn structure as will be examined later in this chapter. Black will prove that White is a bit overextended and will try to open up the center as fast as possible, by playing  13...exd5.

12. O-O cxd4 13. Nxd4
{ A logical recapture, as taking on d4 with the pawn gives White an isolani. This can be strong when White has a lot of activity to compensate, but that's not the case here. }
13... Nd6 { Attacking the bishop. This move also has a clever idea behind it: }
14. Bd3 e5
{ A nice move, as  15.Bxh7+  Kh8  16.Nb3  g6  would trap the bishop.  Thanks to 13... Nd6, the knight can't really go to f5 now. }
15. Nb3 Qh4
{ Protecting h7 and setting up an attack. If you want a draw, you can take on g2 and take the perpetual with Qg4+. However, if you want to play for more, f5 and getting more pieces to the kingside will give Black good chances. }

9. Bd3
{ This is not often played compared to 9. b4 or 9. Be2, but it is still a natural move. White doesn't mind getting doubled pawns, as the open g-file may provide additional dynamic opportunities. }
9... c5
{ This is a familiar move to us, and a strong one. If Black were to play 9... Ne4, he would soon get a transposition to 8... Ne4 where there are a lot of theory and games.   As 9. Bd3 is a relatively rare move in White's play after 8... d6, I don't think it's useful to study all that theory. This is why 9... c5 is a good move to get into less explored territory. }
10. O-O Nbd7
{ Now we are ready to play Rc8 and take on d4, exploiting the position of White's queen. Since White has developed most of the pieces, the only logical moves for him are 11. b3 or 11. b4 to be able to play Bd2. }

15. Nf3
{ In the game between Yudasin - Psakhis @@StartBracket@@1999@@EndBracket@@, Black repeated moves with 15... Nfe4, but White declined. That was very costly for him, as White later lost the game. So this is a possible continuation to aim for a threefold repetition if that's in your interest. }

{ This is an important set-up for Black which will be recurring throughout the course. Black establishes some advantage in space on the kingside which may later help with building up an attack there. Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6.   These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn.   White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one on e4. Then, he can play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2.   The most frequent move is 12. b4 which has the idea of a queenside offensive combined with d4-d5 and opening a diagonal for the important dark-squared bishop, followed by 12.

Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6.   These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn.   White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one at e4, and play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2.   The most frequent move is 12. b4 which has the idea of a queenside offensive combined with d4-d5 and opening a diagonal for the important dark-squared bishop, followed by 12. Ne1 and more occasionally 12. Nd2 and 12. b3. }

{ This is an important set-up for Black which will be recurring throughout the course. Black establishes some advantage in space on the kingside which may later help with building up an attack there. Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6.   These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn.   White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one at e4, and play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2.   The most frequent move is 12. b4 which has the idea of a queenside offensive combined with d4-d5 and opening a diagonal for the important dark-squared bishop, followed by 12.

{ This is an important set-up for Black which will be recurring throughout the course. Black establishes some advantage in space on the kingside which may later help with building up an attack there. Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6.   These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn.   White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one at e4, and play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2.   The most frequent move is 12. b4 which has the idea of a queenside offensive combined with d4-d5 and opening a diagonal for the important dark-squared bishop, followed by 12.

{ This is an important set-up for Black which will be recurring throughout the course. Black establishes some advantage in space on the kingside which may later help with building up an attack there. Typically, Black coordinates his pieces further by bringing a rook to f6 where it can go to the g6-or h6-square, and the queen typically wants to get involved in the attack by going to important light squares like h5 or g6.   These ideas are based on attacking the kingside, but Black can also play for the more flexible combination of ...f5 and ...c5 like we'll see often in other variations of the Nimzo-Indian as well, or push for ...e5 which would work harmoniously with the f-pawn.   White's ideas in this line are to limit the bishop on b7 and chase away the knight by placing a pawn on f3 and possibly one at e4, and play d4-d5 to limit the bishop and open the long diagonal for the dark-squared bishop and weaken the f5-pawn at the same time. So we see that White places pawns on the light squares, and to be able to play f2-f3, White will first have to retreat the knight to e1 or d2.   The most frequent move is 12. b4 which has the idea of a queenside offensive combined with d4-d5 and opening a diagonal for the important dark-squared bishop, followed by 12.

17. Nxd4 cxd4 18. g4
{ White is trying to launch an attack, but we can start our own counterplay too now. }
18... a5
{ This move was suggested by Lc0 to prevent White from playing b4. Humans are not very likely to push the pawns in front of their king like that, but the pawn on a5 also allows to insert ...a4 if White were to play b3. This would protect the c4-pawn that is going to be attacked very soon. We can do this by playing ...Ba6, or another route: ...Bc8-e6. The rook can go to either b8 @@StartBracket@@eyeing b2@@EndBracket@@ or c8  @@StartBracket@@attacking c4@@EndBracket@@. ...Rg6 is still on the table to chase away the queen and defend against the upcoming attack. The position is objectively equal, but there is still plenty to play for. }

Black's pawns in the center are also pleasant as they keep White's pieces at bay, while Black has the d4-square to play for. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ As explained in the Strategic Ideas, this is called the Classical variation and is a very popular and critical line. Study the lines in this chapter carefully! }
4... O-O
{ My choice for this repertoire.   4...b6  I have always had a soft spot for this move, and have played it in several games with reasonable success. However, if White really knows his stuff, there are some lines that are quite difficult to deal with. This is why I ultimately decided to cover the main move 4... O-O, which is very sound, and only play ...b6 a bit later. However, if I manage to solve the problems, I might add 4...b6 later to this course as an alternative way of playing! }
5. a3
{ The main move, forcing us to give up our bishop right away. We will examine other moves such as  5.e4  and  5.Nf3  in  the next chapter. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 b6 7. Bg5
{ Pinning the knight is by far the main move and makes a lot of sense, as we can not solve the pin by putting a bishop on e7. }
7... Bb7 8. f3
{ White's aim is to push e2-e4, getting a strong center and space for the pieces. The downside to this is that White is already behind in development and this move is only making it worse. }
8... d6
{ I think this move is really interesting, consistent with other recommendations and most in the spirit of this repertoire. Instead of occupying the center with the more common move ...d5, the goal is to attack it with ...c5. Although White's center may look strong, Black claims that the pawns can be too far-advanced and even vulnerable. }
9. e4
{ The logical follow-up to 8. f3.    9.e3  This is a transposition to 8. e3.  It is covered via 8. e3 & 9. f3.   and  9.Nh3  will lead to the same positions as after 8. Nh3. }
9... c5 10. dxc5
{ White opens the d-file while Black can't recapture with a piece. } 10... bxc5
{ White has effectively traded his central d-pawn for the b-pawn, leaving Black with a pawn majority in the center although the d6-pawn is optically a bit vulnerable. }
11. Rd1
{ This has been the main move, putting immediate pressure on the d6-pawn. White is worried his king might be unsafe on the queenside and prefers to keep it in the center for now. Black has good replies in 11...e5!?N and 11...Nc6. }
11... Nc6
{ This logical move has been played most often. However, I have also analysed an interesting novelty as an alternative way of playing. }
12. Bxf6
{ Just like after 11. O-O-O, White is trying to ruin our pawn structure on the kingside. }
12... gxf6 13. Ne2
{ 13.Bd3  was played in 4 games. This doesn't worry Black as he can always play ...Qa5 and exchange queens.  13...Qa5  This is similar to 11.Bxf6: the ending is fine for us as we can use the d4-square. }
13... a5
{ A prophylactic move, preventing any pawn breaks on the queenside. Against other moves, such as the most common  13...Qe7  , White could try  14.b4  , as seen in a similar position in the game Howell - Svetushkin @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@. }
14. Qd2
{ We have seen this move before: White puts pressure on the d6-pawn, while keeping the option of transferring his queen to the kingside to assist in a possible attack. }
14... f5
{ Black doesn't care about the d-pawn and instead seizes the initiative: just the way we like it! This was played in the correspondence game Lloyd - Holloway, 2013 that was won by Black. }
15. Qf4
{ Aiming to take on d6 with the rook. There is no way to save the pawn, so we fight for the initiative! }
15... Qf6
{ Attacking b2 so if White takes the pawn on d6 now, we will capture on b2. }
16. exf5 e5 17. Qd2 Nd4
{ We will get back the pawn on f5 and are still ahead in development. } *

7... Bb7 8. e3
{ White does not confront Black in the center immediately, but builds up his pieces logically behind them. Only after that, he will push the pawns to create more influence in the center.   8.Nf3  is a transposition to 7. Nf3.  See here. }
8... d6 9. f3

12... Ba6

13. Rc1 Re8

14. b4 { White's usual pawn push on the queenside. } 14... h6
{ In this case, there is a very concrete reason to play this move @@StartBracket@@besides chasing the bishop away so it doesn't protect e3 anymore, which could be useful sometimes@@EndBracket@@.

Meanwhile, White's attack is not starting yet. Note that we play ...d5 now, as we don't care anymore about attacking g2 - preventing White from developing his kingside is less important when he has decided to just castle queenside. }
15. cxd5 exd5 16. Qc2
{ White's queen is in the way of the bishop on f1, so this move prepares to develop it to d3. }
16... c5

17. Bd3 cxd4 18. exd4 Ne4

19. Kb1 Rc8 20. f3 Nxc3+ 21. bxc3 Nf8
{ and Black will regroup his pieces to put pressure on White's compromised king position. The knight can go to e6, the queen to d7 and the bishop to c6, aiming to go to a4 at some point. Surprisingly, all of these moves were already played in the correspondence game from 2010. Black even won that game @@StartBracket@@which is quite unusual in correspondence chess@@EndBracket@@, so there are definitely chances here!

{ Let's start this chapter by examining some of the less common moves and then look at 2 important 5th moves for White @@StartBracket@@besides 5.a3@@EndBracket@@: 5. e4 and 5. Nf3. }
5. Nf3
{ This is the most popular move, after 5.a3. Transpositions from 4.Nf3 are not rare here, and players who like the option of 4.Qc2 d6 can also use the following lines against the Nf3-variations.   5.e3  c5  Transposes to 4.e3 0-0 5.Qc2.   5.Bd2  b6  Transposes to 4.Bd2; 5.Qc2.   5.Bf4  This commits the bishop too early, on a square where Black can gain a tempo against it, for example by ...Qe7, ...Nbd7 and ...e5.  5...d6  6.Nf3  Or 6.e3 - Black prepares the same plan anyway.  6...Nbd7  7.e3  Qe7 =  We are ready for e5 now and can develop our bishop on c8 with ...b6 and ...Bb7. We are fine here.   5.g3  The fianchetto set-up for White is usually played without Qc2 @@StartBracket@@Please see 4.g3 for more information@@EndBracket@@. Normally we would take on c3 and double the pawns, but White does have the queen on c2. Instead, Black can put his pawn on d5 now so White has to bear in mind ...dxc4, as well as that Black can play a c6+d5 set-up to blunt the bishop on g2.  5...d5  A bit Ragozin-like now, although definitely one where White has played a bit weirdly.  6.Bg2   6.cxd5  exd5  7.Bg2  Nc6  8.Nf3  Ne4 =  We can go Re8 and Bf5 next, with an active position.   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.Qxc3  c5  As White is still underdeveloped, we try to break open the position as soon as possible.  8.cxd5   8.dxc5  d4  =+  Intending to play ...e5 next, when we have a powerful center. We're not really worried about temporarily being a pawn down, as White will struggle tremendously with continuing his development. One idea to keep in mind is ...a5 and possibly ... a4, so White is unable to play b4 and consolidate his c5-pawn.  Ne4  9.Qc2  exd5  10.dxc5  Nc6  We don't usually go for an isolani  @@StartBracket@@we rather let White get one@@EndBracket@@, but in this position Black emphasizes the advantage in development.  11.Nf3  Re8  12.Bg2  Bf5  =+  White is close to finally being able to castle, but our activity is not slowing down with moves such as ...Qf6 @@StartBracket@@preventing b4 by pinning the pawn@@EndBracket@@, ....Rad8 and perhaps ...d4 next. If you prefer, you can also try to get the pawn back with ...Qa5+ and ... Qxc5.  dxc4  7.Nf3  Nc6  8.e3  Rb8 =  We are well-prepared to protect our extra pawn on c4. Again, the move Qc2 is a bit too slow in combination with playing the kingside fianchetto.   5.f3 ?!  This is also a bit too slow: if White wants to play like this, he should really consider it on move 4 @@StartBracket@@Please see 4.f3 for more details@@EndBracket@@.  5...c5  White usually likes to respond to this move with d5, but with a queen on c2 that's impossible.  6.a3   6.dxc5  Bxc5  7.e4   7.Bg5  h6  8.Bh4  d5  ∓  Black is significantly better now, and takes over the initiative.  Nc6  8.Bg5  h6  9.Bh4  d5  Black is playing for his advantage in development, and is signifcantly better.  10.cxd5  exd5  11.Nxd5  Qa5+  12.Qc3  Nxd5  13.Qxa5  Nxa5  14.exd5  Re8+  ∓  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  Nc6  8.e3  This is probably not what White had in mind when playing 5.f3...  8...b6  9.Bd3  Ba6  This is a typical set-up when Bxc3 bxc3 has happened: block the pawn on c4 with c5, then go Nc6-Na5 and Ba6 to attack it. Simple, but effective!  10.Ne2  Na5  11.e4  White realizes it is hopeless to defend the pawn. We don't even bother taking it yet, but improve our position first.  11...h6  First preventing Bg5, which was possibly annoying.  12.e5  Ne8  13.dxc5  bxc5  ∓  And we will take on c4 soon, with a healthy pawn up.   5.Bg5  This is the fourth popular move by White. The bishop is placed on g5 early and one of Black's set-ups consists of quickly going after the unprotected d4-pawn by ...c5, thereby also making it possible to play...Qa5.  5...c5  Black could have also considered playing ...h6 here, but in some lines Black would rather have the pawn on h7 if White takes on f6.  6.dxc5   6.e3  Black can change the structure now and try to isolate White's d-pawn later on.  6...h6  7.Bh4  cxd4  8.exd4  Nc6  9.Nf3  d5  10.a3  Bxc3+  11.bxc3   11.Qxc3  g5  ∓  e5 !  Remember, we're playing for our advantage in development!  12.dxe5  Re8  13.O-O-O  Nxe5  14.Rxd5  Ned7  =+  On the next move Black intends to move the queen, and Black has a promising position as the statical features of White's position are long-term problems.  Qa5  With a very annoying pin.  7.Bd2   7.Bxf6  gxf6  Here we see why we rather have the pawn on h7 instead of h6: it is just slightly less weakening.  8.e3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  Na6 =  With ... Nxc5 next, when we can go our usual b6 and Bb7. The position is objectively equal, but White has long-term statical problems.  Qxc5  8.e3  Now a3 is a threat, as the bishop is unable to retreat and taking on c3 is not very desirable here.  8...Qc7  A lot of queen moves, but keep in mind that White also wasted a tempo with Bg5-Bd2.  9.Nf3   9.Nb5  Qa5 !?  The idea is that we would like to exchange pieces on our terms and open up the position next. Of course, 9...Qc5 can be played as well, with a small signal to repeat moves.   9...Qc5  10.Nc3  and now you can go back to c7 and repeat, or try to play on with 10... d6.  10...d6  10.Nc3   10.Nf3  d5  d5  11.a3  Now there's no need to move as the a1-rook is hanging.  11...dxc4  12.Bxc4  Bd7  Black still does not intend to exchange his bishop for the knight without any form of compensation for it, and intends to play ...Rc8, and possibly move the bishop back to e7.  Be7  Anticipating White playing a3, we just move our bishop away already. We are also getting ready for Nc6-Nb4.  10.Bd3  Nc6  11.a3  Preventing Nb4.11.Nb5 does not help White as we can play ...Qb8 and ...a6 next.  11...b6  12.Nb5  Attacking the queen, but we can chase away the knight later.   12.O-O  Bb7  13.h3  Rac8  14.Rac1  This was played between Gagunashvili - Tran, 2016. Both sides have made very natural moves so far.  14...Na5  N  Simply putting pressure on c4 feels logical. Black also has the option of taking on f3 now. One interesting idea might be Qb8-a8!  12...Qb8  13.Bc3  Threatening Bxf6 and Bxh7+.  13...h6  Now we are ready to kick out the knight.  14.Rd1   14.O-O  a6  15.Nbd4  Nxd4  16.Nxd4  Bb7 =  When we can consider to play either ...Ng4 or ...d6.  a6  15.Nbd4   15.Bxf6  This is a flashy try by White.  15...Bxf6  16.Nd6  Obviously we can't take this knight, but we can easily attack it with ...Be7 so that White probably exchanges on c8 and we neutralized the knight, equalizing the position. We can also improve our position and try to take back a capture on c8 under better circumstances.  16...Ra7 =  Is to defend the pawn on d7 against taking on c8 and Bh7+, and now we can answer Nxc8 by ...Rxc8, so there's play on the c-file /...b5. My old trainer taught me that such a knight on an outpost like d6 may look powerful, but if the other white pieces can't support it, you can just play around it. This seems very true for this situation: White is for example unable to play e4-e5 to support the knight, and has a hard time finding more active squares for the rest of his pieces.  Nxd4  16.Bxd4   16.Nxd4  Bb7 =  If White castles, we have the same idea as before of going ...Ng4 and d6. If White doesn't, we can consider playing ... Rc8 and ...b5 to play on the queenside. Lots of different ideas for Black!  d6  17.O-O  Bd7  18.e4  e5  This idea will also be seen in the 5.Nf3 variation. We weaken the d5-square, but White's knight @@StartBracket@@or any other piece for that matter@@EndBracket@@ is far away and unable to occupy it. So, the d5-square isn't really a weakness and we can play this move without any problems.  19.Bc3  Thus far, we have been following the game of Aronian - Caruana, 2015.19.. .Rc8 followed, but it looks like Black can set more problems with 19...Bg4. In any case, Black has a good game.  19...Bg4  N   5.e4  is less common than 5.a3 and 5. Nf3, but a very principled move. White sees an opportunity to immediately take over the center and grabs it with both hands.  5...d6  The trusted alternative is to play 5...d5 which has, amongst others, been analysed in Barrish's and Sielecki's Nimzo-Ragozin course here on Chessable. I like ...d6 as it is less explored and will give excellent chances to unbalance the position. White's moves have been in descending order of frequency: 6.a3, 6.Bd3, 6.e5, 6.Nf3 and 6.Bg5.  6.a3   6.Bd3  At first, it looked very tempting to suggest the move .. .Nc6, followed by ...Ba5 and possibly ...Nb4 like Kramnik played against Carlsen in 2009, but the consequences of 6...Nc6 7.Nge2 Ba5 8.a3 are difficult to assess as it involves an unclear piece sacrifice. Instead, I have decided on the move 6...e5.  6...e5  This move holds off the e4-e5 push and stakes a claim at the dark squares in the center. We will look at 4 different responses by White played in practice according to descending frequency; 7.d5, 7.Nge2, 7.a3 and 7.Nf3.  7.a3   7.d5  This is the most popular move, but deciding to change the structure immediately gives Black the opportunity to occupy the weakened c5-square.  7...Na6 !  We immediately head towards the c5-square.  8.Nge2  The most natural move, discouraging Bxc3.   8.a3  Bxc3+  9.Qxc3  Nc5  =+  Black has a clear advantage, as the closed structure definitely benefits our knights. I like the plan that was chosen in a recent online game by Gunay Mammadzada of going ...Nh5 and ...f5. To understand why this is good for us: Black has a King's Indian type of position, but without the dark-squared bishop that often needs a lot of moves to become more active.   8.Nf3  The knight does not really belong here, as White likes to maintain the option of playing f3.  8...Nc5  =+  With similar play as in the previous variation: at some point we will take on c3, and Nh5-f5 is very much in the air.  8...Bc5  A different way of playing Kramnik's idea: instead of playing Ba5 and Nc6 to go Nb4, we have played Na6 and Bc5 to get the knight to b4!  9.a3  Preventing Nb4, but now we take over the initiative:   9.h3  Nb4 is not the only threat: Ng4 was also in the air, so White prevents that one.  9...Nb4  10.Qd2  Nxd3+  11.Qxd3  Black equalized and has the bishop pair. Either ...c6 to open the c-file and play on the queenside, or ...a6 is useful as we can combine playing to prepare ...b5 with the preparation of moving the knight and play ... f5 as soon as White castles.  11...a6  12.Be3  Bxe3  13.Qxe3  Bd7 =  Preparing to play b5, with an interesting position. Play could for example continue with 14. O-O b5 15. b3 Nh5.  9...Ng4 !  10.Nd1  Qh4  =+  f2 is under a lot of pressure, especially if we follow up by f5 and open up the f-file. White needs to be very precise to hold off these threats.   7.Nge2  This gives Black the opportunity to change the structure. We will take the d4-pawn off the board and create play on the dark squares and possibly the e-file.  7...exd4  Now the structure is reminiscent of a Philidor, but with the bishop on b4. This seems fine for Black.  8.Nxd4  Re8  Transposes to 7.Nge2.  9.f3  Protecting the pawn on e4. Transposition to 6.Bd3.  9...Nc6  10.Nxc6  bxc6  11.O-O  Bc5+  We now see the advantage of playing Re8 and provoking f3.  12.Kh1  Nd7 =  Black has a nice position. White doesn't have a lot of defenders on the kingside, so this is where we should try to get an attack going with moves such as Qh4 and Ne5.   7.Nf3  exd4  8.Nxd4  Re8  Transposes to 7.Nge2.  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  White does best not to recapture with the queen, as we would gain time with ...exd4 Qxd4 Nc6. It's very important to study this line carefully as it could arise from the main move 6. a3 Bxc3 bxc3 e5 Bd3.  8...Nc6  9.Ne2  From this position, several approaches are possible. It looks interesting to move away the knight so ...c5 becomes possible, putting pressure on the d4-pawn so White is provoked to play d5. After that, the pawn on c4 can be weak.  9...Na5  10.O-O  c5  In practice, White has played 11.f4, 11. d5 and 11.Rb1.  11.f4   11.Rb1  was played once in Heinke - Haznedaroglu, e-mail @@StartBracket@@2013@@EndBracket@@. In that game 11...b6 was played, which is fine but in the game Black rather had a defensive position. The text move has more active ideas.  11...Nh5  N  The knight can now work against White's plan of f2-f4, does not get pinned, and in the mean time Black prepares to play ...b5 by ...

One of the ideas is to play ...f5, and to have ...Qc6 if White were to play Rd1. White has compensation for the pawn, but that might evaporate if he doesn't play energetically enough, leaving us a healthy pawn up.  13.Be2   13.Rd1  Qc6 =  The only good square, as Qe7 or Qe8 both run into Bc5. We are not worried about any Ng5 moves, as we can always play f5. We will see the idea of playing f5 and e5 in the upcoming variations as well.  f5  14.f4  Ng6  15.Nc3   15.Ng5  e5  Here we see the f5 and e5 idea that I mentioned before.

Therefore he is interested to play ...f5 at a certain moment to take away this square or open the f-file after exf6, and count on his bishop pair in the endgame.  14.Rg1+  Kh8  15.Bd3  Bd7  ∞  This occured in Fodor-Turner, 2015 that ended in a draw.

Qc2 Nimzo-Indian repertoire on Chess24, although he does not cover the reply I recommend for Black.   I used to underestimate the Bd2 move that White can play in several lines, like 4. Bd2. However, Black actually has to know his stuff, so please do take it seriously! By unpinning the knight, White is now threatening to play e4.6. e4 e5 and we have a transposition to our 5. e4 lines. Black is fine here. 6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 b6 This will usually transpose to lines covered in 4. Qc2 with 5. a3. }
6... b6 { Our favorite set-up. } 7. e4
{ White plays for a strong center but Black counterattacks it immediately.   7.e3  This is of course very possible, but a little less energetic than 7. e4.  7...Bb7  8.Bd3  c5  Nbd7 is a more common option, but I like waiting with that move. The knight might end up on the more active square c6 instead!  9.a3   9.dxc5  bxc5  10.a3  Ba5  Now that the bishop can safely retreat, we rather keep it on the board.  11.O-O  Nbd7  Nc6 is also possible, but I like not blocking the bishop on b7.  12.Rfd1  Qe7  13.Rab1  Bxf3  14.gxf3  Ne5  15.Be2  Rab8 =  Bxc3  Now we have no choice. Luckily, we have some strong moves coming up.  10.Bxc3  cxd4  11.exd4  Bxf3 !  With the center slightly different than in the previous line, I think taking on f3 is much stronger. White's structure is just ruined.   11...Nbd7  is also possible, keeping the option of taking on f3 later.  12.gxf3  Nc6 =  White can castle long and try to attack, but we can respond by playing d5 and blocking the bishop on c3. As we have no weaknesses, we are doing fine.   7.a3  A logical follow-up to Bd2: White wants to force a capture on c3 and take back with the bishop.  7...Bxc3  8.Bxc3  Bb7  9.e3  Ne4  By now, this idea should no longer be a surprise to you.  10.Bd3  f5  11.O-O-O   11.O-O  Nxc3  12.bxc3  Bxf3  13.gxf3  Nd7  =+  White has 2 doubled pawns and his bishop is not great, while we have no weaknesses.  Nd7  with the idea of ...c5 and ...Rc8, with an interesting battle ahead.   7.g3  Bb7  8.Bg2  Nbd7  9.O-O  Transposes to 6. g3, variation 9.Bd2. }
7... c5 8. a3
{ Combining e4 and a3 is of course possible too.   8.e5  Now things get concrete.  8...cxd4  9.exf6  dxc3  10.bxc3  Qxf6  The bishop is untouchable because of the pin.  11.Bd3  h6  12.O-O  Bc5  An ideal spot for the bishop. The line continues though:  13.Be4  d5 !  The only way not to lose material.  14.cxd5  exd5  15.Bxd5  Nc6 =  Material equality has been restored. We will develop our bishop and have a balanced position.   8.Bd3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  Bc5  10.Nb3  Nc6  This has also been seen before: we now threaten Nb4 and Ng4.  11.O-O  Nb4  N  12.Qb1  Ng4  13.Be1  A bit artificial, but it does protect f2.  13...Ne5 =  We can attack the pawn on c4 next. It's a Maroczy structure again, but quite a pleasant one! }
8... Bxc3 9. Bxc3 { 9.bxc3  Qc7 = } 9... cxd4 10. Nxd4
{ 10.Bxd4  was played in Svane - Zhigalko, 2016.  10...e5  11.Bc3  Transposing back to the main line of 11. Nf3.  11...Nbd7 }
10... e5
{ Weakening the d5-square, but White is unable to put a knight there anytime soon. }
11. Nf3
{ Transposing back to the main line of 11. Nf3.   11.Ne2  was played in the game Zhao - Anton Guijarro, 2019.  11...Be6  12.Ng3  In that game 12...Qc7 was played, with ideas of ...b5. Improvements for White can be made upon that game and therefore I suggest to put pressure on the c4-pawn immediately, and use the f6-knight to add additional pressure later.  12...Nc6  N  13.b3  Rc8  Black hints at ...b5.  14.a4   14.Qd2  Getting out of the idea of ...b5 and trying to pressure d4.  14...Na5 !?  Encouraging White to take the knight as the pawn on a5 help Black in attacking White's pawn structure.  15.Rb1  Qc7  We can reroute the knight to c5 and play Rfd8.  h5 !?  With the knight on g3, this move makes sense, especially as White will probably stop the advance by h4, creating a target later as Black has ideas to play ...Nd7-c5.  15.h4  Nd7  16.Bd3   16.Nxh5 ?!  f5 !  with a strong initiative. A sample continuation:  17.Ng3  fxe4  18.Nxe4  Bf5  Now Nc5 is threatened.  19.O-O-O  Nc5  20.f3  Bxe4  21.fxe4  Rf4  =+  And we will win back our pawn, with a good position.  g6  17.Qd2  Nc5 =  White has the bishop pair, but in a closed position like this one that's not really a problem. Our queen can go to f6 and the rook to d8.   11.Nf5  Bxf5  12.exf5  d5 =  The tactics seem to work out in our favour here, and we have nice central control. If White takes on d5, we will take back with the queen and play Nc6 later.   11.Nb3  Happened in Maris - Kuljasevic @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@. Black can bind the queenside and put pressure on c4.  11...a5  N  12.Be2   12.Nd2  a4  13.Rd1  Qc7  a4  13.Nd2  Nbd7 = }
11... Nbd7 12. Nd2 Nc5 13. Be2 Bb7
{ 13...Bd7 was played in Risting - Oleksiyenko @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@, and later ...Bc6 was played. Black can also play ...Bb7 right away, with a very elastic and dynamic position where Black can regroup his knights, pressure the c4-pawn with ...Rc8 and perhaps play ...Nh5-f4 when ...Qg5 starts making sense like it happened in that game. 5.Nf3  Keiman,Clemens }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O
{ Let's start this chapter by examining some of the less common moves and then look at 2 important 5th moves for White @@StartBracket@@besides 5.a3@@EndBracket@@: 5. e4 and 5. Nf3. }
5. Nf3
{ This is the most popular move, after 5. a3. Transpositions from 4. Nf3 are not rare here, and players who like the option of 4. Qc2 d6 can also use the following lines against the Nf3-variations.   5.e3  c5  Transposes to 4. e3 O-O 5. Qc2.   5.Bd2  b6  Transposes to 4. Bd2; 5. Qc2.  See here. }
5... d6
{ This is an interesting choice as it creates more unbalanced positions compared to other alternatives. I would love to recommend 5...b6 here, but I think it's dangerous in this case to allow e2-e4 as it turns out that it is not easy to undermine the center in this case.   5...d6 instead prepares to take a stance in the center right away because when White plays e2-e4 now, we simply transpose to the lines in 5.e4 where the knight is not ideally placed on f3. }
6. g3
{ The fianchetto is currently the third popular move. As the bishop can become strong on the long diagonal, one way of fighting against the fianchetto in general is to oppose the bishop yourself. }
6... b6 7. Bg2 Bb7 8. O-O
{ Now that the knight is unpinned, Black has to be careful with the dark-squared bishop as it can't safely retreat to e7 in case the knight moves and threatens the bishop with a2-a3. }
8... Nbd7
{ Keeps more tension in the position compared to the most popular move  8...Bxc3  , but the bishop on b4 is now a bit at risk as it can't retreat to e7.  I've analysed 9.a3, 9.b3, 9.Bd2, 9.Nd1 and the main move of 9.Rd1. }
9. a3
{ As we know, White can throw in this move at a lot of different times, so the positions often transpose. }
9... Bxc3 10. Qxc3
{ Suddenly, we have arrived in a position that often arises from either 4.Qc2 d6 lines, or from 4.Qc2 O-O 5.a3 with 7.Nf3 and 8.g3. See here for that specific move order. }
10... a6
{ A very rare move but it was played by Hracek and Sargissian @@StartBracket@@second of Aronian@@EndBracket@@, so it's interesting to take a look. The idea is actually quite simple, we try to attack the center from the flank by preparing a ...b5 push.   10...c5  If you don't like 10...a6, this is the move I would suggest for you to explore deeper on your own. }
11. b3
{ This was featured in Georgiev - Hracek, 2017.   11.Rd1  b5  With again a transposition to Topalov - Grischuk which is covered under variation  9.Rd1.  See here.   11.b4  wasn't played in this particular position but it transposes later on to two games.  11...Qe7  12.Bb2  b5  13.c5  Be4=  when we can use the d5-square for our knight again. }
11... b5 { We just follow our plan. } 12. Bf4
{ 12.Rd1  would transpose into Topalov-Grischuk @@StartBracket@@2013@@EndBracket@@.   12.c5  Be4=  Solving the threat of c6. Next up is Nd5. }
12... bxc4 13. bxc4 Be4
{ Stepping away from the b-file so a rook move would not attack the bishop with tempo, and preventing Rb1. }
14. Rfd1 h6 15. Rac1
{ We are still following the game Georgiev - Hracek. If White puts the queen on a5, then just ...Nb8 and on the next move ...Nc6 when the position is equal. }
15... a5
{ We'll see that we also use this idea against 11.Rd1 and 12.a3 in the game of Topalov against Grischuk. }
16. Ne1 Bxg2 17. Kxg2 Qe7 { Black has no problems here. } *

{ This is an interesting choice as it creates more unbalanced positions compared to other alternatives.

6. Bd2
{ This is the most popular move in the position and it was also recommended by Jan Gustafsson in his 4.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3
{ 5.Nge2  White intends to play a2-a3 quickly to recapture with the knight.  5...c6  Although the number of games played here is nowhere near the main move 5...d5 or the interesting 5...Re8, the move 5...c6 has become quite popular in recent years. The idea behind this move is that Black can retreat the bishop to c7 where it stands well. We are not scared of the center that White can build up - on the contrary, we are going to attack it or use it to open up the game. This variation has strong potential to get double-edged positions and even piece sacrifices.  6.a3  The only logical move: White has specifically prepared this with 5.Nge2, so why play something else?  6...Ba5  From this position, the most popular has been to attack the bishop on a5 with b4 to solve the pin, which is very natural. However, playing without b4 is also seen in practice, for example 7. Ng3, 7.Qc2, 7.c5 and other rare moves have been tried.  7.b4  This is currently White's main option to resolve the pin right away and grab even more space.   7.Ng3  This is the second most popular move. This makes sense as we have just played . ..Ba5, so taking on c3 now would be a waste of tempo. Therefore, this knight move seems logical: White simply wants to bring his bishop on f1 into play while also keeping an eye on the e4-square from g3. Some White players prefer to remain flexible and wait with this move though, as the knight can also go to f4 at times.  7...d5  8.Bd3  Black waits till the bishop develops to take on c4, followed by a pawn move in the center, comparable to lines in the Semi-Slav.   8.Bd2  As often, White can throw in this move anywhere and it will usually transpose in some way.  8...Nbd7  9.cxd5  If the bishop on f1 moves we will take on c4, and White was running out of useful waiting moves. So he decides to take on d5 himself. Now our bishop from c8 improves though.  9...exd5  10.Bd3  Re8  11.O-O  Bc7 =  With a familiar structure in which Black will regroup his forces to the kingside.   8.Qc2  This has little independent value.  8...Nbd7  9.Be2  dxc4  With a transposition to 7.Qc2.   8.Be2  Black can just play similarly as in 8.Bd3 by taking on c4 and after 9. Bxc4 we transposed.  8...dxc4  See 8.Bd3.   8.cxd5  Taking straight away is also possible, but doesn't differ much from playing Bd2 first.  8...exd5  9.Bd3  Re8  10.O-O  Nbd7  Black's plan is clear. The bishop can go to c7, the knight on d7 can go to f8 and from there Black prepares to play on the kingside. I will show some sample moves to give you a good idea of how the game can continue.  11.Bd2  Bc7  12.Qc2  Nf8  13.f3  h5 =  I like this way of attacking on the kingside. And why not! I don't see a downside for Black at the moment. With again the same attacking motives.  14.Rf2  This was played by Dubov against Andreikin in 2012. Black already has a promising position after this move.  14...h4  15.Nge2  Ne6  16.Rd1  Qd6  N  Andreikin played ...a6, but I find this move more thematic.  8...dxc4  9.Bxc4  c5  10.O-O   10.dxc5  This has also been seen in practice but it's a dubious one.  10...Qxd1+  11.Kxd1  Bxc3  12.bxc3  Bd7  =+  White's structure is ruined and his pawns are hard to defend, giving Black a lasting edge.  cxd4  11.exd4  Now we have the isolated queen's pawn structure again that we have seen many times before.   11.Nce4  happened in Wemmers - Tkachiev, 2013.  11...Bb6  N  In the game followed ...Nxe4. This is a perfectly fine move but if Black plays a natural move like ...Nc6 later, White can play Qh5 with a reasonable position and some possible attacking chances. I'd rather avoid that! Instead, we just protect our extra pawn.  12.exd4  Bxd4  =+  Black is a healthy pawn up.  11...Nc6  12.Be3  Bb6  Putting immediate pressure on the pawn, which is already not so easy to defend.  13.Nge2  Ng4 =  Black is fine if not already slightly better.   7.Qc2  This is the third popular move. If White really doesn't want to allow doubled pawns @@StartBracket@@which he does after the immediate Ng3 - not that we took there@@EndBracket@@, this is a logical option to prepare Ng3.  7...d5  8.Ng3  This has little independent value.  8...Nbd7  We are again waiting for White to move his bishop from f1 so we can take on c4.  9.Be2  Bd3 is the same, as in both cases we would take on c4 and transpose.   9.cxd5  exd5  10.Bd3  Re8  11.O-O  Bc7  This is really similar to what we examined earlier.  12.Bd2   12.b4  Transposes to a line in 7.b4 Bc7 8.Ng3.  12...h5 =  We attack in a similar way as before.   12.e4  White's pieces are all aiming at e4, so it makes sense to examine this move here. It also occured in a game: Wemmers - Cramling, 2014.  12...dxe4  13.Ncxe4  h6  Stopping Bg5. On the next move Black prepares to take on e4 to resume development. Black is slightly for choice already.  14.Be3  Nxe4  N  15.Nxe4  Nf6  =+  h5  13.f3  Nf8 =  With again the same attacking motives.  9...dxc4  With a transposition to 7.Qc2.  10.Bxc4  e5  Normally we would like to consider ...c5, but in this case White takes on c5 and the bishop is forced to take on c3 as otherwise b2-b4 would be a nuisance.  11.O-O  exd4  12.exd4  Bc7  13.Bg5  Let's see what happens if White pins us before we got the chance to play b6.   13.Ba2  White is sensing that ... Nb6 will come, so he already moves his bishop away. Maybe he also has some potential Bb1 ideas on his mind, although that's not very threatening at the moment.  13...Nb6  As we want to go to d5 do block the isolani, we play this move anyway.  14.Re1   14.Rd1  The pawn on d4 is now protected and can go to d5 in certain lines. For example, 14...Qd6 for example will be met with d5, as if the pawn takes back on d5 there are suddenly Nb5 tricks. So be careful!  14...h6 =  Preventing the annoying Bg5, and getting ready for Nbd5. Note that d5 currently doesn't work for White as we can just take the pawn.  Qd6  Now d5 isn't on the table, so we can play this natural attacking move.  15.Bg5  was played in Dimov - Zhekov, 2015. Careful! Bb1 is now a real option.  15...Bd7  Discouraging Bb1 while developing. Those multifunctional smart moves are the best!  16.Rad1   16.Bb1 ?!  Let's see why this is not so strong anymore...  16...Rfe8 !  This was not possible with the bishop still on c8. Black makes some room for the king on f8 so that Qxh7+ will not be mate, and sets up some tricks of his own. For example, Rxe8+ Rxe8 Bxf6?? fails to Re1+ Nf1 and the pretty mate Qxh2#. If White tries Re3, Black has ...g6.  Nfd5 =  Now a future Bb1 can be answered by ...f5. Black is fine here.  13...Nb6  Winning some time by attacking the bishop. Note that h6 here would be too slow: White can just respond Bh4 and maintain the pin. Compared to the main line, this makes one key difference: 13. .. h6 14. Bh4 Nb6 15. Nce4 Qxd4 16. Nxf6+! gxf6 17. Qg6+! Auch! This was not possible with the pawn on h6. Please remember this difference, as it would be very costly to lose like this!  14.Nce4  This was played between Wiedenkeller - Maghsoodloo in 2018. The position becomes sharp but Black is tactically ready for it!   14.Ba2  h6  Now this is fine, as after Bh4 we can just take on d4. In Stephan - Villegas, 2018 followed:  15.Be3  Qd6 =  White has no attack and we can just gradually improve our pieces.  14...Qxd4  15.Bxf6  Here Nxf6+ would just lose a piece, as both bishops would be hanging after gxf6.  15...Qxc4 !  Don't play 15... gxf6? now! This would run into 16. Rad1! when Black struggles to defend f6 and has a ruined structure. Luckily, taking on c4 works out well for us as there is no mate now because White first has to save his attacked queen.  16.Qd2  Qe6  N  in the game ...Qd5 was played. The text move has the advantage that Black can play ...Qg6 or ...Qg4 at a certain moment.  17.Qd4  Qg4  ∓  We could still not take on f6, but there are now numerous threats. Even ...c5 is on the cards. So Black is fine here, but it's important to remember the moves well!   7.c5  This alters the situation on the board. However, we will get a familiar pawn structure anyway...  7...d5  8.cxd6  Qxd6  And as you might notice, this is the same pawn structure as after playing ... dxc4 in some of the other lines! @@StartBracket@@just exhanging the d-pawn for the c-pawn@@EndBracket@@. Given White has wasted some time and still struggles to develop, I would say this can't be bad for Black.  9.b4  Bc7  This transposes into what we have already examined in 7.c5.  10.g3  Trying to develop the bishop in a different way, which would not be possible if we could still go dxc4. Here I'll suggest two choices: 10...e5 and 10...a5. The main suggestion is to play the natural .. .e5 but some players might be attracted to the more unclear and unexplored play of 10...a5.  10...e5  is the most natural of both pawn moves.   10...a5 !?  This has only been tried 6 times, but surprisingly 3 of those games feature the same white player @@StartBracket@@Gleb Dudin@@EndBracket@@!  11.b5  cxb5  None of Dudin's opponent went for this move, but it's stronger than the alternatives e5 and Rd8, that give White time to finish developing. We need to act fast!  12.Bg2  The point of the previous move was that 12. Nxb5 runs into Qd5! with a double attack on the knight and rook.  12...Qb6  13.Qb3  b4  14.axb4  If 14.Na4, Black can opt for repetition with ...Qb5 or play ...Qa7 to continue. Up to you!  14...Nc6  Both sides were unable to take the pawn because of the pin, but now Nxb4 is a real threat.  15.b5  Nb4  16.O-O  Bd7 =  The position is interesting but balanced. The pawn on b5 is weak, but White has some active potential.  11.Bg2  Qe7  This might seem a little mysterious, but we are aiming to close the center by continuing with 12...e4. 11... Re8 with the same idea has also been seen in practice.  12.O-O  e4  This pawn blocks in the white bishop on g2 and gives us a lot of space.  13.Qc2  Re8  14.h3  Nbd7 =  Now that the kingside is closed, we can focus our attention on attacking the advanced pawns on the queenside.   7.Bd2  This is theoretically not that challenging. Black is always happy to get the bishop to c7 and play for ...d5.  7...d5  8.Ng3  And we have already transposed to 7. Ng3 d5 8. Bd2. White could have included 8.cxd5 but this will also transpose as Ng3 is coming anyway.   7.g3  This does not seem that accurate to play at this point, inviting ...d5 with the threat of ... dxc4. It's not the first time that we see in this repertoire that Black is playing against White's c4-pawn while White intends to fianchetto the bishop.  7...d5  8.cxd5   8.b4  Bc7  9.cxd5  exd5  Black often has strong control on the light squares, and the knight can go to c4 later on in these structures. The pawn on c6 that often becomes a backward one after b5-bxc6 can be defended quite easily.   9...cxd5  is an easy alternative that was played by Vidit, but it's not the principled move on the board.  10.Bg2  Nbd7  11.O-O  Nb6 =  10.Bg2  Bf5  11.b5   11.O-O  Nbd7  12.b5  Re8  Transposes to 11.b5.  Nbd7  12.O-O  Re8  Transposes to 11.b5.  13.bxc6  bxc6  14.Qa4  Re6  As said, defending the pawn is not too hard for Black. We can chase away the queen with ...Nb6 soon, heading towards c4.  15.Nf4  Bxf4  16.exf4  Nb6  17.Qd1  Nc4  18.h3  h5  ∓  The game was drawn in Garkauskas - Cadilhac @@StartBracket@@2007@@EndBracket@@, but Black has a nice advantage as he strongly controls the light squares and is about to put more pressure on White's position with ...Qa5.  Qxd5 !?  Now we see why g3 was not timed well.  9.Rg1  Qd6 =  and Black is fine as White can't castle short. It quickly went downhill for White in Riemersma - Lai, 2018 after 10.Bg2 e5 11. dxe5 Qxe5 Qd4 Qe7.  7...Bc7  This is where we wanted to place the bishop. From here, it cooperates with the pawns  @@StartBracket@@that will soon be on c6, d5 and e6@@EndBracket@@ perfectly.  8.e4  Now White finally gets that mighty pawn center that we will immediately attack. From here on, the fireworks are starting!   8.Ng3  d5  This will resemble the positions with 7. Ng3.  9.cxd5  This has been the most popular move but it rather helps Black to develop freely in the center and on the kingside.   9.f4  This aggressive attempt does prevent the typical plan of Black to play ...e5, but Black can take another approach.  9...Nbd7  There are now ideas of playing ...Nb6, but also waiting for White to move the bishop before taking on c4 followed by ...Nd5.  10.c5  White has used quite some time to get a space advantage, but as is known from those positions, the weaknesses left behind in their camp can be counterattacked.   10.Bd3  dxc4  11.Bxc4  Nd5 =  with the idea of ...f5, firmly locking down all of White's weaknesses.  10...e5 !

This structure outlines several Black's potential ideas on the kingside: ...h5 followed by ...h4 is played often, the knight on d7 is likely to go to f8 later and maneuvered to e6 or g6 later on, and the one from f6 already is ready for ...Ng4. The queen can be placed on squares like for example h4, g5 or d6 depending on circumstances. Also, not uncommon is to play ...g6 and ...

We will continue by developing our bishop to the queenside, as well as our standard attacking ideas in the position.  12...h5 =  We attack in a similar way as before.   8.d5  This looks premature but it's actually quite a good move!  8...Qe7  White was threatening d6, so we prevent it while improving the position of the queen.  9.g3   9.Bb2  8. d5 has opened the diagonal, so the bishop is excellently placed here.  9...exd5  10.cxd5  Be5  We immediately try to oppose that powerful bishop. Now we can also go d6 without blocking our bishop.  11.g3  a5 =  and White can't easily play Bg2 as the pawn on b4 would hang.  cxd5  10.cxd5  a5  11.b5  e5 =  Now the bishop won't be so strong on g2, and we can start developing our queenside.   8.Bb2  d5  9.Ng3  Nbd7  Transposes to 8.Ng3   8.c5  d5  9.cxd6  Qxd6  This transposes into what we have already examined in 7.c5.  8...d5  9.e5  By far the most logical move: White wants to keep his center intact.   9.Bg5  This does not really force Black to act, so Black is free to use forcing moves himself.  9...h6  10.Bh4  dxe4  11.Nxe4  g5  Our favorite unpinning move is also present in this variation.  12.Nxf6+  Qxf6  13.Bg3  Bxg3  14.hxg3  a5 =  White is really underdeveloped and is not able to take advantage of our weakened kingside. Meanwhile, we can try to push e5 to open up lines @@StartBracket@@or a diagonal@@EndBracket@@ for our pieces.   9.cxd5  This is a rare move that popped up in a game from last year.  9...exd5  White is really only doing us a favour by opening up this diagonal for our bishop.  10.e5  Ne8  Not blocking the bishop, and intending ...f6 @@StartBracket@@and later fxe5@@EndBracket@@ against 11.g3, Ng3 and Be3, with a good game.  9...Nfd7  An alternative move was to play 9. ..Ne8, but I like to have the knight on d7 in order to sacrifice it on e5!

But Black can start his operations against another advanced pawn...   10.cxd5  exd5  Again, this only seems to help Black.  11.f4  Trying to stabilize the center.   11.g3  f6  12.e6  Nb6  ∓  and White is in trouble as the e6-pawn is too far from home.  11...Qe7  12.Qc2  came into discussion in Kuzubov - Volokitin, 2019. Now that everything is defended, we won't sacrifice but go a more quieter route.   12.g3  was played in Garcia Palermo - El Debs, 2019.  12...f6  13.Bg2  fxe5  14.dxe5  Nxe5 !  Again this sacrifice!  15.fxe5  Bxe5  Because of the pin, the knight on c3 is once again hanging. Combined with the open f-file, the black pieces are just to powerful for the poor white king.  16.Bb2  Nd7  Since White can't castle anyway, we have all the time in the world to prepare Nb6-c4.  17.Rf1  in the game followed . ..Rxf1, but that eases the pressure on White's position. It would be better to speed up development or keep the rook on the board for attacking chances.  17...Re8  =+  Obviously we keep this rook on the board. White's position is dangerous. White's king can't easily go to f2 because ...Bxc3 followed by Qe3+ is in the air.  12...Bb6  Putting some pressure on d4 now the queen is no longer defending it.  13.Na4  Of course you can go back to c7 now and go for a repetition...but that's not what we came for, right!?  13...f6  14.Nxb6  axb6  Now we can hope to use the open a-file and block the white pawns with ...b5.  15.Bb2  b5  16.Ng3  fxe5  17.fxe5  Nb6  18.Bd3  in the game Black played Qh4 which is a good move, although White could defend the position with a new move 19.Rf1. Therefore I'll suggest 18...g6 with a good position for Black. If you want to play more dynamically, it is interesting to play 18.. . Nc4 and sacrifice the h7-pawn but in return Black gets to speed up his play quite a bit, making White's position hard to defend.  18...g6  19.Rf1  N8d7  =+  White's king is still weak and the pawns have once again left a lot of weak squares behind. We can go Nc4 soon.   10.Ng3  In this scenario, the knight seems more active on f4. Now we can continue our plans undisturbed.  10...f6  11.exf6  Nxf6  In practice, Black took back with the queen but recapturing with the knight looks sensible as well. He prepares to play ...Nbd7 and is likely to capture on c4 so that ...

Memorize these lines well as the rewards for it can be very high! As a cautionary tale, I will tell you that I mixed up some lines in an OTB game last year, sacrificed a piece where it didn't work, and quickly lost. You will find this game at the bottom of this chapter. I hope that motivates you to study the lines well!)  11.Rb1  This is the typical move in practice, defending b4.11.Ra2 would be a new move but Black seems fine by taking on b4, or even sacrifice the knight on e5.  11...axb4  12.axb4  c5 !  A fantastic move! It is very important to remember this one in these lines. Black either wants to open the e1-a5 diagonal, or undermine the d4-pawn so the e5-pawn becomes weakened.  13.bxc5   13.dxc5  This is the other option, but it's clear that this loses the e5-pawn, making this not a real sacrifice.  13...Bxe5  N  14.Nb5  Qf6  I love how Black attacks something with every move, and White can only respond and not create much himself.

The queen can return to c7 if necessary and we have Bb7 coming in.  Qe5+  18.Qe3  d4  19.Qxe5  Nxe5  20.Be2  Ra2 =  Black exercises pressure. The d4-pawn is potentially a great asset!  Ba5  The point behind c5.  14.Bd2  This is necessary as protecting with the queen with 14. Qc2 comes with disadvantages after 14...Nc6 attacking d4, or if 14.Qd2, then 14...Nxc5 is strong.  14...Nc6  Attacking d4: this pawn is unprotected after Bd2.  15.Nb5   15.cxd5  N  This is a novelty, but it should be a better try for White. Even here, we are fine though.  15...Nxd4  16.Nb5  White has to try something, as otherwise we will just take one of his pawns. From this position, Black can either play a complicated line starting with 16. ..Nxc5! 17.Nxd4 Ne4, or if these variations are too dense for your taste, it's fine to play 16... Nxb5 17.Bxb5 Nxe5 18.0-0 exd5 and Black equalizes. I'll still recommend the complicated line because Black is in a better situation if he knows the tactical details of the struggle - and if you study this well, you will know them!  16...Nxc5 !  We don't care about our hanging knight!  17.Nxd4  Ne4  White needs to address the threats on d2, but taking on a5 would spell disaster.

Nxd4  Let's try to sacrifice again, because why not?  17.Nd3  This was played in Koudounis - Samaridis, 2020. White is trying to hang on to his two pawns, but it won't work out for him.   17.Nxd4  Nxe5  A double attack.

5... c5 6. Nf3
{ As described in the strategic ideas for this chapter, this is White's most popular set-up. It's also the one I like facing most, as it has good potential for interesting positions!   6.Nge2  This is the second most popular move by White. White is about to play a2-a3 and take back on c3 with the knight if Black would capture. We can approach this move by the familiar recipe of taking on d4 followed by d5, once again to create an isolated pawn for White.  6...cxd4  7.exd4  d5  White has played 8.cxd5, 8.0-0, 8. a3, 8.c5 and 8.Bg5 in practice.  8.cxd5   8.a3  is the third popular move.  8...dxc4  9.Bxc4   9.Bxh7+  This is seldomly played and for good reason: White does not gain anything by this move other than giving up his strong light-squared bishop.  9...Nxh7  10.axb4  Nc6  11.b5  Na5  Or ...Nb4 supported by ...a5 is equally fine.  12.Ra3   12.Bf4  This does not hinder our plan, so we can just develop in the same way.  12...b6  13.O-O  Bb7 =  b6 =  Black reached equality and can proceed with strong natural moves.  Bd6  The retreat to e7 has been more popular, but I like this more active square for the bishop. There is also a hidden idea behind it!  10.Bg5   10.Qd3  This move may seem a bit odd, but it protects the bishop on c4 which allows White to castle next.  10...Nbd7  As we have seen before, I find this a more harmonious square for the knight. In this case, it can jump to b6 @@StartBracket@@attacking the bishop@@EndBracket@@ and possibly d5.  11.O-O  if 11.Bg5, Black can transpose to 10. Bg5 by playing a6.  11...Nb6  12.Ba2  Bd7 =  The bishop will be activated via c6.   10.Nb5  This has been seen in practice. I don't find it very dangerous though: we may lose a tempo with our bishop, but we can chase back the knight with a6 soon and make White lose a tempo as well.  10...Be7  11.Bf4  11...a6  12.Nbc3   12.Nc7 ?!  Ra7  13.Ne8  This is not a move one you see everyday! So it's good to be prepared for this.  13...Nc6  14.Nxf6+  Bxf6  ∓  White's operation has not brought him what he was hoping for.  b5  and next comes ...Bb7, when Black is slightly for choice. I sometimes get the same structure with Black @@StartBracket@@from the French Tarrasch with 3...c5 for example@@EndBracket@@, but this is a pleasant version as White hasn't even castled yet.   10.O-O ?!  Here the hidden idea is shown: White is unable to castle because of Bxh2+!  10...Bxh2+  11.Kxh2  Qc7+  and we win a pawn.  Nbd7  Black equalized. There aren't many games yet but Black can choose to play ...a6 followed by ...b5, or ...Nb6-d5. In practice, the move 11.Qd3 and Qd2 has been seen, after which ...a6 makes sense. Castling short is still not recommended as Black has the Bxh2+! trick once more, now followed by Ng4+.  11.Qd3  White can think about retreating the bishop to b3 and play it to c2, so Black has to be aware that the knight on d7 has a good defending function of protecting h7 by defending the f6-knight. This is why we play a6 in this case. If White plays the queen to d2 like it happened in practice too, Black does not have these concerns as much and can play Nb6.   11.Qd2  Nb6  12.Bd3  Bd7  The bishop can be activated on c6, whereas the other bishop can break the pin with ...Be7 if necessary.  11...a6  12.Ba2  b5 =  We can finish development and have a good position.   8.c5  White releases the tension early, and Black can undermine the c5-pawn right away.  8...b6  9.a3  Bxc3+  10.Nxc3  White has achieved the aim of 6. Nge2: to be able to take back on c3 with the knight. However, it has cost him a lot of time.  10...Nc6  Putting more pressure on the center.  11.Bb5   11.O-O  Nxd4  The lines now get a forced nature.  12.Bxh7+  White gains nothing from taking on b6 as Black just recaptures with the queen.  12...Nxh7  13.Qxd4  Ba6  14.Re1  bxc5  15.Qxc5  Qd7  Black is slightly for choice because we have good control in the center.  Bb7  12.O-O   12.Bxc6  was played in Ianovsky - Panchenko, 2008. Black played well and soon got a promising position by playing the following moves:  12...Bxc6  13.b4  White tries to solidify his structure, but Black is able to firmly block the pawns.  13...bxc5  14.bxc5  Ne4  This is a strong move. White doesn't want to take, as that would improve Black's bishop and give us pressure on the d4-pawn.  15.Ne2  Qa5+  16.Bd2  Qa6  I like how this move prevents White from castling: after 17.0-0 we have Ba4! 18. Qe1 and only now Bb5, winning material.  17.f3  Nxd2  18.Qxd2  Rab8  19.O-O  White has finally castled, but now we had enough time to make progress on the queenside.  19...Rb3  20.a4  Rfb8  ∓  Panchenko has handled this position excellently and managed to win.  bxc5  13.dxc5  a6  14.Bxc6  Bxc6 =  Again we have the strong pair of central pawns that we can try to push slowly but surely.   8.O-O  dxc4  9.Bxc4  Nc6  White will try to set up an attack and use the pawn on d4 to support his pieces, while we will try to prove it is a weakness in the long run.  10.a3   10.Bg5  Be7  The bishop wasn't doing much on b4 anymore, so unpinning the knight seems useful.  11.a3   11.Qd2  a6  12.a4  %cal Ga4b5,Rb7b5  12...h6  13.Bf4  Re8  Making room for Bf8, and then preparing ...e5 if we want to.  14.Rfd1  Nb4 =  We make use of the fact that White has played a4, weakening the b4-square. Our bishop can now get transfered to the long diagonal by Bd7-c6.   11.Rc1  The rook is now on the c-file and Black should be a bit careful with pushing for ...b5 if White plays Bd3 as White might then gain a tempo against an undefended knight on c6. This isn't an issue against 12.a3 though as then the light-squared bishop still blocks the scope of the rook.  11...a6  12.Bd3  Black can play ...b5, but we can avoid the possibility of White gaining a tempo on the knight at some point.   12.a3  This makes room for the bishop but doesn't really prevent our idea.  12...b5  13.Ba2  Bb7 =  12...Nb4  13.Bb1  Bd7  Black has ideas in ...Bc6 and ...Nbd5. This was played in Simek - Pala @@StartBracket@@2010@@EndBracket@@ where Black prevailed at the end.  a6  White has just gone a3, so it is very unlikely that he will play a4 now to prevent b5. So, going a6 seems smart here.  12.Qd3   12.Ba2  This does not change much.  12...b5  13.Rc1  Bb7  =+  b5  13.Ba2  b4  Objectively the best move, although 13... Ne5 is worth mentioning as an option.  14.Bb1  A clever intermediate move by White.  14...g6  The only way to defend against the threat of Bxf6.  15.axb4  Nxb4  16.Qf3  Rb8  with equality. In one game followed:  17.h4  White is trying something on the kingside: what else can he do? It doesn't lead to much though.  17...Nbd5  Overprotecting the knight on f6, solidifying our position. We also casually attack b2 now.  18.Bc1 ?!  Still following the game, but it looks a bit passive. Black was fine anyway.  18...Bb7  =+   10.Be3  a6  11.a3  Bd6  12.Ng3  b5 =  Bd6  11.Qd3   11.h3  h6  12.Be3  Ne7  A good move: a common idea for the side with an isolated pawn is to try to advance it. With Ne7 we prevent this d4-d5 advance and instead keep the position closed.  13.Rc1  b6  and Black is already slightly for choice as his pieces are harmoniously placed for the upcoming struggle and White has not utilized the advantages of the isolated d-pawn yet.  a6 !?  12.Rd1   12.Ba2  h6 =  Preventing the pin on g5 which could be a little annoying, with an equal position.  b5  13.Ba2  b4  N  14.Ne4  Nxe4  15.Qxe4  Bb7 =  White isn't nearly as active as he would hope, and we have a fine position. We can take on a3 soon, and play Rb8 @@StartBracket@@protecting our bishop on b7@@EndBracket@@ and perhaps play our typical Ne7 move to prevent d5.   8.Bg5  dxc4  9.Bxc4  Nc6  10.O-O  Transposes to 8.0-0 & 10.Bg5.  Qxd5  Although 8... Nxd5 makes perfect sense and is by far the usual reply, recapturing with the queen makes the position a bit more unbalanced as in most cases White remains with the isolated pawn while in variations with the former mentioned White can often take on d5, forcing a recapture by the e-pawn.  9.O-O  9...Qh5  %cal Gh5d1,Gh5a5  (The queen may be a bit vulnerable here, but in practice the queen exerts pressure on White's position by preventing the knight on e2 from moving freely. After a few moves the queen will be transfered to the other side of the board with Qa5.)  10.Ne4  This has been the most popular move.   10.Bf4  Nc6  If White just develops, we will do the same.  11.Qb3   11.a3  There is a good option is playing the bishop to a5 here in order to put pressure on the d4-pawn. But in this specific case, Black can also take on c3.  11...Ba5  And we will put the bishop on b6, exerting pressure on the d4-pawn.  12.Qd2  Now White can move the knight, so we have to be a little careful about our queen now.  12...Rd8   12...Nxd4  If you want to simplify the position, this would be an accurate way to do so.  13.Nxd4  e5  14.Be2  Bg4  15.Bxg4  Nxg4  16.h3  Nf6  17.Bxe5  Qxe5 =  13.h3  h6  This may look strange, but Black prevents that his queen is getting trapped by Ng3 and Bg5. This is something to keep in mind with the bishop on a5 as the queen can't easily swing over to the queenside.  14.Rad1  Bb6 =  The pressure on d4 is real and we can consider to play e5 at some point. Our bishop on c8 currently looks a bit like the typical French Bad Bishop, but by playing e5 it will get some air.  Ba5  Just like against 11.a3, we can place the bishop on a5, although ...Be7 was a good alternative as well.  12.Rad1  Bb6 =  We will play our rooks to c8 and d8 and the bishop to d7, when the position is equal.  10...Nbd7  Black has mostly taken on e4, but I don't see why we would help White with activating his pieces. Usually, it is better to let the opponent take!  11.Qc2   11.Qb3  Qa5  Now that Black can't take on d1 anymore if the e2-knight moves, Black protects the bishop and gets the queen out of the precarious zone right away.  12.a3  Be7  13.Qc2  This was played in Georgiev - Giorgadze, 1999.   13.Bd2  was tested in a correspondence game between Brinkmann - Klein, 2005, but again Black has a decent square for the queen.  13...Qb6  14.Nxf6+  Nxf6  15.Qxb6  axb6  Some of you may not be happy to have this doubled pawn on the b-file, but in exchange we have a lot of @@StartBracket@@semi-@@EndBracket@@open files for our rooks. White also has no easy way to attack the pawns.  16.Rac1  Rd8  17.Be3  Bd7  18.Nc3  Bc6  The position is balanced.  13...Nxe4  Now taking makes more sense, as we can immediately win time by attacking the bishop.  14.Bxe4  Nf6  The game was agreed drawn but Black certainly can continue by putting the queen on b6, and from then on the bishop can move to d7 and the rooks become connected.  15.Bf3  15...Qb6 =  Protecting the pawn on b7, with equality. White can't easily move the knight on e2 as d4 is hanging, and in case of 16.Be3, Black has ...Nd5. Further moves are ...Bd7 and an impending rook to c8.   11.a3  Be7  After this move, White has exclusively played the bishop to f4.  12.Bf4  Nd5  13.Bd6  was played in Krensing - Petkov, 2005. Black has an interesting resource in marching up the f-pawn, sometimes all the way to f3.  13...f5  N  14.N4g3  Qh4  15.Bxe7  Nxe7  16.Re1  f4  There's no stopping this pawn!  17.Nf1  f3  18.gxf3  Nb6 =  Preparing Bd7, with the idea of Nc6, attacking the weakened kingside. We're not better yet, but I think Black has fun play here!  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  Nf6  Again we win a tempo on this bishop.  13.Bf3  Qa5  N  The preferred square for the queen.  14.Bf4   14.Nc3  Rd8  15.Be3  Rb8 =  Black develops naturally and prepares to play ...Bd7, ...Bd6 @@StartBracket@@against a2-a3@@EndBracket@@ or ...b6/b5.

6... b6
{ Using the queenside fianchetto to influence the center is a fine option. As usual, 6... d5 is much more common but we'll only play d5 to isolate White's d-pawn if we have taken on d4 first. }
7. O-O
{ 7.Bd2  Usually this move is played on move eight, and Black can aim to transpose to this variation.  7...cxd4  8.exd4  Bb7  9.O-O  d5  Transposition to 8. Bd2.   7.d5  White may grab some space in the center, but Black aims to play ...d6 and later possibly ...e5, in order to build up play on the kingside.  7...d6  8.O-O  Bxc3  A good moment to take on c3 as White has just unpinned the knight and will otherwise move it away in an attempt to trap the bishop. We have seen this theme before in this course, for example in some lines of 4.Qc2 and 5.Nf3. And we'll also see it again soon in the 8.Na4 lines of this chapter.  9.bxc3  Re8  Making room for the knight to come to f8, continuing to build up play on the kingside.  10.Re1  or 10.e4, Black's response is the same.  10...Nbd7  11.e4  Nf8  12.a4  Ng6  was played in Shimanov - Khismatullin, 2015, as you can find in the model games section. In that game, Black build up his play on the kingside, and Lc0 suggests as well that Black does so, for example by ...e5 and ...Nf4, and then even ...Kh8 and ...Rg8 with the idea of . ..g5 could be on Black's agenda.   7.a3  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  Bb7  9.O-O  Ne4  Transposes to 8.a3. }

{ This is a good option which has proven itself at the highest levels. I first wanted to suggest to immediately take on c3, but 7... Bxc3 8. bxc3 Bb7 9. Re1 is a surprisingly good variation.

8. Na4
{ This is the most popular move, with a similar idea as in other lines of the Nimzo-Indian with c5-setups: to trap the bishop on b4 with a2-a3.   8.Bd2  is the second most popular move in this position. White aims to develop quietly.  8...cxd4  By exchanging on d4 and playing ...d5, Black aims to isolate White's d-pawn. This works well with the bishop on d2 as it seems a bit clumsy on that square in that case.  9.exd4   9.Nxd4  This is the much less frequent attempt by White to avoid the isolated pawn. I believe Tarrasch used to have a quote for such behaviour.  9...Nc6  10.Nxc6   10.a3  Be7  Taking on c3 makes little sense now @@StartBracket@@as we get nothing in return for giving up the bishop@@EndBracket@@, so we retreat.  11.Nf3  If White does not retreat, we can take on d4 and go ...d5 and create the isolani after all.   11.Nxc6  dxc6 =  This is similar to 10.Nxc6. The position is just equal.  11...Rc8 =  The main idea here is to transfer a knight to e5: as we have slightly less space, exchanging pieces would be favorable for us. The position is just equal.  dxc6  I think this is the easiest option. The pawn structure now gets quite symmetrical, giving us easy equality.  11.Qc2  h6  12.Rad1  Qc7 =  We can play ...Be7 and then ...c5 to make our bishop on b7 happy. ...Ng4 is also an idea to create some weaknesses and start an attack.  d5  10.cxd5   10.a3 !?  This is not that popular but it was played once by Nakamura against Carlsen @@StartBracket@@2016, although a bullet game@@EndBracket@@. It is not problematic, as we will get the same pawn structure in the end.  10...Bxc3  11.Bxc3  dxc4  12.Bxc4  Nd5  =+  Blockading the d-pawn and Black is about to develop quickly with ...Nc6 and ...Rc8, with a pleasant position. 12... Nc6 directly is also fine.  Nxd5  With the important position we already discussed in the section of strategic ideas. White has tried several moves from which 11. Qe2 is the most popular. Other frequent moves in practice are Re1, Nxd5, Rc1, a3 and Qc2 which will all be covered as well.  11.Qe2  As mentioned, this is the most popular move, but Black does not fear this set-up.   11.Re1  A standard move, improving the pieces and later on the rook may be used in kingside operations.  11...Nd7  This is the most natural square for the knight. You might be tempted to put the knight on c6 @@StartBracket@@isn't it more active there?@@EndBracket@@, but the knight is the most flexible on d7 as it can go to f6 to support the knight on d5, or perhaps to f8 and g6. It also does not block the bishop here.  12.Rc1  Bd6 =  The bishop is well-placed here. Black aims to exchange pieces soon and further simplify the position when the pawn on d4 becomes weak.   11.Nxd5  Bxd2  Obviously forced.  12.Ne3  Not the only way to react, but probably the best one. Nc3 runs into Bxc3 with a very similar position.   12.Nxb6  This intermediate capture happened in Korelov - Keres @@StartBracket@@1965@@EndBracket@@.  12...axb6  13.Qxd2   13.Nxd2  Qxd4 =  Material is equal and so is the position.  Bxf3  14.gxf3  Ra5  =+  Due to a discovered check we can't take on d4, but we can bring our rook into the action in an original way! White's structure is ruined and Black is much better.   12.Qxd2  Bxd5  13.Ne5  Bb7 =  is objectively equal, but the pawn on d4 will be a source of worry.  12...Bb4 =  Taking on e3 is very similar, but has a more drawish character. We now keep the bishop pair and can still pressure the pawn on d4. Black can be satisfied with the outcome of the opening.   11.Rc1  Nd7  12.Qe2  Transposes to 11.Qe2.   12.Re1  Transposes to 11.Re1.   11.a3  Be7  With the bishop on d2, we are not interested in taking on c3.  12.Re1  Nd7  13.Qe2  Nxc3  A good idea: we would love to trade some minor pieces and try to pressurize the isolated pawn.  14.bxc3  Rc8  Black has a good game. The pawn isn't isolated anymore, but the hanging pawn structure that has arisen now is also a bit weak. We can play moves like Qc7 and Bd6 next and try to slowly improve our position.   11.Qc2  11...Nf6  Simply protecting h7.  12.Bg5  h6  13.Bxf6  Qxf6  14.Bh7+  White is trying to be clever by chasing our king to h8, but he's not achieving much really.  14...Kh8  15.Be4  Nc6 =  A good move: taking on e4 would only help White, as he would take back with the knight and win some time. Instead we finish our development and can attack the d4-pawn in the future. We can consider taking on c3 at some point to alter the pawn structure, as in the previous line.   11.Ne5  White is trying to launch an attack right away, but Black can defend effortlessly.  11...Nd7  N  Trying to get rid of the knight already.  12.Qh5  f5 =  A good way to defend h7, and Black will act in the center shortly.  11...Nd7  Again, I prefer to place the knight on d7 instead of d6, as it's more flexible on this square.  12.Rac1   12.Nxd5  Bxd2  13.Qe4  This was White's idea, but we are able to defend everything.  13...g6  14.Ne7+  Qxe7  15.Qxb7  Bf4  White has tried hard to make spectacular-looking moves, but in fact all he did was trade a few pieces while still keeping his isolani.  16.Be4  In Isigkeit - Marek, e-mail @@StartBracket@@2012@@EndBracket@@, White wanted to trade the queen for two rooks, but this soon backfired.   16.g3  Bd6  17.Kg2  Rfb8  18.Qe4  Nf6  19.Qe2  Rc8 =  The position is equal, but White has a pawn that needs to be defended long-term, and that could give practical chances.  16...Qd6  17.Qxa8  Rxa8  18.Bxa8  g5  19.g3  g4  20.Ne1  Bg5  and Black was better.   12.Qe4  Playing this right away seems more logical, but it's not dangerous.  12...N7f6  Here we see one of the advantages of playing the knight to d7: we can attack the queen and protect h7 at the same time!  13.Qh4  Ne7  Here we try to reroute the knight to g6, to chase the queen away and protect the king. We also attack the knight on f3 in the mean time.  14.Bg5   14.Ne4  Trying to spice things up. There is only one good move now, so remember it well please!  14...Bxe4 !

In general, the bishop is well-placed on d6.  13.Ba6   13.Be4  N7f6  14.Bb1  Nf4  Here it becomes clear what the bishop's job is on d6: it made this jump possible.  15.Bxf4  Bxf4  16.Rcd1  Rc8  Black was comfortable in Shalamberidze - Yemelin @@StartBracket@@2014@@EndBracket@@, and later went on to win.   13.Ne5  N  Rc8 =  Soon more exchanges are about to happen, with an equal position but the weakness on d4 grows stronger as the position simplifies.

Closing the center. If White allows us, we will play e5 and shut it down completely. After that, we have all the time in the world to attack on the kingside.  15.e5  A good move, trying to get some space for the bishop and attacking h7.  15...h6  White's central pawn structure starts to look unstable.   8.Qe2  is the fourth popular move and was played by Laznicka against Yu Yangyi @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@. There's an easy solution by taking on c3 and playing the light-squared bishop to e4 to simply matters, but we're after more interesting developments.  8...Re8 !?  This move was chosen by Almasi and Fedorchuk. The rook is placed on the same file as the white queen and this will come in handy after Black plays ...d5. Black does not release the tension yet and intends to make purposeful moves while the pawn structure keeps the bishop on c1 locked in.  9.Rd1   9.Bd2  this was seen in two games.  9...cxd4  10.exd4   10.Nxd4  Nc6  N  Nc6  11.Rfe1  d5  12.cxd5  exd5 =  Here we can't take with the knight, as White would have the classic bishop sacrifice on h7 with a deadly attack! Always pay attention! Taking with the pawn and opening the e-file is fine though and gives us an equal position.   9.e4  White sets up a powerful center and threatens e5, so we immediately have to take action.  9...cxd4  10.Nxd4  d5  11.cxd5  N   11.e5 ?!  dxc4  ∓  This strong intermediate move secures the advantage for Black.  exd5  12.e5  Bc5  The rook on e8 is proving very useful.  13.Nf5   13.Nf3  h6 =  White was threatening to play Qc2, when the h7-pawn would be lost.

exd4
{ 9.a3  This is an interesting try if White doesn't want to allow Black to play Re8 and Bf8, as in the main line.  9...Bd6 !?  Most people have retreated to e7, but this interesting try has been played by strong grandmasters such as Aronian, Eljanov and Adams, so it definitely deserves attention. One idea is to play for ...Nc6 and ...e5, the other idea is that the bishop can sometimes retreat to b8 followed by Qc7, with pressure on the h2/b8 diagonal. But more importantly, the e7-square is kept clear for the knight on b8 so we can transfer it to g6 via e7.  10.exd4  Nc6  Most played have taken on f3, followed by ...Nc6 and ...e5, which is also a good continuation. The text move of 10...Nc6 has the idea of playing ...Rc8 quickly, and reroute the knight from c6 to e7-g6 or to a5. In practice, White has either played Nc3 or Re1 on the eleventh move.  11.Re1   11.Nc3  A reasonable move, as the knight has no longer any purpose on a4.  11...Rc8  Or 11... h6 is also possible.  12.b4  Preventing Na5, so it's time to go the other way! This was played in Figlio - Popov @@StartBracket@@2012@@EndBracket@@.   12.Bg5  This is the move Harikrishna played against Aronian.  12...h6  13.Bh4  Be7  In this case we do bring the bishop back to e7, and instead go for the Na5 plan.  14.Re1   14.b4  N  Ne8  15.Bg3  Bf6 =  With pressure on d4. Black looks comfortable, as he can play for example ...g6 and ...Bg7 when both bishops are very well-placed.   14.Bc2  N  With the idea of Qd3.  14...Nh5  15.Qd3  g6  =+  Black's position seems more comfortable to me as White faces threats on the pawn structure soon. For example, if White takes on e7, Black recaptures with the knight and ...Ba6 is on the cards. If White then defends with b2-b3, then ...d5 is again a strong option for Black.  Na5 N  with a good game. It will be hard for White to defend the pawn on c4, and if he tries to do so with Nd2, we can play d5 and favorably open up the position.  12...Ne7  N  Now there are 3 moves that we want to play next: h6, Ng6 and Bb8.  13.Bg5  Bb8 !?  Our piece configuration looks very harmonious.  Rc8  12.b4   12.Bg5  h6  13.Bh4  Be7  Black can break the pin again and prepare for exchanging bishops with ...Nh5.  14.b4  Or 14.Rc1 and Black has the same idea of exchanging bishops.  14...Nh5  15.Bxe7  Nxe7  16.Rc1  b5 !

Qb6 is also next, and we can always chase away the white knight with ...d6.  Ne7  13.Bb2  was played in Liang - Baron, 2016. The position is probably balanced, but I will show you some lines to illustrate how easy it is for White to go wrong here.  13...Ng6  14.Ne5   14.Nc3  I will just show this line to illustrate how fast Black can develop an attack @@StartBracket@@and for fun!@@EndBracket@@.  14...Ng4 !?  15.h3 ?!

In practice, this move has led to more exchanges into an endgame in which there are a few unbalanced factors, giving both sides chances to play for a win.  12.Qxf3  Nc6  It is quite uncomfortable for White to protect the d4-pawn here. In practice, everyone opted for Bxf6.  13.Bxf6   13.Qe3  N  Be7  Black is fine and we can play our usual ideas here.  Qxf6  14.Qxf6  gxf6  15.d5  Nd4 !?  This is an interesting idea. Black can support the knight with ...e5, and ... f5 to have a good position in the center.  16.Rfd1  f5  17.a3  Bf8 =  With an interesting endgame ahead.   10.Bf4  Bf8  White was about to play a2-a3, so moving the bishop back right away makes sense.  11.Re1  Nc6  This was played by Karjakin against Debashis in 2016. The ideas are the same as before: we will put pressure on the c4-pawn, or try to isolate the d-pawn. The knight can go to a5 again, or perhaps to e7 as that square is free here as well.  12.Rc1  Rc8  N  13.Nc3   13.a3  If White prevents the knight coming to b4, we can reroute it through another square.  13...Ne7  And on the next move Black will probably play ...Ng6 and ...d6.  14.b4  14...Ng6 =  %cal Gd7d6,Gb7a6,Ga6c4,Gc8c4,Ge6e5  (In this case, we can even prepare d6 and e5 if we want.)  Nb4  14.Bf1  White had to keep an eye on the c4-pawn - the advantage of Rc8.  14...d5  15.a3  Nc6  16.cxd5  Nxd5  17.Nxd5  Qxd5 =  White has an isolated pawn again, but not much attacking potential yet so I would prefer Black here.   10.c5  This isn't played often but White threatens to win the bishop with a2-a3, so it's definitely useful to look at this!  10...bxc5  The alternative was to play ...Bxf3 immediately.  11.a3   11.Nxc5  Bd5  12.a3  Bxc5  N  This seems stronger than going to a5, when White could play b4 and the knight on c5 would be quite strong.  13.dxc5  d6  We immediately get tid of this advanced pawn. Otherwise, a pawn storm on the queenside could be dangerous for us.  14.cxd6  Qxd6  15.b4  Nc6 =  Although White has the bishop pair, we are quite active and have no weaknesses so this should be fine for Black.   11.dxc5  d6  and a draw was agreed already in Demuth - Cori @@StartBracket@@2016@@EndBracket@@, but Black is equal to slightly for choice.  c4 !  A good intermediate move, making room for the bishop to retreat.  12.Bxh7+  This was exclusively played in practice and is not unlogical: White wants to snatch a pawn with check, and hopes to get the pawn on c4 later.   12.Bxc4  Bf8 =  We can play ...d6 and later ...g6, with no problems for Black.  12...Nxh7  13.axb4  Bxf3  Getting rid of the defender of the d4-pawn.

10... Bf8 11. b4
{ This move has been the most popular. White gains space and prepares to develop the bishop to b2. Other set-ups are possible too though, and they may transpose to the main line anyway.   11.Nc3  White returns the knight.

As I would rather not accept a draw by force, I instead recommend to put the pawn on d6 and transpose to other lines where White only later returned the knight.  12.Re1   12.Bg5  Nbd7  13.Re1  Transposes to 11. Re1.  Nbd7  Transposes to 11.Re1.   11.Re1  This is the second most popular move and looks natural.

White has c5 and can support that pawn by playing b4, when we are not so happy anymore. So we see the knight on a4 actually still has some function - it supports White playing c5, but now by playing d6 we have prevented this.   11...Bxf3 !?  This is an easy alternative as the position becomes simplified quite quickly.  12.Qxf3  Nc6  13.Be3  e5  This was our idea.

This may look like it loses a pawn, but we get the pawn on b4 in return.  17.dxe5  dxe5  18.Nxe5  Nxb4  19.Bf1   19.Bf5  Ra8 =  Bc5 =  Both sides are active and can be satisfied about their position, meaning that the position is balanced.   14.Bg3  Anticipating ...e5, but this move doesn't take into account our other ideas of ...Na5 and ...d5.  14...Na5  15.Nd2  d5  =+  14...h6  White has to bear in mind that after ...Bh4, Black can consider playing ...g5, ...g4 and the pawn on d4 is hanging after the knight moves.  15.Bh4  g5  16.Bg3  g4  17.Nd2  Nxd4  White definitely has compensation because of our weakened kingside, but a pawn is a pawn.   11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  Bxf3  13.Qxf3  Nc6  These are the same moves we played without a3 Bf8 included.  14.Qe3   14.Bxf6  Qxf6  15.Qxf6  gxf6  16.d5  Nd4  With a very similar endgame as before. Actually, it's the exact same position if we play Rfd1 f5 here!  g5  In the line without a3 Bf8 included, we opted for Be7 here. That has actually been played here too, but I want to suggest a more fun suggestion that works now that there's a bishop on f8: g5 and Bg7!  15.Bg3  Bg7  I quite like this: Black has some potential to start an attack and we also keep an eye on the e4-pawn from here.  16.Nc3  Ng4  17.Qe2  f5 =  The d4-pawn is hard to protect.   11.Bf4  This is again similar to the lines without a3 and Bf8. However, we opted for the prophylactic move 10...Bf8 there anyway, so it kind of just transposes.  11...d6  12.Re1  Nc6  Transposes to 11.Re1 & 12.Bf4. }
11... d6
{ In practice, the move 11...a5 has been seen. The positions tend to become complex as White will play b5, and if Black tries to break out with ...e5, White typically responds with d5 having long-term pressure on the b6-pawn. Black has his own ideas though with ...g6, ...Nh5 and later on he prepares to play ...f5, with an unclear battle. You can explore this deeper on your own if you like! I'd like to reiterate that here we also can not go d5, because White has played b4 to support c5 as a response. Remember that as reminder for these setups: only go d5 in this variation, if White is unable to go c5 and you are sure you can create an isolated pawn in White's camp! }
12. Re1 { 12.Bb2  Nbd7  13.Re1  Transposes to 13.Bb2. } 12... Nbd7 13. Bb2
{ 13.Nc3  White has lost a bit of time to create this kind of structure, and Black is ready to open the game with ...e5 and ... a5.  13...e5  14.d5  b5 !?  15.Nd2  bxc4 =   13.Bg5  h6  Forcing a decision from White: where should the bishop go?  14.Bh4  Now that e5 does not come with tempo, playing ...b5 makes no sense here compared to 14.Bf4. Black can achieve a good game though by playing either 14.. . a5 or 14... e5.   14.Bf4 ?!  Not here! This runs in a surprising tactical sequence.  14...b5 !  If the bishop is on f4, this move has an instructive tactical point - Black needs the d5-square so he can play ... Qd5 after all the exchanges on e5. White has a lost game by force after cxb5.  15.Nb2  A sad necessity, as other moves lose by force. White can't even play Nc3, as that runs into bxc4 when he is unable to take back on c4, because of Rc8 when everything will be hanging in White's camp.   15.cxb5  A natural move: White has not spotted our idea yet...  15...e5 !  16.dxe5  dxe5  17.Nxe5  White has to take, because otherwise e4 is killing.  17...Nxe5  18.Bxe5  Qd5  -+  And we win a piece as White is unable to defend both e5 and g2. A great illustration of how this set-up can suddenly be really venomous for the opponent!   15.Nc3  bxc4  16.Bxc4  Rc8  -+  15...Rc8  White still can't easily take on b5, as it will just run into the same trick as before.  16.Rc1  bxc4  17.Nxc4  Nb6  =+  Black is slightly better because of the better pawn structure and the pieces are very harmoniously placed. One creative idea that I like here is to play Re7-c7. Also, White is probably not in a good place psychologically after we have played that great b5 move!  14...a5  15.Nc3  If 15.Rb1, Black can take on b4 and play ...e5.  15...axb4  16.axb4  Rxa1  17.Qxa1  Qa8  with pressure on g2 and f3.  18.Be2  g5  19.Bg3  Nh5 =   13.Bf4  This position is similar to 13. Bg5 h6 Bf4, but the pawn on h6 fulfills an important function. The tactical shot of 13...b5 is less strong here, as after 14.Nb2 Tc8 15.c5 e5 16.dxe5 dxe5 17.Bg5 is quite annoying to meet as after 17...e4, White has the shot of 18. Bxb5! and White is in a winning position. So, we should play differently.  13...a5  A familiar move from many other variations. In the game Torres Rosas - Shimanov there followed 14. b5.  14.b5  Rc8  15.h3  d5 =  Black is about to take on c4, with a comfortable position. }
13... g6
{ White has just placed his bishop on the a1/ h8-diagonal, so we try to oppose it by moving our bishop there as well. }
14. Nc3
{ 14.Rc1  a5  N  White has left the a-file so this is a good time to start operations over there. It also provokes White to play b5, when we can try to undermine the pawns with d5.  15.b5   15.Nc3  e5  16.d5  b5  ⇆  The idea we have seen before. White can not take because the knight on c3 has to guard the e4-square, and Black is fine.  Rc8  16.g3   16.h3  was played in Bruzon Batista - Carlsen, 2012.  16...d5  White can push c5 but that will cost him a pawn here, so it is possible to play ...d5.  17.Nd2  17...dxc4  18.Nxc4  Nd5  19.Be4  N7f6  N  In the game, Carlsen played 19.. .Rc7 and that's a very interesting piece configuration. However, it may be even stronger to first play some other moves to get the ideal cooperation between our pieces.  20.Bf3  Bh6  21.Rc2  Re7 =  With a very playable position for both sides, although I think it's slightly easier for Black as White will always have that potentially weak d-pawn.   16.Rc2  was played in Kenneskog - Blomqvist, 2016.  16...d5  17.Ne5  dxc4  18.Bxc4  Rc7  Blomqvist opts for the same move as Carlsen did a few years before him @@StartBracket@@in a slightly different position@@EndBracket@@.  19.Qe2  Nxe5  N  20.dxe5  Nd7 =  Our mighty bishop on b7 is unopposed, and we can try to get some initiative by bringing our queen over to the kingside.  d5  I'll say it one last time so you won't ever forget it - consider d5 when there is no c5!  17.Nd2  dxc4  18.Nxc4  Rc7 =  Black starts regrouping his pieces with ...

It might look like we can take on c5 right away: 14. .. bxc5 15. dxc5 dxc5 16. Lb5! and White gets some activity, which I would rather avoid.  15.cxd6  Bxd6  16.Nc3  Nd5  Is objectively equal although Black seems slightly for choice as can play against the isolated pawn on d4. }
14... e5

4... O-O
{ Black does not show his hand in the center yet and chooses a flexible move. }
5. Bd3
{ This is the most popular move. White does not commit the knight yet and plays the bishop out so Ne2 would not hamper its development.   5.Nge2  After this move, White is ready to play a2-a3 and recapture with the knight on c3.  5...c6  This looks a bit out of the ordinary compared to the more regular choices, but Black wants to drop the bishop back to c7 after a2-a3 and b2-b4, where it stands very well. The variations in these lines tend to become very exciting, and it is currently Black's best scoring line against the early knight move.  6.a3  Ba5  7.b4  Bc7  8.e4  d5  9.e5  Nfd7  when the position is very complex.

The knight is now on e2 and although it controls the c3-square, it is further away from squares that are critical for preparing kingside play. Play is more quiet and we'll take a look at the more unbalancing 8. cxd5 Qxd5!?, as well as White's alternatives. }
6... b6 7. O-O Bb7
{ This set-up was often played by Paul Keres, and indeed is called the Keres variation in literature. After this move, White has two major moves: 8. Bd2 and 8. Na4. }
8. Na4
{ is the most popular move. White prevents an exchange on c3 and moves away to harass the bishop on b4 with impending moves like a2-a3. The knight also has another function of helping White's play in preparing c4-c5 in some cases.   8.Bd2  White develops quietly with this move, but Black can change the pawn structure now.  8...cxd4  9.exd4  d5  10.cxd5  White is likely to take here, as otherwise we take on c4 ourselves and get the same structure anyway while the bishop probably needs to move again at some point.  10...Nxd5  Black is playing against the Isolated Queen's Pawn @@StartBracket@@IQP@@EndBracket@@. From a strategic perspective, we can say that there's a static weakness on the board that nevertheless provides dynamic opportunities for White.   The typical strategy of taking away these dynamic possibilities is to develop the remaining pieces while taking into account the importance of @@StartBracket@@prophylactically@@EndBracket@@ protecting the king.  Additionally, Black's idea is that the more pieces leave the board, the easier it is to attack the pawn on d4. Black would then like to exchange minor pieces @@StartBracket@@which are good defenders of the pawn@@EndBracket@@ and consider carefully what to do with the heavy pieces as they can pressure the IQP. Exchanging queens of course brings us closer to a potentially promising endgame where the isolani may prove difficult to defend.  Furthermore, Black tries to control the square in front of the pawn so that the blockading piece is strongly positioned and that d4-d5 is also ruled out as a dynamic opportunity. The knight is already there, so this is to our advantage. White will normally seek dynamic opportunities, for example by using the e5-square, the open c- and e-files and the space behind the pawn to prepare for play on the kingside. The upcoming theoretical lines will show how to deal with White's typical moves in practice. Of course, all these strategical notions should only be seen as a guide, and concrete variations will be of paramount importance. So make sure to study the variations well, as you will likely face this line a lot! }

{ This is the second most popular move. This makes sense as we have just played ...Ba5, so taking on c3 now would be a waste of tempo. Therefore, this knight move seems logical: White simply wants to bring his bishop on f1 into play while also keeping an eye on the e4-square from g3. Some White players prefer to remain flexible and wait with this move though, as the knight can also go to f4 at times.   7.Bd2  This is theoretically not that challenging. Black is always happy to get the bishop to c7 and play for ...d5.  7...d5  8.Ng3  And we have already transposed to 7. Ng3 d5 8. Bd2 as later in this variation.   White could have included  8.cxd5  but this will also transpose as Ng3 is coming anyway. }
7... d5 8. Bd3
{ Black waits till the bishop develops to take on c4, followed by a pawn move in the center, comparable to lines in the Semi-Slav.    8.Qc2  This has little independent value.  8...Nbd7  9.Be2  dxc4  With a transposition to 7. Qc2.  See here.   8.Be2  Black can just play similarly as in 8. Bd3 by taking on c4:  8...dxc4  9.Bxc4  and we transpose to this line with 8. Bd3. }
8... dxc4 9. Bxc4 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. exd4

11... Nc6 12. Be3 Bb6

The queen can be placed on squares like for example h4, g5 or d6 depending on circumstances.

{ White intends to play a2-a3 quickly to recapture with the knight. } 5... c6
{ Although the number of games played here is nowhere near the main move 5... d5 or the interesting 5... Re8, the move 5... c6 has become quite popular in recent years. The idea behind this move is that Black can retreat the bishop to c7 where it stands well. We are not scared of the center that White can build up - on the contrary, we are going to attack it or use it to open up the game. This variation has strong potential to get double-edged positions and even piece sacrifices. }
6. a3
{ The only logical move: White has specifically prepared this with 5. Nge2, so why play something else? }
6... Ba5
{ From this position, the most popular has been to attack the bishop on a5 with b4 to solve the pin, which is very natural. However, playing without b4 is also seen in practice, for example 7. Ng3, 7. Qc2, 7. c5 and other rare moves have been tried. }
7. b4
{ This is currently White's main option to resolve the pin right away and grab even more space. }
7... Bc7
{ This is where we wanted to place the bishop. From here, it cooperates with the pawns @@StartBracket@@that will soon be on c6, d5 and e6@@EndBracket@@ perfectly. }
8. e4

11... Qe7 12. Qc2
{ came into discussion in Kuzubov - Volokitin, 2019. Now that everything is defended, we won't sacrifice but go a quieter route. }
12... Bb6
{ Putting some pressure on d4 now that the queen is no longer defending it. }
13. Na4
{ Of course you can go back to c7 now and go for a repetition... but that's not what we came for, right!? }
13... f6 14. Nxb6 axb6
{ Now we can hope to use the open a-file and block the white pawns with ...b5. }
15. Bb2 b5 16. Ng3 fxe5 17. fxe5 Nb6 18. Bd3
{ In the game Black played Qh4 which is a good move, although White could defend the position with a new move 19. Rf1. Therefore I'll suggest 18... g6 with a good position for Black. If you want to play more dynamically, it is interesting to play 18... Nc4 and sacrifice the h7-pawn but in return Black gets to speed up his play quite a bit, making White's position hard to defend. }
18... g6 19. Rf1 N8d7
{ White's king is still weak and the far advanced pawns have once again left a lot of weak squares behind. We can go Nc4 soon. }

I'd like to reiterate that here we also can not go d5, because White has played b4 to support c5 as a response. Remember that as reminder for these set-ups: only go d5 in this variation, if White is unable to go c5 and you are sure you can create an isolated pawn in White's camp! }

{ So far, so good. To give you some context: this game was played in the Dutch League in 2019. You don't know who your opponent is until the round starts, but you do know the colour so I did some general preparation and had looked at this line a bit, but not in great detail. I was very impressed by the ...c5! move that we have encountered in this chapter, and was very excited that I could get the chance to play it! However, in my excitement, I forgot how the line went and where I should play c5... }
10... c5
{ Too early! I was actually not the only one who made this mistake: in 2016, a 2400+ player also played this move and even managed to win. Surprisingly, it's not even that bad.   10...a5  This is the correct move order, opening the a-file. You will see why this is important later.  11.Rb1  axb4  12.axb4  c5 !  Only now this works! You will see the difference later.  13.bxc5  Ba5  14.Bd2  Nc6  15.Nb5  dxc4 }
11. bxc5 Ba5 12. Bd2 dxc4
{ Now it is bad. I was really confused, thinking that I had some tricks on d4, but I couldn't remember how exactly and it quickly went downhill.   12...Nc6 !  Just like in the main line, this was the correct move.  13.Nb5   13.cxd5  Nxd4  ∓  a6  This should be tried now.   13...dxc4  If Black tries to play like in the 10... a5 line, things will soon go wrong:  14.Bxc4  Nxd4  15.Nxd4  Nxe5  16.Nb3  Nxc4  17.Bxa5  Nxa5  This was what we would play in the main line, but now this loses a piece, as the rook is not protecting the knight!  18.Qxd8  Rxd8  19.Nxa5  +-  14.cxd5  exd5 !   14...axb5  15.dxc6  bxc6  I looked at this and felt this was pretty bad for Black. However, there were much better moves available.  15.Nd6  Nxd4  Here, the complications work out for Black. It seems like 10... c5 is not even that bad after all!  16.Bb4  Nc6 !

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3
{ This is the most popular move after 4. Qc2 and 4.e3 and should therefore be studied carefully. Often the game will transpose to a main line we have studied before, but White can also go for sidelines that have established themselves over the years, for example after 4. ..b6, the 5.Qb3-variation. }
4... b6
{ This is my preferred recommendation here. Black can transpose to main lines if the opportunity arises. One advantage of waiting with castling is that in lines with Bg5, we might even go h6-g5 and castle long. You will see this in the main line of this chapter. }
5. Bg5
{ In practice, this move has been the main move. Note that this position can also arise after 4. Bg5 b6 5. Nf3. Either ...Bb7 or ... h6 are good choices here, although they coincide quite often.   5.Bd2  O-O  With a direct transposition to 4.Bd2.   5.e3  This is similar to the 4.e3-variation, and Black aims for a transposition.  5...Bb7  6.Bd3   6.Bd2  O-O  Again transposes to 4. Bd2.   6.Be2  With the bishop on e2, Black can't transpose to the repertoire against 4.e3 as the bishop is on d3 in the main line. However, the bishop is a little less actively placed and variations are not critical. Black can double White's pawns and play for ...c5 to open the c-file the c-file later and attack the c4-pawn.  6...Bxc3+  We capture directly before White prevents the worsening of the pawn structure. Compare this move to the note on 7...Bb7 in 4. e3 with Bd3 and Nf3: I considered to take in that situation, but I ultimately felt that White could control the e4-square well enough and refrained from recommending it. However, now that the bishop is on e2, we do have access to that square.  7.bxc3  O-O  8.O-O  c5  Here we have the same position as would occur if we would take on c3 on the 7th move in the aforementioned 4.e3 line, only with the bishop on e2.  9.Nd2  There is no 9.Re1 here, as we can just play 9... Ne4.  9...Nc6 =  We will follow up with moves such as ...Rc8, ...d6 and likely ...e5, with good control over te dark squares. We can also rely on our old "attack the pawn on c4" plan. Black is fine here.   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  Ne4  This is a transposition to 4.a3, which also leads to a transposition to 4. e3 with 5.Bd3, 6.Nf3 and 8.a3. There are gonna be a lot of transpositions in this chapter, so pay good attention!  O-O  White's main moves have been to castle short, play 7.Bd2 and 7.Qc2.  7.O-O   7.Qc2  This move has been seen instead of castling short, which is a much more popular option.  7...c5  Now we have transposed to regular 4.e3 territory, but to a line where White plays Qc2. As we have not examined this before, let's take a look!  8.a3   8.dxc5  Giving up the center doesn't look very threatening.  8...Bxc5  This is an interesting recapture, although taking with the pawn is definitely possible too. The point behind this move will be revealed shortly.  9.a3  This is the most played move. White thinks about playing b2-b4 and attack the bishop at the same time, and develop the dark-squared bishop. White also provokes Bxf3, so that the open g-file will offer dynamic chances.  9...Nc6  10.O-O  Or 10.b4: Black's reply is the same.  10...Bd6 !?  This is an interesting set-up, only possible because we played Bxc5 earlier. Black can bring the rook to c8, the bishop on d6 can be played back to b8 and we can move the knight from c6 to a better square. It's also a familar way of playing from 4.e3; 6.Nf3; 9.a3-lines, where Aronian used a similar set-up.   8.Bd2  Chess is a concrete game. We didn't take on f3 earlier, but for concrete reasons we now take on f3 because we are quick to attack d4.  8...Bxf3 !  Here we do take on f3, for concrete reasons.  9.gxf3  cxd4  10.exd4  Nc6  Suddenly the pawn on d4 is hard to defend.  11.Be3  d5  ∓  11...Rc8 was also an option. Now we threaten to take on c4 and the pawn on d4 is vulnerable. Black is doing very well.   8.O-O  Bxf3  Now that White has castled, taking on f3 is also a good idea.  9.gxf3  cxd4  10.exd4  Nc6  We are playing in the same way as before.  11.Be3  Bd6  N  d5 is not a good idea here, as the knight on c6 can come under attack if White takes on d5. Black is slightly to prefer, with numerous ideas indicated that are mentioned before and indicated by the arrows.  Bxc3+  9.bxc3   9.Qxc3  Black can now use the placement of the queen on c3 by opening the position with 9...d5 so that taking back on d5 with the knight comes with tempo. That being said, 9...cxd4 exd4 Nc6 and using the c-file is also an option.  9...d5  10.cxd5   10.dxc5  dxc4  11.Bxc4  Ne4  An important way to win a tempo, so we don't have to take back on c5 with the pawn.  12.Qc2  Nxc5  with good play for Black.  cxd4  On 11. Nxd4, ...Qxd5 makes sense.  11.Qxd4  Bxd5  =+  This is a strong way to recapture. We will play Nc6 next, when development is completed and Black has a comfortable game.  Bxf3  10.gxf3  Nc6  =+  Although we don't have our bishop to attack the pawn on c4, we can still go for the familiar idea of playing ...Na5, ... Rc8 and taking on d4 to open the c-file.   7.Bd2  c5  Transposes to 4.Bd2.  c5  Transposition to the main line of 4.e3 & 6.Nf3.   5.Qb3  This is seen frequently on the fifth and sixth move. It is also a direct transposition from 4. Qb3 c5 5.Nf3 after our next move.  5...c5  This is a good option as in some lines it can be convenient to take on d4. The main move has been to play 6.Bg5 which transposes to 5.Bg5, but in this case there's also the popular option of going 6.a3.  6.a3  is the second most popular option after 6.Bg5.   6.Bf4  This move pops up from time to time @@StartBracket@@for example. Mamedyarov played it a few years ago@@EndBracket@@, and is still the third popular move in this line.  6...Nc6  Putting more pressure on d4, and also threatening Na5.  7.a3   7.e3  Na5  8.Qa4  Bb7  The queen is still vulnerable on a4, and we can attack it with ...Bc6. We can also use the pin and play ...Nxe4.  Na5  A nice intermediate move.  8.Qc2  Bxc3+  9.Qxc3  cxd4  10.Nxd4  d5  We are playing very energetically, opening up lines for our pieces and benefiting from White's lack of coordination.  11.cxd5   11.Nb5  This move was played in Pawlowski - Werner @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@ and comes with a very obvious threat, but Black can defend very well against Nc7.  11...O-O  12.Nc7  Ne4 !  13.Qd3  Qf6  ∓  14.Be3  If 14. Bg3, White would be in big trouble after 14...Nxc4 when the threats on b2 outweigh the attack on our rook.  14...Bb7  15.Nxa8   15.Bd4  This happened in the game.  15...e5  16.Nxd5  Bxd5  17.cxd5  exd4  18.Qxe4  Rfe8  =+  The last moves were all forced. We are currently a pawn down, but can play ...Rac8 next when all our pieces are active. The knight can go to c4, attacking b2.  dxc4 ∓  Black's piece activity compensates more than enough for the exchange.  Nxd5  12.Qg3  Nxf4  13.Qxf4  Qe7  Black builds up his forces on the e-file.  14.Nf3  O-O  15.e3  Bb7  16.Bd3  Rae8 =  Now we again threaten e5. We use this rook as we want to play f5 later as well, forming a nice block of pawns in the center.   6.e3  is quite a modest move.  6...O-O  7.Be2  is the most popular, but does not protect the e4-square.   7.Bd3  Preventing Ne4.  7...Bb7  8.O-O  Nc6  In the only two games in this position, White played 9.a3 but this is actually not to be recommended.  9.a3  Na5  Playing this move before taking on c3 is a common motif in lines with Qb3.  10.Qc2  Bxc3  11.Qxc3  Bxf3  N  In the game Sokolov - Eljanov @@StartBracket@@2009@@EndBracket@@, Black first took on d4. We will take on d4 next, but are cutting out the option for White to take back on d4 with the knight.  12.gxf3  cxd4  13.exd4  Now we have transposed back into the Sokolov - Eljanov game.  13...Rc8  14.b3  Nh5  ∓  Black has a pleasant position, as there is pressure on both wings.  7...Ne4  Now we can double White's pawns or take the bishop on d2.  8.O-O   8.Bd2  Nxd2  9.Nxd2  Nc6 =  Black is fine and will develop the pieces in usual fashion with ...Bb7, ...Rc8, ...Na5 etc.  Bxc3  Since our knight is very active on e4, we should give up our bishop and not our knight.  9.bxc3  f5  Black is fine.   6.dxc5  Sometimes this move inserted before going Bf4 or Bg5.  6...Bxc5  As in other variations, this is my preferred recapture.  7.Bg5   7.Bf4  Bb7  We will play the exact same moves as after 7.Bg5: ...Bb7, ...0-0, ...Be7, ...Na6 and Nc5-e4.  Bb7  With a transposition to 5.Bg5, 6.Qb3 and 7.dxc5 as later in this chapter.  6...Ba5  Keeping the tension a bit longer makes it a bit more inconvenient to play for White. Frequent moves in this position has been the most popular 7.Bg5, followed by 7.e3, 7.Bd2 and 7.Bf4.  7.Bg5   7.e3  O-O  8.Be2  If 8.Bd3, then 8. ..Bb7 threatens to take on f3. However, with the bishop on e2, White lacks control over the e4-square which we can immediately take advantage of.   8.Bd2  Nc6  We can't go ... Na5 now, but putting pressure on d4 is still a good idea.  9.Be2  This may look a bit tame, but we would respond to 9. Bd3 in the same way anyway.  9...cxd4  10.exd4  Bxc3  Because the knight on c3 is not pinned in this case, we prefer to take it off the board before going d5.  11.Bxc3  d5 =  This should be familiar to you from the 4.e3 lines: creating the isolated pawn on d4, when White does not have the activity yet to compensate for it.  8...Ne4  If White doesn't unpin, we are going to take advantage of that!  9.O-O  Bxc3  The right way to take on c3, causing doubled pawns and remaining with a strong knight on e4.  10.bxc3  Nc6  =+  The knight on e4 can be supported by playing ...f5. There can also be the typical idea of playing Na5-Ba6 to attack the pawn on c4. Black is doing great here.   7.Bd2  O-O  8.e3  Nc6  Transposes to 7.e3.   7.Bf4  Nc6  There is no Na5 anymore now, but we can still pressure the d4-pawn.  8.e3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  If White takes back with the pawn, Black can just castle and play for ...d5, with a comfortable position.  9...Nxd4  10.exd4  d5 =  Black is slightly for choice as he can take on c3 whenever appropiate, and is about to isolate White's d4-pawn.  h6  8.Bh4  g5  Now we see an advantage of having delayed castling short! We immediately push our pawns.  9.Bg3  Ne4  There's also an interesting alternative in 9...g4. The line is pretty forced and continues like: 10.Nd2 cxd4 11.Nb5 Ne4 12.Nc7+ Kf8 13.0-0-0 Bxd2+ 14.Rxd2 15. Kxd2 d6 16.Nxa8 e5. The knight on a8 will be captured at some point and the position remains unclear.  10.e3  We were threatening to take on d4 now, so White defends the pawn.   10.d5  This is a more direct way of preventing ... cxd4, but it's not frightening.  10...d6  We first prevent any piece @@StartBracket@@either the knight or the bishop@@EndBracket@@ coming to e5.  11.Qc2  f5  Next we go Qf6, when there are threats on c3 and the possibility of trapping the bishop on g3! White is in trouble.   10.O-O-O  A more original attempt of defending d4, but also a bit risky.  10...Bxc3  11.bxc3  Nc6  =+  White's king is not very safe on the queenside and we have similar plans as in the previous variation.  10...Nc6  11.Bd3  Bxc3+  Taking here now seems wise, as now White is forced to take back with the pawn, weakening his structure.  12.bxc3  Nxg3  13.hxg3  Na5  14.Qc2  Ba6 !?  Taking c4 under fire.  15.Nd2  Qc7 =  We can castle long if we want to. Meanwile, White's king is not safe on either wing!   5.Qc2  This is almost a transposition to 4.

The idea is that the bishop is now protected so it doesn't get bothered by the defended bishop on g2, and sometimes Black can try to play ...Be4 so that ... Qb7 can be played. Additionally, Black has ideas like ...c5 and ...Nc6-a5 at some point, or ...e5. There are four games in this line, 3 of them went 9.Re1, and one game went 9.a4.  9.Re1   9.a4  White is trying to grab some space on the queenside, but this feels a little off.  9...O-O  Let's look at some different ideas White can try here.  10.Re1   10.a5 ?!

After ...c5, Black can either attack the c4-pawn or open the c-file later on.  O-O  10.Qc2  10.a4 would transpose to 9.a4.

5... Bb7 { The most common move. } 6. e3
{ The majority of players opts for this move, which White has to make sooner or later.   6.Nd2  The second-most popular move. White unpins the knight on c3 and avoids the h6-g5-Ne4 ideas that are possible in other lines.  6...h6  It is useful to include this move, so we can go ...g5 and unpin our knight at any moment.  7.Bh4  e5 !?  Out of almost 1000 games, this has only been played 9 times! Black scored a stunning 7,5 out of 9 and 5 of the black players were above 2600, so this is definitely a serious move. Instead, most players opted for calmer moves such as 7... c5, 7.. . O-O or 7... Bxc3. The advantage of playing e5 though is that it opens up the e-file, and we will often play ... Qe7 to use that file and then castle queenside. What's so pleasant about 7... e5 is that the most logical move of 8. dxe5 is actually not so good for White! But on top of that, other tries are also fine for us, so it is just a very strong move not only psychologally but objectively as well.  8.dxe5  Clearly the most logical test. Black is giving up a pawn, so White should seriously consider taking it - especially since it also attacks a pinned knight!   8.Qb3  exd4  In the lines with 4.Qb3, we also at time see this capture on d4 when the bishop hangs @@StartBracket@@although with...cxd4 instead of exd4@@EndBracket@@. This exchange is usually fine for Black.  9.Qxb4  Na6  Stronger than taking the knight right away: why not develop with tempo first? From a6, the knight can jump to c5 and doesn't block the bishop's diagonal.  10.Qa3  In case of 10. Qb3, Black can play another intermediate move with 10.. .

Black will initiate a kingside attack soon.  12.Bg3  Nc5  13.Bf5  Bc8  We don't mind exchanging this bishop, as it would eliminate White's pair of bishops.

If White ever tries to castle kingside, the opened g-file could prove very useful for our rook!  10...Nh5  We are currently down a pawn, but our pieces are active and White has two doubled pawns - and since we will soon take on g3, he will have 3@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ doubled pawns.

If White plays 12. cxd5, we will take back with the queen.

The idea is to offer the h7-pawn and get on with play against White's king.  15.e5   15.Bxf6  Qf4+  ∓  Nd5  Now the line gets a forced character.  16.Bd3  f5  17.exf6  Nxf6  18.Bxf6  Rxf6  19.Bxh7+  Kh8  20.Be4  Raf8  =+  Black plans ...Nc4 and ...b5, emphasizing White's unsafe king.   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  Because White can play a3 at many different moments, this position has arisen from various move orders. To make things easier for us, this is a direct transposition to 4.a3 with 6.Nf3 and 7. Bg5.  7...h6   6.Rc1  This is still played in more than a hundred games. White waits to see what set-up Black will go for, and defends the knight on c3 in advance.  6...h6  7.Bxf6  This is a calm approach, and Black can develop calmly in return.   7.Bh4  g5  8.Bg3  Ne4  9.Nd2   9.e3  Black can just take on c3 and continue development. If you want to play an alternative, please consider 10... h5. Although the latter option is great if White plays 10.h3 so Black can take on g3, the situation becomes unclear after 10.d5. Nevertheless, it is certainly playable and I invite you to explore this further on your own!  9...Bxc3+  10.bxc3  d6  The knight on e4 is very strong, so White will likely try to chase it away with either Nd2 or Bd3.  11.Bd3   11.Nd2  Nxg3  12.hxg3  Nd7  =+  Black proceeds with ...Qe7 and ...0-0-0 in most cases, with a complex struggle ahead although Black is slightly for choice as the statical elements are in his favour.  Nd7  12.O-O  Qe7  =+  And we will castle queenside and think about starting an attack against White's king. I'm sure you would have a lot of fun in this position, and according to the database Black actually did by winning all games except for one draw.  Bxc3  First inflicting doubled pawns before taking on g3.  10.bxc3  Nxg3  11.hxg3  d6  This is similar to other variations in 4. Nf3, although the rook on c1 couldn't recapture on c3 and castling long is off limits now for White.  12.e4  White seizes space and tries to become active to compensate for his weakened structure.  12...Nd7  13.Bd3   13.Qa4  White is pinning our knight, getting ready to play c4-c5.  13...Qe7  Black could consider ...a5 as well, preventing White's Ba6 idea.  14.c5  We are following Hracek - Efimenko @@StartBracket@@2016@@EndBracket@@.  14...dxc5  Pay attention!

7... Bxc3+
{ This is a good moment to create doubled pawns for White. We eliminate a defender of the e4-square and will get ready to play ...g5 at some point. }
8. bxc3 d6
{ We're going for a simple set-up. Our idea will be to play .. .Nbd7 and then go ...g5 and/or ...e5, controlling those dark squares now that we have given up our bishop. It's important to postpone castling so we can go . ..g5 whenever we like. }
9. Nd2
{ White does not want to allow Ne4.   9.Bd3  This is second in frequency.  9...Nbd7  Now we have developed everything and are ready for g5.  10.O-O  Although a very common move, this king will often be vulnerable here on the kingside.   10.Qc2  White takes the e4-square under firm control, so we have no Ne4 ideas in this case.  10...g5  There we go!  11.Bg3  Qe7  Preparing to castle long.  12.e4   12.O-O  Let's see what happens if White makes normal moves.  12...O-O-O  Black just continues his typical plan.  13.Nd2  A move we see a lot, but it's not really to the point here.  13...h5  ∓  With a highly dangerous attack.  Nh5  This is a good move played by Spassky in 1984. We go after the bishop in a different way and prepare our attack.  13.Nd2  Nf4  Causing some inconveniences in White's camp.  14.Bxf4  gxf4  This gives Black excellent counterplay on the g-file.  15.O-O  Rg8  16.f3  O-O-O  ∓  Sadly Spassky only drew this game after continuing 16...h5, but Black has a splendid position after the simple 16... 0-0-0. We will double on the g-file with a great attack.  10...g5  This is familiar from many lines by now: Black unpins and uses the e4-square.  11.Bg3  Ne4  Now White mostly either played Nd2 or Qc2 in this position to neutralize the knight.  12.Nd2  A common way of getting rid of the knight, but our play will be fairly similar.   12.Qc2  f5  Firmly establishing the knight.  13.Nd2   13.d5  White clears the d4-square and tries to gain access to more light squares while blocking our bishop diagonal. It looks logical to take the pawn but the lines tend to go deeply towards a simplified position. An alternative is 13... Ndc5, which is a good option as well. The text move is more clear.  13...Qf6  Attacking the pawn on c3, making it logical for White to take on e4.  14.Bxe4  In one game, Bareev played Nd2 and a draw was agreed, but Black could have had an excellent position after taking on d2 as the pawn storm is too dangerous.  14...fxe4  15.Qxe4  Nc5  16.Qd4  Rf8  Let's take stock for a second. We have sacrificed our pawn, but our pieces have good squares and we have some open files that we can use. I would say the position is complex but balanced. We do not mind a trade on f6, since the pawn on d5 would then fall immediately.  17.e4  Threatening e5, so it is time to close the position a bit.   17.Nd2  Preparing to take on f6 and then go e4, or perhaps threatening f4!?. We can parry both ideas by moving away our queen.  17...Qg6  =+  Now we have the idea of playing h5 and e5, when White's queen will actually be trapped!  17...e5  18.Qe3  a5  N  With ...Ba6 and preparation of ...h5 on the cards.  Nxd2  13... Ndf6 to keep the knight on e4 is also possible, but we win some time by taking here and can go after the bishop on g3 immediately now.  14.Qxd2  h5  15.f3  The natural way to keep the bishop. With our knight still on e4, this would win White a tempo so taking on d2 was a good decision.  15...Qf6  16.e4   16.h3  was played in Eismont - Thiel @@StartBracket@@2004@@EndBracket@@, but Black finds it easy to get a promising position.  16...O-O-O  17.a4  White tries hard to launch some attack himself, but it's nothing special.  17...a5  With one simple move, we shut down White's whole attack and now we can focus on our own.  18.Qe2  g4  -+  It's highly unlikely that White will survive the coming assault on his king.  f4  17.Bf2  O-O-O  ∓  in Booth - Mulligan @@StartBracket@@2015@@EndBracket@@, Black got a promising position after 18.a4 a5 19.Qe2 g4.  12...Nxd2  13.Qxd2  h5  Launching the attack again.  14.h3   14.f3  Qf6 =  Black can play ...h4 on the next move and then ...e5, and castle long. This is really similar to the line we just saw with 12. Qc2 and 13. Nd2, only we now didn't have to go ...f5. That's fine though - our attack works well without it!  f5  Trying to go h4 and then g4 without sacrificing a pawn.   14...h4 !?  This is a more direct alternative which is really interesting.  15.Bh2  g4  16.hxg4  h3  17.f3  This is sort of forced as g2-g3 would make matters worse for the bishop on h2 and the light squares on the kingside. Maybe a computer would like to defend that, but a human certainly wouldn't!  17...hxg2  18.Qxg2  Qf6  =∞  For one mere pawn, Black got White to worsen his structure and has long-term attacking potential.  15.f3  Stopping g4 for now. In fact, if Black would play 15... g4 right now, White has the strong reply 16. e4!.  15...Qe7  16.c5  O-O-O =  Black will push pawns to open lines while White will try to do the same, giving us a complex but fascinating position.   9.Be2  This does nothing to control the e4-square.  9...g5  10.Bg3  Ne4  11.Qc2  Nd7  We do not have to waste time on f5 now and can immediately finish developing.  12.O-O  Qe7  13.Nd2  Nxd2  14.Qxd2  ∓  And we're back in our familiar position from the other variations in which Black typically castling long and plays for a pawn storm. }
9... Nbd7 10. f3
{ Now it's even more clear that White really does not want to allow Ne4! Luckily, we still have our e5-plan. }
10... Qe7
{ In this position, Black has plenty of options like ... e5, ...g5 or 0-0-0, although they often coincide. }
11. Bd3
{ 11.e4  e5  12.Be2  This looks a bit modest but it does prevent a check on the e-file in certain lines.   12.Bd3  Transposes to 11. Bd3.   12.Qa4  This is actually a clever move, as it effectively prevents castling long since Black has to make some unpleasant consessions to make that happen. Black is better off castling short and regroup his pieces.  12...O-O  Now we are happy that we didn't play g5 yet, as our king is very safe on the kingside here.  13.Bd3  Black will resolve the pin by moving the rook on f8, and prepare ... Nf8-g6. The rook seems sensibly placed on either e8 or c8.   13.Be2  Against this move, Black can play in the same manner as against Bd3.  13...Rfe8  14.O-O  Nf8  15.Rfd1  Ne6  16.Nf1  Nf4 =  13...Rfe8  This is a good solution, although ...Qe6 also has its followers. Black prepares to play the knight to f8 where it can go to e6 or g6.  14.O-O  Nf8  15.Rfe1  Ne6 =  With some pressure on the d4-pawn. The position is balanced.  12...g5  13.Bf2  Nh5  The knight can go to f4 and we prepare to play on the kingside.  14.g3  Preventing Nf4, but this does weaken the kingside for White.   14.Nf1  White also dreams of rerouting the knight.  14...O-O-O  15.Ne3  Nf4  16.Bf1   16.Nf5  Qf6 =  Planning to play on the kingside.  h5  17.Nf5  Qf6 =  With the idea of ...g4, or even to take on d4 at the right moment so the knight on d7 can come to e5.  14...O-O-O  Black will stop the a-pawn by ...a5 if needed, and builds up play on the kingside.  15.O-O  Nhf6 =  The knight was blocking the march of the pawn, but now we are fully ready open lines on the kingside.   11.Qa4  Again with the idea of preventing 0-0-0.  11...e5  12.Bf2  This was played in Wang - Tomashevsky @@StartBracket@@2009@@EndBracket@@. White used up some time to play Qa4 and Bf2, so Black can think about striking himself.   12.e4  Transposes to 11.e4 that we examined before.  12...c5  N  13.d5  e4  with play along the e-file.   11.Be2  This does not have much independent value as we can play in the same way as usual: g5, 0-0-0 and start the attack!  11...g5  12.Bf2  O-O-O  =+ }
11... e5 12. e4
{ Otherwise we would play e4 ourselves! See the 12.Qe2 line.   12.Qe2  g5  13.Bf2  e4 !  Initiating good play in the center but more importantly, preventing White from playing e3-e4.  14.Bc2  The only move, as exchanges on e4 would only help Black. The e3-pawn will be very weak if that would happen.  14...O-O-O  15.O-O-O  15...h5  %cal Gh5h4,Gd8g8  (And even though White's king is not there now, we can improve our position on the kingside.) }
12... g5 13. Bf2 Nh5 14. Nf1
{ 14.g3  Preventing ...Nf4.  14...f5  White can't easily take on f5 as ...exd4+ comes with check, and the c3-pawn will be lost. This was not possible with the bishop on e2.  15.Qe2  f4  Now that there were no more discovery checks, we immediately advance this pawn.  16.g4   16.a4  a5  This is our usual reply to a4, and play is just very similar to lines without including them.  17.g4  Ng7  18.h4  h5 =  And castling long after hxg5, picking up the pawn later but it's essential to keep the h-file open as White could otherwise close the position.  Ng7  Black must realize, just as in the 16.a4-variation, that he has to play ...h5.  17.h4  h5  18.hxg5  O-O-O  With a complex position that is objectively equal. }
14... f5 { The discovery check also works in this case. } 15. Ne3
{ 15.d5  Black welcomes a closed structure.  15...Nf4  16.Ne3  Nc5  N  Our knights have wonderful squares, whereas the white bishops look unhappy.  17.Bc2  fxe4  18.fxe4  Bc8  ∓  Covering the f5-square and getting ready to play ... Bd7 and ...0-0-0, to resume Black's play on the kingside. }
15... fxe4
{ Now ...f4 isn't such a good idea as White can immediately jump to f5. Instead, we should try to pressurize e4. }
16. fxe4
{ Attacking the knight on h5, but the bishop is looking at its own pawns now.   16.Nf5  Qf7  17.Bxe4  This is a better recapture than taking with the pawn, as the bishop on d3 is not active and would like to exchange himself.  17...O-O-O  18.Bxb7+  Closing the position with 18. d5 would be beneficial for Black as well.  18...Kxb7  ∓  Black's counterplay comes quick.   16.Bxe4  O-O-O  with similar ideas to the 16. Nf5-variation. Black either welcomes closing the position, or starts quick counterplay if the bishops are exchanged. }
16... Nf4 17. d5
{ 17.O-O  O-O-O  18.Nd5  18. Nf5 looks nice, but the knight lacks other pieces to coordinate with - and on its own, it's not that dangerous. After 18.Qh7, Black aims to play on the kingside with the pawns on the g and h-file.  18...Qe6  19.a4  a5  20.Rb1  h5  N  in the game Hernandez - Cioara @@StartBracket@@2000@@EndBracket@@, Black combined a bit of defense with the attack on the kingside, and prevailed in a beautiful game @@StartBracket@@see model games@@EndBracket@@. The novelty looks like an improvement over that game. }
17... O-O-O
{ Black has a good position as the knights are flexible and the pawn structure favours him. }
18. Bc2 Qf7
{ Black can build his position with ease while g2-g3 can be met by the quite bothersome Nh3. }

{ This is the most popular move after 4. Qc2 and 4. e3 and should therefore be studied carefully.

5... Bb7 6. Be2
{ With the bishop on e2, Black can't transpose to the repertoire against 4. e3 as the bishop is on d3 in the main line. However, the bishop is a little less actively placed and variations are not critical. Black can double White's pawns and play for ...c5 to open the c-file later and attack the c4-pawn. }
6... Bxc3+
{ We capture directly before White prevents the worsening of the pawn structure. Compare this move to the note on 7...Bb7 in 4. e3 with Bd3 and Nf3: I considered to take in that situation, but I ultimately felt that White could control the e4-square well enough and refrained from recommending it. However, now that the bishop is on e2, we do have access to that square. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bg5
{ This is the start of the so-called Leningrad variation, and is commonly associated with the practice of Boris Spassky. The move Bg5 is broadly used by White against our repertoire and unsurprisingly the move transposes for a large portion to other moves like 4. Nf3, 4.a3, 4.Qc2 and 4.e3-lines. This chapter will be about the lines that White can play before transposition. There isn't much theory or practice in the lines without 5.Nf3 and this reduces the effort of learning much variations against a move that isn't played that often. Later on, I plan to add the entertaining 4...c5 which involves blocked structures with doubled pawns for White, where Black attacks on the kingside often and hides the king on the queenside with Kd8-Kc7. }
4... b6
{ From this position, the most frequent move has been 5.Nf3, and transposes directly to 4.Nf3; 5.Bg5. The next move of discussion will be 5.f3, followed by 5.e3, 5.e4, 5.a3 and 5.Qc2 in descending order of frequency. }
5. f3
{ is the most popular move after 5.Nf3. White wants to build a strong center while delaying development for the moment.   5.e3  Bb7  From this position, the most frequent move has been 6.Nf3 and this would transposes to the main line of 4.Nf3. There are still some alternatives in in 6.Nge2, 6.f3 and 6.Qc2 but they are all very similar. It's important to know that in most cases, Black prepares to play ...d5 or ...c5 after retreating the bishop back to e7.  6.Nf3  Transposes to 4.Nf3; 6.e3.   6.Qc2  O-O  7.f3   7.Nf3  Transposes to 4.Nf3; 6.Qc2.   7.Nge2  This will be similar to other lines, only the knight blocks the bishop before it can develop. So, this is hardly dangerous.  7...h6  8.Bh4  Be7  Retreating the bishop before playing ...c5, as will be customary in this chapter.  9.f3  c5 =  h6  It's often useful to include this move in these lines. Bd3 is coming, when White will threaten our h7-pawn and we would have to play h6 anyway.  8.Bh4  Be7  Black wants to play c7-c5 without getting bothered by a2-a3 against this structure of e3 and d4.  9.Bd3  c5  10.Nge2  Nc6  11.O-O  Nb4  =+  Black can increase the pressure after 12.Qd2 by ...Ba6 with the idea of ...d5.11... cxd4 12. exd4 d5 is also possible, keeping the option to play ...Nb4 later.   6.f3  h6  We are reacting in the same way as we would had White played Qc2. This means that lines could transpose if White goes Qc2 at some point after all.  7.Bh4  Be7  8.Bd3  c5  9.Nge2  Nc6 =  With pressure on the center.   6.Nge2  h6  7.Bh4  O-O  We wait a little longer with retreating our bishop, as it is unclear what White should do here. If he plays Qc2, we will transpose to 6.Qc2.  8.a3  Be7  We wanted to play this anyway, so we don't mind White forcing us.  9.Bg3  Now ...c5 would be normal but White can reply d4-d5 which is a bit annoying. This was made possible by White's last move: if the bishop was still on h4, we could always answer d5 with ...Nxd5 when the bishop on h4 is hanging. Instead we go d5 ourselves which was played in Yermolinsky - Kasimdzhanov @@StartBracket@@1999@@EndBracket@@.  9...d5  10.cxd5  Nxd5  N  We can play c5 later and finish development when we have nothing to fear.   5.e4  White uses the pin to play this advance, but it comes with a downside.  5...h6  6.Bxf6  White had to take as after 6. Bh4, 6... g5 wins the e4-pawn.  6...Qxf6  7.e5   7.Nf3  A normal move, but not a dangerous one.  7...Bxc3+  As you know, we like to double White's pawns and this position is no exception.  8.bxc3  Bb7  9.Bd3  O-O  10.O-O  d6 =  Preparing ...e5, with a pleasant position as White still has doubled pawns and also has a less active bishop.  Qg6  Now we have pressure on the g2-pawn. There is also a hidden idea behind this move...  8.Nf3  or 8.Nge2, Black plays ...Bb7, and is for choice.   8.Qf3 ??  Looks natural and was played twice, but Black can play a very nice move.  8...Qc2  N  Winning on the spot: we will win the b2-pawn when White collapses.  8...Bb7 =   5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Transposes to 4.a3; 6.Bg5.   5.Qc2  This move will often transpose to other variations.  5...Bb7  Black prevents e2-e4 that would have been strong after castling short. Now, Black can just play ...Bxe4.  6.f3   6.a3  Bxc3+  7.Qxc3  O-O  Transposes to one of the main positions in the Nimzo-Indian, that usually arises after 4.Qc2 0-0 5.a3 with 7.Bg5.   6.e3  O-O  With a transposition to 5. e3 Bb7 6. Qc2 as examined earlier in this chapter.   6.Nf3  Transposes to 4.Nf3; 6.Qc2.  6...d6  h6  As we have seen in other Bg5 lines, this is useful to include so we can play ...g5 whenever it suits us.  7.Bh4  c5  Immediately attacking the center makes a lot of sense here. White has gone f3, signaling intentions to play e4 and create a strong center, so we should waste no time and have to take direct action.  8.a3   8.e3  Defending the pawn is very natural, but not so strong.  8...cxd4  9.exd4  Now the pawn on f3 looks quite ugly and weakening. Its purpose to support a pawn push to e4 has failed miserably.  9...O-O  10.Bd3  Nc6  We can just develop in a natural way.  11.Nge2  Be7  Making room to go ...Nb4, and unpinning our knight doesn't hurt either.  12.a3  Rc8  ∓  Now that we have developed all of our pieces, we are ready to go d5. Black's position is excellent.   8.dxc5  Bxc5  We have examined positions where White takes on c5 before and we recapture in the same way as usual.  9.e4  Nc6  Now the d4-square looks very weak.  10.O-O-O  O-O  11.Kb1  Rc8  With a flexible position for Black. Ideas could be to play for pressure on the c4-pawn by playing the knight to either a5 or e5, and retreat the bishop to e7.

Nbd7  We just ignore White's attack and develop calmly. Note that we don't have to fear g5, as we can respond with ...Nh5! utilizing that the bishop on h4 is unprotected, which means that the pawn is pinned.  13.Nh3  Ne5  14.Nf2  b5  Black is just slowly improving all the pieces.  15.a3  Ba5  16.O-O  c4  N  Opening the diagonal for the bishop.

White's other pieces are paralyzed.  16...Rxd5  We have won a third pawn for the piece and our initiative is still there.  17.Qb3  Happened in Niemann - Jayaram @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@.  17...Qe7  18.c4  Rd4  19.Bf2  Re4  -+  With a winning advantage, which Black converted later on. }

{ This is a very topical and aggressive variation you can definitely expect to face on a regular basis as it has been recommended in a few recent sources. I would love to state the official name of the variation, but it seems like there is some debate on this topic, either calling it the Kmoch, Georghiu or Shirov variation. White is building up rather agressively in the center, but delaying its development a bit which may backfire badly. However, if White can stabilize his center he will be better in the long run. So, quick action from our side is required! }
4... c5
{ This is the move that is most suitable for playing dynamically with Black.   I did consider  4...O-O!?  though, having the variation  5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nh5  in mind. However, if White is precise, Black can end up being worse @@StartBracket@@the lines given by Daniel Barrish in part 2 of his 1.d4 courses here on Chessable were quite unpleasant for Black for example@@EndBracket@@. Therefore, I decided on playing 4... c5 with the idea of a quick ...b5. }
5. d5
{ White gains space and tries to consolidate the center. However, from now on he has to keep an eye on possible flank attacks that will undermine his center. Besides 5.a3, there are no real alternatives for White on this move, as we can just answer other moves by taking on d4.   5.a3  This is the second most popular move, which is actually a Sämisch variation with f3 c5 included and therefore reduces White's flexibility a bit.  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nc6  We usually respond to the Sämisch with 5...b6, so unfortunately we do not transpose. However, the moves Nc6-Na5 and b6-Ba6 to attack the c4-pawn will also feature in those lines, making them a bit similar after all.  7.e4  The critical move as White is statically worse and has to compensate with active, dynamic play.   7.e3  This seems a little tame. White is not immediately looking for compensation for the weakened c4-pawn, and logically Black puts pressure on it.  7...b6  8.Bd3  Ba6  =+  Na5 is next, and Black seems to do well here. White has just been playing too slowly.   7.d5  is probably a bit too much to play a2-a3 and d4-d5 at such an early stage.  7...Na5  Of course we do not capture as it would only improve White's structure.  8.e4  d6  We play in the same style as against the other moves. This transposes to the variation 7. e4 d6 8. d5 Na5.  7...d6  This is a typical move in these structures. We prevent e5 and remain flexible for now, waiting for White to decide on its direction. White has typically chosen 8.Be3 as the main move, followed by 8. Ne2, 8.d5, 8.Bg5 and 8.Nh3 as more occasional moves.  8.Be3  This is the most popular move.   8.Ne2  This is the second most popular move after 8.Be3.  8...b6  9.Bg5   9.Ng3  The knight makes room for the bishop on f1, but the knight on g3 isn't contributing much for now.  9...O-O  We just continue our established plan of Na5 and Ba6. One plus of not playing ...Na5 too early is that White is unable to develop his bishop to d3, as the pawn on d4 would be hanging @@StartBracket@@you'll see later that this is why they usually play 8.Be3@@EndBracket@@.  10.d5  Na5  =+  Black has the better side of equality.  h6  We chase away the bishop and prepare a possible g5.  10.Bh4  Black has multiple options in this case like to castle short and play the c6-knight to e7, the usual ...Na5 / ... Ba6, or try to close the position with ...e5. The latter option is preferred by Leela, with the plan to play on the kingside later @@StartBracket@@...g5 / ...Nh5-f4@@EndBracket@@.   10.Be3  This will be similar to immediately going to e3.  10...Na5  With the d4-pawn firmly protected, we can move the knight already and go for that c4-pawn.  11.Ng3  Ba6  12.Bd3  There was no satisfactory way to defend the c4-pawn, although because of double attacks on a4 the pawn is currently untouchable.  12...O-O  Now the pawn is under attack though, but White is just in time to defend it.  13.Qe2  cxd4  14.cxd4  Rc8  This is another idea familiar from the 4.a3 lines: opening the c-files so the rook can also join the attack.  15.Rc1  Qc7  We are now attacking the pawn 4 times, and White is finally unable to defend it with extra pieces. So, he advances the pawn, hoping to make things work.  16.c5  Bxd3  17.Qxd3  dxc5 !?  While it is natural to capture with the b-pawn, this capture has the benefit of being able to quickly play ...Rfd8.  18.dxc5  Rfd8  19.Qe2  Qb7  =+  This all happened in Teverovski - Tenev @@StartBracket@@2008@@EndBracket@@. Black is slightly better as his piece activity is preferable. In the game, he showed fine technique @@StartBracket@@to be fair, it was a correspondence game@@EndBracket@@ and brought home the point.  10...e5  N  I think it is interesting to close the center here and get something going on the kingside, as we can win more time thanks to the placement of the dark-squared bishop.  11.d5  Na5  12.Nc1  Where else? With the bishop on h4, going to g3 isn't going to help White.  12...g5  13.Bf2  Nh5  =+  The king is safe in the center, and Black prepares counterplay on the kingside. Meanwhile, the pawn on c4 is just as weak as in all the other lines!   8.Nh3  It makes sense to not block the bishop and try to go to f2, but this move is really not helping White as Black can attack the center and threaten to take on h3 with just one simple move.  8...e5 !  Just like in the previous variation, closing the center with this move is useful. We also attack h3 now and White is already in trouble.  9.d5  White simply has no time to move the knight. He can go dxe5, but then his pawn structure will forever be damaged.  9...Bxh3  An important intermediate move.  10.dxc6  Bc8  11.cxb7  Bxb7  =+  We aren't even down material, but we have compromised the white pawn structure and have a better light-squared bishop compared to the white one.   8.d5  White voluntarily closes the center, but this is not to be recommended.  8...Na5  9.Bd3   9.Bg5  b6  10.Bd3  h6  11.Bh4  g5  Again this advance!  12.Bg3  12.Bf2 is just similar.  12...Nh5  13.Ne2  e5  ∓  Again closing the center and trying to play on the kingside. The bishop can go to d7 in this case and the queen to f6, when we can even think about castling queenside.  b6  or ... Nd7!? is interesting, but the text move is more thematic. Black is in good shape. One move that is seen more frequent in practice is 10.f4.  10.f4  exd5  ∓  Black is doing well in the center.  11.cxd5  c4 !  The point, grabbing some useful space. ...Nb3 will also be in the air now and we can quickly castle and take control over the e-file while White is still underdeveloped.   8.Bg5  You would think this transposes to lines with a later Bg5, but I want to show you how to exploit this early committing of the bishop.  8...h6  9.Be3   9.Bh4  cxd4  10.cxd4  Qa5+  The point! This was not possible when we had already played b6. White is unable to play Bd2 with the bishop far away on h4.  11.Kf2  A sad necessity, as Qd2 would lose the d4-pawn.  11...Qd8  =+  It is quite unnatural to go back into the pin, but there is a concrete idea: we are now threatening ...Nxe4+! After 12.Bg3 Nh5, Black is in good shape.  b6 =+  This is just the 8.Be3 line with h6 included, which is fine.  8...b6  Although 8... 0-0 or 8...Qa5 has been played as well, 8. ..b6 is a flexible option as sometimes it can be advantageous to castle long.  9.Bd3  Na5  The pawn on d4 is protected, so it is fine to move this knight. Now White has to decide whether to put his knight on e2 or h3.  10.Nh3  This is the most frequently played.   10.Ne2  A natural square, but it cuts out the option of playing Qe2 to defend the pawn on c4.  10...Ba6  11.O-O  Obviously Black can't take the pawn yet.  11...Qc7  N  with a good position. The queen has some influence on the c-file and the black king can go to the safe queenside. We have a flexible pawn structure in the center to deal with White's possible advances. Let's examine two possible options.  12.d5  Black has flexibility in which side it will castle.   12.f4  These four pawns on the fourth rank may look scary, but they aren't!  12...O-O-O  ∓  We simply ignore them and bring our king into safety. It is very useful that we have just been given access to the g4-square.  13.f5   13.e5  Ng4  =+  The bishop is under attack, and we can take on c4 next.  e5 =+  The c4-pawn will drop.  12...O-O-O  =+  I prefer this one, but if you don't then castling kingside is fine too. We can now try to start an attack against the white king, or we can just focus on winning the c4-pawn.  10...e5  Again we immediately play this move, threatening to take on h3.  11.Nf2  This was not possible without playing 8. Be3, so White has accomplished his goal. However, if this is the best he has, we can conclude that playing f3 and a3 is just not so strong for White as it is too slow to have full compensation for the weakened pawns.  11...Ba6  12.Qe2  N  Protects the c4-pawn but the center wasn't closed yet.   12.Bg5  h6  13.Bh4  g5  14.Bg3  Qe7  =+  Black aims to castle long and push Harry the h-pawn, especially after White castles short.  12...exd4  13.cxd4  cxd4  =+  White has problems as taking back on d4 would run into ...Nb3, and after Bg5, Black plays ...h6 and . ..g5 if needed. }
5... d6
{ A useful move as White will soon play e4 and positionally threatens e4-e5. I have always been very intrigued by the line 5.. .b5 6.e4 0-0 where Black not only allows but almost encourages White to advance the e-pawn in order to attack the pawns later. However, I feel that this line was covered in quite a lot of repertoire suggestions already, and frankly I think this line is even more interesting as it is less of a forcing nature and invites to more creative play. }
6. e4 b5
{ Although playing with ...b5 has been frequently seen on the fifth move, delaying it for one move has been rising in popularity over the last few years. It is quite logical: White is building up a strong center, so we need to undermine it. I will be covering a lot of moves for White here, but don't panic: I won't ask of you to memorize all of it, a lot will just be available as reference material if you want to study it more deeply, or on a specific occassion if you expect your opponent to play a certain line. }
7. Ne2
{ This has been White's most popular move, in shared place with 7.Bd2. He tries to develop as fast as possible, but does leave the c4-pawn hanging in the progress.   7.Bf4  This move is not very popular but it was played by GM Volkov. It also has a @@StartBracket@@quite obvious@@EndBracket@@ point to it: White can take on e6 and then d6 is suddenly hanging.  7...O-O  We can just ignore White's threat! e5 and exd5 have been tried in practice, but I don't like to release the tension if it's not of any concrete benefit. This move also has the advantage that it will directly transpose to 7.dxe6, meaning that we have to study less.  8.dxe6  This is the most logical connected to Bf4. If 8.Nge2, Black can play 8...exd5 and then ... Nh5 @@StartBracket@@attacking the bishop on f4, which suddenly seems a bit clumsy@@EndBracket@@ and ...f5 can follow.  8...Bxe6  Transposes to 7.dxe6 and 8.Bf4.   7.Bd2  Resolving the pin has been a trending move in the last few years. It was even featured in a game between Aronian and Carlsen at the important Fide Grand Swiss tournament on Isle of Men last year. It is also the move recommended for White by Daniel Barrish in his repertoire here on Chessable, as well as the main recommendation by Sopiko Guramishvili on Chess24 - so definitely a move we should take seriously! It seems interesting to play either 7... Bxc3 as a more quiet option, compared to the more dynamic and unexplored 7...exd5 of Rapport which will the second option. As this is very topical, I will present you both moves so you can choose for yourself and mix it up in your games, making it harder to prepare for your opponents.  7...exd5 !?  This was played by Rapport against Mamedyarov in a rapid game last year, and went on to win a great game. The positions are unexplored and very dynamic - just how we like it.   7...Bxc3  This move has been rising in popularity since last year. In October 2019, it was featured twice in the FIDE Grand Swiss tournament. First in Fedoseev-Wojtaszek, and a few days later in the top duel between Aronian and Carlsen! We will largely follow the moves that Magnus played.  8.Bxc3  b4  This was the idea behind taking on c3: we lose our dark-squared bishop, but control the dark squares with our pawns.  9.Bd2  O-O  10.Be3  A multi-purpose move, White shields the e-file and can play ...g4 against ...Nh5 as the check on h4+ is parried by Bf2.   10.Ne2  exd5  11.cxd5  Nh5 =  This is an illustration of how Black can control White's expansion.The knight move to h5 helps Black with either ...Qh4+ or ... f5.   10.Qc2  Occurred in Butvilas - Narmontas @@StartBracket@@2020@@EndBracket@@, but now Black can use the pressure on the e-file combined with play on the queenside.  10...exd5  11.cxd5  Nbd7  12.Ne2  Re8 =  The threat of ...Nxd5 causes some inconveniences along the way, and Black has ideas to combine play on the queenside with threats to White's pawn chain.  10...exd5  11.cxd5  Nfd7  This was Carlsen's choice against Aronian, a novelty at the time. 2 other strong grandmasters, Alekseenko and Smirnov, have played it as well.

White aims to win some time with attacking the room, giving him a chance to complete his development.

This is a very good square for the knight as from there, it can assist attacks on both sides of the board.  19.Rhe1  Ne5  If it wasn't for the previous move, Black would now be threatening to win a piece with ...Ng4+. We are threatening Nd3+ though.  20.Bc2  Nbd7 =  The knight can go to c4, when our other knight can go to e5 or perhaps b6 to attack d5. I think Black is fine here.  Qh4+ N  Although 13... Ne5 is exclusively played in practice so far, there are certainly a few lines where Black has to play difficult variations, and improvements upon the existing games are imminent. It sometimes means we have to sacrifice the exchange, but the benefits are worth it.  14.g3  Qf6  We only go here after provoking a weakness in White's camp.

We can also try to get our knight from f6 to d7 after all then, from where it can go to c5.

However, we are not out of ideas yet either.  17...Rb8  18.Be3  Bxe3  19.Qxe3  h5  ⇆  A surprising case of playing on two flanks. We can try to go after the b2-pawn by playing Bd7 @@StartBracket@@attacking the knight on a4@@EndBracket@@, but we can also try to play h4 and get something on the kingside. Although we are still a pawn down, we have a lot of activity to compensate and I definitely don't mind having Black here.  14.Be3  Preventing c4.   14.Be2  White wants to castle, but he's not in time...  14...c4  ⇆  15.Nf5  Taking the pawn would give Black too much activity, similar to what we have seen in other lines.  15...Nc5  We now threaten to take on f5 and go Re8, when the opened e-file will give White a ton of problems. So, White's next move is forced.  16.Ne7+  Kh8  17.Nxc8  if 17.Be3, then 17...Bd7 and the knight on e7 might need to go to c6 soon as a rook will come to e8, with equality.  17...Rfxc8  18.Be3  Nfd7  Again we reroute this knight, one of the key ideas in this variation. 18...Qc7 was also an option: 19.0-0 Nb3 20.

White can't catch a break.  15.Kf2  Ne5 =  We can again try to play h5 and harass the knight on g3. The position is very dynamic and should be a lot of fun to play!  13...c4  White can't easily take on c4 as ...Nb6 would give Black a winning position.  14.O-O  White quickly castles. Qc2 would just transpose after Qb6 to a line we covered earlier.  14...Nc5  15.Qc2  Nb3  16.Ra2  Nxd2  17.Qxd2  Ba6 =  Black is definitely happy to have won the dark-squared bishop and can start the usual rerouting of the knight soon.   10.Rxa4  This was played in Lysenko - Loskutova @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@, but it feels less critical than taking with the queen.  10...O-O  11.Bd3  a5  Again we put our pawn here as fast as we can, so we don't have to worry about protecting it anymore.  12.Nge2  Nbd7  Or the familiar 12...c4, and if 13.

The position is again double-edged.  Nfd7 !  We keep our knight on b8, so it can be developed via a6. Black plans to castle short and gain a tempo on the queen on a4, either by ...Nb6 or after Black has played ...a5 and ...c4, either by Na6-c5 or Nd7-c5.  11.Nge2  a5  12.Ng3  O-O =  and Black either wins a tempo on the queen or prepares ...Na6, and maybe even sacrifices a pawn with ...c4, with strong play on the dark squares. At the moment Black threatens to actually play ...c4.  13.Qc2  Avoiding Black's threats.  13...Na6  14.Be2  c4 !  This typical move from the Benoni and Benko gambit gives Black interesting play.  15.O-O  White had just enough time to castle, but we are not done annoying him yet!   15.Bxc4 ?!  Ne5  16.Be2  Bc5  ∓  Suddenly, there are all kinds of threats that White has to worry about and his king will not be able to castle anytime soon.  15...Bc5+  16.Kh1  Nb4  All with tempo.  17.Qc1  Ne5 =  We have managed to get our pieces to good squares and can undermine the center by playing f5. There is also the possibility of getting a knight to d3. We can be satisfied about how the opening went.   7.a3  Ba5  I feel like taking on c3 does not really match with going b5, so I prefer to keep the bishop.  8.Bd3  For this move, two solutions can be chosen: either taking on c4 and exchange the light-squared bishops or castling short and taking on d5.   8.dxe6  This move has been seen a few times in practice. White's ideas are likely either Bf4 or cxb5. We will examine both.  8...Bxe6  9.Bf4   9.cxb5  d5  With typical counterplay: Black is threatening d4 for example. In one game White tried to break the pin.  10.Bd2  This happened in Gray - Horwitz @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@.  10...dxe4  N  11.fxe4  Although White's knight @@StartBracket@@the piece he typically struggles with in this variation@@EndBracket@@ can now we developed to f3, the unsafe king and semi-open e-file will give us a lot of chances.  11...O-O  12.Qc2  Nbd7  13.Nf3  c4  ⇆  This plan has been seen before as well. Now we can turn our attention to the e-file. If White develops his bishop from f1, we can go Qb6 to prevent 0-0. White can consider to castle queenside, but we can open files with a6 in that case and will definitely have a lot of fun attacking him! We might be down a pawn, but White will struggle a lot to defend correctly here.  O-O  is similar to 7...dxe6-lines, but with a2-a3 included.  10.Bxd6   10.Qxd6 ?!  Qc8  ∓  Speeding up Black's development. White is definitely in trouble here.   10.cxb5  d5  ∓  Here Black's play will also be too fast for White to handle, which was shown in a game from 2019. Lots of fun opportunities in this 4.f3 variation!  Nc6 !  was played in Auzins - Jankowiak @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@. Black has a lot of counterplay for offering the exchange, consisting of ideas to keep the king temporarily in the center and play on the dark squares.  11.Nge2  It is wise for White to try and develop, but now c4 is hanging.   11.Bxf8  N  Qxf8  ∓  And we have a ton of activity for the exchange, while White is still very passive.  11...Bxc4  12.Bxf8  Qxf8  13.Ng3  Rd8  We do not give White time to catch his breath: we have to keep up the pressure.  14.Qc1  Bxf1  15.Kxf1  The only option, as otherwise Ne5 would follow with deadly threats on d3.  15...Nd4  16.Qf4  Ne6  N  17.Qe3  Bb6  =+  We have made some very energetic moves and kept the pressure on. White has survived so far, but in a practical game I think it's much easier to play for Black.  8...O-O  Here we will see the other idea, of taking on d5. You can decide for yourself which one you like best.   8...bxc4  9.Bxc4  O-O  Please remember to play this first! Do not go Ba6 straight away, as taking on a6 and Qa4+ would be very unpleasant...  10.Nge2  Ba6  Following the first plan: trading the light-squared bishops.  11.Bxa6  Nxa6  12.O-O   12.Bg5  was played in Doren - Kevicky @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@.  12...exd5  13.O-O  White can take back, but first tries to provoke a mistake from our side.  13...Nc7  The only good move: since White had unpinned his knight with the last move, there was the threat of Nd5 @@StartBracket@@in case we played d4@@EndBracket@@ or Nxe4/fxe4 if we had captured on e4: in all cases leading to big troubles for our knight on f6. With Nc7, we solve all those problems and force White to take on d5 after all.  14.exd5  Rb8  15.Qc2  Re8 =  All our pieces have found reasonable squares and we can try to put some pressure on the d5-pawn by for example Re5.  c4 !?  Black aims to play for White's weakened squares.  9.Nge2  exd5  10.cxd5   10.exd5 ?!  bxc4  11.Bxc4  Nbd7  =+  Black's development will be fast, whereas White's pieces are not really coordinating.  a6 =  Black can comfortably develop his play further and will mostly focus on playing on the queenside.   7.Bd3  This is not played that often but it is established as a possible move over the last few years, and was played in a rapid game between Mamedyarov and So @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@. There is a line that has been discussed mostly in correspondence games involving trading two rooks for the queen, so it's good to know some details here.  7...O-O  We remain flexible and wait for White's intentions. It should be noted that there are now quite some games in this position, as it can transpose from 5. d5 0-0 6. e4 d6 7. Bd3 b5.  8.Nge2  This is the dominant choice by White and the one we should focus on. In practice, Black frequently takes on c4 and a long variation starts in which Black trades two rooks for a queen while getting compensation. In correspondence games, the games have all been drawn although White still needs to be precise. I'll give this option as well as 8... exd5 which is not as forcing.   8.dxe6  This is not a particularly good timing for this move: usually this is connected to attacking the pawn on d6, but that is not happening with a bishop on d3.  8...Bxe6  9.cxb5  a6 !?  I like this pawn sacrifice in the style of the Benko gambit. The goal is to get fast development and the initiative while White is still not fully mobilized.  10.bxa6  c4  11.Bc2  Bc5  =+  We can take back on a6 with the rook now and develop the knight to the active square c6. Although we are a pawn down @@StartBracket@@2 now even!@@EndBracket@@, we have so much activity to compensate for it! I hope you can agree that Black is definitely in good shape here.   8.Bd2  This is not White's strongest move, but still featured in 5 games, 2 of which were correspondence games.  8...exd5  9.Nxd5  What else? Taking with the c-pawn runs into c4 when Black is very fast compared to other lines, and taking with the e-pawn allows us to open even more files by taking on c4 when play is also very fast.  9...Nxd5  10.cxd5  Na6  N  Protecting our bishop in an original way, so we can play c4 again.  11.Bxb5  The obvious critical try.  11...f5  with the initiative for Black.   8.cxb5  It's always wise to check this move and know what to do. Luckily, we usually get a lot of active play!  8...exd5  9.exd5  a6  This was played by Smirnov against Brazdzionis in 2015.  10.Nge2   10.bxa6  Nbd7  Black is not in a rush to take back on a6, but instead prioritizes developing first.  11.Nge2  Qb6  Now White can't castle - we are definitely having the initiative here.  12.a3  Bxc3+  13.Nxc3  Re8+  ∓  White has difficulties and couldn't overcome them in the game.  Qb6  Black is slightly better, and shouldn't take material and play 11. a3 or 11.a4, when Black can continue with playing ...Nbd7 and ...Re8. In the game Touzane - Kiselev @@StartBracket@@1991@@EndBracket@@, White took on a6 and got punished badly.  11.bxa6   11.a4  Nbd7  12.Be3  Re8  =+  We can take on b5 whenever we want, and can also go Ne5 soon.  13.Bf2   11.a3  Bxc3+  12.bxc3  Taking back with the knight would just allow us to win time with Re8+, after which we can take on b5.  12...Nbd7  ⇆  And our usual developing moves will follow.  Nbd7  12.Bf4  Re8  13.Kf1  Ne5  14.Bb5  Bxa6  -+  8...exd5  This is also played and will keep more pieces on the board.   8...bxc4  The most popular option, but the lines here get very forced and may not be to everyone's taste.  9.Bxc4  exd5  10.Bxd5  Nxd5  11.Qxd5  Now our rook is trapped! However, we came prepared.  11...Be6  12.Qxa8   12.Qd1  White can retreat, but this is not so critical.  12...Bxc3+  Usually we wouldn't give up the bishop without good reason, but there is a concrete idea behind it: to go Qh4+ next.  13.Nxc3  Qh4+  14.g3  Qe7 =  We have managed to weaken White's structure and can now finish our development. The position is balanced.  Qb6  Now the queen is trapped on a8, but we're not done yet...  13.O-O  Nc6  14.Qxf8+   14.Nd5 ?!  was played in Happel - Van der Werf @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@.  14...Bxd5  15.Qxf8+  Kxf8  16.exd5  c4+  -+  with a winning position. White is helpless against the coming invasion of the knight.  Kxf8  First, let's take stock: White has two rooks, whereas we have a queen. This should usually be slightly in White's favour - however, that depends very much on the coordination of the pieces. In this case, White is still not fully developed and we will have some time to exploit that. We also have the bishop pair which can count for something. Let's look at some more moves to see how both sides could continue from here.  15.Nf4   15.Be3  Bc4  16.Rfe1  Ne5  =+  Our pieces are very active, and we can consider taking on c3 @@StartBracket@@or play Ba5@@EndBracket@@ to emphasise the vulnerability of the b2-pawn.  Bxc3  16.bxc3  Now we can try to attack the weak pawns. The following is just a sample line and is by no means forced.  16...Ne5  17.Rd1  h6  18.Be3  Qb2  19.Rab1  Qxc3  =+  We have won a pawn and can play Ke7 to defend the pawn on d6, when we have winning chances because of the strong passed pawn on c5. However, positions with unbalanced material are never easy to play for either side. So, if this is not for you - give 8...exd5 a shot!  9.cxd5  a6  We just keep our pawns protected for now, and can always push c4 later.  10.O-O  Nbd7  and Black equalized. In practice, the move 11.Ng3 has been mostly seen.  11.Ng3  c4  12.Bc2  Bc5+  13.Kh1  b4 =  We have our usual Ne5 jump and can push the pawns on the queenside even more, starting with playing a5. Black is definitely not worse here.   7.dxe6  This is the third popular move. White aims to capture the d6-pawn, but that comes with certain disadvantages.  7...Bxe6  8.Bf4   8.cxb5  d5  With similar play as in the line with 7.a3 Ba5 included.  8...O-O  We ignore the threat on our d6-pawn @@StartBracket@@which couldn't be defended anyway. White now has to answer an important question: to take or not to take? And if he goes for the former, does he take with the bishop or the queen? We will look at all of these options.  9.Qxd6   9.Bxd6  Re8  You hopefully remember that with a3 Ba5 included, we could play Nc6! here. However, this does not work in this case: White can take on b5 and on f8. Compared to the other lines, Black has Nd4 there when the b3-square is weakened! So then there are Bb3-Nc2+ tricks in the air. As this is not the case here, we just move our rook away. In practice, three moves have been seen now. Black gets enough compensation by putting pressure on the dark squares.  10.a3  was chosen in a game between Volkov - Kotsur, 2019.   10.cxb5  From this position, Black has good chances with either 10...Qb6 or the complicated 10...Nd5. I'll suggest them both.  10...Qb6  N  This is a less forcing alternative if you don't feel like playing the complex lines after 10... Nd5!?. Black aims to play a6 and open files on the queenside.   10...Nd5 !?  This has been played in correspondence chess. Careful: lots of complex stuff ahead!  11.exd5  White can also take right away, but this is a lot less complex.   11.Be5  was played in two games in correspondence chess. It requires a bit of study as the lines are forcing till a high depth.  11...Nd7  Now White really has to take on d5, as otherwise we can just take on c3.  12.exd5  Now the bishop can either go to f5, which looks normal, or to g4 which is very funky!  12...Bf5  This is the safer option. Black could seek good practical chances with the piece sacrifice 12... Bg4!?, which is objectively sound and White needs to find a lot of difficult moves. However, if you don't like being down material, 12... Bf5 might be your style as here we win material instead!   12...Bg4 !?  Black sacrifices a piece to prevent f3-f4 to take on e5 and leave the king in the middle. Some sample lines are:  13.fxg4  Nxe5  Now White has to be accurate or he can easily end up worse.  14.Be2   14.Kd2  White is trying to run into safety, but this leaves his pieces undeveloped.  14...a6  Opening up lines to attack the king on the queenside. Please don't take on d5, as after Kc2 there are no more checks and White will get some time to develop.  15.h3  What can White do? With this move he defends the pawn on g4, so he can go Nf3 next.  15...axb5  The bishop can't take back on b5, as then after Qxd5+ Qxg2 can follow.  16.Nf3  c4  Our typical move, taking control over some squares and getting more attacking power.  17.Be2  Nxf3+  18.Bxf3  Bxc3+  19.bxc3  b4  ∞  The white king is still not safe, but White has defended well. We probably don't have enough to mate, but a perpetual is definitely possible.   14.Nge2  This looks natural, but is a blunder! This illustrates how easy White can go astray here.  14...Qh4+  15.g3  Qf6  -+  Now that the f3-square is weakened, White is in big trouble.  Nxg4  Qf6 is again a threat now.  15.Qd2  White is now threatening to castle long, but we can prevent it!  15...Ne3  ∞  The position is unclear. White may be able to hold the balance, but in a practical game it will be hard for him to defend. We can open lines with c4 again and try to improve our pieces.  13.f4  The only move.  13...Nxe5  14.fxe5  Qh4+  15.g3  Qe4+  16.Kf2  Qxh1  The last moves were all forced. We have won some material but our queen can be trapped, so we have to be careful.  17.Nf3  Now two possible approaches seem sensible from this position: either to go into the endgame, or stay in the middlegame with 17... c4 and keep the pressure on.  17...Bg4 !?  Here we force White to play Bg2, and we exchange queens and go for the endgame. However, the ending is quite comlex and I would personally prefer to keep the queens on. Do look at it though if you are interested and love endgames! IN REFERENCE ONLY.   17...c4  Threatening Bc5+.  18.Qd4  Rac8  Protecting the pawn and renewing the threat.  19.Na4  h5  Now we are threatening Bg4. White has to respond to our threats all the time!  20.h3  Bxh3  21.Rd1  g5  If Black is not content with a draw at this point, it is fine to take on f1 with the bishop and play .. .Qh3. The game will still be unclear as White compensates with his pawn play and both sides need to be very precise. The text move was played in Pheby - Rawlings in 2019, and soon ended in perpetual check.  22.d6  g4  23.Qf4  gxf3 =  24.Qg5+  Kf8 =  Since White is down a lot of material, he will take the perpetual here. Don't go to the h-file though, as then the h5-pawn can be taken with check!  18.Bg2  Qxd1  19.Rxd1  White has some dangerous pawns here though, so we have to be careful.  19...a6 !?  Rooks need open files! So we try to open up a bit.  20.a4   20.b6  White wants to keep things closed, but now the pawn is lost.  20...Rab8  21.h3  Bxf3  22.Kxf3  White takes with the king, as otherwise the king could have been a bit vulnerable on f2 after c4 and Bc5+.  22...Rxb6  23.d6  Ba5  Trying to keep an eye on the d8-square already.  24.Nd5  Rxb2  25.Ne7+  Kf8  26.Nc6  Rxa2  27.d7  Rd8 =  And this is a very weird position which is objectively equal.  axb5  21.axb5  c4  22.d6  Rad8  23.Nd5   23.Rd5  Be6  24.Rd2  Bc5+  24.Kf1  Rxe5  25.Ne7+  Rxe7  26.dxe7  Rxd1+  27.Ke2  Bd7  28.Kxd1  Bxb5 =  is equal but the bishop pair in the endgame is still on the board.  11...Bf5+  12.Kf2   12.Nge2  was played in Stefan - Grove, 2017.  12...Qxd6  13.g4  What else?

Very similar to the line with a direct 10.e5.  12.Nge2  Playing for compensation by preparing Bf4 - d6 if Black takes on e5.  12...Ne8  ∓  We just ignore the pawn! e8 is the right square, as Nfd7 would have allowed Be7 when the bishop can transfer to d6. We can take on e5 later if we want, as there is no Bf4 anymore. Black converted his good position later on.   10.Qb3  was tried in the correspondence game Popov - Kaytazki @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@.  10...a6  The typical pawn sacrifice to open lines.  11.exd5  exd5  12.Nge2  In this case, Black has the very complicated 12...axb5 13.0-0-0 Nc6!, and the line will be in the reference-section. An easy solution that gives Black an advantage is to take on c3.  12...Bxc3+  The easy option.   12...axb5  N  It looks like Black will lose the d5-pawn after White castles long, but Black will have plenty of counterplay.  13.O-O-O  Nc6 !  We don't care about the d5-pawn but we do care about the counterplay we get after the pawn is captured.  14.Rxd5   14.Bxf6  Qxf6  15.Qxd5+  Kh8  16.Qd6  White wants to trade queens to convert his material advantage, but we obviously won't cooperate.  16...Be6  Developing a piece while preventing the exchange, but doesn't this leave our knight hanging?  17.Qxc6  Qh6+ !  Now the king can't move, as that would lead to a deadly discovered check.  18.f4  Bxc3  White can recapture in two different ways, but both leave him with a worse position.  19.bxc3   19.Nxc3  Rxf4  Now more discovered checks are coming.  20.Bxb5  Protecting the queen.  20...Rc8  21.Qxc8+  White has no choice: any other move would lose the queen as well to a discovered check.  21...Bxc8  ∓  Luckily, there is no back rank mate, as the rook can retreat to f8 with check! Black is definitely pushing here, although this position is by no means easy to convert.  Rxa2  20.Qxc5  Qf6  -+  Rc8 is coming, and White's king is very, very unhappy here.  Na5  A nice zwischenzug.  15.Qd1  Qe8  White is in big trouble: his rook has no good squares. If it goes to d2 or d6 for example, we already have Nc4.  16.Bxf6  gxf6  -+  Please don't take with the rook automatically, as that runs into Rd8. This works fine however. We can proceed our attack by playing Bb7 and Nc4, when White will struggle to defend.  13.Nxc3   13.Qxc3  Nbd7  ∓  We first protect c5 before taking back on b5.  Re8+  14.Be2  Be6  =+  And let's get those pawns rolling! Black is fine here.  Qc7 !  11.exf6  Qe5+  12.Nge2  Qxg5  13.fxg7  Qxg7  ∓  Black has strong counterplay in the center for the investment of just one pawn.   8.a3  Bxc3+  9.bxc3  h6  We throw this move in, in order to be able to solve the pin with g5 when we want to.  10.Bh4  Re8  Black can try to use the threat of opening the e-file to force White to change the pawn structure.  11.Be2  Qe7 =  We can take on d5 next and develop our queenside pieces with a healthy position.  8...exd5  9.exd5   9.cxd5  c4  =+  With active play.  bxc4  10.Bxc4  Nbd7  ∓  Following the aforementioned plan of playing Ne5, h6 and Ng6.   7.cxb5  White took away his support of the d5-pawn, so we can take there now. Black can use the open e-file while White is underdeveloped.  7...exd5  8.exd5  O-O  9.Bc4  Although this is the only move chosen in practice @@StartBracket@@perhaps White fears a future c5-c4 from our side?@@EndBracket@@, this is an unfortunate square for the bishop as you will soon see. In case of 9.Bd3, play transposes to 7.Bd3 & 8.cxb5 - see the game of Anton Smirnov where he played 9...a6.  9...Nh5  Now we see why the bishop is awkward on c4!  10.Kf1  was chosen by Herrera against Sanchez @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@. Black can play ...Nd7-b6 against 10.g3 as well, with a significant advantage.  10...Nd7  N  11.g3  Trying to get the king to a safe spot, but the position is already very bad for White.  11...a6  Let's open up those lines and diagonals!  12.Kg2   12.bxa6  Bxc3 !  13.bxc3  Qa5  ∓  And only now we will take back on a6, when we can recapture with the queen.  Nb6 ∓  And we can play our knight back to f6, pressuring the d5-pawn. }
7... bxc4 8. Nf4
{ The main move. White apparently does not seem bothered by e6-e5, or rather even provokes the move. Black can take on c3 first and then play ...e5. There's another rather unexplored possibility in 8.. .g5!?, and then take on d5. I will give both options here.   8.Ng3  This is seldomly played.  8...exd5  is a good option, although 8...Ba6N was interesting as well.  9.exd5  O-O  10.Bxc4  Re8+  Black is in good shape. In Vakulenko - Ben Ari @@StartBracket@@2020@@EndBracket@@, Black soon increased his advantage.  11.Kf2 ?!  Nbd7  All very natural developing moves from Black.  12.Re1  Ne5  N  Black has a promising position and can put pressure on the d5-pawn. }
8... Bxc3+
{ 8...g5 !?  is a very interesting alternative. Conquering the center from the flank, as Lipnitsky once wrote about!  9.Nfe2  exd5  10.exd5  Qe7  N  Pinning the knight and making it hard for White to develop.  11.Bxg5  What can be more natural than taking a pawn while developing the bishop? Well, it seems White experiences quite a bit of trouble after this move.   11.Kf2  Nbd7  ∞  For now, the bishop can't easily take on g5 as ...Ng4+ is in the air. Although objectively equal, it is clear that matters are far from clear.   11.Bd2  Nbd7  12.Qc2  White is trying to castle on the queenside.  12...Bxc3  The more fighting move: we don't want a draw yet, right?   12...Ne5  This is strongly heading towards a draw by repetition as Black can't allow the e-file to be opened if the rook comes to e1 after castling long.  13.O-O-O  Nd3+  14.Kb1  Nf2  15.Re1  15...Nd3 =  13.Bxc3  Nb6 =  The position is balanced but there is still a lot of play left here, and we can win the d5-pawn soon. If White castles long, we can castle short to get out of the dangerous e-file @@StartBracket@@and get the knight out of the pin@@EndBracket@@.  11...Bxc3+  12.bxc3  Nbd7  13.Qd2   13.Bxf6  Qxf6  ⇆  Rg8  %cal Gg8g5,Gd7e5,Ge5d3,Gd7b6,Gb6d5,Gc8b7  (White's position quickly became difficult to play. We are not even down material but can improve our knight and develop the bishop to b7.) }
9. bxc3 e5 { Now the center is closed, which leads to very different play. }
10. Ne2 Nbd7 11. Ng3 Nb6
{ The knight is just in time to protect the pawn on c4. } 12. Be2
{ Now in Tutisani - Santos Latasa @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@, Black played an interesting manoeuvre to place the f6-knight on a better square. }
12... Ng8 13. O-O
{ 13.h4  White is hinting that ...Ng6 will be met with h5 at the right moment.  13...f5  N  Another perk of moving the knight away: we can push our f-pawn to attack the center.  14.Nxf5   14.exf5  Ne7 =  and sooner or later a White pawn will drop.  15.Bg5  O-O  Bxf5  15.exf5  Ne7  %cal Ge7f5,Gb6d5,Ge7d5  (with good play against White's structure.) }
13... Ne7
{ and if 14.Bxc4 Nxc4 15. Qa4+ Bd7, Black has the traditionally good bishop in this structure still on the board. If White play 14.a4, Black just replies ...a5. Black is fine. }

{ This is fundamentally different from any other variation we have examined so far, so I would like to start this chapter by giving a @@StartBracket@@short@@EndBracket@@ overview of the typical ideas in this variation for both sides.   With f3, White is obviously aiming to play e4 and get a strong center. The downside is that the development of his kingside pieces is a bit delayed by this operation. Therefore, Black should aim to develop quickly and try to grab the initiative, to compensate for White's strong central control. Let's look at the first moves of this variation. }
4... c5
{ This is the move that is most suitable for playing dynamically with Black.   I did consider  4...O-O!?  though, having the variation  5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nh5  in mind.

Therefore, I decided on playing 4... c5 with the idea of a quick ...b5. }
5. d5
{ This is the main move. White gains space and tries to consolidate the center similar to positions from the Benoni defense, although the bishop is now on b4 influencing the center. Black typically uses the strength of the queenside pawns by playing ...a6 and ...b5, although ...b5 in one move is what we aim for.   Also, after playing f2-f3, Black can control White's expansion in the center with f4 and e5 by playing ...Nh5 @@StartBracket@@f2-f3 blinded the queen of the h5-square@@EndBracket@@ and play ...Qh4+ or ...f5.   5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  This is also an option for White, giving the position a Sämisch-like character. The typical idea of attacking the c4-pawn will also be seen here. }
5... d6 6. e4 b5
{ This is my suggestion for this repertoire. As you will soon see, I have analysed a lot of different moves for White in this position. To make this less overwhelming, I will be summarizing the main ideas that arise here.   - White can play Bf4 and take on e6, and try to win the pawn on d6. We do not have to fear this and can just ignore the threat. As White loses valuable time by going after this pawn, we will get a lot of activity to compensate for the pawn deficit. Often, we immediately get the pawn back as we can win the pawn on c4, since that one is also under attack after dxe6 ...Bxe6.   - Black will often take on d5, castle quickly and play ...Re8, trying to put pressure on the e-file.   - Once we have taken on d5 and White has replied cxd5, we can push our pawn to c4 and get a knight @@StartBracket@@or sometimes even the bishop@@EndBracket@@ to c5.   - To put pressure on the e4-pawn, we would like to play ...f5. This will often be achieved by either ...Nh5 or ...Nfd7.   - We should not fear White taking on b5. We can play ...a6 and open files and diagonals for our pieces, when we have more than enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn.   - A knight jump to e5 is also very common. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ This is a very topical and aggressive variation you can definitely expect to face on a regular basis as it has been recommended in a few recent sources and has been played even in World Championships.   I would love to state the official name of the variation, but it seems like there is some debate on this topic, either calling it the Kmoch, Georghiu or Shirov variation.   White is building up rather aggressively in the center, but delaying its development a bit which may backfire badly. However, if White can stabilize his center he will be better in the long run. So, quick action from our side is required! }
4... c5
{ This is the move that is most suitable for playing dynamically with Black.   I did consider  4...O-O!?  though, having the variation  5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nh5  in mind. However, if White is precise, Black can end up being worse @@StartBracket@@the lines given by Daniel Barrish in part 2 of his 1.d4 courses here on Chessable were quite unpleasant for Black for example@@EndBracket@@. Therefore, I decided on playing 4... c5 with the idea of a quick ...b5. }
5. a3
{ This is the second most popular move, which is actually a Sämisch variation with the moves f3 c5 included and therefore White's flexibility is reduced a bit. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Nc6
{ We usually respond to the Sämisch with 5... b6, so unfortunately we do not transpose. However, the moves ...Nc6-Na5 and ...b6 followed by ...Ba6 to attack the c4-pawn will also feature in those lines, making them a bit similar after all. }
7. e4
{ The critical move as White is statically worse and has to compensate with active, dynamic play.   7.d5  It is probably a bit too much to play both a2-a3 and d4-d5 at such an early stage.  7...Na5  Of course we do not capture as it would only improve White's structure.  8.e4  d6  We play in the same style as against the other moves. This transposes to the variation 7. e4 d6 8. d5 Na5.  See here. }
7... d6
{ This is a typical move in these structures. We prevent e5 and remain flexible for now, waiting for White to decide on a direction. White has typically chosen 8. Be3 as the main move, followed by 8. Ne2, 8. d5, 8. Bg5 and 8. Nh3 as more occasional moves. }
8. d5
{ White voluntarily closes the center, but this is not to be recommended. }
8... Na5 9. Bg5 b6 10. Bd3 h6 11. Bh4 g5 { Again this advance! } 12. Bg3
{ 12.Bf2  is just similar. } 12... Nh5 13. Ne2 e5

It seems interesting to play either 7... Bxc3 as a more quiet option, compared to the more dynamic and unexplored 7... exd5 of Rapport which will be the main option. As this is very topical, I will present you both moves so you can choose for yourself and mix it up in your games, making it harder for your opponents to prepare. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ This is a very topical and aggressive variation you can definitely expect to face on a regular basis as it has been recommended in a few recent sources and has been played even in World Championships.   I would love to state the official name of the variation, but it seems like there is some debate on this topic, either calling it the Kmoch, Georghiu or Shirov variation.   White is building up rather aggressively in the center, but delaying its development a bit which may backfire badly. However, if White can stabilize his center he will be better in the long run. So, quick action from our side is required! }
4... c5
{ This is the move that is most suitable for playing dynamically with Black.   I did consider  4...O-O!?  though, having the variation  5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nh5  in mind. However, if White is precise, Black can end up being worse @@StartBracket@@the lines given by Daniel Barrish in part 2 of his 1.d4 courses here on Chessable were quite unpleasant for Black for example@@EndBracket@@. Therefore, I decided on playing 4... c5 with the idea of a quick ...b5. }
5. d5
{ White gains space and tries to consolidate the center. However, from now on he has to keep an eye on possible flank attacks that will undermine his center.   Besides 5. a3, there are no real alternatives for White on this move, as we can just answer other moves by taking on d4. }
5... d6
{ A useful move as White will soon play e4 and positionally threatens e4-e5.   I have always been very intrigued by the line  5...b5  6.e4  O-O  where Black not only allows but almost encourages White to advance the e-pawn in order to attack the pawns later. However, I feel that this line was covered in quite a lot of repertoire suggestions already, and frankly I think the line I'm recommending is even more interesting as it is of a less forcing nature and invites to more creative play. }
6. e4 b5
{ Although playing with ...b5 has been frequently seen on the fifth move, delaying it for one move has been rising in popularity over the last few years. It is quite logical: White is building up a strong center, so we need to undermine it.   I will be covering a lot of moves for White here, but don't panic: I won't ask you to memorize all of it, a lot will just be available as reference material if you want to study it more deeply, or on a specific occasion if you expect your opponent to play a certain line. }
7. Bd2
{ Resolving the pin has been a trending move in the last few years. It was even featured in a game between Aronian and Carlsen at the important Fide Grand Swiss tournament on Isle of Man last year. It is also the move recommended for White by Daniel Barrish in his repertoire here on Chessable, as well as the main recommendation by Sopiko Guramishvili on Chess24 - so definitely a move we should take seriously!   It seems interesting to play either 7... Bxc3 as a more quiet option, compared to the more dynamic and unexplored 7... exd5 of Rapport which will be the main option. As this is very topical, I will present you both moves so you can choose for yourself and mix it up in your games, making it harder for your opponents to prepare. }
7... Bxc3
{ This move has been rising in popularity since last year. In October 2019, it was featured twice in the FIDE Grand Swiss tournament. First in Fedoseev-Wojtaszek, and a few days later in the top duel between Aronian and Carlsen! We will largely follow the moves that Magnus played. }
8. Bxc3 b4
{ This was the idea behind taking on c3: we lose our dark-squared bishop, but control the dark squares with our pawns. }
9. Bd2 O-O 10. Be3
{ A multi-purpose move, White shields the e-file and can play ...g4 against ...Nh5 as the check on h4+ is parried by Bf2.   10.Ne2  exd5  11.cxd5  Nh5=  This is an illustration of how Black can control White's expansion. The knight move to h5 helps Black with either ...Qh4+ or ...f5. }
10... exd5 11. cxd5 Nfd7
{ This was Carlsen's choice against Aronian, a novelty at the time. 2 other strong grandmasters, Alekseenko and Smirnov, have played it as well. The idea is to play ...f5 to prevent White from expanding in the center, and the knight may go to the e5-square. }
12. Ne2 f5 13. exf5
{ Aronian's move. White aims to win some time with attacking the rook, giving him a chance to complete his development. It does break up White's powerful center though and gives us chances to exploit the opened e-file. }
13... Rxf5 14. Ng3 Re5 { Immediately using the e-file. } 15. Kf2 Qf6
{ Here, Carlsen went for  15...Qh4  which was brave but slightly inaccurate.  Instead, I propose to put the queen on the f-file  @@StartBracket@@it has to be said that 15... Qf8 works in the same way, but I find going to f6 more natural@@EndBracket@@. Black will play against the weakened d5-pawn with ...Qf7 on the cards, and the minor pieces can target it as well. }
16. Qd2 { Supporting the bishop. } 16... Qf7 17. Bc4 Ba6
{ Trying to eliminate a defender of the d5-pawn. } 18. Bb3 Re8
{ Since the pawn on d5 is firmly supported, we move our rook away so the knight can go to e5. This is a very good square for the knight as from there, it can assist attacks on both sides of the board. }
19. Rhe1 Ne5
{ If it wasn't for the previous move, Black would now be threatening to win a piece with ...Ng4+. We are threatening ...Nd3+ though. }
20. Bc2 Nbd7
{ The knight can go to c4, when our other knight can go to e5 or perhaps b6 to attack d5. I think Black is fine here. }

It is quite logical: White is building up a strong center, so we need to undermine it.   I will be covering a lot of moves for White here, but don't panic: I won't ask you to memorize all of it, a lot will just be available as reference material if you want to study it more deeply, or on a specific occasion if you expect your opponent to play a certain line. }
7. Bd2
{ Resolving the pin has been a trending move in the last few years. It was even featured in a game between Aronian and Carlsen at the important Fide Grand Swiss tournament on Isle of Man last year. It is also the move recommended for White by Daniel Barrish in his repertoire here on Chessable, as well as the main recommendation by Sopiko Guramishvili on Chess24 - so definitely a move we should take seriously!   It seems interesting to play either 7... Bxc3 as a more quiet option, compared to the more dynamic and unexplored 7... exd5 of Rapport which will be the main option. As this is very topical, I will present you both moves so you can choose for yourself and mix it up in your games, making it harder for your opponents to prepare. }

Although my colleague Tobias did win this game, he missed a chance to play a strong move here:  12...Nh5−+  Black simply plans ...f5, and White faces difficulties to meet it. It doesn't help him that ...Qh4+ is also in the air sometimes. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black's development is very harmonious, whereas White's pieces are still on the first rank. Definitely not a good outcome of the opening for our opponent! }
13. Nd2 b3

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ This is a very topical and aggressive variation you can definitely expect to face on a regular basis as it has been recommended in a few recent sources and has been played even in World Championships.   I would love to state the official name of the variation, but it seems like there is some debate on this topic, either calling it the Kmoch, Georghiu or Shirov variation.   White is building up rather aggressively in the center, but delaying its development a bit which may backfire badly. However, if White can stabilize his center he will be better in the long run. So, quick action from our side is required! }
4... c5
{ This is the move that is most suitable for playing dynamically with Black.   I did consider  4...O-O!?  though, having the variation  5.a3  Bxc3+  6.bxc3  Nh5  in mind. However, if White is precise, Black can end up being worse @@StartBracket@@the lines given by Daniel Barrish in part 2 of his 1.d4 courses here on Chessable were quite unpleasant for Black for example@@EndBracket@@. Therefore, I decided on playing 4... c5 with the idea of a quick ...b5. }
5. d5
{ White gains space and tries to consolidate the center. However, from now on he has to keep an eye on possible flank attacks that will undermine his center.   Besides 5. a3, there are no real alternatives for White on this move, as we can just answer other moves by taking on d4. }
5... d6
{ A useful move as White will soon play e4 and positionally threatens e4-e5.   I have always been very intrigued by the line  5...b5  6.e4  O-O  where Black not only allows but almost encourages White to advance the e-pawn in order to attack the pawns later. However, I feel that this line was covered in quite a lot of repertoire suggestions already, and frankly I think the line I'm recommending is even more interesting as it is of a less forcing nature and invites to more creative play. }
6. e4 b5
{ Although playing with ...b5 has been frequently seen on the fifth move, delaying it for one move has been rising in popularity over the last few years. It is quite logical: White is building up a strong center, so we need to undermine it.   I will be covering a lot of moves for White here, but don't panic: I won't ask you to memorize all of it, a lot will just be available as reference material if you want to study it more deeply, or on a specific occasion if you expect your opponent to play a certain line. }
7. Bd2
{ Resolving the pin has been a trending move in the last few years. It was even featured in a game between Aronian and Carlsen at the important Fide Grand Swiss tournament on Isle of Man last year. It is also the move recommended for White by Daniel Barrish in his repertoire here on Chessable, as well as the main recommendation by Sopiko Guramishvili on Chess24 - so definitely a move we should take seriously!   It seems interesting to play either 7... Bxc3 as a more quiet option, compared to the more dynamic and unexplored 7... exd5 of Rapport which will be the main option. As this is very topical, I will present you both moves so you can choose for yourself and mix it up in your games, making it harder for your opponents to prepare. }
7... exd5

White can consider to castle queenside, but we can open files with a6 in that case and will definitely have a lot of fun attacking him! We might be down a pawn, but White will struggle a lot to defend correctly here. }

{ White gains space and tries to consolidate the center. However, from now on he has to keep an eye on possible flank attacks that will undermine his center.   Besides 5. a3, there are no real alternatives for White on this move, as we can just answer other moves by taking on d4. }
5... d6
{ A useful move as White will soon play e4 and positionally threatens e4-e5.   I have always been very intrigued by the line  5...b5  6.e4  O-O  where Black not only allows but almost encourages White to advance the e-pawn in order to attack the pawns later. However, I feel that this line was covered in quite a lot of repertoire suggestions already, and frankly I think the line I'm recommending is even more interesting as it is of a less forcing nature and invites to more creative play. }
6. e4 b5
{ Although playing with ...b5 has been frequently seen on the fifth move, delaying it for one move has been rising in popularity over the last few years. It is quite logical: White is building up a strong center, so we need to undermine it.   I will be covering a lot of moves for White here, but don't panic: I won't ask you to memorize all of it, a lot will just be available as reference material if you want to study it more deeply, or on a specific occasion if you expect your opponent to play a certain line. }

9. Bxd6 Re8
{ You hopefully remember that with a3 Ba5 included, we could play ...Nc6! here. However, this does not work in this case: White can take on b5 and on f8. Compared to the other lines, Black has ...Nd4 there when the b3-square is weakened! So then there are ...Bb3-Nc2+ tricks in the air. As this is not the case here, we just move our rook away.   In practice, three moves have been seen now. Black gets enough compensation by putting pressure on the dark squares. }
10. cxb5
{ From this position, Black has good chances with either 10... Qb6 or the complicated 10... Nd5. I'll cover them both, although my main recommendation will be 10... Nd5 because I find the positions there so fascinating! However, if you prefer to keep things a little less complicated, 10... Qb6 is the move for you. }

11. Be5

12. exd5
{ Now the bishop can either go to f5, which looks normal, or to g4 which is very funky! }
12... Bg4
{ Black sacrifices a piece to prevent f3-f4 to take on e5 and leave the king in the middle. Some sample lines are: }
13. fxg4 Nxe5 { Now White has to be accurate or he can easily end up worse. }
14. Kd2
{ White is trying to run into safety, but this leaves his pieces undeveloped. }
14... a6
{ Opening up lines to attack the king on the queenside. Please don't take on d5, as after Kc2 there are no more checks and White will get some time to develop. }
15. h3
{ What can White do? With this move he defends the pawn on g4, so he can go Nf3 next. }
15... axb5
{ The bishop can't take back on b5, as then after Qxd5+ Qxg2 can follow. } 16.
Nf3 c4
{ Our typical move, taking control over some squares and getting more attacking power. }
17. Be2 Nxf3+ 18. Bxf3 Bxc3+ 19. bxc3 b4

5. d5
{ White gains space and tries to consolidate the center. However, from now on he has to keep an eye on possible flank attacks that will undermine his center.   Besides 5. a3, there are no real alternatives for White on this move, as we can just answer other moves by taking on d4. }
5... d6
{ A useful move as White will soon play e4 and positionally threatens e4-e5.   I have always been very intrigued by the line  5...b5  6.e4  O-O  where Black not only allows but almost encourages White to advance the e-pawn in order to attack the pawns later. However, I feel that this line was covered in quite a lot of repertoire suggestions already, and frankly I think the line I'm recommending is even more interesting as it is of a less forcing nature and invites to more creative play. }
6. e4 b5
{ Although playing with ...b5 has been frequently seen on the fifth move, delaying it for one move has been rising in popularity over the last few years. It is quite logical: White is building up a strong center, so we need to undermine it.   I will be covering a lot of moves for White here, but don't panic: I won't ask you to memorize all of it, a lot will just be available as reference material if you want to study it more deeply, or on a specific occasion if you expect your opponent to play a certain line. }
7. Ne2
{ This has been White's most popular move, in shared place with 7. Bd2. He tries to develop as fast as possible, but does leave the c4-pawn hanging in the progress. }
7... bxc4 8. Nf4
{ The main move. White apparently does not seem bothered by e6-e5, or rather even provokes the move. Black can take on c3 first and then play ...e5. There's another rather unexplored possibility in 8... g5!?, and then take on d5. I will give both options here. }
8... Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 e5
{ Now the center is closed, which leads to very different play. } 10. Ne2 Nbd7
11. Ng3 Nb6 { The knight is just in time to protect the pawn on c4. } 12. Be2
{ Now in Tutisani - Santos Latasa  @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@, Black played an interesting manoeuvre to place the f6-knight on a better square. }
12... Ng8 13. O-O Ne7
{ And if  14.Bxc4  Nxc4  15.Qa4+  Bd7  , Black has the traditionally good bishop in this structure still on the board.   If White plays  14.a4  , Black just replies  14...a5.  Black is fine. }

He's also known for being on the receiving end of the Immortal Zugzwang Game @@StartBracket@@If you have no clue what game I'm talking about, please google it right now - you won't be disappointed@@EndBracket@@.

For a more detailed description of the strategical ideas, you can read the General Considerations in the Introduction chapter. }
4... Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 b6
{ Black aims to use the b8-knight and c8-bishop to pressure the c4-pawn. The following moves are aimed to prevent White from making too much progress in the center with his mobile e and f pawn, while Black prepares to attack the queenside. With this in mind, White has played the most frequent in descending order: 6.f3, 6.Bg5, 6.Nf3 6. e3, 6.Qc2 and 6.e4. }
6. f3
{ This logical move to prepare e2-e4 is the most common move.   6.Nf3  Bb7  7.Bg5  is very similar to 6.Bg5. Black is not afraid to use ...h6 and ...g5 to get the knight to the e4-square and develop the remaining pieces before castling long.   7.e3  is reminiscent of the 4.e3 followed up by Nf3-variations, and it is bound to transpose to lines where White plays a2-a3 there.  7...Ne4  We just play our normal moves.  8.Qc2  Or 8. Bd3: in almost all cases White follows up with Qc2 at some point.  8...f5  9.Bd3  Black would play the same moves against 9.Be2.  9...O-O  10.O-O  c5  This position is familiar as it transposes to 4.e3; 5. Bd3; 6.Nf3 & 8.a3.  7...h6  8.Bh4  g5  9.Bg3  Ne4  10.Qc2  f5  Black sets up his familiar aggressive pawn structure.  11.e3  d6  12.Nd2  Trying to make room for f2-f3.   12.Bd3  Nd7  13.O-O  Qf6  =+  With 0-0-0 to follow. I can imagine a lot of white players will feel uncomfortable at this point.  12...h5  An extremely simple, yet effective idea: we try to trap the bishop on g3.  13.f3  Nxd2  =+  This is very important: a lot of people might be tempted to take on g3 instead of d2. Please don't do that! It might look strong, but White is actually happy to get the doubled g-pawn and get rid of the bishop, as it's not doing anything. Instead, by capturing on d2, we can play h4 next and doom the bishop to passivity. After that, we can play our usual moves to prepare castling on the queenside and enjoy a nice position.   6.Bg5  As we have seen before, Black can often use this placement of the bishop to get in ...h6 and ...g5 so that the knight can jump to the e4-square. It's even stronger in this case, as we have not castled yet and can still go to the queenside instead.  6...h6  7.Bh4  g5  8.Bg3  Ne4  9.Qc2  Bb7  10.e3  d6  Black can play for ...Nbd7, ...Qe7 and castling long as we have also seen before in the 6.Nf3-lines.   6.e3  Bb7  7.f3  Trying to block our strong bishop on b7. However, it makes slightly more sense to go 6.f3 if this is what White wants.   7.Nf3  Ne4  8.Qc2  f5  9.Bd3  c5  10.O-O  O-O  Transposes to 6.Nf3, which refers to a transposition itself. This means you should be very familiar with this position by now!  7...Nc6  8.Bd3  Na5  Black prepares the attack on c4 by ...Ba6, ... c5 - to prevent it from coming forward and open the c-file by cxd4 - ...Rc8, and even ...d6 so that the f6-knight can join the action by ...Nd7. This set-up was played in a game of Dimitrov - Mekhitarian @@StartBracket@@2013@@EndBracket@@.  9.e4   9.Ne2  Ba6  10.O-O  White already has nothing better than giving up the pawn! A clear sign something has gone wrong.  10...Bxc4  =+  Ba6  10.Qe2   10.e5  Ng8  The only square, but going backwards is not bad: we can just play our knight to e7 where it will be nicely placed.  11.Qe2  c4 is protected for now, but we have a nice way to seize the initiative here:  11...d5 !  As has been played several times already. Black opens up the position which is favourable here.  12.cxd5  Bxd3  13.Qxd3  Qxd5  =+  Our queen is very centrally placed and active now. We will play Ne7 next and probably Qc4. Trading queens might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it is actually very logical: given White's bad dark-squared bishop, any endgame is good for us.It also gives us the opportunity to play our knight from e7 to d5. White will struggle to get control over the light squares.  c5  With White's pawn still on e4, we prefer to just block the weak pawn on c4.  11.Be3  d6  Just stabilizing the pawn on c5.  12.Nh3  cxd4  Here we see the other idea behind c5: we open up the c-file so our rook can put pressure on c4.  13.cxd4  Rc8  It will be very interesting to play Nd7 and prepare e5: when White goes d5 after that, the pawn on c4 will be even weaker and we get the c5-square too. Objectively it's probably equal, but I prefer Black here.   6.e4  Effectively trades the e4-pawn for the g7-pawn, and promises White a small disadvantage.  6...Nxe4  7.Qg4  f5  8.Qxg7  Qf6  Black exchanges queens and enjoys having an extra pawn in the center for a flank pawn.   6.Qc2  Normally White plays the queen to c2 earlier in order to take back on c3 with the queen, but now White uses it to prepare for e2-e4. This setup doesn't bother Black.  6...Bb7  7.Bg5  Pinning the knight to reduce Black's play in the center can be met by our familiar recipe of removing the pin.   7.f3  Nc6  8.e4  d6  9.Bd3  Na5  with similar play as in the main line. Black prepares ...Ba6 and ...Qd7.   7.Nf3  is played with the idea of Nd2, but it all rather costs White a bit of time.  7...d6  8.Bg5   8.e3  O-O  9.Bd3  Re8  10.e4  e5  Black is slightly for choice as his structure is better.  Nbd7  9.e3  h6  10.Bh4  g5  11.Bg3  Ne4  =+  7...h6  8.Bh4  g5  9.Bg3  d6  =+  Black moves the queen to e7, castles long and places the b8-knight on either d7 or c6.   6.Bf4  Transposes to 4.Bf4. }
6... Nc6 7. e4 { White threatens e4-e5 now. } 7... d6
{ Protecting the knight against e4-e5 and making room for the queen in some cases. }
8. Bd3
{ Natural development and White protects the e4-pawn in case he wants to go with the plan of pushing the f4-pawn forward.   8.Bg5  Na5  9.Bd3  White has nothing better than just transposing to the main line. }
8... Na5
{ This line has been played by Aronian @@StartBracket@@twice!@@EndBracket@@. Our plan is the same as before: to put pressure on the c4-pawn. White has typically played 9.Bg5, 9.f4 and 9. Nh3 in practice. }
9. Bg5
{ 9.Nh3  Ba6  10.Qe2  If 10. Bg5 or 10. Nf2, Black can play ...Qd7 with a similar plan of attacking the c4-pawn as in the text move.  10...e5  11.Be3  This was played in Carlsen - Aronian @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@ in a blitz game, where Black showed impressive harmony of the pieces against White's pawn structure.   11.Rb1  c5  12.O-O   12.d5  Closing the position only makes the c4-pawn weaker.  12...Qd7 =  With the surprising idea of attacking the pawn with Qa4!  cxd4  13.cxd4  Nd7 =  The position is equal, but there is plenty left to play for.  11...Qd7  12.a4  This move makes a lot of sense: it prevents Qa4, which was potentially very annoying for White.  12...Qc6  Another way of attacking c4, and provoking the d5-pawn forward.  13.d5  Qd7  We have achieved our aim. Now we can take over the c5-square.  14.O-O  Qe7 !  15.Nf2  Nd7  16.Rab1  O-O  17.g4  As Black is clearly ruling the queenside, White has to try something on the kingside. However, he is shooting in thin air.  17...Rac8  18.Nh1  Some very original regrouping that I just wanted to show you.  18...c6  or 18...Nc5 makes a good impression.  19.Ng3  White has put a lot of effort into this, but we kill his idea of Nf5 with one simple move...  19...g6  =+  White still struggles to make progress on the kingside while we are definitely making some on the queenside.   9.f4  This is the idea that was prepared by Bd3.  9...Bb7  10.Qe2  It would be a little slow now to attack the c4-pawn as e4-e5 is on the cards, but Black can first reduce the strength of White's attack by exchanging the knight on a5 for the bishop on c1 that has strong potential over the dark squares. For example, after Black plays ...e5 White could play fxe5 and Bg5, so it's good to prevent that first.  10...Nb3  11.Rb1  Nxc1  12.Rxc1  e5  Now it is safe to play this.  13.fxe5  dxe5  14.Nf3  Nd7  Black has equalized. In two games White still wanted to impose the pawn structure.  15.c5  O-O  16.O-O  bxc5  17.Rb1   17.dxe5  Qe7  =+  We get the pawn on e5 back and although neither side has a particularly pretty pawn structure, our bishop is better and we should have good chances.  18.Rb1  Rab8  19.Rb2  Bc6  Was good for Black in the game of Umetsubo - Pichot @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@.  Bc8  Black is fine. We now prepare to put our bishop on e6 instead. }
9... Qd7
{ The queen steps out of the pin and can later go to the c6 or a4-square to put pressure on the c4-pawn. We are not worried about White taking on f6, as it just weakens his dark squares and our king will be safe in the middle. }
10. a4
{ Preventing Black's ... Qa4 move.   10.e5  The push of e4-e5 is a bit early.  10...dxe5  11.dxe5  Ng8  =+  Black has a healthier structure and is playing for ...h6 next and ...Ne7. From then on, ideas of ...g5 can become of interest as well.   10.Rb1  Ba6  11.Qe2  c5  12.Nh3  Qa4  All moves we have seen before.  13.d5  This happened between Dabija - Voveris @@StartBracket@@2015@@EndBracket@@.  13...Bxc4  14.O-O  O-O-O  N  with a dynamic position. Black will think about playing ...exd5. }
10... Ba6 11. Qe2 O-O-O 12. Nh3 Qc6
{ This seems to allow e4-e5 but White is actually better off without it. Either way, the pawn on c4 will be lost and Black is doing great. Just for fun, let's look at the refutation of e5! }
13. e5 dxe5 14. dxe5 Rxd3
{ A spectacular move that gives us a winning advantage. } 15. Qxd3 Bxc4
{ Black has an overwhelming attack for the exchange as the pieces are joining in while White can't easily castle. }

Trading queens might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it is actually very logical: given White's bad dark-squared bishop, any endgame is good for us.  It also gives us the opportunity to play our knight from e7 to d5. White will struggle to get control over the light squares. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd2
{ This looks like a harmless move, but it has come up as a serious weapon over the last few years, and has recently been recommended by Shyam. Luckily, the main line transposes to the repertoire against 4.e3, thereby reducing the amount of theory by a large part. In this chapter, all the important lines remaining before that transposition are covered. }
4... O-O
{ White has typically played 5.Nf3, followed by 5.e3, 5.a3, 5.Qc2 and 5.g3 in descending order of frequency. }
5. Nf3
{ 5.e3  This position could of course also arise from 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd2. This variation was also recommended as a back-up weapon for White in Daniel Barrish's course on Chessable.  5...b6  If White lets us, we will try to make the same moves as we would normally do against the 4.e3 line and try to transpose to 4.e3 with 8.Bd2. So, starting with ...b6 is very natural.  6.Nf3   6.Bd3  Bb7  7.f3  This move has been seen in practice as coming second in popularity after 7.Nf3. That move is familar to us as it transposes to the main line after 7...c5. Obviously White is trying to prepare e4 here, so we should immediately counter in the center.  7...c5  In practice, White has either mostly played 8.Nge2 and 8.a3.  8.Nge2  White can choose not to play a3, but we respond in the same fashion.   8.a3  This gives Black the opportunity to play similar as against 8.a3 in the main line, although this is a better version for Black since the pawn on f3 rather disturbs White's natural development in that position.  8...Bxc3  9.Bxc3  cxd4  10.exd4  d5  Creating that isolani for White again - a recurring theme in lines with e3.  11.b3  White does not want an isolani, and instead aims for a hanging pawn structure after 11...dxc4 12. bxc4. Although this is a decent option, we can also just avoid it and do something better!  11...a5 !  This typical thrust to break up White's pawn formation is familiar from 8.a3 lines.  12.Ne2  a4  13.Bb4  This was played in Struzka - Dedina @@StartBracket@@2015@@EndBracket@@, although there is not much difference with taking on a4 directly.  13...Re8  14.bxa4  White is temporarily a pawn up now, but the a-pawns can't exactly call as assets here.  14...dxc4  15.Bxc4  Nd5  Black is fine as he blockaded the isolani, and proceeds to activate the remaining pieces and pick up the pawn on a4 at some point. In the game White played 16.Qd2, after which 16...Qh4+ 17.g3 Qf6 gave Black even slightly better prospects, and eventually won.  8...Nc6  First putting on additional pressure on the center, before taking on d4 and releasing the tension. If we take on d4 right away, White could recapture with the knight and we don't get to create the isolani.  9.O-O  cxd4  10.exd4  d5  11.cxd5  Nxd5  This is all familiar without a pawn on f3 - however, that is only to our advantage.  12.Nxd5  Bxd2  This is strongest. As you may remember from the strategical ideas in isolani positions: when playing against an isolani, you want to exchange minor pieces that could defend the pawn @@StartBracket@@and consider to leave heavy pieces on the board@@EndBracket@@. So, exchanging of these bishops makes sense, as otherwise White can play Be3 and protect the pawn.  13.Qxd2  Qxd5  Black is for choice as White does not have sufficient activity to compensate for the isolated pawn.  Bb7  Could arise from transposition via 4. Nf3 b6 5.e3 Bb7 6.Bd2.  7.Bd3  c5  Transposes to the main line.   5.Qc2  This could have arisen from 4.Qc2. Since we often play with b6 and d6 in such lines, we can try to transpose here.  5...b6  6.e4  This is slightly different as White refuses to put a knight on f3.   6.Nf3  d6  And we already have a transposition to 4. Qc2 & 5.Nf3.   6.e3  This is some sort of strange hybrid of Qc2, e3 and Bd2. Naturally, this should not be too worrying and we will soon return to positions we have seen before.  6...Bb7  7.Nf3  d6  8.Bd3  c5  Transposes to 4.Qc2; 5.Nf3 & 7.e3.  6...c5  7.a3  After 7.Nf3 d6, we would transpose to 4.Qc2 & 5.Nf3-lines, so delaying Nf3 is the only independent try here. However, this will come with certain risks as we will soon see...  7...Bxc3  8.bxc3  White could of course also recapture with the bishop, but then we will attack the center fast with 8...Bb7 followed by 9... d5.  8...Bb7  9.Bd3  If 9.e5N, then 9...Ne4 and Black can support the knight with ...f5.  9...b5 !  A fun way of undermining the center.  10.f3  The only way of protecting e4.   10.Qb1  White is trying to pin and trick us in return, but of course we were prepared for this.  10...bxc4  Wait, doesn't this lose material?  11.Qxb7  cxd3  We just let the rook on a8 hang, but the pawn on d3 will prove very strong. If White doesn't take the rook we are just a pawn up, so he has to.  12.Qxa8  Qb6  -+  And the queen will be trapped next, with Nc6. But more importantly: Qb2 is coming and White's defense is crumbling.   10.cxb5 ?  c4 !  This is the point behind the pawn sacrifice.  11.Bxc4 ??  White's best move is probably 11.Bf1, but then we can also take on e4 with the bishop and play d5 afterwards, with a superior position.  11...Bxe4  And we can take on g2 next, winning the rook!  10...bxc4  11.Bxc4  d5  ∓  Opening up the position is to our advantage, since White's king is still in the middle. White is regretting not having played Nf3 earlier and is in serious trouble.   5.a3  Bxc3  6.Bxc3  b6  7.Nf3  White either plays this move or 7.e3.   7.e3  Bb7  8.Nf3  Ne4  Transposition to 7.a3 in this chapter.  7...Ne4  Transposes to 6.a3 in this chapter.   5.g3  Since White has played Bd2 already, we can't take on c3 and damage White's structure here as we would play against 4.g3. We also have no time to play ... b6. So, we play 5...d5 instead and limit White's bishop. Don't worry though, there won't be a lot of extra theory, since combining g3 and Bd2 is quite rare.  5...d5  Now we are already threatening to take on c4 and then on d4: this is why Bd2 is unfortunate in these g3 lines. White has wasted a bit too much time.  6.cxd5  The best way to stop us from taking on d4.   6.Qb3  c5  7.dxc5   7.a3  Ba5  ∓  White experiences problems with the pawn structure. If White plays 8. dxc5, we can reply with 8.. .d4! 9. Nb1 Bc7, when we will win back the pawn on c5 at some point and will build up a strong center by playing ...e5 at some point.  Nc6  Development is more important than taking back the pawn. Now we can play d4 again.  8.cxd5  The only way to stop d4.  8...exd5  N  The d5-pawn is coming to d4, with problems for White. Normally, we usually prefer White having the isolated pawn, but in this case it is clear that it will be a very strong pawn and that our pieces are way more active than White's, giving us a clear advantage.  6...exd5  7.Bg2  c6  Putting up a nice blockade against that g2-bishop.  8.Nf3  Re8  9.O-O  Nbd7 =  Our knight can go to b6, and our bishop can go to f5 @@StartBracket@@after we have played h6, in order to retreat to h7 in case of annoying Nh4 ideas@@EndBracket@@. Black is fine here - but so is White. }
5... b6
{ Could have transposed from 4.Nf3 & 5.Bd2, as we play 4...b6 against 4.Nf3. In this position, White has played 6.e3, 6.g3 and 6. a3 most frequently in descending order. }
6. e3
{ 6.g3  Ba6  Although Bb7 is more common, putting the bishop on a6 while White was intending to fianchetto the bishop is a recurring idea. We can simply put pressure on the c4-pawn.  7.b3   7.Qb3  c5  8.Bg2  Nc6 =  The pawn on c4 is firmly blocked and we will attack it in our usual way, with a balanced position.  d5  Immediately putting more pressure.  8.cxd5   8.e3  Combining e3 and g3 looks quite ugly, but this does protect the pawn on c4.  8...dxc4  9.bxc4  c5  =+  With similar ideas as before.  exd5  9.a3  Bxc3  Since we clearly could not go to a5, we prefer to take here to eliminate the defender of the e2-pawn.  10.Bxc3  Re8  Now we exercise unpleasant pressure on e2, which makes it hard for White to finish development. At some point he probably has to play e3, when we can exchange bishops, eliminating the bishop pair and leaving White's light squares weakened.   6.a3  Bxc3  7.Bxc3  Ne4  A common motive.  8.Qc2  Bb7  Now White mainly has played two different set-ups in practice: to play e3 or g3.  9.g3  Although ...f5 looks thematic, Black has to reckon with the undefended bishop on b7 against the defended bishop on g2 in such positions. There's another good solution on the board though.   9.e3  We can borrow ideas from 4.Qc2; 7.Nf3 lines now, and sometimes even transpose.  9...f5  10.Be2  This has been played almost as much as Bd3. The bishop doesn't attack the knight on e4, but does defend his own knight, preventing any Bxf4 ideas.   10.Bd3  The bishop is slightly more active here than on e2.  10...d6  11.O-O-O   11.O-O  This seems a bit too optimistic.  11...Nxc3  12.Qxc3  Bxf3  13.gxf3  Qh4  =+  White's structure is damaged. We can develop our knight to d7 and get our rook into the attack, with a small but stable advantage.  Nd7  Building up play on the c-file.  10...d6  We play in the same way.  11.O-O  Nd7  12.Nd2   12.b4  Rf6  This rook lift should be familiar to you from the aforementioned Qc2 lines.  13.Rfd1   13.Bb2  Rh6  Transposes to 4.Qc2; 7.Nf3; 13.Bb2.  Rh6  14.d5   14.g3  A useful defensive move, preparing to play h4 and also just preventing ...Qh4.  14...Ndf6  15.Be1  Qd7  =+  And we can continue to build our attack slowly.  e5  Resuming play on the kingside while White's important dark-squared bishop is limited for a while.  Qg5 ⇆  9...Nxc3  10.Qxc3  c5  This has more purpose than it looks as it aims for ...cxd4. As our bishop is already on the long diagonal, White will be forced to recapture with the queen on d4 when we can win a tempo with ...Nc6. This is similar to 4. Qc2 with 7. Nf3 and 8. g3, except that the f6-knight has been exchanged for the c1-bishop here.  11.Bg2   11.dxc5  bxc5  12.Bg2  a5  Not allowing White to play b4, which would allow him to solve his weakness. Now we can try to attack this pawn in the future - one original idea to do this would be Ra6-b6. We can also consider to play a5-a4 to lock the pawn, and can defend the d-file by ...Qc7 and ...Rd8.  cxd4  12.Qxd4  As mentioned, White has to take with the queen because of the pin.  12...Nc6  13.Qf4  Where else? The queen isn't safe on c3, as we will play Rc8 and can harass it with ...d5.  13...Rc8  14.Rc1  Na5  Attacking the pawn on c4, which will be hard to defend. The knight can't move yet because of the pin, and we will aim for Qf6 to trade queens and remove one defender of the pawn.  15.O-O  Bxf3  First we have to take here, as White could defend the pawn with Nd2 now.  16.Bxf3  Qf6  White can't defend both b2 and c4 and loses a pawn. Although not all hope is lost yet, in Galunova-L. van Foreest, White already resigned here according to my database! }
6... Bb7
{ In this position, 7.Bd3 is the most popular move, then followed by 7.Be2. Other less popular alternatives are 7.a3, 7.Rc1, 7.g3 and 7. Qc2 and will also be discussed. }
7. Bd3
{ 7.Be2  This is the second most popular move but it just feels like a less active version of 7.Bd3. Black can play in the center with ...c5, followed by taking on d4 and ...d5 at some point, creating the isolani as we often do. The interesting alternative was to play ...d6, following up with ... Ne4 and ... f5 since White is controlling the e4-square less from e2.  7...c5  8.O-O  cxd4  9.exd4   9.Nxd4  Nc6  10.Bf3   10.Ncb5  Be7  11.Bf3  Qc8  12.Rc1  Ne5 =  Be7  11.Rc1  Qb8 =  Be7  Black removes the sort of hanging bishop before playing ...d5. This has a very specific reason: with the bishop on d3, we would play 9...d5 here, and respond to 10. cxd5 with 10... Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Bxd2. This works with a bishop on e2: White can not take on b6, as after 12... axb6 he can take back on d2, but the pawn on d4 will be lost after 13. Bxf3. However, now with the bishop on d2, White does have 12. Nxb6! and can play 13. Qxd2, with d4 protected and this seems a bit troublesome for us. So, long story short: we first have to retreat our bishop before playing d5. White now has tried several options such as 10. Rc1, 10.Ne5, 10. Bg5 and 10.Bf4.  10.Rc1   10.Ne5  This looks active, but doesn't stop our plan.  10...d5  11.Bf3  Nc6 =  Now we threaten to take on d4. We will follow up by playing Rc8, when we can take on c4. We can also choose to take on e5 at some point.   10.Bg5  White has additional pressure on d5 now.  10...h6  If we would play 10... d5 now, White could play 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. cxd5 when the position would be very symmetrical after 12... exd5. That is not really my taste, so I propose to postpone d5 for now. Please be aware not to play 10... Nc6 here though as it runs into 11. d5, when White will trap the bishop next with 12.d6.  11.Bh4  Nc6  Now we can play this, because 12. d5 doesn't work for tactical reasons.  12.Ne5   12.d5  exd5  13.cxd5  Nxd5 !  The point. This was not possible with the bishop still on g5, as White could then play Qxd5 when the bishop on g5 would be protected.  14.Qxd5  Bxh4  15.Nxh4  Qxh4  16.Qxd7  Rab8 =  The dust has settled and the position is equal.  Rc8  13.Bf3  d6  This is also an advantage of not having played d5 yet: we can chase the knight away now.  14.Nxc6  Bxc6  15.Bxc6  Rxc6  Black is doing well here. We can play Qc7/ Qd7 and Rfc8, with pressure on the pawns.   10.Bf4  Now we can just follow our plan.  10...d5  11.Rc1  Nc6  We are not in a rush to take on c4 and first finish development.  12.Re1  Rc8  =+  We have now developed our pieces and are ready to take on c4. If White captures on d5, then ...Nxd5 and if Ne5, Black is in good shape after taking on c4 like happened in Karttunen - Markos @@StartBracket@@2001@@EndBracket@@.  d5  11.cxd5  Nxd5  The position is equal, although White still has to seek dynamic chances for the isolani. The knight can go to either d7 or c6, and the rook will go to c8 as usual.   7.a3  White spends a tempo and now it becomes more interesting to exchange the bishop for the knight and follow up with ...Ne4 and ...f5, although retreating to e7 and follow up with . ..d5 is certainly possible too.  7...Bxc3  This is also possible, with similar play as after 6.a3.   7...Be7  Retreating the bishop first so we can safely play ...c5 on the next move. This is similar to 7. Rc1.  8.Bd3  c5  9.O-O  cxd4  10.exd4  d5  11.Re1   11.cxd5  Nxd5  Transposition to 4.e3; 6.Nf3; 11.a3.  dxc4  12.Bxc4  Nc6 =  8.Bxc3  Ne4  9.Bd3  White could play Qc2 somewhere in this line, transposing to the lines covered in 6.a3.  9...f5  10.O-O  Nxc3  11.bxc3  Qf6   7.Rc1  Be7  This retreat doesn't let our bishop stay stuck on the queenside as we would like to play ...c5, but then White can play a2-a3, which simplifies the positions quite a lot. We can now aim for transposition to our main repertoire against 4.e3.  8.Bd3  c5  9.O-O  cxd4  10.exd4  d5  11.cxd5  Nxd5  Transposes to 4.e3; 6.Nf3; 11.Rc1.   7.g3  Has been played but e3 and g3 creates additional weaknesses if White is not careful.  7...c5  8.Bg2   8.dxc5  N  bxc5 =  And we can follow up with Nbd7, d6, Qb6 and activate the rooks. Black is fine here.  cxd4  9.exd4  Qc7 !?  Our plan is to play d5, but it seems smart to first attack the pawn on c4. How is White going to defend it?  10.b3  Bxc3  Eliminating the option to go Nb5 for White.  11.Bxc3  d5  Now White is under pressure.  12.Rc1   12.Qe2  was played in Henkel - Tauscher @@StartBracket@@2013@@EndBracket@@. However, the pawn is already beyond saving.  12...dxc4  13.bxc4  Rc8  14.O-O  Qxc4  ∓  With a healthy pawn up.  dxc4  13.O-O   13.bxc4  Qxc4  -+  White has no good discovered attack and is just a pawn down.  b5  We're not falling for 13... cxb3 14. Bb4 of course. Instead, we just overprotect our extra pawn.  14.a4  a6  Black is slightly better, as White does not seem to have enough compensation for the pawn deficit.   7.Qc2  is bound to transpose.  7...d6  8.Bd3  c5  Transposes to 4. Qc2; 5.Nf3 & 7.e3 as we have seen earlier in this chapter. }
7... c5
{ A move consistent with our repertoire against 4.e3. From this position, White's most popular move has been to castle short which transposes directly to 4.e3; 5.Bd3 & 8.Bd2. The second most popular move is 8. a3, followed by comparably a lot less games in 8.dxc5 and 8.Qc2. }
8. a3
{ 8.dxc5  Releases the tension early and does not give Black any problems.  8...Bxc5  You may remember that we examined 8. dxc5 earlier, in the file with 4. Nf3. However, there Qc2 was played instead of Bd2. Our idea is still the same though: we recapture with the bishop, and will aim to play the Bd6 idea that was mentioned in that line.  9.O-O  Nc6  The bishop on c5 and knight on c6 are lacking harmony for the moment, so the bishop can be played to d6 @@StartBracket@@and even sometimes back to b8 after Black played .. .Rc8@@EndBracket@@, and the knight on c6 can go to e7-g6 or a5 so the bishop on b7 is active again.

11. b3
{ White is trying to go for that hanging pawn structure, aiming to play bxc4 once we take on c4.   11.O-O  This is a natural move, but we can just follow our normal ideas.  11...dxc4  12.Bxc4  Nc6  In this case, I don't see a lot of purpose for the knight on d7, so instead we just pressure the pawn on d4. Please note, this position could arise from the Panov-variation in the Caro-Kann, For example, my good friend Svetlana Sucikova had this position against Rosen last year that emerged from that opening.  13.Re1  Rc8  14.Rc1  Nd5  15.Qd3  Was played in two correspondence games.  15...Nce7  N  A typical rerouting of the knight: we can transfer it to f5 now.

{ The kingside fianchetto by White is a known guest in our repertoire via 4.Nf3 b6 5.g3, but in this case 4...b6 is not to be recommended since White already has 5.Bg2 attacking the rook. }
4... Bxc3+
{ This move, although not very common, is consistent with our repertoire choice of creating doubled pawns, and it is also one of the strongest moves in this position. Black could have also considered to take on c3 a move or two later @@StartBracket@@by castling and playing d6 first@@EndBracket@@, but it makes sense to cut out extra options for White by playing it directly. Another option is to castle and play ...d5. Although this is a fine choice, I don't think this is in the style of this repertoire. The most popular move here is 4...c5, but I personally dislike playing c5 when there is a bishop on g2 - I would rather keep the option of playing c6 at some point, blocking the bishop if we need to. }
5. bxc3 O-O 6. Bg2 d6
{ Black aims to play ...e5, which leads to a center type familiar from the so called Zurich variation of the Nimzo-Indian or Bogo-Indian lines, although in those positions the pawns aren't necessarily doubled. What we remember from the general considerations is that White would like to play his c4-pawn forward, and in these positions he might just do so as Black didn't stop it by playing . ..c5 or indirectly by ...b6. }
7. Nf3
{ This is almost exclusively played, but we will also look at some set-ups for White where he doesn't go Nf3.   7.e4  White is taking advantage of the fact that Nf3 isn't played and that the bishop is protecting e4 here. However, we are not impressed and will just continue our plan.  7...Nc6  Preparing ...e5 which puts pressure on White's center.  8.Ne2   8.f4  This is quite an aggressive approach as White threatens to win more space and expel our knights. Also, Black should be careful not to allow fxe5, 0-0 and Bg5, or a violent kingside pawn expansion. So memorize the moves here well!  8...e5  Of course we can't allow White to go e5.  9.Ne2  White can't go to f3, as then e4 would be hanging.  9...b6  N  I like consistency: here we go for our usual plan of attacking the weak pawn on c4 with Ba6 and Na5. It has to be said that 9...Re8 is a good option as well though.   9...Re8  is a good alternative, aiming to take on d4 and win the e4-pawn.  10.Qd3  Na5  N  Now we go after the c4-pawn.  11.O-O  Be6  12.d5  The only way to save the pawn, but now White's pawns have lost some flexibility.  12...Bg4  =+  We will proceed with rerouting our knight from f6 and will attack the pawn formation next. Keep in mind that 13. fxe5 is not dangerous - we can reply Rxe5 @@StartBracket@@preventing Bg5@@EndBracket@@, although the pawn sacrifice 13... Nd7 might be even stronger! As long as you don't reply 13... dxe5, allowing 14. Bg5, you should be doing fine.  10.O-O   10.fxe5  dxe5  Now we have to take back with this pawn, but we can prevent Bg5 next.  11.O-O  The immediate 11. Bg5 is not problematic, since we can just play 11... h6 and chase the bishop away.  11...h6 !  This is important as Bg5 would be quite a nuisance. Now Ba6 is threatened.  12.c5  Ba6  =+  White has pushed his pawn, but this doesn't stop us from going here. We now threaten Bxe2, winning the pawn on d4. White's pawns here are weak, and not assets. Note that 12... bxc5 wasn't so strong, because White has 13. Ba3.  h6  With the same ideas as before.  e5  9.O-O   9.f4  Transposing to 8.f4.  Re8  We go for the e4-pawn here.  10.Qc2  h6  A useful precaution against any f4 and Bg5 ideas.  11.Rd1  Qe7  We are still going for that e4-pawn! It's actually very hard to protect.  12.c5  dxc5  N  We don't mind winning this pawn either.  13.Ba3  b6  =+  Black is a pawn up and has a fine position.   7.e3  Nc6  8.Nf3  White can go 8.Ne2 here, but it doesn't really make sense. We will just play our normal ... e5 plan.  8...e5  9.O-O  Transposes to 9.e3.  9...e4   7.Nh3  This happened recently in a rapid game between El Debs and Azarov @@StartBracket@@2020@@EndBracket@@.  7...Nc6  8.O-O  Re8  Black is not in a hurry and prepares e5 first.  9.f4  d5 !  I admire Black's flexible thinking in this game. Since f2-f4 weakened the e4-square, he goes for d5 instead of e5 in this case.  10.Nf2  Na5  Forcing White to make a decision regarding his c4-pawn.  11.c5  Taking on d5 would only make the weakness of the e-pawn and e4-square more apparent, so White tries to close the center instead.  11...b6  However, we can open up anyway.  12.cxb6  axb6  N  Black is slightly for choice. Our pieces have some very nice squares, such as c4 and e4 and the white bishop on c1 is definitely not happy about the placement of the pawns.   7.Rb1  White is just procrastinating here: he will have to move his knight at some point, so he might as well do it immediately.  7...Nc6  8.c5  was seen in Miana - Giardelli  @@StartBracket@@1985@@EndBracket@@.   8.Nf3  e5  9.O-O  h6  Transposes to 9.Rb1.   8.e3  Na5 !?  9.Qa4   9.Qe2  e5  and we can follow up with Bf5 @@StartBracket@@with tempo!@@EndBracket@@ and e5-e4.   9.c5  e5  10.cxd6  cxd6  =+  and Black is just doing very well, we can go for e4 later @@StartBracket@@a move we will see a lot in this line@@EndBracket@@ and White is struggling to develop.  b6 !  This is a cool move to play. Just imagine the look on your opponent's face when you play this! At first, he might think you are blundering, only to realize that White is in fact in trouble himself...  10.Bxa8  Bd7  11.Qc2  Qxa8  -+  We have given up on exchange, but the rook on h1 is under attack and to save it, White has to make some serious concessions. We can also take the pawn on c4 soon, so the material deficit is very minimal.  8...h6  N  Just preventing Bg5 already, and waiting for White to make a plan.  9.Ba3  Qd7  Trying to play the rook to d8 and also preparing to take on c5, so that Bxc5 b6 comes with a tempo on the bishop.  10.c4  Rd8   7.a4  I was quite surprised when I saw that this move, in true AlphaZero style, was played twice already around 1990 by Loek van Wely. White will run all the way to a6, but we are not scared of this little pawn as you will see.  7...Nc6  8.a5  Bd7  Protecting the knight so we can go b6.  9.a6  b6  We can just move our rook out of the pin, and can continue to attack the c4-pawn in usual fashion, as well as prepare Re8-e5. }
7... Nc6 8. O-O
{ 8.Qd3  is the second most popular move. White defends c4 in advance and prepares e4. Black has played 8...Rb8 in practice, with the idea of ...b6 and ...Ba6. The popular alternative of 8...e5 seems more clear-cut.  8...e5  9.Nd2  A necessary preparation: in case of 9.e4, we have exd4 10. cxd4 Nxe4! when the queen can't recapture because of the pin on the e-file.  9...Re8  10.O-O  Qe7  11.e3  Happened between Tarun - Kollars @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@. However, I find e3 a bit inconsistent together with Qd3. Kollars shows us why.   11.e4  Was played in Van Laatum - Chuchelov @@StartBracket@@1997@@EndBracket@@ and is most consistent with Qd3.  11...b6  12.Ba3   12.Nb3  N  White is so scared of ...Na5 that he tries to prevent it.  12...h6  Preventing the Bg5 pin is often useful.  13.Re1  Ba6  14.Be3  Rad8 =  The position is balanced. Either side will find it hard to improve the position of the pieces. One idea I want to mention is that White might want to play f3 to prevent Ng4 and protect the pawn on e4, but then we have the nice break d5!.  Qd7 N  We go out of the pin, and prepare to go Na5 and Qa4 instead.  13.f4  Na5  14.c5  Qa4  15.fxe5  dxe5  ⇆  11...e4  Now this is with tempo and we see the point behind 10...Qe7.  12.Qc2  Na5 !?  Although 12...Bf5 was possible, this option seems highly interesting. Black prepares to attack c4, and it's not easy to defend.  13.c5  The recipe of c4-c5 and Ba3 does not work that well.   13.f3  exf3  14.Rxf3  c5  ∓  The pawn on c4 is very weak now. We can attack it in our standard way with b6 and Ba6, but Be6 is an option too here.   13.Ba3  c5  With the same idea of attacking c4.  13...d5  14.Ba3  b5 !?  This is a funny move: even though there is no longer a pawn there, we still try to get control over the c4-square. }
8... e5
{ In this structure, White has to play fiercely and keep the pawn structure dynamic as otherwise White's statical problems will become more prominent. One key idea is that we can often push e5-e4, blocking the bishop on g2. This might involve playing the preparatory moves Re8 and/or h6 first. Our standard idea of attacking the pawn on c4 will also be present in some of the coming lines. There aren't that many games in this position @@StartBracket@@less than 100@@EndBracket@@, and there is no clear set-up that every white player goes for. Therefore, we will examine many moves here, based on the games that have been played. Don't be scared though of the 11@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ different moves that are analysed here - remembering the ideas is more important in this case and I won't make you memorize every line. }
9. c5
{ Not allowing Black to stabilize and open up the position seems the only real critical test of Black's set-up, and is a logical attempt as Black didn't stop the advance by ...c5 or ...b6.   9.Qc2  Re8  With his previous move, White took control over the e4-square, meaning that 9... e4 here would lose a pawn after 9. Ng5. Therefore, we first prepare this move with Re8.  10.Rd1   10.dxe5  Nxe5  N  There were 2 games that saw 10... dxe5 instead, but I think it's more interesting to keep our semi-open e-file.  11.Nxe5  Rxe5  Again not taking with the pawn, but preferring to keep pressure against the pawn on e2. We have zero weaknesses whereas White's structure is damaged, so we should not be unhappy here. One idea is to play Qe8 and Bf5 with tempo is also nice, when we can block White's bishop with either Be4 or Ne4.   10.h3  This happened in Sribar - Krizanovic @@StartBracket@@2010@@EndBracket@@. Since this does not prevent our idea of e4, I suggest we just go for it.  10...e4  N  11.Nd2   11.Nh4  Na5  =+  With White's knight on the other side of the board, we can attack c4 and this pawn is actually really hard to defend. White can try 12. Qa4, but after c5 Black is doing well and can play Bd7 next.  Bf5 =+  White's knight protects the pawn on c4 from d2, but doesn't cover the f5-square so now our bishop is happy to go there. We can play Qd7 to protect the bishop and have options of going e3, and we can also play Na5 and go for the c4-pawn once again. In short: we are doing great!   10.d5  was played in Simunic - Birkic @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@.  10...Na5  N  11.Nd2  Nd7  Black is slightly for choice. He can consider ...b6 and ... Ba6 on the next move, and maybe bring the rook back to f8 and start thinking about ...f5.  e4  11.Ng5  It's better to play Nd2 or Ne1, but Black also has a good game after 11...Bf5. I want to show this move to illustrate a tactical point.  11...Bf5  White was in trouble in Botsari - Kiriakov @@StartBracket@@1996@@EndBracket@@. Black can play ...Qd7/c8 and ...h6 soon.  12.Qa4  Qc8  -+  Surprisingly, after only 12 moves, Black is already winning! The problem is that his knight on g5 has nowhere to go and will be trapped on the next move. Kiriakov soon won. By the way, 12...Qd7 isn't as strong, since White can force a queen exchange with 13. d5 when the knight can escape to h3.   9.Rb1  This is the third popular move. White keeps on eye on b7, which means we can't protect our pawn on e4 with ...Bf5 as easily.  9...h6  This is a good prophylactic move against Bg5. Also, after a future ...e4 by Black, Ng5 is prevented now. By the way, you will soon see a line with 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Rb1, where we will answer 10... Rb8. Here is a warning: do not play 9. .. Rb8 here! White has the surprising 10. Nxe5!, utilizing the pin of the b-pawn when White will have the advantage.  10.dxe5   10.Ba3  happened in Naoum - Saric @@StartBracket@@2017@@EndBracket@@. This has the very obvious threat of taking on e5, but we can parry that with an equally obvious reply.  10...Re8  Stepping out of the pin: now we are ready for e4 next.  11.dxe5  dxe5  If White takes on d8, the pressure on Black's position is reduced and static factors of the position will become more important. Black aims to play the rook to b8 to cover the b7-pawn, and ...Be6 is coming next.  12.Qc1  12...Qd7  In anticipation of Rd1, the queen can now go to a few useful light squares, such as e6 or g4, from where she will attack the c4-pawn.  13.e4  It is understandable that White was scared of our coming e4-push, but this is counterproductive as the bishop on g2 is greatly reduced in scope.   13.Nd2  Kind of prophylactic, already retreating the knight in anticipation of 13...e4. But we just play it anyway.  13...e4  With possible ideas of ...e3 or ...b6.  13...Qe6  14.Nd2  Na5  Now the pawn on c4 will be lost.  15.Rb5  In the game, Black took on c4 which is perfectly fine for an advantage. However, this pawn is not going anywhere really! So I suggest a better move, 15...b6.   15.c5  b6  ∓  White can take on b6, but we will recapture with the a-pawn when our rook on a8 will come to life. White is just not able to handle all of our activity.  15...b6  N  Black is in a winning position. The bishop will come to a6 and White's position is falling apart.  dxe5  11.Qc2  This happened in Zajogin - Kazakovskiy @@StartBracket@@2020@@EndBracket@@. Both players played very strongly, and the game is therefore a good example.  11...Qe7  12.Nd2  Rd8  Black is mobilizing his forces and has a good position. See the model games section for the rest of the game.   9.d5  Gains a bit of space, but White's pawn mobility is not optimal now.  9...Na5  Immediately putting pressure on the c4-pawn.  10.c5  As can be seen in the variations after 10.Nd2, getting rid of the weakened pawn on c4 makes sense.   10.Nd2  b6  11.Re1  Occurred in Potapov - Debashis @@StartBracket@@2018@@EndBracket@@. Black can put his forces towards the weak pawn.   11.Rb1  Took place in a correspondence game between Borodin - De Oliviera @@StartBracket@@2013@@EndBracket@@.  11...Ba6  12.Rb4  A creative way of defending this pawn, but we can just continue to improve the position of our pieces.  12...Nd7  13.Kh1  Nc5  ∓  Black can build up his forces in the center by playing ...f5, ...Qf6 and ...Rae8, and possibly start kingside operations. At the same time, White still has to guard the c4-pawn for a while and has problems coming up with a good plan.  11...Ba6  12.Qa4  Qe8  Trying to exchange the defender of the c4-pawn. This could also be done with 12... Qd7, but I really like the way Debashis played in the game.  13.Qb4  e4 !  Preventing e2-e4 and restricting the minor pieces. Black has another idea in mind which we'll soon see.  14.e3  Qe5  The point of the previous moves. The queen is placed well, and Black can start thinking about a kingside attack now.  15.Bf1  Bc8  16.f4  exf3  17.Nxf3  Qh5  With a strong and possibly already decisive attack.  @@StartBracket@@See model games for the end of this marvelous game@@EndBracket@@.  10...Qe7  N  Forcing White to make a decision about the pawn structure.  11.cxd6   11.c6  bxc6  12.dxc6  White has opened up part of the diagonal for his bishop, and is now hoping that we take on c6...  12...Nc4  =+  But we just outsmart him and go for activity instead of a pawn. We can play Be6 next when our pieces are well-placed. @@StartBracket@@12... Nxc6?! 13. Nd4! Suddenly the bishop will become active, and this is obviously not what we wanted. @@EndBracket@@   11.Qa4  b6  12.Nd2  White has the tricky idea to play for d5-d6 after we take on c5, but this was all planned out.  12...dxc5 !  13.d6  cxd6  14.Bxa8  Bd7  ∓  Picking up the important light-squared bishop, while the pawns in the center will be strong.  cxd6  The c3-pawn is now a target.  12.Nd2  Bd7  =+  And we will bring a rook to c8 and attack the c3-pawn.   9.dxe5  dxe5  Releasing the tension at this stage is not frightening at all. In practice, White has played 10.Qb3, 10.Qc2 or 10. Rb1.  10.Qb3  Creates a bit of pressure on b7, but Black can develop and play a rook to b8 or play ...b6 at some point.   10.Rb1  Rb8  White attacks b7 - we protect b7. Simple as that. Compare this to the note I mentioned at 9. Rb1: there is now no 11. Nxe5 to utilize the pin, since we can just play 11... Nxe5.  11.Nd2  was played in Mourao - Supi @@StartBracket@@2020@@EndBracket@@, but Black is already slightly better after this move.  11...Bf5  Solving the pin with tempo.  12.Rb2  e4  13.Nb3  Ne5  Black exercises unpleasant pressure.  14.Na5  b6  15.Bf4  Qxd1  16.Rxd1  Nfd7  N  Keeping the c6-square under control. White is going to lose at least a pawn @@StartBracket@@on c4@@EndBracket@@.   10.Qc2  This position can apparently arise from a wide range of variations. There are 3 games that had this position on the board, and all had a different move order @@StartBracket@@and none involved 4.g3 actually!@@EndBracket@@. Either way, the ideas are similar to what we have seen before.  10...h6  Avoiding Bg5.  11.Ba3  In case of 11. Rd1, we have the intermediate move 11... Bf5! after which we can go Qc8.  11...Re8  12.Rfd1  Bd7 =  Shielding the queen and preparing ...Qc8 to pressure the light squares.  10...Re8  11.Rd1  Qe7  Black is fine. One of the typical ideas in these structures is to play for ...h6 and ...e4, and remove the pressure of the b7-pawn with b6 or Rb8.   9.Bg5  Since we often play h6 to avoid this move, let's see what happens if White goes for it when he still has the chance.  9...h6  Solving the pin right away makes a lot of sense to me.  10.Bxf6  Qxf6  11.Rb1  If 11.e3, then Bg4 looks fine. The text move of 11.Rb1 was played by Shirov and deserves investigation.  11...Rb8  There seem to be no tricks with the pin on the b-pawn here, so this move is risk-free.  12.Nd2  Bd7  Of course White was threatening to take on c6 now, but we can simply protect the knight.  13.Nb3  b6  N  With his last move, White was aiming to play c4-c5. So, we prevent it. This also gives us the ability to move our rook to a more active square @@StartBracket@@say, d8 or e8@@EndBracket@@.  14.c5  White can go c5 anyway, but it's not very dangerous.  14...dxc5  15.dxe5  Qe6  15...Nxe5 would run into 16.f4 which would be painful.  16.f4  Rbd8  With the idea of ...

It is a bit out of the ordinary, but the idea seems to be to play the knight to c2, then to e3 and from there to d5. White will aim to trade his bishop for our knight on f6, when his knight would be quite powerful on d5. So we come to the recommended move here: 9... h6. This was probably obvious, but I will mention it anyway: White could not go 9. Bg5 and then Ne1, since after 9... h6 10. Bxf6 Qxf6 the pawn on d4 would be hanging if the knight moved.  9...h6  N  10.Nc2  Re8  11.Ne3  Bd7  12.Nd5  White's knight has been on a long journey, and now it finally has arrived at his dream square, only for us to simply ignore it.  12...Na5  We go for this pawn once again and make room to chase the knight away with c6.  13.Qd3  c6  14.Nxf6+  Qxf6  Black is about to take on d4 and play ...Be6, with a slight pull.   9.e3  This is a bit pleasant for Black as White stops his own idea of Bg5, meaning we can do without h6.  9...e4  10.Nd2  Re8  Black plans to attack on the light squares, and White will likely try to exchange the strong pawn on e4.  11.f3   11.Rb1  Was played in McNab - Rowson @@StartBracket@@2004@@EndBracket@@.  11...b6  12.f3  exf3  13.Qxf3  Bb7  =+  And we can go Na5 next, and get rid of White's strong light-squared bishop.

Re1. Then he could answer 14...Bh3 with 15. Bh1, which is a good idea in many structures. However, the rook is nicely placed on f1 and this plan is just too passive here. Black can go Na5 for example, or perhaps try to double on the e-file with Re7 and Rae8.  14...Bh3  15.e4  Nd8  N  16.Bxh3  Qxh3  Black is fine.   9.Qa4  Happened only once in the game of Xu - Le Quang Liem @@StartBracket@@2019@@EndBracket@@.  9...Bd7  White will likely retreat the queen soon.

Defending the b7-pawn makes sense so Black can continue his play on the light squares, or play with ...b6 against White's advanced pawn can be considered.   10.Ne1  The retreat to e1 does not not put direct pressure on Black, giving the advantage to Black.  10...dxc5  11.Ba3  Re8  12.Bxc5  b6  Making it possible for the bishop to come to a6 in some lines, and the knight is protected on a5.  13.Ba3  Na5  Black has harmonic piece play.  14.f3  Bf5  ∓ }
10... Re8
{ The easy, safe move.   10...d5  This would be a terrific recommendation if it weren't for the dangerous consequences of a piece sacrifice on the twelfth move.  11.f3  h6  12.fxe4 !?  This is critical. 12. Nh3 wouldn't bother Black as after ...Re8 or ...b6, he has a good game. After the piece sacrifice, Black has to be aware of all White's threats for quite a while, but of course has the prospect of fending off the attack and having a winning position. The attack and defence of both sides require much variations that are very difficult to predict. Since I usually prefer the attacking side over the defensive side in such situations, I decided to not make this my main recommendation. However, if you are interested in this, I have some sample variations for you here!  12...hxg5  13.Bxg5  dxe4  14.Qd2 !?   14.Bxf6  gxf6  15.Bxe4  Kg7  16.Qd3  Rh8  Black seems to hold here.   14.Rf4  was played in Georgiev - Mancini @@StartBracket@@2012@@EndBracket@@.  14...Qd5  Black defended well for a while and got an advantage, although it later somehow went wrong. He is not scared of White taking on f6, as after 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Rxf6 Kg7, the rook has to move when f5 will follow and Black's strong center will keep him safe.  Re8  15.Qf4  Qd5  16.Bxf6  gxf6  17.Qxf6  Qe6  18.Qh4  Qg4  And here too, Black seems to hold and keep his extra piece. So although Black definitely has enough resources, in a practical game it's easy to go wrong and suffer a painful loss. Do look into this if you want to though! }
11. cxd6
{ 11.d5  Nb8  This may look passive, but the knight can come to d7 soon enough.  12.cxd6  cxd6  =+  This has actually clarified the position for Black and he can now start putting pieces on the weakened squares in the center. Black has a small advantage. }
11... cxd6 12. f3 { 12.d5 is similar to playing d5 on the previous move. }
12... exf3 13. exf3 d5
{ Black will soon attack the knight with ..h6, play ...Na5, and the light-squared bishop may come to d7 and the rook to c8. Black is definitely not worse here and there is a lot to play for in this position. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. g3
{ Although fianchetto systems for White are far more common with Nf3 instead of Nc3, it is still very possible and we should study some ideas here. From g2, White's bishop will exert a lot of pressure on our queenside. Our main aim should thus be to block this bishop and limit its power.   This could be done in different ways, for example by putting a pawn on d5 or c6, although the latter is too passive to work out. My preferred choice will be different: with the move ...d6, we will be preparing the push ...e5-e4 to gain a lot of space and to really annoy the bishop. Let's see how we can achieve this. }
4... Bxc3+
{ First, we create doubled pawns for White before he has the chance to prevent it. This will be useful because, just like we have seen in many other lines, the pawn on c4 can be a target for us to attack. Now with White's bishop on g2, it is especially tempting to try and attack the weakened c4-pawn, since it won't be protected by the bishop in these lines. We will combine threats on this pawn with our play in the center. }

{ This is the main tabiya for this line. White has a lot of different moves at his disposal here, so before studying those I'll summarize the main ideas for you here.   - As mentioned before, we will often try to push ...e4. This will usually be prepared by ...Re8. Once the pawn is on e4, it can be extra protected by ...Bf5. We can then follow up with ...Qd7 @@StartBracket@@or sometimes Qc8@@EndBracket@@ and try to play ...Bh3, aiming to exchange bishops.   - The move ...h6 is often useful, to prevent the move Bg5 which would pin our knight and make it harder to push ...e4.   - Since White has a half-open b-file, he will often play Rb1. We can protect our b7-pawn with ...Rb8, but we do have to be careful as the b-pawn will then be pinned and there could be tricks for White!   - If White goes d5, we can switch to our plan of attacking the pawn on c4 @@StartBracket@@although this also applies to other variations: the c4-pawn is one of our main targets@@EndBracket@@.   - White can go c5 to get rid of his doubled pawn. This does not stop our ...e4-plan however. }

White will aim to trade his bishop for our knight on f6, when his knight would be quite powerful on d5. So we come to the recommended move here: 9... h6.   This was probably obvious, but I will mention it anyway: White could not go  9.Bg5  and then Ne1, since after  9...h6  10.Bxf6  Qxf6  the pawn on d4 would be hanging if the knight moved. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. g3
{ The kingside fianchetto by White is a known guest in our repertoire via 4. Nf3 b6 5. g3, but in this case 4... b6 is not to be recommended since White already has 5. Bg2 attacking the rook. So, we'll go for something else! }
4... Bxc3+
{ This move, although not very common, is consistent with our repertoire choice of creating doubled pawns, and it is also one of the strongest moves in this position. Black could have also considered to take on c3 a move or two later @@StartBracket@@by castling and playing d6 first@@EndBracket@@, but it makes sense to cut out extra options for White by playing it directly.   Another option is to castle and play ...d5. Although this is a fine choice, I don't think this is in the style of this repertoire.   The most popular move here is 4... c5, but I personally dislike playing c5 when there is a bishop on g2 - I would rather keep the option of playing c6 at some point, blocking the bishop if we need to. }
5. bxc3 O-O 6. Bg2 d6
{ Black aims to play ...e5, which leads to a center type familiar from the so-called Zurich variation of the Nimzo-Indian or Bogo-Indian lines, although in those positions the pawns aren't necessarily doubled.   What we @@StartBracket@@hopefully@@EndBracket@@ remember from the General Considerations is that White would like to play his c4-pawn forward, and in these positions he might just do so as Black didn't stop it by playing ...c5 or indirectly by ...b6. }
7. Nf3
{ This is almost exclusively played, but there are some set-ups for White where he doesn't go Nf3, as we have just examined. }
7... Nc6 8. O-O e5
{ In this structure, White has to play fiercely and keep the pawn structure dynamic as otherwise White's statical problems will become more prominent. One key idea is that we can often push e5-e4, blocking the bishop on g2. This might involve playing the preparatory moves Re8 and/or h6 first. Our standard idea of attacking the pawn on c4 will also be present in some of the coming lines.   There aren't that many games in this position @@StartBracket@@less than 100@@EndBracket@@, and there is no clear set-up that every white player goes for. Therefore, we will examine many moves here, based on the games that have been played.   Don't be scared though of the 11@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ different moves that are analysed here - remembering the ideas is more important in this case and I won't make you memorize every line. For example, the moves 9. Re1 and 9. Qa4 are not trainable but are covered in the reference only. }
9. c5
{ Not allowing Black to stabilize and open up the position seems the only real critical test of Black's set-up, and is a logical attempt as Black didn't stop the advance by ...c5 or ...b6. }
9... e4 10. Ng5
{ Black has good options in either playing 10... Re8, or the riskier 10... d5 which involves a piece sacrifice.   10.Ne1  The retreat to e1 does not put direct pressure on Black, giving the advantage to us.  10...dxc5  11.Ba3  Re8  12.Bxc5  b6  Making it possible for the bishop to come to a6 in some lines, and the knight is protected on a5.  13.Ba3  Na5  Black has harmonic piece play.  14.f3  Bf5∓  We can play moves like ...Nc4, ...Qd7 develop our rook from a8 and then, perhaps take on f3 finally. }
10... Re8 { The easy, safe move. } 11. cxd6 cxd6 12. f3
{ 12.d5  is similar to playing d5 on the previous move. See the previous variation. }
12... exf3 13. exf3 d5
{ Black will soon attack the knight with ...h6, play ...Na5, and the light-squared bishop may come to d7 and the rook to c8. Black is definitely not worse here and there is a lot to play for in this position. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qb3
{ This move is called the Spielmann variation, named after Rudolf Spielmann. It had a spike of popularity around 1930 but it eventually went out of fashion, although there are still adherents to the move until this day. This move is also familiar to us from the 4.Nf3 b6 5.Qb3 variation, but in this case the queen move forces Black into different types of positions, but then again the queen on b3 is a bit misplaced. I've also tried to analyse different moves, like ...Nc6 or ...Qe7, but the principled and probably strongest move on the board is to play 4...c5 which defends the bishop and influences the center. }
4... c5
{ After Black's last move, White has played in descending order of frequency: 5.dxc5, 5.Nf3, 5.e3, 5.a3, 5.Bg5 and 5.d5. }
5. dxc5
{ By far the main move.   5.Nf3  This is the second most popular move, but it transposes to positions we have examined before.  5...b6  With a direct transposition to 4.Nf3 b6 5.Qb3 c5. It has to be said that 5... Nc6 is possible too, as after 6.e3 there's a transposition to 5.e3, and after 6. dxc5 it transposes to 5.dxc5.   5.e3  Nc6  Putting additional pressure on the center.  6.Nf3   6.a3  Bxc3+  This leads to a good position by force.  7.Qxc3  cxd4  8.exd4  Ne4  And now we win a pawn by force, wherever the white queen goes:  9.Qc2  Other squares will get the same reply of ... Qa5+. White can try 9. Qd3 Qa5+ 10. Ke2, but this looks terrible too.  9...Qa5+  10.Bd2  10. b4 runs into 10... Nxb4.  10...Qxd2+  11.Qxd2  Nxd2  12.Kxd2  Nxd4  ∓  And we are just a healthy pawn up.  cxd4 !?  Exchanging on d4 followed by ...d5 with the idea to isolate White's d-pawn.  7.exd4   7.Nxd4  Now there's the idea of Nxc6, so Black removes the bishop from the attack by the queen and attacks the knight.  7...Bc5  Attacking the knight. White typically takes on c6 or moves it to f3.  8.Nxc6   8.Nf3  O-O  9.Be2  Here the bishop is safe. In case of 9. Bd3, Black can just play in the same way, and might one day attack the bishop @@StartBracket@@for example, when Ne5 is possible@@EndBracket@@.  9...b6  10.O-O  Bb7  Both sides are developing naturally.  11.Rd1  11.a3 runs into the same reply.  11...Qb8 =  With the idea of playing Ne5. This is better than Qc7, as there the queen is vulnerable to Nb5 attacks.  dxc6 !?  Or 8...bxc6 9.Be2 d5 was also possible, but I think the pawn structure is most harmonious in this way when we can go .. .e5 next.  9.Be2  e5 =  This position should be around equal, but Black is slightly for choice because of the central control and more harmonious placement of the pieces. One idea could be to play for ... Qe7 and ...e4 soon.  7...O-O  8.Bd3  This looks active, but after the upcoming ...d5 with the idea of capturing on c4, the bishop or queen has to recapture but that gives Black ways to gain tempi.   8.Be2  This is pretty similar to 8.Bd3, especially if White wants to recapture on c4 with the bishop anyway.  8...d5  9.O-O  dxc4  10.Qxc4  After 10.Bxc4 we would transpose to 8.Bd3, but this is a little different as the bishop is on e2 rather than d3.  10...Bd7  With equal play.  11.Bg5  Be7  12.Rfd1  Rc8  was played by Rausis against Schwarz @@StartBracket@@2012@@EndBracket@@. Black has activated almost all of the pieces now, so let's look at a sample variation to see how play could progress.  13.Qd3  Nb4  Rerouting the knight to d5, and making room for the bishop on d7.  14.Qd2  Nbd5  15.Bd3  Qb6  N  We will activate the rook, and can put the bishop on e8 if necessary to open up the file.  8...d5  9.O-O  dxc4  was played in Prieto - Escobedo Tinajero @@StartBracket@@2006@@EndBracket@@.  10.Qxc4  Now the queen attacks c6, so we can not do b6 or a6/b5 here.   10.Bxc4  Be7  Moving the bishop away, so our knight can move @@StartBracket@@to a5, if White lets us@@EndBracket@@.  11.Qd1  a6  Instead of b6, we try a6 and b5 here which is a bit more active since we gain a tempo on the bishop.  12.a3  Preventing any ...Nb4 ideas and allowing the bishop to retreat to a2.   12.a4  White doesn't want to allow b5, but this does make the b4-square weak.  12...Qb6  The rook will come to d8, with good pressure on the d4-pawn.   12.Be3  b5  13.Bb3   13.Bd3  Bb7  =+  Black has developed all minor pieces and has a good position.  Na5 =+  Harassing the bishop, and the knight can go to c4 if White moves the bishop.  12...b5  13.d5   13.Ba2  b4  The downside of 12.a3 is that we can immediately open the position.  14.axb4  Nxb4  15.Bb1  Bb7  =+  With the typical pressure on d4.  Na5  This is stronger than taking on d5, when White would take back with the bishop and get some activity.  14.Ba2  Nc4  Now we threaten to take on d5, so White has to take on e6.  15.dxe6  Bxe6  =+  Our bishop is now activated and we are slightly ahead in development, giving us a tiny advantage.  10...Be7  Making room to reroute the knight, when we can go b6 after all.  11.Rd1   11.a3  N  Prevents the Nb4 manoeuvre.  11...Na5  So we just go somewhere else with the knight!  12.Qa4   12.Qa2  b6  Going a6 and b5 makes less sense now, as there is no tempo to gain on the bishop here @@StartBracket@@since it's not on c4@@EndBracket@@.  13.b4  Nc6 =  Bd7  Although b6 is also possible, developing the bishop with tempo is too tempting.  13.Qd1  Bc6 =  The bishop is on the right diagonal after all. We can go Rc8, Qb6 and Rfd8 and can enjoy our position.  Nb4  12.Bb1  b6  13.Ne5  Bb7  14.Bg5  Rc8  All of these moves are very natural.  15.Qb3  Nfd5  N  Black is in good shape. We certainly do not mind to exchange minor pieces as that would help our battle against the isolated d4-pawn.   5.a3  Challenging the bishop. Black still has the option of playing ...Ba5, which looks attractive.  5...Ba5 !?  In this case, taking on c3 would not win material: 5... Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 Ne4 7. Qc2 Qa5+?? 8. b4! when there is no Nxb4 trick. So, we move our bishop away.  6.Nf3  Now we can transpose to 4. Nf3 b6 5. Qb3 c5 6. a3 Ba5.   6.e3  O-O  7.Nf3  b6  With another transposition to 4. Nf3 b6 5. Qb3 c5 6. a3 Ba5, with 7.e3.   6.dxc5 ?!  White thinks he is winning a pawn, but we have a strong reply:  6...Ne4 !  Attacking the pawn on c5, but most importantly putting pressure on the knight on c3.  7.Bd2  The only way to avoid getting tripled pawns on the c-file, but now White loses the right to castle.  7...Nxd2  8.Kxd2  b6  =+  Opening up files for our pieces, to attack that poor king of White. He is in big trouble.  6...b6   5.Bg5  h6  First we challenge the bishop. Typically, it will go back to h4 or exchange itself on f6. Going to h4 looks most logical, but is actually a mistake as you will soon see.  6.Bh4 ?!  This looks tempting but Black can play a sequence of forcing moves to get a good position.   6.Bxf6  Qxf6  Now White has to protect d4, since taking on c5 would lead to tripled pawns after the reply Bxc3+.  7.Nf3   7.e3  cxd4  N  We take right now, so White does not get the chance to take back with the nice if we would include 7... Nc6 8. Nf3 and only then cxd4.  8.exd4  Nc6  9.Nf3  b5 !?  This is a strong move to connect the queen and bishop after cxb5 Nxd4, and is also playable against 9.Rd1.  10.cxb5  Nxd4  11.Nxd4  Qxd4  =+  Now the bishop is protected. Although material is equal, White is clearly worse as we have some strong central pawns, the bishop pair and slightly more activity.  b6  8.e3  Nc6  Now we have ideas of going Na5 sometimes, when we can take on d4.  9.Be2   9.a3  Na5  N  We first win a tempo on the queen before we take on c3. This is useful to open up the diagonal of our bishop, that will soon come to b7.  10.Qc2  Bxc3+  11.Qxc3  Bb7  Now we threaten to take on f3 with pressure on the central pawns.  12.Nd2  Now we can't take on f3, but there will still be pressure on the pawns.   12.Be2  A logical move, but it allows us to demonstrate our idea.  12...Bxf3 !  13.Bxf3  Rc8  ⇆  With enormous pressure on the pawns in the center. One idea is to take on d4 and play d5, because the c-pawn will be pinned then.  12...cxd4  13.Qxd4  White could take with the pawn, but that will only make things worse for him as the queen is vulnerable on c3. We could play ...Rc8 and ...d5 to take advantage of that.  13...Qxd4  14.exd4  Nc6  =+  The knight's job on a5 is done and now returns to attack the pawn on d4. We will proceed by attacking the pawns and enjoy a small advantage.  Na5  This move was played once before, by my great countryman Jan Timman. The idea is the same as before; opening the diagonal for the bishop that will soon come to b7.  10.Qc2  cxd4 =  And we will just finish our development with 0-0, Bb7 and Rc8 when we will pressure the pawns yet again.  6...Nc6  Now White has problems with the d4-pawn, so he has to take on c5.  7.dxc5  g5  8.Bg3  Ne4  Keeping up the pressure.  9.e3  Bxc3+  10.bxc3  Nxc5  N  We have our pawn back and White's structure is ruined. Next we will block White's bishop on g3 with d6 and e5, when it is completely buried.  11.Qc2  d6  12.h4 !?  g4  13.Ne2  e5  =+  We have achieved our goal and will continue with developing. Castling queenside is most logical, although if you are feeling brave you can also castle kingside!   5.d5  The d5-pawn is rather a target than a strength.  5...b5 !  We immediately undermine White's pawns. Let's look at some options.  6.cxb5   6.dxe6  bxc4 !  This is an important move to insert, as otherwise White can take on b5.  7.exf7+   7.exd7+  Qxd7  8.Qxc4  Ba6  ∓  With a huge initiative for the pawn.  Kxf7  Do not be afraid of your king here: Black gets a strong center with ...d5, and ...Re8 is on the cards. Meanwhile, White is very underdeveloped.   6.Bd2  This is very tame.  6...bxc4  7.Qxc4  exd5  N  White is basically lost already. Taking the pawn on d5 will be answered by Bxd2+ when we can just castle and White's king will be vulnerable.   6.e3  O-O  =+  White can't hold onto his center.  exd5 ∓  The central pawns will be very strong and we will soon open more files and diagonals for our pieces.   5.Bd2  Nc6  6.dxc5  This can easily also arise from 5. dxc5.   6.d5 ?  Na5  -+  And we win the c4-pawn.  6...Bxc5  Since there are no Ne4 ideas here, we just take back the pawn.  7.Nf3  Or White can start with 7.e3, likely transposing a move later.  7...b6  8.e3  O-O  9.Bd3  Or 9.Be2 with the same idea by Black.  9...Bb7  10.O-O  Ng4 !?  Trying to launch play on the kingside. We will try to exchange one pair of knights by going to e5, and can grab space with ...f5. }
5... Nc6 { Now we have Ne4 as a resource. } 6. Nf3
{ 6.Bg5  Pinning the knight and thus preventing Ne4.  6...h6  7.Bxf6  7.Bh4 would transpose to 5. Bg5 after 7...g5 8.Bg3 Ne4 9.e3 Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 Nxc5.  7...Qxf6  Now the pressure on c3 is real.  8.Nf3  Or 8.e3: Black plays in the same way.   8.Rc1  Protecting the knight on c3, so we switch plans here.  8...Bxc5  9.e3  b6  10.Nf3  Ne5  This was played by Wei Yi against Zhou @@StartBracket@@2016@@EndBracket@@. We open up the diagonal for our bishop that will soon go to b7.  11.Be2  Bb7  12.Qd1  O-O  N  Wei Yi took on f3 and played for a slight structural advantage in the endgame, although the game was drawn later. The text move is used to play with the bishop pair.  13.Nxe5  Qxe5  14.O-O  Rac8  =+  Black has the bishop pair and will try to open the position.  8...Bxc3+  9.Qxc3  Qxc3+  10.bxc3  10...b6  Opening up lines to speed up our development. Don't worry, we will get the pawn back soon!  11.cxb6  axb6  12.e3  Na5  With an endgame where White has static, long-term weaknesses on the c-file.   6.a3  Nd4 !?  Although 6...Bxc5 is more common and also possible, I just can't resist playing such a move. We chase the queen away so we can take on c3.  7.Qa4  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  Nc6  Black is fine. Similar to the variation of 6.Bg5, Black can play for ...b6 against these pawns. I believe it was Tony Miles who used to call this structure an "Irish pawn center".  9.Bf4  Was played in the game Goregliad - Salman @@StartBracket@@1995@@EndBracket@@.  9...Ne4  Attacking two of the pawns at once.  10.Qc2  White protects one pawn, but we can still take the other.  10...Nxc5  N  11.Bd6  Attacking our knight and preventing us from castling, which may look annoying.  11...b6  =+  Not only protecting the knight, but also enabling us to play Bb7 to chase away the bishop, when we can castle.   6.Bd2  Bxc5  With a transposition to 5.Bd2. }
6... Ne4 { Putting pressure on c3. } 7. Bd2
{ The only move to defend c3.   7.e3  Bxc3+  This is much better than taking with the knight on c3, as the knight on e4 is much stronger than the bishop in this position.  8.bxc3  Nxc5  9.Qc2  b6  =+  With some advantage because of White's ruined structure. }
7... Nxd2
{ In the past, people played 7...Nxc5 as well but now it has drastically reduced in popularity as it is stronger to grab the bishop pair. }
8. Nxd2 O-O
{ This is one of the popular lines, together with 8...Bxc5. An alternative is to play 8...f5, although the lines often coincide with the current recommendation. }
9. e3
{ This seems the most natural set-up for White, already preventing any Nd4 ideas.   9.g3  Although most people prefer the e3 set-ups, this has been seen a couple of times too.  9...Bxc5  10.Bg2  Black has a good option in playing 10...Be7, which in many lines means preparing ...Rb8 and sacrificing a pawn with ...b5 but Black either regains its pawn or gets strong compensation. A more quiet alternative is to play with ...b6 and ...Bb7, aiming for example to exchange light-squared bishops at some point.  10...Be7 !?  The bishop could be a target on c5, for example after 10...a6 11.0-0 Rb8, White has 12.Na4 followed by c4-c5. This is not a big problem for Black but we might as well avoid it.   10...b6 !?  The easier option.  11.O-O  Bb7  12.Rac1  Qb8  This is a safe square for the queen: on c7 for example she could easily be attacked by Nb5.  13.Rfd1  Rd8  Now that we have protected the pawn on d7, we are ready to play Na5 and exchange bishops.  11.O-O  a6  Preparing ...Rb8 and possibly ...b5.  12.Rac1  was played in Zakharov - Shchebenyuk @@StartBracket@@2015@@EndBracket@@. Black can finish its task of finishing development by using the queen on b3 to speed up the process. Black can play ...b5 directly or prepare it by ...Rb8.   12.e3  White does not want to allow ...Nd4, but besides that this move feels a little slow.  12...Rb8  We just continue our plan.  13.Rfd1  b5 !?  14.cxb5  Na5  A useful intermediate move before we take back on b5, so that White does not have Nxb5.  15.Qc2   15.Qa4  It looks like White will be up a pawn in the end, but we have enough compensation to gain the pawn back as White has to guard the knight and defend the b2-pawn.  15...axb5  16.Nxb5  d5  Black threatens ...Bd7 of course.  17.Nb1  or Ne4, Black's idea is the same.  17...Bd7  As you will see, we will threaten something with every move we play! We definitely have the initiative and will soon have the pawn back.  18.N1c3  Bxb5  19.Nxb5  Nc4  20.Qb3  Bf6  White can no longer safe the pawn.  21.a4  Nxb2 =  Material equality has been restored and the position is balanced.  axb5  We have the pawn back and will finish our development by playing ...d6 and ... Bd7.   12.Qc2 !?  White prophylactically removes the queen away from the b-file in advance.  12...Rb8  13.Rfd1  b5  14.cxb5  Nb4 =  Avoiding Bxc6 and only taking back on b5 next.  12...Rb8   12...b5  N  I like this move better than 12...Rb8 as in that variation as we don't want to allow White to play Rfd1 and after ...b5, play the unexpected c4-c5. If Black takes that pawn, White can take on c6 and after Nde4, White threatens the queen and the bishop.  13.cxb5  axb5  14.Nxb5   14.Qxb5  Ba6  15.Qb3  d5  =∞  We have sufficient compensation for the pawn. If White tries 16.Nxd5, Black has the intermediate 16...Nd4 and Black is in a winning position.  Rb8  15.a4  Nd4  16.Qd3  Nxb5  17.axb5  Qb6  Black will regain the pawn and has the bishop pair to count on.  13.Rfd1  White's idea is subtle. If Black plays ...b5, White can consider c4-c5 as after ...Bxc5 there's Bxc6 followed by ...Nde4. Although that is not a big problem, it changes the course of the game while we were planning to use the bishops.  13...Nd4  Avoiding White's trick.   13...b5  14.c5 !?  Bxc5  I will show this move to illustrate White's idea.  15.Bxc6  dxc6  16.Nde4  And we lose our bishop pair, and White will get play on the dark squares. This is why I prefer to play 12...b5 and avoid this.  14.Qa4  b5  15.cxb5  Nxb5  16.Nxb5  Rxb5 =  The position may be objectively equal, but Black is slightly for choice with the two bishops and the pressure on White's queenside. }
9... Bxc5 10. Be2
{ This is the most frequent move, although it is by no means the only option for White.   10.Nde4  Activating the knight and attacking the bishop, although the knight can be chased away by ...f5 at some point.  10...Be7  11.Rd1  This move, just as 11.0-0-0, aims to answer 11... f5 with 12. Nd6. Other 11th moves will run into 11...f5.   11.O-O-O  This is an optimistic try by White, and Black will use the placement of the king on the queenside as an incentive to open up the queenside.  11...a6  12.Na4  This was played in the old game of Steiner - Adam @@StartBracket@@1937@@EndBracket@@ . White may have been hoping to put a piece on b6 and block our pawns, but he is one move too late:   12.Nd6  Black can play 12. ..Rb8 or give away his b-pawn right away: in opposite castled situations, material becomes less of a prominent factor compared to the initiative.  12...b5 !?  If you don't like sacrificing a pawn, you can also play 12... Rb8 13. Kb1 Qc7 and try to build up the attack more slowly.  13.cxb5  axb5  Now we have an open a-file to work with.  14.Ndxb5  d5  ∓  With a huge initiative and upcoming attack on the king.  12...b5 !  Let's open up those files!  13.cxb5  axb5  14.Bxb5  Rb8  -+  White is lost. We will play Na7 and d5, and move all of our pieces to the queenside in order to finish off White's king.  11...Qc7  Preventing Nd6.  12.Be2  a6  We are trying to open the queenside once again, preparing ...b5. From this position, either c4-c5 or 0-0 seems the most logical.  13.c5  Trying to prevent b5, and aiming for Nd6.   13.O-O  N  Rb8  Black can seek counterplay through pushing the b-pawn or f-pawn, and play the knight to a5 or e5 depending on circumstances. Because we have all of these resources as well as the bishop pair, we are slightly for choice here.  14.Qc2  Ne5 !?  And f5 next.  13...Rb8  N  We don't let the pawn on c5 stop us and seek counterplay by either ...b6 or ...b5. For example:  14.Nd6  b5  15.O-O  Black will now try to exchange the strong knight on d6, either by ...Nd8!? with the idea of ...Nb7 or just ...Bb7.  15...Bb7  =+   10.Rd1  f5  Avoiding any Ne4 ideas.  11.Be2   11.g3  This happened in a blitz game between Epishin and Psakhis @@StartBracket@@2004@@EndBracket@@, but combining e3 and g3 can cause long-term weaknesses on the light squares.  11...b6  12.Bg2  Bb7  13.O-O  Qc8  N  Preparing ...

{ Has been played more often than 0-0-0.   11.O-O-O  A more risky approach by White - and we certainly don't mind that!  11...b6  This is the most common option. Black prepares ...Bb7 and to use the c-file against White's king.  12.Nf3  Bb7  13.Rd2   13.Kb1  Getting out of the c-file.  13...Na5  It is interesting to insert this first as after 13... Rc8 14.Rd2, the queen now can go to d1 in one move.  14.Qc2  Bb4  15.Ne5  d6  %cal Gb4c3,Ga8c8  (Black is preparing to take the knight on c3, followed by ... Rc8.)  Na5  Another idea is 13...f4!?, threatening fxe3 and with the idea of 14.exf4 Rxf4.  14.Qc2  Bb4  =+  Black is preparing . ..Rc8 and ...d5. }
11... b6
{ In these positions, the idea of ...Rf6 is quite an interesting move to probe the kingside with ideas like ...Rh6 and ...g5, combined with ...Bb7. White typically has played 12.Rad1 and 12.Nf3 in this position. }
12. Rad1
{ 12.Nf3  Rf6  N  You can just play 12... Bb7 here with a transposition to the mainline when White plays 13. Rad1, but this novelty seems interesting to explore.  13.Rad1  Rh6  ⇆  If White attacks the bishop on c5 with Na4, the bishop from c5 can retreat to f8 so it doesn't disturb the coordination in the upcoming attack. We will play g5 and g4 and can create a dangerous kingside attack. }
12... Bb7
{ You can consider to play 12... Rf6 here as well, but there is a difference: White can sometimes block the attack with the move f4 @@StartBracket@@after chasing the bishop away with Na4@@EndBracket@@, when the rook isn't that well-placed on f6. This would not be possible with a knight on f3 as in the previous variation. This is why I am opting for a slightly different way to launch the attack. }
13. Nf3
{ 13.a3  White avoids any jump to b4 by either the knight or bishop, but this is quite slow.  13...Ne5  Opening the diagonal for the bishop, bringing ... Qg5 ideas into the position.  14.Na4  was played in Assmann - Leitner @@StartBracket@@1983@@EndBracket@@.  14...Be7  N  15.f4  Ng4  =+  We don't mind White taking on g4, as our strong bishop on b7 would then be unopposed. If White doesn't take, we can reroute our knight to f6 and to the newly weakened e4-square.   13.Bf3  was played in Bultman - Pytlik @@StartBracket@@2004@@EndBracket@@.  13...Qe7  N  Stepping away from the d-file and making it possible to play ...Bd6 soon after White would play Qc2, threatening Nb3.  14.g3  g5  With attacking possibilities similar to the main line. }
13... g5
{ Here we go! It will be quite hard for White to defend against the upcoming attack. }
14. Nd4
{ 14.Na4  N  is more critical.  14...Be7  15.Nd4  Qc8  White was threatening to take on e6, so we step out of the dangerous d-file. On c8 the queen is safe and indirectly pressures the pawn on c4.  16.Nb5 !?  Ne5  17.Nd6  Bxd6  18.Rxd6  f4  =+  With some attack. }

{ This line is called the Spielmann variation, named after Rudolf Spielmann. It had a spike of popularity around 1930 but it eventually went out of fashion, although there are still adherents to the move until this day. This move is also familiar to us from the 4. Nf3 b6 5. Qb3 variation, but in this case the queen move forces Black into different types of positions, but then again the queen on b3 is a bit misplaced.   I've also tried to analyse different moves, like ...Nc6 or ...Qe7, but the principled and probably strongest move on the board is to play 4... c5 which defends the bishop and influences the center. }
4... c5

5. Bg5 h6
{ First we challenge the bishop. Typically, it will go back to h4 or exchange itself on f6. Going to h4 looks most logical, but is actually a mistake as you will soon see. }
6. Bxf6 Qxf6
{ Now White has to protect d4, since taking on c5 would lead to tripled pawns after the reply ...Bxc3+. }
7. e3 cxd4
{ We take right now, so White does not get the chance to take back with the knight if we would include 7... Nc6 8. Nf3 and only then ...cxd4. }
8. exd4 Nc6 9. Nf3 b5

10. cxb5 Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4

There’s a @@StartBracket@@strong@@EndBracket@@ possibility you will never encounter these, but just in case an opponent tries to surprise you, you will be prepared! }
4. Bf4
{ White rather prematurely brings the bishop out, and at some point in the game the bishop often has to move again due to threats like ...Nh5 or ...e5. Black can choose several set-ups but to double White's pawns, play ...b6 and proceed in the center seems thematic.   4.d5  This is premature, but it is useful to see why.  4...Bxc3+  5.bxc3  d6  Black doubled White's pawns and puts a claim on the c5-square.  6.Nf3  Nbd7  Black is fine. He can castle short, play ...Re8 and ...Nb6 is one of the ideas.   4.e4  This is apparently called the Dilworth gambit because of an article about it in the March 1949 CHESS Magazine, but in later issues the debate about the move was cut short as multiple readers had sent in refutations of the move, and rightly so.  4...Nxe4  5.Qg4  This is what White had in mind when he offered the pawn, but Black is actually in a winning position already.   5.Qc2  Nxc3  6.bxc3  Bd6  ∓  White has very little compensation for the pawn.  5...Nxc3  6.Bd2  This was the original idea of the Dilworth gambit.   6.a3  Hitting the bishop, but Black can just retreat it so White has to take the knight by bxc3.  6...Be7  7.bxc3  O-O  White has a weakened structure as well as a pawn deficit. He can only try to compensate it by attacking the king, but this is to no avail.  8.Bh6   8.Bd3  f5  9.Qe2  Bf6  Black was signifcantly better in Roeder - Volpert @@StartBracket@@1987@@EndBracket@@.  10.Nf3  d6  ∓  Black has everything under control and will make use of the central pawns soon.  Bf6  9.Bd3  Re8  Trying to open the e-file and benefit from a future attack on the queen by the bishop on c8.  10.Ne2  e5  ∓   6.Qxg7  Ne4+  7.Ke2  Qf6  -+  Attacking and defending at the same time. Black wins.  6...Nd5  Black just needs to be aware of this retreat, or find it with ease at the board.  7.cxd5  Bxd2+  8.Kxd2  O-O  Black should win. White's king is stuck in the center and White is also just a pawn down.   4.Qd3  is named after Vladas Mikėnas, who also has variations named after him in the Benoni and English opening. The placement of the queen looks similar to the important line of 4.Qc2, but the queen is rather exposed here and it also might be detrimental to the coordination in White's camp. However, if White wants to, it will just transpose to 4.Qc2 with 5.a3.  4...O-O  5.a3   5.Nf3  c5  You can also consider to play 5...d6 @@StartBracket@@like we would play against 4.Qc2 and 5.Nf3@@EndBracket@@, but this move tries to punish White for going to d3 instead of c2.  6.a3   6.Bg5  Only one game has ever reached this position...but the white player was none other than World Champion Magnus Carlsen! The game is from 2003 though.  6...h6  7.Bh4  d5  Taking control over the center.  8.cxd5   8.e3  cxd4  9.exd4  b6  A good move: we can go to a6 with the bishop, exploiting the position of White's queen.  exd5  9.dxc5   9.e3  g5  10.Bg3  Ne4  And we can go Bf5, with a lot of activity.  g5  10.Bg3  Ne4  The threat is again ...Bf5. From there, the bishop will also make sure that our kingside is safe. Other ideas are to activate our rook with ...Re8 and develop our other pieces; for example Na6-xc5 is an interesting option.  Bxc3+  Either forcing bxc3 or winning time against either the queen or the knight.  7.Qxc3  This is not a transposition to our regular repertoire against 4.Qc2 and 5.a3, but we can play very concretely here.  7...cxd4  8.Nxd4   8.Qxd4  Nc6  Followed by ...d5 to emphasize Black's advantage in development.  9.Qh4   9.Qd3  White just can't resist going to this square again...  9...d5  10.cxd5  exd5  ⇆  We get an isolated pawn, but it gives us control over the center. With ...Ne4 and ...Bf5 we can quickly get active and the position is balanced.  d5  10.cxd5  Qxd5  In this case, this seems stronger than taking with the pawn as we can't harass the queen on d3. Instead, we activate our queen.  11.Bg5  Ne4  12.Rd1  Qa5+  13.b4  Qf5  We first went to a5 to provoke b2-b4. In the future, we can try to exploit the slightly weakened queenside, for example by playing ...a5 or getting a piece to attack the a3-pawn.  14.e3  A natural move, but now we have a surprising idea. White should probably have retreated his bishop when we also have no problems at all.  14...Ne5 !  Trying to deflect the defender of the bishop on g5.  15.Nd4  If White takes on e5, we can take back the queen with a deadly invasion on c3. Now we see why provoking b4 was useful!  15...Qg6  16.Bf4  Nc3  17.Bxe5  White could move his rook, but then ...Nd3+ would have been annoying.  17...Nxd1  =+  d5  Opening up the center while White is still underdeveloped.  9.e3  Other moves run into the same reply @@StartBracket@@even if White takes on d5@@EndBracket@@.  9...e5  10.Nf3  Re8  11.cxd5  Capturing on e5 with the knight runs into ...Ne4.  11...Nxd5  Now we don't take with the queen, as then White could play Bc4 with tempo and finish his development without any problems.  12.Qc2   12.Qd2  Nc6  13.b4  With the queen on d2, Bd3 is not possible because of the fork on e4.  13...e4  N  14.Nd4  Ne5  =+  With a dominant position.  Nc6  13.Bd3  Nf6  =+  Black has an advantage in development and currently threatens ... e4, as well as ...Be6 and ...Rc8 to increase Black's advantage in development even more.   5.e4  d5  Normally we would play ...d6 in such situations, but with the queen on d3 it's different and Black can play forced lines to get a comfortable position.  6.e5   6.cxd5  exd5  7.e5  Ne4  Now we will play c5 and demolish White's center.  8.a3  Ba5  9.b4  Bb6  White has prevented c5, but now we can put pressure on d4 with our pieces instead of the pawn.  10.Nf3  Nc6  ∓  White has to keep an eye on the pawn on d4, while we can just play Bf5 next when all of our pieces are active. Black is much better here.  Ne4  White's pawns may look threatening, but in fact they are weak: White's pieces are not developed yet and are not supporting the pawns, so we can break them up.  7.a3  Bxc3+  Now 7... Ba5 obviously doesn't work, as the bishop will be trapped after 8. b4 and c5.  8.bxc3  c5  9.cxd5  exd5  10.Ne2  Bf5  =+  With an active position.  Bxc3+  6.Qxc3  b6  Transposes to 4.Qc2 with 5.a3. }

10. O-O Ne4 11. Qc2 f5

25. Rd2

{ The knight is very powerful here, putting strong pressure on f3. } 28. Rxd4
cxd4 29. Qxd4
{ White gives back some material to eliminate the knight, giving him three pawns for a piece. However, White's king is still unsafe, so Black is still dominating. }
29... Nh5 30. Qf2 Ba6 31. b3 Bc8
{ First Black provoked b3, when the bishop on a4 is excluded from helping on the kingside. Only after this will the bishop actually go to the right square. }

7... d6 8. O-O

8... Bxc3 9. bxc3 Re8 { Making room for the knight to come to f8. } 10. Re1
{ This is the only move that I cover in the theory section @@StartBracket@@because Black's idea is the same anyway@@EndBracket@@, so let's look at some alternatives for White here.   10.h3  Played in Flores - Lafuente, 2007. The position is quite closed, so White can afford to waste some times on moves like this, but it's obviously not critical.  10...Nbd7  11.Re1  Nf8  12.e4  Ng6  Both Black and White are making similar moves as in other variations.  13.a4  h6 !?  An interesting idea: Black prevents Bg5 and makes room for the knight to reroute via h7. After that, e5 can be played which completely locks up the bishop on d3 and the black knights will become very powerful in that position.  14.Be3  e5 =  With an interesting position.   10.e4  exd5  Taking back with the e-pawn is strategically undesirable for White, but taking with the c-pawn involves a pawn sacrifice.   10...Nbd7  I would just play this move when a transposition to 10. Re1 seems likely.  11.cxd5  Nxe4 ?!  Black takes the bait, but this is actually very risky @@StartBracket@@and the reason why I would recommend 10... Nbd7@@EndBracket@@.  12.Re1 ?!  Played in Ris - Hirneise, but this is inaccurate.   12.Bxe4 !  The right way for White.  12...Rxe4  13.Ng5 !  Re7   13...Re8 ??  14.Qh5  is a disaster.  14.Qd3  Now Black has to weaken his kingside. Since he is also very underdeveloped, it seems that White will have the upperhand even though he is a pawn down for now.  12...Nf6  Now there seems to be no direct attack for White.  13.Bg5  Rxe1+  14.Qxe1  Nbd7  15.Qe3  Bb7  16.c4  b5  Black is a pawn up, but he's also doing very well strategically. He won the game later. }
10... Nbd7 11. e4 Nf8 12. a4
{ White will probably try to play a4-a5 at some point to exchange this potentially weak pawn. }
12... Ng6
{ The rerouting of the knight is completed, so it's time for the next phase. As explained in the theory section, the idea is to set up a kingside attack here with moves like ...e5, ....Nf4, and possibly even ...g5 ideas. }
13. Ra2
{ Very creative; perhaps White is dreaming of doubling on the e-file?   13.a5  This seems more in line with the previous move, 12. a4.  13...exd5   13...e5 !?  Another possibility: we just ignore the threat and proceed with the plan.  14.axb6  Qxb6  Although it is isolated, the a-pawn is in fact a passed pawn. It is not clear yet if it will be strong or weak, but I think Black should be fine here.  14.cxd5  Bg4  This pin is quite annoying for White. One nice point is that White can't immediately solve it:  15.h3  Bxf3  16.Qxf3  Nxd5 !  Using the pin on the e-file. }
13... Bd7
{ It was not really necessary to move this bishop yet.   13...h6 !?  Or the direct 13... e5.  14.h3  e5  Following the plan right away, when the rerouting of the knights can start. }
14. h3
{ Both sides are taking it slow.   14.Nd2  White could consider getting his knight to f1 and g3 via this route as well. }
14... e5 15. Nh2 { This was White's idea: to go to f1 and then g3 via h2. }
15... h6 16. Nf1 Rb8
{ Not unlogical: Black will ultimately play ...a6 and then ...b5.   16...Nf4 !?  I would prefer to not focus on the queenside but instead continue with the kingside plan. The knight is very active on f4 and if White goes to g3 with his knight as planned, he will also be unable to chase it away with g2-g3.  17.Ng3   17.Bxf4  exf4  18.Qf3  g5  Now the attack is already starting to look dangerous, as we can use the freed up e5-square to involve the rook or queen.  g6  White's knight is not allowed to go to f5 for now. As there is no rush here, the king can first be moved to h8, the rook to g8 and only then the attack will be continued with ... g5. }
17. Ng3 Nf4 18. Bb1 a6
{ Continuing on the queenside, but  18...g6  or  18...Nh7  were definitely options as well. }
19. Qf3 Ng6
{ It seems that Black did not really want to risk much in this game, so he retreats the knight. Of course, this is not really in the spirit of this repertoire - we want to fight!   19...g5 !?  I hope that many of you would choose this move instead! Black seems to have good attacking potential in this case: ...h5 and ...g4 can follow. }
20. Kh2 Rb7 21. Nf1 Nh4 22. Qd1 Ng6 23. Qf3
{ White seems to be happy with a move repetition, but Black decides to play on for now. }
23... Nh7 { Finally rerouting this knight. } 24. Ne3 Ng5 25. Qg3 Nf4 26. Kh1 b5
{ I'm not a fan of this move. Although Black prepared it with ...a6 and ... Rb8-b7, to me it seems that the kingside was Black's domain and that this operation was unnecessary. }
27. axb5 axb5 28. cxb5 Rxb5 29. Bc2
{ White's knight has now gained access to the c4-square, which can be annoying. There is also the threat of Ba4 - and Black would rather keep the light-squared bishops, as otherwise the light squares in his camp will be very weak. }
29... Ra5 30. Rb2
{ A good move from White: trading on a5 would only help Black. Now Nc4 is a threat. }
30... Ra1 31. f3
{ 31.Bd2  This simple move might have been White's best option.  31...Rxe1+  32.Bxe1  Qa8  33.f3  +=  Now there are no tricks with Nxe4/Nxf3, so it is safe for White to play this move. }
31... Nh5
{ Black seizes the initiative and the position suddenly becomes very sharp. Where should the queen go? }
32. Qh4
{ Perhaps White saw the sacrifices after the other moves, and decided this was the best square for the queen. But it's actually a blunder!   32.Qf2  This is a logical move, but runs into another surprising tactic:  32...Bxh3 !  33.gxh3   33.Nf1  This is probably the best move, when the tactics are even crazier!  33...Bxg2+ !?  Black really wants to get rid of that bishop!  34.Kxg2  Rxc1  35.Rxc1  Nxe4  What is happening?? Is Black just giving away all of his pieces, like a beginner?  36.Bxe4  Qg5+  Winning back the rook on c1: the point of the sacrifices.  37.Ng3  Nxg3  38.Qxg3  Qxc1  With 3 pawns for the piece, Black is not worse.  Nxh3  34.Qd2  The only move, as otherwise ...Qh4 would already be deadly.  34...Qg5  ...Ng3+ is a big threat. The engine gives 35. Bb1 as the only saving move, but even then Black has some initiative and I would be very surprised if a white player would be able to hold this position in a practical game.   32.Qh2  Even this one runs into a tactic!  32...Nxe4 !?  33.fxe4  Qh4  Attacking the rook and threatening ...Ng3+.  34.Qg1  The only move.   34.Rd1 ?  Ng3+  35.Kg1  Ne2+  36.Kh1  Qf2  37.Nf1  Nxc3  -+  White's position is falling apart fast.  34...Ng3+  35.Kh2  Qf4  Now the game will end in a perpetual:  36.Rd1  Nf1+  37.Kh1  Ng3+  38.Kh2  Nf1+ = }
32... Nxe4
{ Black saw this trick and probably went for it with big enthusiasm. However, he missed an even better tactic!   32...Nxf3 !  Winning on the spot. If White moves the queen, the rook can be taken.  33.Qxd8  Black probably missed the following opportunity:  33...Ng3  What a beautiful mate! }
33. Qxd8 Neg3+ { This intermediate move wins Black a pawn. } 34. Kh2 Rxd8 35.
Bd2
{ 35.Rb6 !?  would be an improvement for White; immediately going after the weakness on d6.  35...Bc8  36.Nc4  when the pawn is lost. }
35... Raa8 36. Nc4
{ 36.Rb6  This is not as effective now:  36...Bc8  37.Nc4  Ba6 !  Now the knight can't move, as then Nf1+ forks the king and bishop. }
36... Bf5
{ Again going the tactical route.   36...Bc8  With again the ...Ba6 idea would be a bit safer. }
37. Bxf5 Nxf5 38. g4 Nh4 { Black's idea. } 39. gxh5 Nxf3+ 40. Kg2 Nxe1+ 41.
Bxe1
{ With a very unusual position. White has two pieces for a rook and 2 pawns, but his pawns on the h-file make a strange impression. However, the weakness on d6 needs attention, making it hard for Black to make progress. This endgame is very interesting, but a bit outside the scope of this course so I will only give light comments on the rest. }
41... Ra1 42. Bh4 Rd7 43. Rb8+ Kh7 44. Rd8 Raa7
{ 44...Rxd8  45.Bxd8  Rd1  46.Nb6  Followed by c4 would also not give Black any winning chances. }
45. Rxd7 Rxd7 46. Kf3 f5 47. Ne3 g6 48. hxg6+ Kxg6 49. Nc4 Kh5
{ 49...Ra7 !?  If Black really wants to push for a win, he can try this move, tempting White to take on d6. There is also the threat of .. .Ra4.  50.Bd8  And now Black can't really make progress.   50.Nxd6 ?!  Rd7  51.Nc8  Kh5 !   51...Rxd5 ??  52.Ne7+  would be painful...  52.Bf2  Rxd5  Now Black definitely has some chances. }
50. Be1 Kg5 51. Bd2+ Kh5 52. Be1 Rd8 53. Bf2 Kg5 54. Be3+ Kh5 55. Bf2 Rd7 56.

{ The best move according to the engine. This might look a bit strange, but the idea is to play g4 when the bishop can't go to g6 anymore, as then h5 would trap it. This means that Black's most natural developing move, 13... Nd7, is prevented. }
13... Qf6
{ Preventing g4, as the pawn could now be taken thanks to the pin. There is also pressure on c3 now.   13...Nd7 ?  14.g4  and the bishop is trapped. }
14. Qd2 { Protecting the knight, but also getting in a pin. } 14... Nd7
{ Now this is possible again. Now that all pieces @@StartBracket@@except for the rook on a8@@EndBracket@@ are developed, Black can start play on the dark squares and harass the white king.   14...c4 !?  This was possible, but since we will have to play ...Nd7 at some point anyway, it's best to wait and not show our cards yet.  15.g3  Making room for the king, when White has everything under control for now. }
15. Rd1
{ 15.g3  This might seem logical, but there is an interesting option because ...c4 is not played yet:  15...Qd4+ !  Black is 2 pawns down, but is not afraid to exchange queens! This is because of concrete reasons.  16.Qxd4  cxd4  17.Ne4   17.Nce2  Nb6  18.Nxd4  Bc5  19.Rd1  Nxd5  White can't play Kg2 because of ...Ne3+, which means that he's in big trouble.  Ne5  Even stronger than taking on e4. ...Rac8 is next, when all pieces are active while White is still underdeveloped. }
15... c4 16. g4
{ 16.g3 ?  Bc5+  17.Kg2  Be3 !  The rook on d1 is blocking the only safe square for the queen! She is now forced to go to the e-file, but then ...Bxg1 simply wins a piece. }
16... Bc5+
{ 16...Bxg4 ?!  This might seem logical, but falls into White's trap:  17.Qg5 !  There is no way to avoid a queen exchange now, when White seems to have regained control and is still one pawn up. }
17. Kg2 Be3 { The same trick as against 16. g3 works here too. } 18. Qe1 Bxg1
19. Qg3 Be3 20. gxf5 Qxf5
{ Now the kingside is even more weak. White can grab another pawn though: } 21.
Bxc4 Qc2+ 22. Kh3 { The only move.   22.Be2 ?  Qxb2  -+ } 22... Nf6
{ Controlling the g4-square, which means White's king is stuck. } 23. Bb3 Qf5+
24. Kg2 Bf4 25. Qh3 Qg6+ 26. Kf1 { So far, White has defended well. } 26... Bd6
{ A strong move, blocking the d-pawn. Don't forget to pay attention to your opponent's ideas! }
27. Rg1 Qh6 28. Rg5 g6
{ Making some room for the queen - when necessary, she can reroute via f8. }
29. Re1 Rad8 30. Ne4 Nxe4 31. fxe4 f6 32. Rg2 Bb4
{ White is still 2 pawns up, but the e4-pawn will fall now. Sadly, the game seemed to have ended here @@StartBracket@@in a win for Black@@EndBracket@@, but a possible continuation could be: }
33. Re3
{ 33.Ree2  Qc1+  34.Kf2  Bc5+  35.Kg3  Bd6+  36.Kf2  f5  -+  Opening up lines, when the king will not survive.   33.Rd1  Rxe4  -+ }
33... Bc5 34. Rc3
{ 34.Ree2  Qc1+  35.Re1  Qf4+  This is the same as 34. Re1: Black wins immediately.   34.Re1  Qf4+  35.Ke2  Qxe4+  -+ }
34... Bd4
{ Now the pawn finally falls. White should probably give up the exchange instead, but this will also give Black a big advantage. To conclude: this game showed how sacrificing a pawn or 2 in exchange for activity can work well in these 4. f3 lines! }

8. cxd5 a6 9. a3

14. Qxb3
{ 14.Be2  Perhaps White is better off not taking the pawn, but following the principle of 'at least dying with a full stomach', taking on b3 is very logical of course.  14...h6  15.Be3  Re8  16.Kf2  Rb8  Black's moves are all very natural, while White is struggling to coordinate. }
14... h6 { First getting rid of the pin. } 15. Bf4

The sacrifice works here too!  17.exd5  Re8  18.Kf2  The pawn on b2 is under attack again, and if White defends it, ...Ne5 with the threat of ...Ng4+ will be deadly.  18...Qf6  The pawn on b2 is under attack again, and if White defends it, ...Ne5 with the threat of ...Ng4+ will be deadly. }
15... Rb8 { Now gaining a tempo on the queen... } 16. Qc2 Nxd5

O-O e5 9. d5
{ White has many moves at his disposal in this position. This one is quite commital, as it locks the pawn structure. White is gaining some space, but he's weakening the c5-square in the progress, as well as the pawn on c4. }
9... Na5 { Black jumps at the opportunity to attack this pawn. } 10. Nd2 b6
{ Black continues the plan of putting pressure on c4: a recurring theme throughout this course. }
11. Re1 Ba6 12. Qa4 Qe8
{ Trying to eliminate the defender of the c4-pawn. Notice the difference between both players: Black is attacking something or creating threats every move, whereas White is only defending and reacting. }
13. Qb4 e4
{ The point of going to e8 instead of d7: this pawn break had to be supported. Now the e5-square is available for the black pieces. It is true that White gets the d4-square, but the white pieces are for now unable to exploit that. }
14. e3 Qe5
{ The queen is perfectly centralized now, keeping an eye on the c3-pawn as well as the kingside. }
15. Bf1 Bc8
{ Now that the pawn on c4 was overprotected, Black no longer needs to attack it and the bishop heads to the kingside instead. }
