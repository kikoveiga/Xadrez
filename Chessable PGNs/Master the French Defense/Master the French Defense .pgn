{ Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide ! Before you dive into the main course let's create a study plan based off of the frequency that you will be seeing certain variations based off of statistical and current trends. It should be noted that these study recommendations are from NM Tillis and are suggestions, the reader may wish to follow the pure stats that follow. This chapter is organized in a format that is believed to be most efficient for using the text. There are notes at the start of each variation giving an overview on its placement and importance in the scheme of the entire opening. Classical/Sidelines & Transpositions  (3 Nc3)  34% - With the Winawer or Classical Approaches. Tarrasch  (3 Nd2)  25.5% Advanced  (3 e5)  14.5% Exchange  (3 exd5)  11.1% KIA  (2 d3 and 2 g3)  6.8% 2 Knights  (2 Nf3 and 2 Nc3)  5.1% Labourdonnais  (2 f4)  .7% Wing Gambit .7% Schlecter  (3 Bd3)  .7% Steinitz Attack  (2 e5)  .3% Alapin  (3 Be3)  .3 % Bishops Folly  (2 Bc4)  .2% Diemer-Duhm Gambit  (3 c4)  .1% It should be noted if you select the path of the Rubinstein that more than 1/2 games you play will be a Rubinstein  (59.5%)  if the reader selects the opening as the main option for both 3. Nc3 as well as 3. Nd2. Many players not looking to bog themselves down with too much theory to learn may elect to go for this option. }

[Black "Advance Variation - Mainline Overview"]
[Result "*"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5
{ The Advance Variation, a great place to start when learning the French. It teaches the reader how to cope with playing with a locked pawn structure as well as the minor piece dynamic of the c8/Bad/French Bishop. }
3... c5 { We are able to outline the standard break against the space. } 4. c3
{ 4.dxc5  It is an important note to keep in mind when playing the French when White makes this capture it significantly weakens the e-pawn for the long-term, creating a target. }
4... Ne7 { Our starting move to begin our plan of trading off the Bad Bishop. }
5. Nf3 Nec6 6. Bd3
{ By far the main move here.   6.Be2  will be handled in the same manner in this variation.   White's only real alternative is  6.a3  which we will investigate in the next overview variation. }
6... b6 7. O-O Ba6
{ It would be inaccurate to play another move before ...Ba6.   For instance, if  7...Be7  White can play  8.Re1  and meet  8...Ba6  with  9.Bc2  - avoiding the trade of Bishops.  The immediate ...Ba6 exploits the fact that White's bishop is pinned to his rook. }
8. Bxa6
{ The most common move in practice. Overall, this is a rare guest in tournament play which makes 4... Ne7 a great surprise weapon.   8.Re1  Bxd3  Now that White can play  Bc2  we trade off the bishops.  9.Qxd3  Be7  Black achieves normal development and queenside expansion. Without a light-squared bishop, White finds it very difficult to attack on the kingside. }
8... Nxa6 9. Qa4 Nb8 10. dxc5 bxc5 11. Qg4 h5
{ A novelty investigated in the main text. } *

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Ne7 5. Nf3 Nec6 6. a3
{ White embarks on a typical mainline plan of playing b4. We need to prevent this plan. This is easily the most dangerous line that White has to employ in the Advanced Variation chapter depending on Black's move order. This move comes in at second most popular in practice. We have seen so far that the objective in these lines is to trade off the 'French Bishop' for its strong counterpart. Here we will be placing a focus on limiting the scope of the strong light-squared White Bishop. }
6... c4 7. Nbd2 Na5
{ The logical follow up, Black would like to justify the Knight's journey eyeing the key square of b3. }
8. g3
{ This is the most popular move in practice via transposition. White typically plays this move on move seven. }
8... Qc7
{ This move order dissuades White from playing b3 as the c-pawn is weak. } 9.
Bg2 Bd7 10. O-O Nbc6
{ Black will look to create action on the kingside in the long term. Moving forward, Black will play h6 and then castle queenside. 6...c4 is a little explored and dynamic line updated from our previous suggestion of 6...a5 which is often seen in practice but has some inherent issues. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Qb6
{ Our intention with 4....Qb6 is not to enter the main lines with ...Nc6, but rather to exchange off our problem 'French Bishop'. This line may be more to the taste of some players. }
5. Nf3 Bd7
{ Both of our Advance Variation plans deal with trading off our problem piece. }
6. Bd3 cxd4
{ We should always start with ...cxd4 before playing ...Bb5 for tactical reasons. This will be explored in an informational variation. }
7. cxd4 Bb5
{ This was our idea. Now the light-squared bishops will be traded and Black will have a very harmonious and solid position. }
8. O-O Bxd3 { An accomplishment in the French! } 9. Qxd3 Ne7 10. Nc3 Nec6
{ Black has easy development from this point. } *

[Black "Rubinstein Variation 6.Nxf6"]
[Result "*"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3
{ Of course this can be played against 3. Nd2 as well. This is what places the Rubinstein Variation high in the study list as an alternative variation for both the Classical/Winawer as well as the Tarrasch Variations. Statistically if the reader chooses to make the Rubinstein their main weapon against 3. Nc3 and 3. Nd2 more than 50% of their games statistically will be the variation. For this reason, the reader needs to fully be prepared for the solid and sometimes passive positions that Black may fall into compared with the other more theoretical and aggressive options. Readers in the comments have often asked: 'Which line should I choose and why ?' this is truly a manner of taste. If the reader finds himself with limited time  (or memory)  for Opening Theory, this is the best option to quickly play at a high level. }
3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6
{ This structure is the starting point of the opening and the main position the reader needs to begin with in the main course. }
6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. Bd3 c5
{ It is critical to get counterplay lest we fall into a passive position. } 8.
O-O cxd4 9. Re1 Bd6 10. Bg5 Bd7
{ Time and again in the text we will see the need to assist the 'French Bishop' see the light of day. This is a Memory Marker we need to keep in mind when studying the French. }
11. Nxd4 { White finally takes on d4 to hold back ... Bc6. } 11... h6
{ The immediate  11...Qc7  allows more complications after  12.Nf5!  , among other reasons to insert 11...h6 first. }
12. Bh4 Qc7 { Notice that Nb5 isn't possible until White protects h2. } 13. h3
O-O-O
{ With a dynamic position, not all Rubinstein Variations we suggest will be dry, happy hunting! }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3
{ The most aggressive of all of the options against the French  (and statistically the most frequently seen)  . }
3... Nf6 4. e5
{ The Classical Variation. Without the trade of the Bishops, this feature adds more counterplay for both players. }
4... Nfd7 5. f4 c5
{ The thematic break in the position, White takes space and we attempt to knock it down. }
6. Nf3 Be7 { Our move to invoke White's full aggression, flexible and good. }
7. Be3 O-O
{ This move order is deliberate, we are keeping our queenside developmental options open. }
8. Qd2 { The most popular move in practice. } 8... b6
{ In many lines we have left the option open to play Ba6. } 9. Nd1
{ This was a main line in the past as it was covered by GM Negi in his Grandmaster Repertoire series. Things changed, however, when Harikrishna won a nice game against Giri using a fresh idea.   9.O-O-O  A move that can be expected to be seen in practice frequently. White feels safe, we have only aggression for him.  9...Nc6  10.Kb1  c4  11.f5  b5  Gets nasty as seen in the major variations. It is strongly suggested that in this type of tactical slugfest that the reader plays around with the engine in these positions to play devils advocate to learn tactical patterns associated with the variation. }
9... a5
{ A very nice idea of expanding on the queenside and preparing typical play. }
10. c3 a4 { A touch of space... } 11. Bd3 Ba6
{ It feels better to wait for White to develop the light-squared bishop before we offer the trade. Trying to coax the stutter step and loss of tempo by White. }
12. O-O Nc6
{ As in: Giri, A. - Harikrishna, P., 0-1, 4th Norway Chess 2016. Black will trade on d3 and push on the queenside. We don't need to fear White's f5 advance. It is usually not even advisable to take on f5 - just weather the storm while you break through on the queenside. With the light-squared bishops off, White's attack loses a lot of its bite. }

{ It should always alarm us when our strong Bishop is traded off while our 'French Bishop' remains. }
6... Qxe7 7. f4
{ A key moment in understanding for Black. Should we play the direct c5 or should we play a6 to stop b5? }
7... a6
{ It is very important to play a6 here before b5 to stop the Nb5 idea. The rule with when to play a6 is simple: When the move Nb5 comes with the dual threat of Nd6+ and Nc7+ we need to play a6 before c5. If our King was castled it would only be the threat of Nc7 which is easy to fix. }
8. Nf3 c5 9. dxc5 Nc6

Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. h4

6... h6 7. Bxe7

{ Not the only square, but a reasonable one. } 15... Qc5
{ Adding support to d5 so we can respond to White's f4-f5 with ...e5. Black will attack on the queenside. Black's dark squared weaknesses are compensated by the attacking prospects and this makes the variation viable. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5
{ The Advance Variation. This is the first variation that an aspiring French player should learn since it exemplifies many of the common positional and structural ideas in the French. Before we begin to learn moves, we should take a moment to understand the nature of the position and our goals for play. With 3 e5, White has defined the position in two ways: The pawn structure has become closed and Black is playing with less space. In a more concrete interpretation, White has voluntarily overextended his center with the trade-off that Black will have more difficult piece development and a weaker kingside. Accordingly we can understand that Black's play and development should revolve around attacking White's overextended center and finding a harmonious scheme of development with potential for exchanging off Black's poorly placed pieces.  This fixing of the pawn structure now clearly defines the Bishops. When evaluating the French Bishop  (c8 Bishop)  we need to define and understand the concept of ‘good versus bad’ A Good Bishop is on the opposite color as its pawns. A Bad Bishop is on the same color as its pawns. This is directly applicable to the central pawn structure as any endgame with Good Bishop versus Bad Bishop with equal pawns will result in a position of ‘playing for two results’ for the Good Bishop wielder.  Across nearly all variations in the French we will need to handle the issue of our French Bishop. }
3... c5
{ The first step in a serious challenge of White's center. We follow the principle of attacking a pawn chain at its base. Trying to attack the center instead with 3...f6 will not work until the chain is weakened because White is not compelled to defend e5 and can instead use that time to develop favorably.   Keep in mind that c5 is the typical Pawn Lever to tear down the pawn wall white has imposed, this is seen across every variation we cover when white chooses to lock the center. }

{ The Advance Variation. This is the first variation that an aspiring French player should learn since it exemplifies many of the common positional and structural ideas in the French. Before we begin to learn moves, we should take a moment to understand the nature of the position and our goals for play. With 3 e5, White has defined the position in two ways: The pawn structure has become closed and Black is playing with less space. In a more concrete interpretation, White has voluntarily overextended his center with the trade-off that Black will have more difficult piece development and a weaker kingside. Accordingly we can understand that Black's play and development should revolve around attacking White's overextended center and finding a harmonious scheme of development with potential for exchanging off Black's poorly placed pieces.  This fixing of the pawn structure now clearly defines the Bishops. When evaluating the French Bishop  (c8 Bishop)  we need to define and understand the concept of ‘good versus bad’ A Good Bishop is on the opposite color as its pawns. A Bad Bishop is on the same color as its pawns. This is directly applicable to the central pawn structure as any endgame with Good Bishop versus Bad Bishop with equal pawns will result in a position of ‘playing for two results’ for the Good Bishop wielder.  Across nearly all variations in the French we will need to handle the issue of our French Bishop. }
3... c5 4. dxc5
{ Poor positional judgement by White. Not only does this help satisfy Black's main goal of proving the e5 pawn to be overextended, it also allows Black to develop efficiently. }
4... Nc6
{ 4...Bxc5 transposes. We are emphasizing the focus on the weak e5 square with this move order. }
5. Nf3 Bxc5 6. Bd3 Qc7
{ It should be noted that the strongest move here is  6...f6.  The setup with ...Qc7 and ...Ne7-g6 just eschews complications. }
7. Qe2 Nge7

{ This scheme of development is a specialty of GM Georg Meier. The g8-knight relocates to c6 to prepare ...b6 and ...Ba6.   A more mainstream option of  4...Qb6  will be offered in informational variations at the end of the chapter.   To overemphasize, this key move and major Memory Marker for the variation initiates the overall plan of trading off our Bad Bishop on c8, 'The French Bishop'. }

Let's take a look at a few lines if the immediate 6.g4 takes place, as all of the lines have very similar flavor to our mainline trainable variations will not be added:    6.g4  Bg6  7.Ne5  Be4  8.Qe2  f6  9.Nd3  Nc6  10.c3  Qe7  11.Rg1  O-O-O  12.Nd2  Bg6  13.Nf3  Qd7  With dynamic equality.    6.g4  Bg6  7.Ne5  Be4  8.Qe2  f6  9.Nd3  Nc6  10.f3  Nxd4  11.Qf2  Nxf3+  A tactical theme to watch out for in the position.    6.g4  Bg6  7.Ne5  Be4  8.f3  Qh4+  9.Ke2  f6  10.fxe4  fxe5  11.exd5  Bd6  12.Bg2  Nd7  13.Qe1  Qe7  14.Kd1  O-O-O  The position is dynamically equal.    6.g4  Bg6  7.Bg2  Qe7+  8.Be3  Nc6  9.Qe2  O-O-O  10.Nc3  Nf6  11.O-O-O  Ne4  12.Nxe4  Bxe4  With another equal position with flavor very similar to our mainline. }
6... Qe7
{ In light of White's intended kingside expansion, Black also makes preparation to castle queenside. }
7. Be3 Nc6 8. Nc3 O-O-O 9. O-O-O
{ We have been following Bacrot - Caruana, GCT Blitz Paris 2017. Caruana continued with   9...Nf6  but this move is slightly inaccurate as it allows  10.g4  Bg6  and  11.Ne5!  +/= }
9... f6
{ A good prophylactic measure for securing our bishop and keeping the f3-knight out of e5. In his game, Caruana instead played   9...Nf6  which allows  10.g4  Bg6  11.Ne5!  where White obtains a strong position. Black can't play  11...Nxe5  12.dxe5  Qxe5  because White follows with f4 - f5 which traps our bishop. }
10. g4 Bf7 11. a3
{ This move is investigated in Sielecki´s Keep it Simple 1.e4 course. Though the authors personally do not have access to the text we have heard great things. }
11... Qd7 12. Nd2
{ This is the point in the Keep it Simple text where the explanation is given: This prepares the push of the f-pawn as the Knight heads towards b3, and possibly c5 later. We agree with the assessment of the position that White has more space which typically yields some edge. }
12... Bd6 { A flexible move to provoke White. } 13. Nb3
{ It is best to continue with 13.Nb3 as:   13.Nb5  h5  14.Nxd6+  Qxd6  15.Nb3  Nge7  16.Qd2  b6  17.Bd3  Qd7  18.Rhg1  Kb8  19.f4  hxg4  20.hxg4  f5  21.g5  Nc8  Leads to a clear plan for Black with the Knight going to d6 with ideas of dropping in on c4 or e4. }
13... h5 14. Bg2 Nge7 { Black is fully developed. } 15. f4
{ This follows the KIS suggestion to gain space. It should be noted that:   15.Nc5  Bxc5  16.dxc5  d4  gives Black the edge. }
15... a6 16. Kb1 Kb8
{ Both players take time for prophylaxis. White does have space on the kingside but it is difficult to prove a concrete edge. Black has multiple ideas to consider in this position: 1  Na7-b5 2  Ng6 to pressure f4 3  Exchange the h-pawn for play down the h-file. With this many pieces on the board it is the better players task to win the position. }

{ Occasionally questions are worth adding into the text. The statistics show that many players want to play castles long in this position. We do not have the firepower left on the board for this move. The following question and answer hopefully helps the reader understand what Black's goals are in this position:  "My initial thought here is: Look at these knights. What to do with them? Would be great if you could formulate some kind of a plan here, as I could imagine a soon trade of bishops... and then what?"  It is difficult to talk in detail on finesse in a position to make something out of a very equal position. All throughout the Exchange Variation Chapter the focus is on creating imbalances to have any change in the position to work with in the future when we get to equal positions like this.  The major points of interest are the Knight on g3 and the Knight on c3 for White and both suggest an idea for Black of playing a pawn move to harass a steed  (h5, and b5 respectively)  based on future decisions by White. To create momentum would be the first goal in the Exchange French Middlegame and I think the ideas with the Pawn pushes would at first glance be a good start. Another idea in delaying castling would be to choose the opposite side of the opponent to liven up the position with the plan of throwing pawns on opposite wings. }

{ Another statement pointed out by a reader which could help illuminate a concept: 'One of these positions where ...a6 is not needed. I still have to understand when I am allowed to go for ...c5 directly and when ...a6 is the right continuation.'   This is pointed out a few times in the text but it seem appropriate to place it here at the start of the Classical Chapter before the reader sees it anywhere else as a reminder. Simply put, if Nb5 comes with a dual threat when White makes the move, we will require the use of a6 before playing c5. For instance, the line 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7.f4 c5? 8.Nb5 makes the dual threat of checking on c7 winning the Rook as well as the check on the d-file cementing the Knight as a bone in our throat. For this reason, 7...a6 is required before playing c5. In the trainable variation above our Bishop covers d6 so there is no dual threat in the event of Nb5 and we are completely fine. }

10... b6

8... c5
{ We achieve our desired ...c5 break. White has several ways to continue development. Black will have no problem achieving a harmonious setup similar to the Ng3 lines against White's less forcing options so we will look at what happens when White plays the forcing 9 Bb5+ and the active 9 Bc4. In the event of 9.dxc5:   9.dxc5  Qxd1  10.Rxd1  Bxc5  11.Bb5  Ke7  Black also has the option on move 9 to play Qa5+ both lines are equal for Black and it is the players readers choice as it is a non-critical line. }

1... e6 2. d3
{ 2. d3 might look strange to those unfamiliar with the King's Indian Attack/Defense, but essentially White is trying to reach a position with e4, d3 and a fianchetto setup on the kingside. 2. g3 isn't a good move-order to reach a King's Indian Attack setup because after 2...d5 White has to make some concession like trading on d5 or playing Bg2 as the normal d3 is no good. 2. Qe2 is a legitimate alternative to try to reach KIA setup and will be covered at the end. }
2... d5 3. Nd2
{ This is why those trying to reach the King's Indian Attack  (which will from now on be abbreviated as KIA)  setup start with 2. d3. Now Black can't trade on e4 and then trade off the queens. 3. Qe2 is possible and will transpose to 2. Qe2 lines. }

{ 4.g3  is imprecise. Black can then play  4...dxe4  5.dxe4  e5  and reach a very nice open position. This is why White plays  Nf3  first to get Black to make some sort of commitment before making their own commitment with  g3. }
4... b6

{ Eventually we will be playing for ...Ba6. So why not play ...b6 where the pawn doesn't interfere with our bishop's development? The answer has to do with how White is going to react to ...Ba6. In most cases, White will want to block the diagonal with the move c4, so by first bringing our pawn to b4, we make ...Ba6 a much larger threat. This plan was played many times by the late GM Victor Korchnoi. }
6. e5 Nfd7
{ This variation is the closest we will get to the mainlines of the KIA. The difference between this position and the main lines, however, is that White has pushed e5 before Black has castled kingside. Accordingly, the position is closed and we can leave our king in the center while we push on the queenside. White's typical kingside play never materializes. }

Nc3 Nf6 3. e4 dxe4 4. f3, and usually meets 3...dxe4 with 4 f3. This truly is bending over backwards to reach the desired structure as the bishop isn't ideally placed on e3, but White has the luxury of the first move and can get away with such ideas. }

The winner of the Candidates tournament would play at the time a 24-game match with the World Champion the following year, and need to win outright to gain the title.  In the 1990 Interzonal in Manila a 'tragic' case was Gurevich. After eleven rounds he shared the first place with Gelfand and Ivanchuk. In order to qualify and become one of the candidates all that was needed was a draw in the last round.  1  Short on the other hand had to win in order to reach one of the eleven qualifying spots for the Candidates matches. “Nigel rose magnificently to the occasion and won a game which most grandmasters would have abandoned as drawn. The game was the beginning of a winning streak that would lead Short all the way to the Kasparov - Short World Championship Match  (1993)  ”.  2    (1)  MANILA izt 1990 by Ftacnik and Stohl  (1990)  .

Sadly, in nearly any variation in chess if White wants to overly simplify the game to a drawish position he has the ability to do so. Do not fret though, if the reader uses the single most important idea of Creating Imbalances he will have no issues in creating winning chances.

{ Vavra - Rydl, Czech Republic, 10.24.2017, 0-1  As a note, all of these games are fully annotated in the video course as bonus content. We will provide light annotations in the game for completion sake.  What can be said of the Rubinstein Variation of the French? It has a solid and stable reputation at the cost of dynamic play on Black's part. The best modern player with the Rubinstein is GM Georg Meier. Even his one minute games in chess.com are a sight to behold as he somehow diffuses attacks and generates winning chances getting blood from a stone. Overall, if the reader is looking for a solid, and not to theory intensive response to meet multiple move orders/variations of the French...the Rubinstein is the line. }

{ Siebrecht - Kengis, 1994, 0-1  As a note, all of these games are fully annotated in the video course as bonus content. We will provide light annotations in the game for completion sake.  The Kings Indian Attack is a very popular line to step away from the standard locked pawn structure of the overall French Defense. It was a favorite of a young Bobby Fischer and modern players like GM Bassem Amin make great use of the opening. The only issue we had with the Kings Indian Attack is what line should we suggest? We chose three technically if you count this bonus variation as another option.  Line 1:  1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. Ngf3 b6 5. g3 dxe4 6. dxe4 Bc5 7. Bg2 Ba6   Line 2:  1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3.

{ Schuls - Huebner, 11.30.2013, 0-1  As a note, all of these games are fully annotated in the video course as bonus content. We will provide light annotations in the game for completion sake.  The Wing Gambit really should have a better reputation. For the cost of a pawn White gets a very aggressive posturing position. The first time NM Tillis encountered the line: 1/2-1/2, 2007, Bill Melvin  (2200)  - Bryan Tillis  (1921)  , Queen of Hearts,:   1.e4  e6  2.Nf3  d5  3.e5  c5  4.b4  cxb4  5.d4  Nc6  6.Bd3  f5  7.exf6  Nxf6  8.O-O  Bd6  9.Re1  O-O  10.Nbd2  Qe8  11.Bb2  Qh5  12.Ne5  Qxd1  13.Raxd1  Bxe5  14.dxe5  Nd7  15.g3  Nc5  16.Bf1  Bd7  17.h4  Rac8  18.Rc1  Na4  19.Ba1  Rc7  20.Bh3  Rfc8  21.Nb3  b6  22.f4  g6  23.Bf1  Nc5  24.Kg2  Nxb3  25.cxb3  Ne7  26.Rxc7  Rxc7  27.Bd3  Nf5  28.Kh3  h5  29.g4  hxg4+  30.Kxg4  Kf7  31.Kg5  Rc8  32.Kg4  Rh8  33.Rh1  a5  34.Bb2  Rc8  35.Rc1  Rh8  36.Rh1  Bc6  37.h5  gxh5+  38.Rxh5  Ne3+  39.Kg5  Rxh5+  40.Kxh5  Nd1  41.Bd4  b5  42.Bb6  a4  43.Bc5  Nc3  44.bxa4  bxa4  45.Bxb4  Nxa2  46.Bd2  d4  47.f5  Nc3  48.f6  Be4  49.Bxc3  A disappointing result as Black had a won game that was missed in the ending. Many lessons were taken from the game, the most important of which was 'Why should we give White exactly what he wants'? The investigation of facing the Wing Gambit with the declined took place shortly thereafter this game. The idea overlap with the Advanced Variation and the solidity of the position for Black made it an easy recommendation. It should be noted of course that accepting the gambit is fully playable as seen, many authors recommend it...should we agree or should we be nettlesome? }

7. Be3
{ By no means the strongest continuation for White here. The Bishop may very well be misplaced later in the game. }
7... Na5
{ The most natural square for the Knight in these lines eyeing the b3 square. }
8. Nbd2 Bd7
{ More accurate was Qc7 which x-rays the c3 pawn stopping b3 from being played limiting counterplay. }
9. Be2 Qc7 10. O-O Nbc6 11. Qc1
{ This begins to feel like a concession for White. The natural pawn breaks in the position are on b3 and f5. With this move no real progress is made on either front. }
11... Be7 12. Bd1
{ This will cost White time and lead to a worse position quickly. } 12... h6
{ We cover the g5 square from the Knight to be able to go long on the queenside. This move will also serve as a pawn lever for a future attack. }
13. Bc2 O-O-O
{ White is no closer to his attack, now Black's plan is clear on the opposite wing. }
14. Rb1 Rdg8 15. Ne1
{ The last two moves from White are too little, too late. Black's attack has arrived. }
15... f5 16. b3 cxb3 17. Nxb3 Nxb3
{ Black is cramped, it does not hurt our chances to trade a set of Knights. }
18. Bxb3 Na5 19. Ba2
{ The c4 square is now a good landing spot for our remaining Knight. } 19... g5
{ White has no real attack on his strong wing while we are in the drivers seat on the kingside. }
20. Nd3 f4
{ A strong move gaining a tempo. This idea puts to question the Bishop's position on e3. }
21. Bd2 b6
{ Though not completely necessary shores up the queenside and is a natural move blunting the Rook on the open b-file. }
22. f3
{ White takes the time to slow the attack. Black now takes a view on the queenside. }
22... Nc4
{ White is left with nothing but difficult choices in dealing with the well placed Knight. }
23. Nb4 a5 { Though not necessary, takes little risk. } 24. Na6
{ A blunder leading to the loss of the game. At this point it is a matter of technique. Much better is Nc2 but Black will have an edge there as well with Ba4. }
24... Qa7 25. Bxc4 dxc4 26. Nb4 axb4 27. axb4 Kc7
{ Black gets the King out of the way to contest the open a-file. } 28. Ra1 Qb7
29. Qb2 Ra8
{ Continuing the plan, when up material...trade down to simplify the win. } 30.
Qc2 { Black can't be afraid of couterplay, not everything can be prevented. }
30... Rxa1 31. Rxa1 Ra8 32. Rd1 Qa6
{ Black now fully owns the a-file and seeks to continue simplifying the win. }
33. Qh7 Qa4 34. Rf1 Bd8 35. Qxh6 Qc2 36. Be1 Ra2 37. Rf2 Qb1 38. Rf1 Qb2
{ A stutter step to pick up time. } 39. Rf2 Qb3 40. Rxa2 Qxa2
{ The time scramble is now real, White picking up the pace begins to unravel. }
41. d5 { A last ditch effort at counterplay. } 41... Qe2

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. exd5 exd5 5. Bd3
{ The most popular move in the variation. Across the Winawer Exchange lines hopefully the reader sees the overlap with the main Exchange Variation lines and themes of creating imbalances. These are not the most critical lines by any means within the course but a few Memory Markers with development is mandatory for mastery. }
5... c6
{ This move is solid with no drawbacks. The reasonable developmental moves of the g8 Knight have been well studied. This goes along with our Exchange Variation chapter principle of making favorable imbalances no matter how small. It should be noted that   5...Ne7  was considered as the main option thematically in the text but after 6. Qh5 White will have pull in the position. This is an important Memory Marker to note, when the White g-Knight in on e2 or f3 we can play Ne7 with no worry with typical ideas. }
6. Qf3
{ The second most popular move in the position. It has logic to it watching the f5 square slowing the progress of us making trades as well as aggressive posturing. }
6... Qf6
{ The alternative with 6... Nf6 seems a bit too accommodating as White has Black on his back foot. The immediate offer of the trade of ladies puts the question to White on his intent moving forward in the position. Is he playing for a draw or attempting to win this position ? }

14. Nh4
{ 14.Qb1  There are many ways for White to play. This line will demonstrate the general plan for Black.  14...b6  Protecting the b-pawn.  15.Bh3  Nge7  16.O-O  Kd8  The King needs to get out of the way so we can generate play against the White King.  17.Kh2  Kc7  18.Bf4  Kb7  Now that the King is safe on the queenside we turn our attention to a breakthrough on the kingside.  19.Bg3  Rhf8  20.Bh4  Rae8  21.Re1  Ng8  22.Qd1  g5  23.Bg3  f5  Getting a dynamically balanced position. }
14... Kd8 15. f4
{ White is putting all pieces on the kingside for an aggressive break on f5. We should be well prepared for this variation as it is most dangerous. }
15... Nge7 16. Bh3 g6
{ A key move to generate dynamic play before it is too late. } 17. hxg6 fxg6
18. f5 gxf5 19. gxf5 exf5
{ Keeps tension and is our main suggestion. Another move has been played in practice with success:   19...Nxf5  20.Bxf5  exf5  21.Ng6  Rg8  22.Nf4  Ne7  23.Kf2  Qc6  24.e6  Be8  25.Rxh6  Rc8  26.a4  Rc7  27.Qf3  Kc8  28.a5  Kb8  29.Bc1  Rg4  30.Rh8  Nc8  31.Nxd5  Nd6  32.Bf4  Rxf4  33.Nxf4  Ne4+  34.Ke2  Rg7  35.Nh5  Re7  36.Qxf5  Rxe6  37.d5  Nxc3+  38.Kf2  Nxd5  39.Kg3  Qd6+  40.Kh3  Kc7  41.Rxe8  Rxe8  42.Rd1  Qa3+  43.Kh2  Qd6+  44.Kh3  Re3+  45.Kg4  Re5  46.Qf7+  Qd7+  47.Qxd7+  Kxd7  48.Ng3  Kc6  49.Kf3  Re3+  50.Kf2  Rc3  51.Rd2  Ra3  52.Ne4  Rxa5  53.Rd1  Ra2  54.Rxd5  Rxc2+  55.Rd2  Rxd2+  56.Nxd2  b5  57.Ke3  Kc5  58.Ne4+  Kb4  59.Kd2  Kb3  60.Kc1  c3  61.Kb1  b4  62.Nc5+  Kc4  63.Na6  b3  64.Ka1  Kd3  65.Kb1  Kd2  66.Ka1  c2  0–1  (66)  (Vestby Ellingsen,M)  (2409)  (-Bruaset,E)  (2057)  (Oslo 2018)  The main thing to keep in mind, if White does not attempt this quick breakthrough we will stick to our typical plan of castling by hand on the queenside and then generate play on the kingside. }
