{ Welcome to this repertoire series, covering the Panov Botvinnik Attack for White.  The Panov Botvinnik arises after the following moves: }
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3
{ I've played this opening and the associated line with   @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c6  2.c4  d5  3.cxd5  cxd5  4.exd5  throughout my chess career, and find that it leads to rich, double-edged play. White often has the initiative, obtained at the cost of material or structural concessions.  He should enjoy positions with an Isolated Queen's Pawn IQP since they come up a lot, especially after   5...e6  , which is one of Black's main responses. A few things to note before we get started:    1. I've analysed the lines using Stockfish and Leela @@StartBracket@@and occasionally Fat Fritz@@EndBracket@@. These monsters have unearthed a lot of surprising discoveries and counterintuitive assessments. Even in lines I was very familiar with, I was amazed at the resources which modern engines show immediately.  2. I don't think White is objectively better in the Panov Botvinnik. After all of Black's main responses, 5...Nc6 @@StartBracket@@meeting 6.Nf3 with 6...Bg4@@EndBracket@@, 5...e6, and even some lines after 5...g6, he equalises with perfect play. I've suggested a number of novelties @@StartBracket@@or, rather, Stockfish and Leela suggested them - see @@StartBracket@@1@@EndBracket@@ above!@@EndBracket@@ which creates novel problems, but most of them can be neutralised with perfect play.  3. I've suggested what I believe are the objectively best moves in every position. Where equivalent moves are available, I've selected the move which poses the most practical problems. There are some traps, and some dangerous spots for Black, but White is at least equal in every line.  4.  I've been quite comprehensive in checking every black Caro-Kann repertoire published over the last 5 or 10 years. I've pointed out what these repertoires recommend, where I disagree, and where I suggest a new move. Hopefully, this will stand you in good stead against most of your opposition. Although I have great respect for many of the authors of these repertoires @@StartBracket@@all of whom, by definition, were working with less information and inferior engines to those currently available@@EndBracket@@, there were some surprising omissions. For example, my recommendation against 5...Nc6  @@StartBracket@@which is the favourite of most black repertoire authors, because it's a good move and leads to quite forcing play@@EndBracket@@ involves a well-known piece sacrifice at move 13, which wasn't mentioned in a couple of repertoires covering this line for Black. }
5... Nc6
{ This is the big main line, and the one recommended in most Caro Kann repertoires.   5...e6  has actually been played more often than 5...Nc6 @@StartBracket@@much more often if we take all the transpositions into account@@EndBracket@@, but you are less likely to meet it in practice. This is Black's sound and ambitious attempt to play a long game, generally facing an IQP where White has some initiative. I've covered this line in a lot of detail, but I'll describe the main choices here.  6.Nf3  Bb4   6...Be7  is also a very serious option  7.cxd5   7.Bd3  dxc4  8.Bxc4  O-O  9.O-O  b6  , transposing to a Nimzo Indian, is good but is not my choice.  7...Nxd5  One thing to note about the Panov, buttressed by modern engines, is that the symmetrical   7...exd5  is an underrated option for Black, both here and on subsequent moves. I've covered this whenever it arises, but be aware that these positions lead to slower play, somewhere between equal and marginally better for White.  8.Qc2   This is my preference, over the equally valid  8.Bd2  8...Nc6  Black has other moves that we'll discuss, but this is the critical option.  9.Bc4  This rare move is my recommendation, strongly supported by the engines. After 9. Bc4, we tend to get interesting IQP positions after standard responses like 9...O-O. The crux of my recommendation arises after the critical   9.Bd3  is the main line and one I've played with success. After  9...Ba5  10.a3  @@StartBracket@@to prevent ...Ndb4@@EndBracket@@,  10...h6 !   Black can win a pawn and enter a world of pain with  10...Nxc3  11.bxc3  Nxd4  12.Nxd4  Qxd4  13.O-O  (If this were forced, everyone would play the Panov with White. Unfortunately, the sober)  10...h6 !  exists, and after  exists, and after  11.O-O  O-O  White has no advantage.  9...Nb6  when instead of the meek and popular   10.Bb5  , I've been convinced by Leela of the merits of  10.Bd3  Nxd4  11.Nxd4  Qxd4  12.O-O  White has outstanding compensation and Black can equalise with perfect play.   5...g6  is an ambitious move but not a major theoretical concern. After  6.Qb3 !  Bg7  7.cxd5  O-O  8.Be2  White retains the easier position after  8...Nbd7  9.Nh3!  or   8...Na6  9.Nf3  Qb6  10.O-O  when the d5-pawn can only be regained after some concessions.   5...Be6  is a sideline which was recommended in a recent repertoire, so I'd expect it to pop up from time to time. Black obtains interesting positions but White generally has better chances after  6.Nge2 }
6. Nf3
{ This is my choice.   6.Bg5  is the big alternative. I think Black equalises by force, in well-known variations, after  6...dxc4  7.Bxc4  or   7.d5  Ne5  8.Qd4  h6  7...Qxd4 }
6... Bg4
{ From a theoretical perspective, this is the biggest challenge to the whole line.   6...g6  leads to a position which can be reached from the Symmetrical English. I've always liked White's chances after  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Qb3  , with a strong initiative.   6...Be6  was analysed by Bologan as an alternative to 6...Bg4. It's complex but White is a bit better. }

The good news is that it leads to interesting, fresh positions where White has a strong initiative. The bad news is that Black can equalise with precise play, and will be a piece up after   13.Qxb5  is overwhelmingly more popular, but Black is doing just fine after  13...Qd7   13...Nxc3  14.bxc3  Rb8  15.Qc5+  Ke8  16.Qxa7  Bd6  is also fine for Black.  14.Nxd5+  Qxd5  15.Qxd5  exd5  I've given some outline coverage of this endgame, but White has nothing. }
13... Nd6

Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white center especially the d4-pawn. As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early such as the Trompowsky and London Systems, this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line.

7... Nxd5 { Taking a central pawn while removing the attack on the c6-knight. }
8. Qb3

The alternative 8. Be2 is a safe @@StartBracket@@some might, correctly, say 'cowardly'@@EndBracket@@ line I've used on occasion. White will castle, play h3 and Qb3, and claim that his light initiative and lead in development counts for more than Black's superior structure. This line can be played with little or no preparation by both sides, and it is hardly a critical or threatening attempt. }
8... Bxf3
{ This should be included without thinking. Black spoils the white structure and compromises the defence of the d4-pawn. The g4-bishop could otherwise have become a tactical target, Ne5 could have been an option, and generally this move must be played. }
9. gxf3
{ Take that bishop! It's not immediately obvious why  9.Qxb7??  which has been played in several games is a bad move, but the answer is  9...Ndb4!  , when the threats of ...Nc2+ and, in particular, ...Rb8 trapping the queen gives Black a very winning position. Of course, it looks slightly murky and White has even won some games from here, but my editors have told me I'm not allowed to recommend lines which start with an assessment of -7, so I'll finish my coverage here. }
9... e6
{ Solidly defending the knight and opening a line for the f8-bishop to develop. }
10. Qxb7

11. Bb5+
{ This disruptive move is key. Simply taking on d5 would give Black a very comfortable endgame. }
11... Nxb5 { No choice. } 12. Qc6+
{ Another precise disruptive move. After the straightforward  12.Qxb5+  Black blocks with  Qd7  White can include one more cute move with  13.Nxd5!  but after  exd5   13...Qxb5??  14.Nc7+  leaves White a piece up in the endgame  White should take  14.Qxd7  , with a harmless version of the endgame I'll cover in the informational chapter. Instead,   14.Qb3?  is a poor move, since after  Bd6  Black, who has retained castling rights, will follow up with  ...O-O  and more than likely launch a mating attack against the shattered white kingside structure. }
12... Ke7
{ Because the white queen is attacking the a8-rook,  12...Qd7??  isn't an option. }
13. Qxb5
{ I thought I should include some basic analysis of the endgame which can arise in the Panov main line, for a couple of reasons. First, I wanted to explain why I am recommending the alternative @@StartBracket@@Grischuk's 13.Qc5+@@EndBracket@@. Second, since this line has long been known to be fine for Black, I wanted to check whether modern engines @@StartBracket@@Stockfish and Leela@@EndBracket@@ had any views on Black's established equalising attempts. The silicon monsters did come up with some interesting points, but not enough to convince me to recommend this line. However, if you want a quieter alternative to 13.Qc5+, you might use these ideas as a starting point for your own analysis. }
13... Qd7
{ This is the main move, with over 1000 games in the database.  Even before modern engines became monstrously strong, their predecessors  (as shown in top correspondence games)  showed that Black has a very decent alternative in   13...Nxc3  14.bxc3  This was condemned for decades on the basis of R.Fischer - M.Euwe, Leipzig Olympiad 1960 @@StartBracket@@1-0 in 36@@EndBracket@@, where White won a classic after 14...Qd7 15.Rb1!, a game so good that it even made it into Fischer's 'My 60 Memorable Games.' However, engines @@StartBracket@@and Schandorff@@EndBracket@@ have pointed out that  14...Rb8 !  is a good option, with very decent compensation for the pawn after  15.Qc5+  Ke8  16.Qxa7  Bd6 }
14. Nxd5+
{ Nikita Petrov recently tried   14.a4  against Alexei Shirov, but it didn't change much after  14...a6 }
14... Qxd5
{ When I first learned this line, I was told to include the 'sophisticated' }
15. Bg5+
{ to force ...f6, and a weakening on e6. This doesn't seem to change much. Neither Stockfish nor Leela like 15.Bg5+ much, although they don't see an advantage after other moves either.  Some players such as Adams have preferred   15.Qxd5  exd5  and simply playing this position, where White can castle on either side.  16.O-O  After Leela's preference   16.Bd2  Ke6  17.O-O-O  both Leela and Stockfish suggest some lines with ...f6, suggesting that 15.Bg5+ wasn't as clever as it might have appeared.  Rd8  17.Rd1  d4  is an endgame where Black has experienced no problems.   15.Qe2  is Leela's preference, and has been tried by Jobava, Kobalia and Vajda. I think that, after this move, White gets a worse version of the middlegame positions arising from Grischuk's 13.Qc5+, since the black structure is immaculate and his queen is perfectly centralised. }
15... f6 16. Qxd5 exd5
{ The d5-pawn is isolated, but it's also passed. Based on the structure, where White has a potential outside passed pawn on the queenside and a horrible kingside structure, I suppose White would have the better chances in a pawn or bishop endgame, but typically rook endgames quickly arise here, where Black has sufficient activity for full equality even in the lines where he sacrifices a pawn. }
17. Be3 Ke6 18. O-O-O Bb4
{ Developing the bishop to its most active square and connecting the rooks. It's also important to prevent Re1. }
19. a3
{ This is the main move, after which Black can trade bishops and play a comfortable rook endgame. }
19... Rhc8+ 20. Kb1 Bc5
{ White has more chances of an advantage after other bishop retreats. } 21.
Rhe1 Bxe3 22. Rxe3+

23. Rde1 Rc4
{ Activating the rook along the fifth rank @@StartBracket@@from Black's perspective@@EndBracket@@. }
24. Re7 Rh4
{ By a small margin, the most popular move in practice. Here I was interested in Leela's suggestion   24...Rf4  is preferred by both Stockfish and Leela.  25.R1e6+  Kc5  26.Rxg7  Rxf3  27.Rxh7  Rxf2  and Black made effortless draws in M.Nikolov - K.Rusev, Bankia 2013 and V.Diu - N.Nguyen, Hanoi 2018. }
25. Kc2
{ 25.R1e6+  has been tried more often, with the continuation  25...Kc5  26.Rxg7  Rxh2  27.Rxf6  Rxf2  28.Rxh7  Rb8  It's true that White is a pawn up and should never lose this position. However, the black activity and heavily reduced material suggest that Black should hold the draw without much trouble. For example,  29.Rc7+  Kd4  30.Rc2  Rxc2  31.Kxc2  a5 !  has led to four draws in four games. White is not better here, despite the pawn count. }
25... Rxh2 26. Kd3
{ Continuing to play for maximum activity. I was impressed that the Dutch GM Dimitri Reinderman played this way back in 2008. If Black takes on f2, White can bring his king to d4 with some initiative, but 26...d4!? is one of several equalising options. }

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6
{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

6... Bg4
{ Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white center especially the d4-pawn. As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early such as the Trompowsky and London Systems, this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line.

The alternative 8. Be2 is a safe @@StartBracket@@some might, correctly, say 'cowardly'@@EndBracket@@ line I've used on occasion.

8... Bxf3

Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }
6. Nf3

6... Bg4
{ Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white center especially the d4-pawn. As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early such as the Trompowsky and London Systems, this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line. We'll cover  6...g6  in a dedicated chapter.   6...Be6!?  is another sideline with a reasonable pedigree, and was given by Bologan as an alternative to the main line.

7... Nxd5 { Taking a central pawn while removing the attack on the c6-knight. }
8. Qb3

The alternative 8. Be2 is a safe @@StartBracket@@some might, correctly, say 'cowardly'@@EndBracket@@ line I've used on occasion. White will castle, play h3 and Qb3, and claim that his light initiative and lead in development counts for more than Black's superior structure. This line can be played with little or no preparation by both sides, and it is hardly a critical or threatening attempt. }
8... Bxf3

9. gxf3

Of course, it looks slightly murky and White has even won some games from here, but my editors have told me I'm not allowed to recommend lines which start with an assessment of -7, so I'll finish my coverage here. }

Instead,   14.Qb3?  is a poor move, since after  Bd6  Black, who has retained castling rights, will follow up with  ...O-O  and more than likely launch a mating attack against the shattered white kingside structure. }
12... Ke7

13. Qc5+
{ An incredible idea, uncorked by Grischuk against Vidit in the World Rapid in Doha, 2016. At first sight this move looks like a horrible blunder, that White has become confused with the subtle Qxb7-c6+ sidesteps, and that he will resign once 13...Nd6 lands on the board. However, things are not so simple at all. The move post-dates Schandorff's book, and isn't mentioned by Fernandez, Winterberg, or Rambaldi in their works, although Bologan's book has some good coverage. I was given advance access to Erwin l'Ami's Lifetime Repertoires Caro-Kann course, and his proposed response is excellent.

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white center especially the d4-pawn. As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early such as the Trompowsky and London Systems, this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line. We'll cover  6...g6  in a dedicated chapter.   6...Be6!?  is another sideline with a reasonable pedigree, and was given by Bologan as an alternative to the main line.

7... Nxd5 { Taking a central pawn while removing the attack on the c6-knight. }

The alternative 8. Be2 is a safe @@StartBracket@@some might, correctly, say 'cowardly'@@EndBracket@@ line I've used on occasion.

8... Bxf3

9. gxf3

13. Qc5+

However, things are not so simple at all. The move post-dates Schandorff's book, and isn't mentioned by Fernandez, Winterberg, or Rambaldi in their works, although Bologan's book has some good coverage. I was given advance access to Erwin l'Ami's Lifetime Repertoires Caro-Kann course, and his proposed response is excellent.

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }
6. Nf3

Black needs to know his stuff, but if he goes for this line he generally will. }
6... Bg4
{ Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white center especially the d4-pawn. As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early such as the Trompowsky and London Systems, this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line. We'll cover  6...g6  in a dedicated chapter.   6...Be6!?  is another sideline with a reasonable pedigree, and was given by Bologan as an alternative to the main line.

7... Nxd5 { Taking a central pawn while removing the attack on the c6-knight. }
8. Qb3
{ Initiating a very sharp tactical sequence. As often happens, such sequences can end up in simplifications and relatively dry positions, but both sides have opportunities to deviate. The alternative 8. Be2 is a safe @@StartBracket@@some might, correctly, say 'cowardly'@@EndBracket@@ line I've used on occasion. White will castle, play h3 and Qb3, and claim that his light initiative and lead in development counts for more than Black's superior structure. This line can be played with little or no preparation by both sides, and it is hardly a critical or threatening attempt. }
8... Bxf3

9. gxf3

It's not immediately obvious why  9.Qxb7??  which has been played in several games is a bad move, but the answer is  9...Ndb4!  , when the threats of ...Nc2+ and, in particular, ...Rb8 trapping the queen gives Black a very winning position. Of course, it looks slightly murky and White has even won some games from here, but my editors have told me I'm not allowed to recommend lines which start with an assessment of -7, so I'll finish my coverage here. }
9... e6

Instead,   14.Qb3?  is a poor move, since after  Bd6  Black, who has retained castling rights, will follow up with  ...O-O  and more than likely launch a mating attack against the shattered white kingside structure. }
12... Ke7
{ Because the white queen is attacking the a8-rook,  12...Qd7??  isn't an option. }
13. Qc5+
{ An incredible idea, uncorked by Grischuk against Vidit in the World Rapid in Doha, 2016. At first sight this move looks like a horrible blunder, that White has become confused with the subtle Qxb7-c6+ sidesteps, and that he will resign once 13...Nd6 lands on the board. However, things are not so simple at all. The move post-dates Schandorff's book, and isn't mentioned by Fernandez, Winterberg, or Rambaldi in their works, although Bologan's book has some good coverage. I was given advance access to Erwin l'Ami's Lifetime Repertoires Caro-Kann course, and his proposed response is excellent.

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line.

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games.

Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.   6...g6!?  is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to  5...g6  , since White generally doesn't develop his knight to  f3  in that line.

Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6
{ I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.   Compared to 5... e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5... g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5... Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5... e6.   Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5... Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.   The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between  6.Nf3  which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame   and  6.Bg5  which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical  6...dxc4  often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.   Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...g6!?  and  6...Be6!?  have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,  White can try the fresh  7.Bg5!?  or the innocuous  7.cxd5  Nxd5  8.Be2  , where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess. }
6. Nf3
{ Knights before bishops, as they say.  6.Bg5  is the principal alternative. I rejected it because I think Black can force a draw after  dxc4  @@StartBracket@@not the only move@@EndBracket@@  7.Bxc4   7.d5  keeps life in the position but does not lead to a white advantage.  7...Qxd4  8.Qxd4  Nxd4  9.O-O-O  e5  10.f4  Bg4  11.Nf3  Bxf3  12.gxf3  O-O-O  This is rare but is covered by both Fernandez and Winterberg in their repertoire works. Black needs to know his stuff, but if he goes for this line he generally will. }
6... Bg4
{ Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white centre  @@StartBracket@@especially the d4-pawn@@EndBracket@@. As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early @@StartBracket@@such as the Trompowsky and London Systems@@EndBracket@@, this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3.6...g6!? is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to 5... g6, since White generally doesn't develop his knight to f3 in that line. We'll cover 6...g6 in a dedicated chapter. 6...Be6!? is another sideline with a reasonable pedigree, and was given by Bologan as an alternative to the main line. Have a look at the dedicated chapter! }
7. cxd5
{ White decides to resolve the central tension, because he's spotted some tactical weaknesses on d5 and b7. He also benefits from the black knight coming to d5, since it shields the d4-pawn from attack by the black queen  @@StartBracket@@which, in combination with the c6-knight and the g4-bishop, was starting to exert unpleasant pressure@@EndBracket@@. }
7... Nxd5 { Taking a central pawn while removing the attack on the c6-knight. }
8. Qb3
{ Initiating a very sharp tactical sequence. As often happens, such sequences can end up in simplifications and relatively dry positions, but both sides have opportunities to deviate. The alternative 8. Be2 is a safe @@StartBracket@@some might, correctly, say 'cowardly'@@EndBracket@@ line I've used on occasion. White will castle, play h3 and Qb3, and claim that his light initiative and lead in development counts for more than Black's superior structure. This line can be played with little or no preparation by both sides, and it is hardly a critical or threatening attempt. }
8... Bxf3
{ This should be included without thinking. Black spoils the white structure and compromises the defence of the d4-pawn. The g4-bishop could otherwise have become a tactical target, Ne5 could have been an option, and generally this move must be played. }
9. gxf3
{ Take that bishop! It's not immediately obvious why  9.Qxb7??  which has been played in several games is a bad move, but the answer is  9...Ndb4!  , when the threats of ...Nc2+ and, in particular, ...Rb8 trapping the queen gives Black a very winning position. Of course, it looks slightly murky and White has even won some games from here, but my editors have told me I'm not allowed to recommend lines which start with an assessment of -7, so I'll finish my coverage here. }
9... e6
{ Solidly defending the knight and opening a line for the f8-bishop to develop. }
10. Qxb7
{ White can't switch to slow play yet, his structure is shattered and his centre is collapsing, so he needs to keep shooting until he runs out of bullets. }
10... Nxd4
{ Another move which achieves an awful lot, dealing with the threat to the knight, re-establishing material parity, and creating an unpleasant threat of ...Nc2+. }
11. Bb5+
{ This disruptive move is key. Simply taking on d5 would give Black a very comfortable endgame. }
11... Nxb5 { No choice. } 12. Qc6+
{ Another precise disruptive move. @@StartBracket@@After the straightforward 12. Qxb5+ Black blocks with Qd7 White can include one more cute move with 13. Nxd5! but after exd5 @@StartBracket@@13... Qxb5?? 14. Nc7+ leaves White a piece up in the endgame@@EndBracket@@ White should take on d7, with a harmless version of the endgame I'll cover in the informational chapter. Instead, 14. Qb3? is a poor move, since after Bd6 Black, who has retained castling rights, will follow up with ...0-0 and more than likely launch a mating attack against the shattered white kingside structure.@@EndBracket@@ }
12... Ke7
{ Because the white queen is attacking the a8-rook,  12...Qd7??  isn't an option. }
13. Qc5+
{ An incredible idea, uncorked by Grischuk against Vidit in the World Rapid in Doha, 2016. At first sight this move looks like a horrible blunder, that White has become confused with the subtle Qxb7-c6+ sidesteps, and that he will resign once 13...Nd6 lands on the board. However, things are not so simple at all. The move post-dates Schandorff's book, and isn't mentioned by Fernandez, Winterberg, or Rambaldi in their works, although Bologan's book has some good coverage. I was given advance access to Erwin l'Ami's Lifetime Repertoires Caro-Kann course, and his proposed response is excellent. Generally, I would not expect to particularly surprise one's opponent with this line, but rather to rely on the relatively fresh and challenging positions which tend to arise. }
13... Nd6
{ Unsurprisingly, this has been Black's choice in correspondence chess. It is also Bologan's recommendation. }
14. Nxd5+
{ White needs to open some lines to justify dropping a piece. Taking the knight with }
14... exd5
{ is critical, not because it's better than 14...Kd7 @@StartBracket@@it isn't - both lines lead to equality with best play@@EndBracket@@ but because White is a piece down and needs to play energetically both to create chances, and not to lose. I will again take a correspondence game as our model, since these guys tend to show the way. This is also the line recommended by Erwin l'Ami in his Lifetime Repertoires course. }
15. O-O
{ Putting the king into relative safety and preparing to deliver check with the Rook on e1.   15.Qxd5  has also been played in some games and is more or less as good it can even transpose  , but bringing another piece into the attack is better attacking technique and so should be preferred in principle. }
15... Qb6
{ Opening the way for the a8-rook to join the action @@StartBracket@@and perhaps to exchange a white rook@@EndBracket@@. Of course White can't trade queens, which would lead to a hopeless endgame. }
16. Qxd5
{ Avoiding the queen exchange, taking a pawn and attacking the rook on a8. At first sight this looks dangerous for Black but, as we have come to expect, engines tell us it's a draw. }

Qb3 Bxf3 9. gxf3 Nb6
{ A very sharp line with a slightly dubious reputation relative to  9...e6  , which has always been regarded as a clean equaliser, but one which has been repeatedly played by strong GMs who know what they're doing, such as Dreev. I've previously played and recommended  10.Be3  followed by long castling, but for this course I was attracted by an ambitious alternative played about as often as 10.Be3 which immediately seizes space and gains time. }
10. d5 { Asking Black a question. He really should know the answer. } 10... Nd4
{ The only move. } 11. Bb5+
{ This has been played slightly less often than  11.Qd1  , but it's the engines' favourite and, in my opinion, the better move. }
11... Nd7
{ Again, all but the worst prepared players will know this move if they are going for 9...Nb6. }
12. Qa4 { Attacking all of the knights. } 12... Nxb5 13. Qxb5 g6 14. O-O
{ Quick development is the most logical option. White doesn't want to allow Black to consolidate.  14.Qxb7  Bg7  15.O-O  has been played in a few games. If Black played the senseless  15...a6?  we would transpose to Rozentalis - Adams which arose after  11...Nxb5?  where, you might recall, I suggested  16.d6!  However  14.O-O!  is a much better move, when Black has decent compensation for the pawn. As well as the extra tempo since  ...a6  isn't an especially useful move here, it makes a huge difference that White's d-pawn is on  d5  , rather than on  d6  and passed. }
14... Bg7 15. Re1 O-O
{ Continuing to offer the b7-pawn. We're still not interested. } 16. Bg5 Bf6
{ By far the most common and well-established move. One of Black's ideas, if White takes on f6, is to recapture with the e7-pawn, thus eliminating his weakness on e7. Even with a normal configuration of white pawns on the kingside @@StartBracket@@i.e. with the f3-pawn on g2@@EndBracket@@, the resulting structure could be excellent for Black if his pieces were placed correctly and, in particular, if his knight were on d6, blockading the d5-pawn and protecting the b7-pawn. I learned about this structure from Gawain Jones @@StartBracket@@who used it to crush me in Kilkenny 2012!@@EndBracket@@. }
17. h4
{ I suppose it won't surprise anyone to learn that this is Leela's preference. Instead of exchanging bishops, White plays for a bind. His structure is ugly, but effective. The d5-pawn controls space and leaves the e7-pawn rather weak. White's kingside structure is far from ideal, but the black pieces are too passive to exploit it.   17.Bxf6  is the main move, but I haven't been able to make it work for White.  Nxf6!  This is the best scoring move and preferred by the engines, although the alternative recapture has been played slightly more often.  18.Qxb7  This position has strong drawish tendencies, for example after  Rb8  19.Qxa7  Nxd5  , which has been played in a couple of games. The knights will probably be exchanged and we are likely to reach a major piece endgame @@StartBracket@@with or without queens@@EndBracket@@ where White might have an extra pawn on the queenside but his compromised kingside structure provides excellent drawing chances. }
17... a6
{ This is Stockfish's favourite defence, using a tactic to remove the white queen from its threatening position. }
18. Qe2
{ The best square for the queen.  18.Qxb7?  Nc5  19.Qb4  Nd3  and Black wins an exchange. }
18... Re8 19. Rad1
{ I think White has the better chances, and that his position is much easier to play. Despite cosmetic defects, his pawn structure controls a lot of space. The e7-pawn requires protection and the d6-advance is a dynamic possibility which Black must constantly monitor. All the white pieces are more active than their counterparts. Black is relying on his solid structure and a blockade. White's next moves to improve his position will probably include Kg2 and Ne4. Note that ...Bxg5 hxg5 is a very double-edged decision by Black, due to the half-open h-file and control of the f6-square. }

{ Back in the day, Capablanca taught us that a pawn could be sacrificed for 3 tempi.

However, the attack on the h7 pawn will cost Black more time to meet, and his queen on d4 will be exposed to attack admittedly, in the main line, Black will try to solve both of these problems in one move. The centre is open, which makes it easier for White to develop his initiative. And the developed black pieces aren't well-placed. The b4-bishop is always a tactical target. To channel more classical wisdom of dubious provenance, one of the greats Tarrasch? Tartakower? is meant to have said something about knights on b3 or b6 always being misplaced. If you're not convinced by my general description from first principles, you can rest assured that both Stockfish and Leela say this line works for White.

I'll give some explanation of my choices along the way. Throughout the material in this section, we will see very typical positions where White has an isolated queen's pawn IQP. In fact, these positions are so typical that we can often transpose into other openings, especially the Semi Tarrasch, but also the Nimzo Indian, c3-Sicilian, Symmetrical English, etc. I'm not going to point out all or even most of these transpositions, since it's not especially interesting and would take up valuable time which we could spend talking about how to play the positions instead of which openings they come from. For more information on IQP structures, interested readers should look at Ivan Sokolov's 'Winning Chess Middlegames', Mauricio Flores Rios' 'Chess Structures: A Grandmaster Guide', or the excellent older work by Alex Baburin, 'Winning Pawn Structures'. }
6. Nf3
{ A very natural developing move, especially when there's no ...Bg4 in the position. }
6... Bb4 { Pinning the c3-knight is the most ambitious move. } 7. cxd5
{ I've always preferred this move, which keeps the game in Panov territory.   7.Bd3  dxc4  8.Bxc4  O-O  9.O-O  b6  transposes to the 'Karpov Variation' of the Nimzo Indian  @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/ PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@ 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 O-O Bd3 c5 6. Nf3 d5 7.O-O dxc4 Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4   9...b6  , which has a good reputation for Black. }
7... Nxd5
{ The most ambitious recapture, maintaining a better structure and creating an immediate threat on c3. }
8. Qc2
{ My favourite move, defending the c3-knight, although I've gone for a less common continuation on the next move. White even has a modest minus score here, which is unsurprising such symmetrical lines are often chosen by players with lower ratings than their opponents, and passive play is as dangerous in symmetrical positions as anywhere else. I can't find any edge here and this isn't suitable for a main repertoire choice.   8.Bd2  is the main alternative. This can also transpose into Semi-Tarrasch or Nimzo positions in some cases. After  8...Nc6  9.Bd3  O-O  10.O-O  Be7  Leela shows a strong preference for  11.Nxd5  I would prefer the most popular move   11.a3  exd5  12.h3  as essayed in G. Jones - A. Giri, Wijk aan Zee 2018, draw in 25. }
8... Nc6
{ Overwhelmingly Black's most popular choice, but not his only reasonable move. }
9. Bc4
{ This is Leela's preference, and leads to standard positions with an IQP. I've also found an interesting idea after Black's most common move , which makes this line quite attractive for White. It's also not mentioned by Rambadli, who covers 5...e6 as an alternative to his main recommendation 5...Nc6.  Unfortunately, everyone knows this now, so 10...h6! is the universal choice of GMs reaching the position after 10.a3. I've found no advantage, nor even a way to maintain an interesting position. As after 8.Bd2, Leela and Stockfish start advocating for symmetrical structures with an early Nxd5 exd5, where a draw becomes an overwhelming favourite.  Nb6 The main continuation is   9.Bd3  Ba5  10.a3  Now  10...Nxc3 ?  remains by far the most common move in the database but I think it's really poor both objectively and practically. No strong GMs have essayed this for about 10 years. The game continues  11.bxc3  Nxd4  12.Nxd4  Qxd4  13.Bb5+  Bd7  14.O-O  Qd5  15.c4  Qf5  16.Bxd7+  Kxd7  and the black king gets kicked around for the rest of the game. }
9... Nb6
{ The most popular move, and a natural response to Bc4 since both the bishop and the d4-pawn are hanging. }
10. Bd3
{ This pawn sacrifice is Leela's big idea, and I'm delighted to present its analysis!   10.Bb5  has been White's universal over-the-board choice including GMs Andreikin, Savic and Timman, but correspondence players have shown that White can sacrifice the d4-pawn. }
10... Nxd4 { Black basically has to go for this. } 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 12. O-O
{ Back in the day, Capablanca taught us that a pawn could be sacrificed for 3 tempi. On that metric, you might think that this position doesn't look impressive for White, who is only slightly ahead in development. However, the attack on the h7 pawn will cost Black more time to meet, and his queen on d4 will be exposed to attack admittedly, in the main line, Black will try to solve both of these problems in one move. The centre is open, which makes it easier for White to develop his initiative. And the developed black pieces aren't well-placed. The b4-bishop is always a tactical target. To channel more classical wisdom of dubious provenance, one of the greats Tarrasch? Tartakower? is meant to have said something about knights on b3 or b6 always being misplaced. If you're not convinced by my general description from first principles, you can rest assured that both Stockfish and Leela say this line works for White. For the moment, Nb5 is a huge threat, so Black's options are quite restricted. }
12... Qh4
{ This might look artificial, but the black queen steps away from Be3 or Rd1 with tempo, while defending h7 and so preparing kingside castling and potentially attacking h2. }
13. Bb5+
{ A strong novelty proposed by Leela.   13.Ne4  O-O !  led to a draw after very high quality play in I.Mende - P.Raivio, ICCF email 2016 in 22 moves }
13... Bd7 14. Bxd7+ Nxd7 15. Qa4
{ Keeping the black king in the centre for a while. } 15... Be7 16. Ne4
{ Of course White isn't interested in an immediate queen exchange. Note that Nd6+ is a threat. }
16... Kf8 { Avoiding Nd6+. } 17. Qxd7 Qxe4 18. Be3
{ White is still a pawn down, but his lead in development and pressure on Black's queenside pawns provides full compensation. }
18... f5
{ Creating a square on f7 for the king, with an option to generate kingside counterplay by running the f-pawn. }
19. Rac1 Rd8 20. Qc7 { Bc5 is now a serious threat. } 20... Qd5 21. Bc5 Qd7 22.

8... Nbd7
{ By far the most popular move, with almost 1, 400 games compared to 450 with  8...Na6  Black prepares to bring the knight to b6, to exert pressure on the d5-pawn. The knight also blocks the half-open b-file, allowing the c8-bishop to develop without dropping the b7-pawn. }
9. Nh3
{ The most accurate continuation, directly bringing the knight to f4. It's only been played in about 25 games compared to almost 1, 300 with 9. Bf3 but it's just a better move. This is also the reason why Sam Shankland assessed 8...Nbd7 as dubious and preferred 8...Na6 in his Lifetime Repertoires series.   After the far more popular  9.Bf3  Nb6  10.Nge2  Bg4!  is a good move, forcing  11.Bxg4  Nxg4  White's light-squared bishop has taken several moves to trade itself on  g4.
