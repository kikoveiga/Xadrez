1. d4
{ Welcome to the wonderful world of the Jobava London System ! A simple yet effective opening. An opening that is young in its life but has a great future. I came across this opening when watching the games of GM Baadur Jobava. My first thought was, 'What is this opening, why haven't I seen it before ?!'. Then the more I researched it the more I thought it would be a perfect opening for numerous players.What are the benefits of the opening ?   1  It is a perfect opening for people who have little time on their hands. That is because the ideas and moves are simple to learn. There is very little 'theory' as such and as long as you master the main ideas and concepts it will offer you lots of fun and exciting games. Compared to other openings where mountains of varations need to be learnt, this makes 'The Jobava London System' an attractive opening. In essence, it is very simple yet very powerful.  2  The opening hasn't been around for long. It is fresh and fun ! This opening has really only started to gain momentum at top level in the last ten years, so in the terms of openings, it is a youngster ! This means there are areas of it that are still to be explored.  3  It is perfect for beginners, juniors, people with bad memories and experts alike ! As I have mentioned, the Jobava London's starting moves are very easy to learn. There are not many long lines which also makes it attractive to those of us who do not want to just rely on our memories but instead want to be creative.  4  Black cannot play on 'auto-pilot'. Meaning that many players on the Black side might have learnt what to do against standard White d4 openings, but the Jobava-London is different. This means that it will surprise Black at an early stage, which cannot be a bad thing. Convinced yet ? Probably not ! Well, let me show you some moves. }
1... d5
{ There are three main ways that Black can play against the Jobava-London System.   1  Systems with ...d5. This is very common and we start this course by looking at all possibilities here.  2  Systems with ...g6. Of course, many people play ...g6 and we must know what to do against those lines.  3  ...c5 ...Bb4 and other ideas. Speaks for itself ! These come at the end of the course.    1...Nf6  2.Nc3  and already Black cannot play on autopilot ! Another reason I love this opening.  g6  3.Bf4  Bg7   3...d5  4.e3  Bg7  5.h4 !  4.e4 !  With good chances to attack as we will study later.   1...c5  is looked at in the final chapter. }
2. Nc3
{ Already taking Black out of mainline theory ! This does seem similar to a very popular opening, The Italian Game, with 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 and 3. Bc4. We are doing that, but with 1. d4 ! }
2... Nf6 3. Bf4
{ The starting position for our adventures ! This bishop is often a great piece as we will see later. One thing I love about this opening is that White often gets a good version of the standard London System. This is due to the Knight on c3, which is much more of an active piece in the Jobava-London System.The way I have structured this course is as follows: We first take a look at some key concepts that will help you as you learn, then...   1  Part 1 - d4 d5 set-ups;  2  Part 2 - ...g6 set-ups;  3  Part 3 - ...c5 ...Bb4 and other set-ups. With each chapter I do, I first take a couple of 'informational' games that show you the main points of the opening. After I have shown these games I move on to the theory that you need to know.I do recommend that you also buy the videos as I find them a much easier way to learn !  (also more cash for me ;-) }

[Black "Common Ideas for White Part 1 - Nb5!"]
[Result "*"]

{ A very typical plan that works well for White in the Jobava London System is the idea of playing Nb5 against ...c5. This is one main difference between the Jobava London system and the standard London System: in the standard London System White's Knight is much more passive, stuck on b1. We now look at some common situations where Nb5 should be considered. }
1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 { Watch this Knight dance ! } 2... e6
{ 2...Nf6  3.Bf4  c5  is an important line, which is very popular and been recommended as a good way for Black to play.  4.e3   4.Nb5 ?  is premature. This is an instance where you should not play Nb5 ! Always watch out for the check on a5...  Qa5+  A major problem. White needs a pawn on e3 for this idea to work, as then the Knight on b5 will be defended by the Bishop on f1.  4...Nc6 ?  A couple of IMs have played this against me in Blitz ! It is practically a losing mistake due to  5.Nb5  Black cannot even play ...Na6 here !  e5  The best chance, but White is well on his way to winning after  6.Bxe5. }
3. Bf4 Nf6 4. e3
{ 4.Nb5  is playable, even Jobava has tried it, but in this course I am not recommending this setup. We will only be going Nb5 when Black has already moved his c-pawn. Here Black can play  Na6  and ...c6 next, kicking the Knight on b5 away. When Black already has a pawn on c5 this idea is not possible.  5.e3  c6  and White is forced back. }
4... c5 { A slight mistake already ! } 5. Nb5
{ This is a good plan when it forces Black to play ...Na6. } 5... Na6
{ Now Black's Knight on a6 and Rook on a8 will have trouble moving. The Rook has to guard a7 while the Knight stops Nc7+. White has a very nice hold on the Queenside. }
6. c3
{ This is a good version of the standard London as White's Knight is much better on the more active b5 square. }
6... Be7
{ 6...Qb6  7.a4  Be7  and now we see another standard idea that we get to soon.  8.Nf3 !  O-O  9.Ne5 !  The Knight is well placed on e5, a beautiful central square. 1-0  (29)  Bauer,C  (2630)  -Berend,F  (2346)  Maastricht NED 2017 }
7. a4
{ Securing the Queenside with an advantage. Black's pieces are worse placed compared to White's. White has a strong bind on the Queenside. }

[Black "Common Ideas for White Part 2 - Domination of the dark squares"]
[Result "*"]

{ You will often find yourself trying to dominate the dark squares in the centre of the board - especially d4 and c5. This can be done with pawns or with pieces. Piece domination of these squares works especially well after the sequence ...c5 dxc5, when the d4 square is free for a White piece to jump into. It works even better when both dark-squared Bishops have already been exchanged. There are many examples of this. Take the next game which I played: }
1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 e6 4. e3
{ We have one of the most popular starting positions of the Jobava London, and now my opponent played the rather rare move 4... Bd6. }
4... Bd6 { An interesting idea, trying to gain some central control. } 5. Bd3
{ Ignoring Black's idea and continuing with developing my pieces to the best squares. The Bishop is great on d3, looking at starting an attack against h7. }
5... Bxf4
{ There were, of course, other options but my opponent decided to double my pawns. In this case, I do not mind as having a pawn on f4 improves my position in several ways.   1  I have extra control of the e5 square.  2  I have a half-open file  (the e-file)  for a Rook to slip into.  3  My opponent can give up hopes of playing ...e5, therefore his Bishop on c8 is now a very passive piece. }
6. exf4 c5 { It is unclear what Black does without this break. } 7. dxc5
{ Simple and good. It will take Black time to win the pawn on c5 back and now I can concentrate on controlling the d4 and e5 squares. }
7... O-O 8. Nf3
{ 8.b4  was playable, but I felt a bit greedy. After something like  b6  my opponent may gain active Queenside counterplay. There was no need to allow him so much fun. }
8... Qc7 9. Qd2
{ Moving my Queen to control the two critical dark squares: d4 and e5. } 9...
Qxc5 10. Qe3
{ Simple stuff ! I am happy with an exchange of Queens, as then I have better development and better pieces. Just look at his Bishop on c8. }
10... Qb4
{ My opponent dislikes the exchange and tries to keep the Queens on, but this causes more problems. }
11. O-O { Simple again ! } 11... Nc6
{ 11...Qxb2  fails to  12.Rab1  Qa3  13.Nxd5 !  Nxd5  14.Bxh7+  Kxh7  15.Qxa3. }
12. a3 { Away with you Queen ! } 12... Qd6 13. Nb5
{ Continuing the dark square strategy. This time I aiming to control d4. }
13... Qe7 14. Rfe1
{ The Rook belongs on this half-open file. This time e5 is the square we are gaining more control over. }
14... Re8 15. Ne5 a6 16. Nd4 Nxd4 17. Qxd4
{ My strategy has been a success. Just look at how well I am controlling d4 and e5. It is also worth comparing the remaining Bishops. I have a beast on d3, whilst my opponent has a lemon on c8. A dead lemon ! 1-0  (71)  Williams,S  (2457)  -Ferrington,N  (2130)  Telford ENG 2018 }

[Result "*"]

{ I certainly do not need any encouragement to play h2-h4 ! The great thing about the Jobava-London is that this idea is standard in numerous lines where Black plays ...g6. Let's take a look at some examples. }
1. d4 Nf6
{ 1...g6  2.h4 !?  is certainly not stupid ! I tried this at the British Championships against FM Charlie Storey. The idea is that after   2.Nc3  Bg7  3.Bf4  is another way to play.  2...Nf6  Stopping  (maybe not, but that is another story !)  h4-h5. We can transpose back into one of the main lines in the Jobava-London System with  3.Nc3  aiming for e4, so  3...d5  stopping e4 seems natural, and now  4.Bf4  Bg7  5.e3  brings us to one of the most important positions for the opening which will be studied in detail later. }
2. Nc3
{ With the idea to play e4. This is great as players who play the Kings Indian Defence, Benko, Benoni and Grunfeld will have to start thinking at this point, as there is no easy way for them to get the positions that they want to play.   2.Bf4  is another move that you might want to experiment with. Saying that, I feel that 2. Nc3 is much more forcing.  2...g6  3.Nc3  d5  4.e3  Bg7  5.h4  and we have the same position on the board. }
2... d5 { 2...g6  3.Bf4  d5  4.e3  leads to the same thing. } 3. Bf4 g6
{ Now we have a target to attack ! First I like to play e3. } 4. e3
{ This craftily supports our pawn advancing to h5. } 4... Bg7 5. h4
{ Here it is ! This is such a fun and simple way to play. It is not just myself who has tried this idea, players such as Aronian and Karjakin have as well. The idea is to play h5 and pressurize Black's Kingside. }
5... O-O
{ 5...Nbd7 ?  has been played. Now back to common idea one...  6.Nb5  winning. }
6. h5 Nxh5 { This move is a mistake ! } 7. Rxh5
{ We will see later that White gains a very big attack from this moment onwards. }

[Black "Common Ideas for White Part 4 - Nf3 and then Ne5"]
[Result "*"]

{ Like in the traditional London System, a very strong idea that you will be playing is Nf3 and then Ne5 ! The Knight is often very strongly positioned on the e5-square from where it controls several squares. If Black ever attempts to exchange it off with something along the lines of ...Nbd7 and ...Nxe5 White will normally capture back on e5 with a Bishop if Black has played ...g6 and ...Bg7, or retake with a pawn if Black has not played ...g6. Why ? Well, White wanted to exchange the Bishop on g7  (if it has moved there)  so moving the Bishop to e5 makes that exchange more likely. On the other hand, a pawn capturing on e5 can become a strong attacking unit. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4
{ We are following a game that I played. Our theory deals with 2. Nc3 as this move cuts out a lot of options Black has. Saying that, 2. Bf4 is another move order you may want to experiment with.   2.Nc3  d5  3.Bf4  g6  is the move order that we will concentrate on in this course. }
2... g6 3. Nc3 d5 { We are back into normal waters. } 4. e3 Bg7 5. h4
{ We have seen this idea already ! } 5... c6
{ A flexible move. My opponent didn't want to commit his King into an attack on the Kingside and this move cuts out Nb5 ideas and in some cases allows Black's Queen access to b6 or a5. }
6. Be2
{ Another important moment. I apologize in advance for the capitals... WHEN BLACK HAS PLAYED ...g6 WHITE'S LIGHT-SQUARED BISHOP BELONGS ON e2. I shouted that as it is important. The Bishop is blocked on d3 as the pawn on g6 stops it from attacking. On e2 we also avoid the pin that could occur after Nf3 ...Bg4. Now we can meet that idea with Ne5. }
6... Qa5 { Aiming for ...Ne4. } 7. Qd2 { Stopping my opponent's idea. } 7... b5
{ Very ambitious play. This pawn can also create weaknesses though, like c6. }
8. a3 { I do not want to allow ...b4 and ...Ne4. } 8... Na6
{ 8...b4 ?!  is met well with  9.Na2. } 9. Ra2
{ How could I resist such a weird, yet logical looking move ? Again I am mainly trying to stop ...b4 as now I simply play axb4. Also, I may play b4 myself not having to fear ...Nxb4. }
9... O-O 10. Nf3 { The Knight is heading into the middle... } 10... Qd8 11. Ne5
{ A great square for the Knight ! In nearly all cases the Knight sits well on e5. }
11... Bb7 12. h5 { Going back to another idea. } 12... Nd7
{ Black decides that my Knight is too strong and aims to exchange it off. } 13.
hxg6 hxg6 14. Ng4
{ With the idea of Nh6+ and an attack to follow. I had a great position that I went onto win: 1-0  (56)  Williams, S  (2442)  -Bukojemski, A  (2183)  London ENG 2017 }

{ In some cases, we should seriously consider capturing a black pawn if it has moved to c5. This is not always a good option, but it becomes much stronger when Black has already played ...a6. Here is a game I played at one of my favourite tournaments that demonstrates this concept. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. e3 c5 4. Nc3
{ This move order is interesting as it switches from a London to a "Jobava London System". This is not the move order I recommend but it can catch opponents unaware. }
4... cxd4 5. exd4 a6 6. Bd3
{ The main move.  Tregubov had to face   6.Qd2  Nc6  7.O-O-O ?!  , which may well just be too ambitious and after  Bf5  8.Nf3  e6  9.Ne5  Bb4  Black was already calling the tune in Neiksans-Tregubov, Tallinn  (blitz)  2016. }
6... Nc6 7. Nce2
{ A new move for us and it wasn't so long ago that we took a good look at Jobava's preference for   7.Nge2  in Jobava-Ponomariov, Baku Olympiad 2016. }
7... Bg4 8. c3 e6 9. Qd2
{ Unpinning. Of course, one's initial reaction is that the position must be fine for Black, but all the pieces remain and there are certainly plenty of ways ahead to out-manoeuvre Black in true Carlsen style. }
9... Bh5 10. Bg5
{ A new move. Previously,   10.Ng3  Bg6  11.Nf3  Be7  12.O-O  O-O  13.Bxg6  hxg6  14.Rfe1  Rc8  15.Qe2  Nd7  16.Nf1  Na5  17.Ne3  Re8  18.Ng4  Nc4  had been extremely solid for Black in Archangelsky-Van Delft, Hoogeveen 2006. Carlsen's play is much less stereotyped. }
10... Bg6
{ Bok has avoided having to concede the bishop-pair, but future exchanges won't be so easy for him to either arrange or judge. }
11. Nf4 Bxd3 12. Nxd3 Bd6 13. Nf3
{ Heading for e5 and offering Black a big decision: to trade bishop and knight while removing the queens, or to carry on the struggle in a middlegame ? }
13... Ne4
{ Bok goes for it. Of course, Black could just castle, but do note that in the event of something like   13...b5  how well White's queen's knight turns out to be placed after its route: b1-c3-e2-f4-d3. }
14. Bxd8 Nxd2 15. Kxd2 Rxd8 16. Rhe1 O-O
{ Perhaps it was better to imitate White with   16...Ke7  when  17.a4  f6  followed by ...Kf7 would inject a bit of dynamism into the black set-up. }
17. a4 { Carlsen begins to probe in trademark fashion. } 17... Rc8 18. a5
{ Clamping and claiming space, but how will White now break through ? It certainly feels unlikely that a minority attack on the kingside will succeed. }
18... Rfe8 19. Nfe5
{ Carlsen realises that he is going to have to remove some pieces to be able to try and squeeze something with just the rooks left. }
19... Bxe5
{ A small concession. Perhaps Bok was put off after   19...Nxe5  20.dxe5  Be7  by  21.f4  , but the knight is some way from d4 and  Rc4  22.b3  Rc6  should give Black enough counterplay with ideas of ...f6, ...g5 and even ...b6 on the agenda. }
20. Nxe5 Nxe5 21. Rxe5 f6 22. Re3 Kf7 23. Ra4
{ 23.Kd3  first was also possible, and if  e5  24.f3  , but in any case this rook lift is the reason why White is slightly for choice in this endgame. Black may well find himself tied down to defence of b7. }
23... Rc4
{ Something like   23...Re7  24.f4  h5  25.Rg3  would not be pleasant against Carlsen, although Karjakin would surely hold it. Bok's choice initially appears tempting, but Carlsen had no doubt long before seen the counter he now deploys. }
24. Rxc4 dxc4 25. b3 Rc8
{ Likewise, if   25...cxb3  26.c4  Rd8  27.Kc3  Ke7  28.Re2  Kd6  29.Kxb3  when the clamping effect of the a-pawn is very much felt and Black is condemned to a long defence, albeit one not without some hope of success. }
26. Re1 cxb3 27. Rb1 Rc4 28. Rxb3 Ra4
{ 28...Rc7  would have lost some time compared to the last note, but better that than losing a pawn. }
29. Rxb7+ Kg6 30. Rb6 Rxa5 31. Rxe6 Ra2+ 32. Kd3
{ Many players would automatically opt for   32.Ke3  , but Carlsen knows that the c-pawn will be very quick. }
32... Rxf2 33. c4 Rxg2 34. c5 Kf5
{ The black king will remain cut off after White's next, so this wasn't good, but then again if   34...Rg1  35.Ke4  a5  36.Ra6  and White's connected passed pawns will sweep all before them. }
35. Re1 Rb2 36. c6 { 36.c6  Rb8  37.d5  is quite hopeless. } *

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 c5
{ This is considered to be the most challenging move to White's set up. Having already played Nc3 White no longer has the option of reinforcing the d4-pawn with c2-c3. It would also be a mistake to play   4.dxc5  in this position, as Black has a very strong reply with  4...d4. }
4. e3
{ This move supports White's central pawn on d4 and also has a key point in opening up the light squared bishop, perhaps surprisingly not with the immediate idea of developing it but supporting the potential advance of Nb5. }
4... cxd4
{ This is considered to be Black's best move. By taking immediately on d4 Black rules out the possibility of White taking on c5 which was very much in play as Black's previous response to this of ...d4 is now covered by White's pawn on e3.   4...Nc6 ??  This is a surprisingly common error by Black and I can assure you that many of you will be the grateful recipients of this natural blunder.  5.Nb5  White's threat of Nc7+ forking king and rook cannot be prevented without loss of material. }
5. exd4 a6
{ This is a very sensible precaution by Black, preventing Nb5.   5...Nc6 ?  This is once again a blunder that allows White to play  6.Nb5  which once again wins material. }
6. Nf3
{ This was the choice of Richard Rapport, as in the current game, and I feel it is the best move. As we shall see White should not fear ...Bg4 pinning the Knight. }
6... Bg4 7. h3
{ Immediately putting the question to the Bishop. There is little doubt in my mind that Rapport would have met the retreat   7...Bh5  with  8.g4  gaining space and the initiative on the kingside. }
7... Bxf3
{ 7...Bh5  8.g4  This thrust turns out to give White a very promising position.  8...Bg6  9.Ne5  e6  10.h4  Ne4  11.h5  Nxc3  12.bxc3  Be4  13.f3  f6  14.Nc4  This clever move ensures that white will get a big centre and the two bishops.  14...dxc4  15.fxe4  White's position is definitely to be preferred. The control of the centre and the 2 bishops are a big plus and the airy position of White's king is a long way from being threatened: currently Black has none of his remaining pieces developed. }
8. Qxf3 Nc6 9. O-O-O
{ This is an excellent move which commits the king to the queenside. This looks more dangerous for White than castling kingside, but the rook immediately gets to d1 covering the d4 pawn and White's plan will be to advance quickly with g4, asking many questions of Black's defence before he can complete his development. }
9... e6 10. g4 Bb4
{ 10...Bd6  This happened the next time Rapport reached this position against Nikolic. Both the prophylactic  11.Kb1  ,  most likely followed by h4  or perhaps sticking with the plan and going   11.h4  are best. The key is to understand that White's immediate plan is further kingside expansion. }
11. Ne2
{ This is an understandable move but White should have shown more faith with   11.g5  as his king is comfortably safe and any Bxc3 can be met by recapturing with the queen.  11...Nd7  12.a3  Ba5  13.h4  White has the better chances here and should continue with the kingside assault by continuing the advance of the kingside pawns to create weaknesses in the black camp. }
11... Qa5 12. Kb1
{ The old cliche says that all the best players play Kb1. On this occassion it also neatly defends a2. }
12... Ne4 13. Nc1 Bd6 14. Nb3 Qc7 15. Be3 O-O 16. Rg1 b5 17. Bd3 f5
{ This move is a key error which demonstrates the full value of White's rook on g1. }
18. gxf5 exf5 19. Bh6 Rf7 20. Bxg7

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. e3 c5 4. Nc3 cxd4 5. exd4 a6 6. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black delays deploying his light-squared Bishop in favour of his Queenside Knight. This approach is more flexible and intends to reduce the speed of White's Kingside expansion but as we will see it does not have the desired effect. }
7. Ne5 Bf5 8. g4
{ White needs little encouragement to play g4 with gain of tempo. } 8... Nxe5
9. gxf5 Nc6 10. Qd3 g6
{ 10...Nb4  looks a little annoying but White can calmly retreat the Queen to e2 when the light-squared Bishop can go to g2 or h3. The Knight will be kicked from b4 by a2-a3. A sample line is  11.Qe2  g6  12.a3  Nc6  13.O-O-O  gxf5  14.Bh3  e6  15.Bxf5  Rg8  where White's lead in development, two Bishops and safer King give him a comfortable advantage from the opening exchanges. }

{ The game to this point has been a success. Levon did not convert smoothly from this position primarily as this was a blitz game, but I am very confident he would have done so at other time limits. The opening was definitely a success for White ! }
20... Rd8 21. Nb6 Qe6 22. Bc7 Rxd4 23. c3
{ This move cedes White's advantage.   23.Rxd4  Nxd4  24.Qxb7  would have left White a clean pawn up with a much safer King and clear advantage. Levon did go on to win but not as smoothly as he would have liked. The full score of this game is not available but the play to this point shows the potential of White's opening and the often important aspect of expanding on the Kingside whilst being supported by well-placed pieces in the middle of the board. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. e3 c5 4. Nc3 cxd4 5. exd4 a6 6. Nf3 e6
{ This is not the best move by Black as it removes the option of developing the light-squared Bishop to f5 or g4. It is not a poor move, just sub-optimal, but it is always helpful to understand the best way to proceed as it gives us an insight to the plans of the position and opening in general. }
7. Bd3 Bd6
{ Many players are understandably concerned about how to meet   7...Bb4  ,  as this move pins the Knight on c3 and should the Bishop capture the c3-Knight, White's pawn structure will be compromised. This is in fact nothing to fear for White because the b-pawn going to c3 supports the centre, opens up the b-file for White's Queenside Rook and seriously undermines Black's control of the dark squares.  8.O-O  Bxc3  9.bxc3  O-O  10.a4  This is a clever move which restricts Black's ability to play ...b5, meaning Rab1 will always create problems for Black who must continue to defend his b-pawn.  10...Nc6  11.Rb1  Ne7  12.Re1  White's position is preferable with better development, control of the centre and 2 Bishops. I would happily play from this position. }
8. Ne2 Nc6 9. c3 Qc7 10. Qd2 O-O 11. h3
{ This precaution is understandable but unnecessary in this particular position. Black cannot play ...Bg4, and after   11.O-O  the move  11...Ng4  is not dangerous and can then simply be kicked away with  12.h3. }
11... b5 12. Rc1 Rb8 13. O-O a5 14. Rfe1 a4 15. Qe3 Na5 16. Be5
{ White has now returned to the key principle of making progress in the centre. Black needs to be very careful as White is prepared for a kingside assault. Notice how the pawn on e6 and Black's pieces on the Queenside leave the threat of a decisive breakthrough very much alive. }
16... Nd7
{ This line shows how close White is to winning:   16...Nc4  17.Qf4  Nxb2 ??   17...Ne4  18.Bxd6  Qxd6  19.b3  Qxf4  20.Nxf4  Ncd6  21.c4  axb3  22.axb3  bxc4  23.bxc4  Ba6  24.Bxe4  dxe4  25.Ne5  is an example where White has used the pressure to simplify into a strong middle-endgame with well-placed pieces and a strong passed c-pawn.  18.Bxh7+  Nxh7  19.Bxd6  +- }
17. Qg5 Nxe5 18. Bxh7+
{ This proves to be premature. taking back on e5 with the d-pawn with tempo was the best and most logical move. It is a positive that White felt the immediate sacrifice was winning, but here he underestimated Black's defensive resources.   18.dxe5  Be7  19.Qh5  g6  20.Qh6  +=  This approach of improving the position and weakening Black's dark squares means that once again Black would need to be very careful not to lose immediately. }
18... Kxh7 19. Qh5+ Kg8 20. Ng5 Re8
{ Despite White overplaying his position, such is the task at Black's hand that he would have needed to find the unlikely   20...Nf3+  to make his defensive task easier. This move would have left White struggling to justify his sacrifice. }
21. dxe5 Bxe5 22. Nd4 Bxd4 23. cxd4 Qf4 24. g4
{ Once again White is overly ambitious but my feeling is that he was so pleased with his position from the opening that the only acceptable result was a victory.   24.Qh7+  would have been roughly equal but in a practical game all 3 results would have been possible. }
24... g6 25. Qh6 Qf6 26. Qh7+ Kf8 27. Rc7 Rb7 28. Qh4 Kg8 29. Qh7+ Kf8 30. Qh4

{ After all the fireworks White had to settle for a perpetual and a draw. The opening was a success, arguably so much so that White got too excited and pulled the trigger too early. A marginally calmer approach would have set up the same possibility without material risk. }

White has the bishop pair in an open position which was the root of his advantage.   4...e6  5.Nb5  Na6  6.c3  This position shows why Black should not allow White to play Nb5. Black's knight on a6 is stuck defending the c7 square against a fork and Black's rook is stuck on a8 defending the a7 pawn. White's knight cannot be kicked away by a pawn as the knight on a6 is preventing the pawn moving there. A good example of White exploiting this position comes from the game Bauer - Berend which continued as follows:  Qb6  7.a4  Be7  8.Nf3  O-O   8...Nh5 ?!

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. f3
{ This is one of the key moves in the Jobava London System when Black plays Bf5. By not having developed the Knight to f3 White can play the pawn there and look towards a quick Kingside pawn advance which both gains space and pushes Black's pieces back. }
4... e6 5. g4 Bg6 6. h4
{ This natural follow up threatens to trap Black's light-squared Bishop. As you will know, when I can push 'Harry'  (the h-pawn)  I will, especially when it is the objectively best move. }
6... h6
{ This is a natural reply but we will also see what happens if Black plays   6... h5:  7.g5  Nfd7  8.e3  Bd6  This position has been seen a number of times before, and previously Jobava and others have played  9.Nh3  but this move does not seem best.  Instead   9.Bxd6  seems like the best move. It has been played before but not by a Grandmaster.  9...cxd6  10.Nh3  Nc6  11.Nf4  This looks like an excellent idea as White is ready to take on g6, shattering Black's pawn structure and preparing the powerful looking follow up Bh3 which hits e6.  11...Ne7  12.Bd3  Qb6  13.Bxg6  Nxg6  14.Nxg6  fxg6  15.Qd3  ±  We will see more of this variation in the theory section especially, as I feel strongly the existing Grandmaster approach  (including by Jobava)  can be improved upon. }
7. e3 c5

8. h5
{ 8.Nb5  This is the move that I will be recommending in this position, but we can certainly learn from Jobava's approach. }
8... Bh7 9. Nb5
{ Jobava plays Nb5 after getting h5 in. I think it's a better approach to save the opportunity of playing h5 as the option would have still been there after playing Nb5 first. }
9... Na6 10. c3 Be7 11. Bd3
{ This is a logical move as Black's Bishop on h7 has been pushed back with tempo, but it is still fairly active on the h7-b1 diagonal. }
11... Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Nd7 13. Ne2
{ 13.Nh3  This may be preferable as it retains the idea of playing g5 if this opportunity presents itself. }
13... O-O 14. a4

{ This is an ambitious move but certainly in Jobava's style. It shows that this opening can contain many active possibilities despite what people may think. }
16... Nb6

14... Ne8 15. Nf2 Nd6 16. Nd3 Nc4

The clever placement of the Knight on d3 is further revealed as it protects b2 should Black find a way of bringing his Queen to b6 for example. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. f3 e6
{ 4...c6  This has been played but should not be critical. As ever, though, it is always best to be prepared.  5.g4  Bc8  This could possibly be Black's best move. If this is the case then it is clear that Black is admitting guilt for the previous moves.   5...Bg6  6.h4  h5   6...h6  This is an alternative but white already has a comfortable position. Play continues in line with the general themes of the opening.  7.e3  e6  8.Bd3  Not committing to an advance of the h pawn in order to retain the option of g5 with maximum effect.  8...Bxd3  9.Qxd3  Nbd7  10.Nge2  Qa5  11.a3  Preventing Bb4 but also making it harder for Black to break with ...c5.  11...Rc8  12.Kf2  Qd8  13.Ng3  There are chances for both sides here but White has a lead in development, more space and threats of further kingside expansion. Black is totally reliant on the c5 break. I would definitely prefer White's position.  7.g5  +=  White is already getting on top. Wherever the knight retreats to, White will play e4 commanding the centre.  7...Ng8  8.e4  e6  9.Nge2  Bd6  10.Qd2  Ne7  11.a3  This was seen in Prie vs Duff Montpellier Open 2013 which was 1-0 in 31 moves.   11.Bxd6  This may be even stronger with the idea of castling Queenside. Black is likely to castle Kingside but with the opposite side castling, White's extra space and clear lead in the race against the Kings gives Black a worrisome defensive task.  11...Qxd6  12.Nf4  Nd7  13.O-O-O  O-O  14.Qh2  +=  The threat of Nxg6  (with the idea of the intermezzo Nxe7+ winning material)  means Black's best move is the meek retreat 14... Qb8, highlighting White's advantage.  6.h4  White continues with the plan of Kingside expansion. It is in no way taking liberties as Black has lost many tempi.  6...Qb6  7.Na4  This is an important move to remember against ...Qb6, but you must be careful that you can play Nc5 if the Knight is subsequently attacked by a ...b5 pawn thrust.  7...Qa5+  8.c3  e6   8...b5 ?!  9.Nc5  +=  This is a very important option. Whites extra space, lead in development and control of the dark squares gives him more than a pleasant position.  9.b4  Qd8  10.e3  +=  This ensures that White can answer  10...a5  with  11.b5.  White has a space advantage on both sides of the board and can simply continue developing. His King will be safe on f2. }

{ 6...h5  7.g5  Nfd7  8.e3  Bd6   8...c5 ?!  9.Nb5  Na6  10.c3  Be7  11.Bg3  +=  A clever move, intending Nh3-f4. Once again the combination of White's dark-squared Bishop and Knight on b5 tie Black up on the Queenside. White has an edge both in position and in future plans.  9.Bxd6 !  This is rarely seen which is why I have given it an exclam. I feel it's an important improvement on previous GM games.  9...cxd6  10.Nh3  Nc6  11.Nf4  +=  Ne7  12.e4  White has extra space and central dominance. Its more than a pleasant position. It's a good one which any player of the white pieces should consider to be an opening triumph. }
7. e3 c5

{ I must thank David Howell for giving me this game. It was a blitz game against none other than the great, former World Champion Garry Kasparov. David suggested the overall standard of the game wasn't the highest as it was blitz but I can comfortably say we would all love to play as well as him in this game and take down one of chess's biggest scalps. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 c6
{ Dare I say this is probably not the greatest challenge to White's opening, but in Kasparov's defence he has been away from competitive chess for a number of years and it demonstrates that even a chess legend can be caught somewhat cold by an unexpected opening such as this. That should make any potential player of this line very optimistic ! }

13... c5 14. a3 c4 15. Qd2 Ba5 16. e4 b5

It really doesn't fight for the initiative.  5.Bd3  Bd6   5...c5  6.Nb5  This is the normal reply when Black plays c5 - without a6 of course.  6...Na6  7.c3  c4  8.Bc2  Bd7  9.a4  Bxb5  10.axb5  Nc7  11.Ba4  I like White's position.

A sample line is:  11...b6  12.Nf3  Bd6  13.Ne5  O-O  14.Qf3  +=  6.Qf3  This is an unusual move in this line so early, but it takes advantage of the fact that Black has played e6 blocking in his light-squared Bishop. This move will not only most likely be unexpected it has merit in its own right.  6...O-O  7.g4  As soon as Black castles Kingside, White seeks out the initiative on that side of the board.  7...Bxf4  8.Qxf4  I very much like White's development, space and the start of a Kingside initiative.  8...Nbd7  9.h4  Qe7  10.Nf3  Re8  11.g5  Nh5  12.Qh2  +=  White has a good position. He is prepared to castle Queenside, has a Kingside initiative and the Knight on h5 is misplaced.   4...g6  5.Be2  This is a clever move which prevents any ...Bg4 by Black and hints at an h4-h5 advance whilst keeping White's options open.  5...Bg7  6.h4  h6   6...h5  7.Nf3  Bg4  8.Ne5  Bxe2  9.Qxe2  Nbd7  10.O-O-O  This was played by Wei Yi and is commensurate with the opening themes. White has more control of the centre, a strongly placed Knight on e5 and prospects of f3 followed by e4.  7.Nf3  Qb6  8.b3  This move is now entirely possible as Black cannot play ...Bb4.  8...Nbd7  9.Ne5  It is fair to say that from an evaluation standpoint there is little in this position. But not for the first time, White's plusses are clear - a strong Knight on e5 and the prospect of castling Queenside to make the game dynamic.  9...O-O  10.Qd2  Nxe5  11.Bxe5  Ne4  12.Nxe4  dxe4  13.Bxg7  Kxg7  +=  After this sequence White's edge lies with a better Bishop, but perhaps more importantly, better attacking chances through h5.

When moves like this are suspect, White should be very happy.  12.h3  It's a classic attacking strategy of opening up lines against the enemy King. Not only is Black's defensive task difficult - he has very little, if any, in the way of counterplay.  12...g3  13.Qf3  +-  This is far from the only move, but it is accurate as it prevents Black playing ...Nh5 which would exchange off a minor piece and slow White's attack down. It is not an exaggeration to say that White is on the verge of a winning attack.   5...h6  6.g4  Bh7   6...Bg6  7.Bd3  Black's best move here is  7...Bxd3  which transposes into the line with 6... Bh7 and 7. Bd3 when Black replies with 7... Bxd3.  7.Bd3  Bxd3  8.Qxd3  Exchanging the light-squared Bishops makes sense for White as this was Black's best minor piece. By recapturing with the Queen, White can castle Queenside without obstruction.  8...e6  9.Nge2  I like this move as it keeps White's options open. He can see how Black deploys his pieces before deciding between a Kingside push with h4 or advancing in the centre with e4. In keeping with the overall plan of our opening, I favour the former as it is consistent with many of the other positions encountered.  9...Qa5  10.h4  Nbd7  11.Kf2  Now that Black has played Qa5, White neatly steps out of the pin and does not castle into the line of Black's developed Queen.  11...Be7  12.Kg2  This is another smart move. Black is without a light-squared Bishop so neither the dark-squared Bishop can check White's King, and any possibility of the f6-Knight moving to g4 or even e4 will not come with check anymore.  12...c5  13.Ng3  White continues with the Kingside plan. Understanding the plans of an opening is important and it's particularly helpful when the themes are consistent. It makes the task of the opponent that much harder as well. }

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. e3 Bb4
{ This move is definitely one to be aware of as White. I have been asked many times how White should deal with this position. Before that, I want to consider the merits of the move 4... Bb4.Black pins the Knight on c3. It's an absolute pin  (to the King)  which means that currently White cannot move the c3-Knight at all. The biggest danger for White is not so much a quick capture on c3, but moves such as ...Ne4, ...c5 and ...Qa5, all increasing the pressure on the c3-Knight. ...Bb4 in this position takes advantage of the fact that White has played e3, which means that the f4-Bishop cannot retreat to d2 to support the c3-Knight and break the pin. }

8. a3 Nxd3+ 9. Qxd3 Ba5 10. O-O-O O-O
{ White has a pleasant position. The knight on c3 is no longer pinned, White has a lead in development and will play e4 quickly. Normally when you have a lead in development it is to your benefit to open up the position as quick as possible. Black has failed to maximise the potential of 4... Bb4.   10...Bd7  11.e4  Bc6  12.exd5  Nxd5  13.Qg3  Attacking g7 and opening up the pin on the d-file. White's pressure on the Kingside gives him an advantage. It's a difficult task for Black to defend accurately. }
11. Bg5
{ This is probably the most accurate, but I don't think I could have resisted   11.h4.  It doesn't gain points for subtlety, but if I can give Harry a push, I will ! As we will see in the game Jobava also appreciates this concept. }
11... h6 12. h4
{ This applies maximum pressure to Black's kingside. White's plan is clear: attack the King in the most direct way. When you are attacking and your opponent needs to spend time on defensive moves like ...h6, they are not taking the time to gain counterplay which strongly suggests you have the upper hand. }
12... Bd7
{ 12...hxg5 ?  13.hxg5  would, of course, just be a massacre due to the pin on the d-file in the event of  Ne4 ?  14.Nxe4  ,  while the seemingly prudent   12...Re8 ?  would also have been a major error in view of the fork  13.Bxf6 !  Qxf6  14.Qb5  ,  and if  Qd8  15.Nxd5 ! }
13. g4

13... Bc6 14. Rh3 e5
{ Allowing White to add power to the pin down the h4-d8 diagonal was not wise. Black would have been better off with something like   14...Rc8  ,  although after  15.f4 !   15.Bxf6  Qxf6  16.g5  Qg6  isn't so clear  15...Qe7   15...hxg5 ??  16.hxg5  Ne4  17.Rdh1  mates  16.Kb1  White would have retained a pleasant edge, if still with a major decision to make over how best to effect a breakthrough. }

{ This choice of Jobava should come as no surprise to us. He almost always takes the most combative approach, but it is risky and his opponent failed to find the best reply. For that reason I would recommend the move  12.a3  first, which effectively forces  12...Bxc5.  More of this in the theory section. }
12... Bxc5
{ 12...b6 !  would have somewhat turned the tables on White, as  13.cxb6  is not possible as the Bishop on d6 falls. The move chosen gives White an edge. It is very instructive how Jobava plays the game as it highlights the importance of the e4 break which is used in a number of lines. }
13. Bxc5 Qxc5 14. e4
{ This is a key idea which challenges Black's centre and intends to open up the d-file for White's well-placed rook. White's advantage lies in his clear lead in development, better placed and centralised pieces and the ineffectiveness of Black's light-squared Bishop. When we have such advantages it is important to open up the position before our opponent can get fully coordinated. }
14... Qxd4 15. Nxd4
{ 15.Rxd4  was also possible and perhaps a little more consistent with the d-file pressure, when White would like to double rooks on the d-file. Jobava prefers to improve the position of his e2-Knight which is entirely understandable. However, as we will see this is more visual than effective. }

1. d4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 Bd6
{ This is a perfectly reasonable move by Black. Playing ...e6, which restricts the light-squared Bishop, followed by ...Bd6 is not the most aggressive, but it is definitely solid. Many of our opponents will be relatively unfamiliar with the Jobava London set-up so may not be well prepared for it. As a result they may deliberately try to seek out a solid position in order to avoid any sharp lines which their opponent  (you)  will know better than them. 3... Bd6 definitely fits this bill and I feel many of you will on occasion find yourselves in this position. }
4. e3
{ This is not White's only decent response but in deciding on this move I felt that learning an opening is easier when we have a regular set up and common themes and plans. So unless there is a strong reason to deviate we probably should not. Jobava himself tends to play e3 against both 3... Bb4 and 3... Bd6, which retains the set-up of the opening. However, each line is different so the differences need to be understood individually. If Jobava himself has this approach I am very comfortable recommending this. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 e6 4. e3 Bb4
{ 4...c5  This is a classic mistake.  5.Nb5 !  Na6  6.c3 !  Stopping any ...Nb4 ideas and in the process killing Black's Knight on a6.   4...a6  This transposes to positions dealt with in the next chapter.   4...Be7  This is a common idea, against which we should just develop and meet ...c5 with dxc5.  5.Bd3  The best square for the Bishop. 5 g4 !? is an interesting idea that I would be tempted to play.  5...O-O   5...c5  6.dxc5 !  With the Bishop on d3 this is pretty much forced  (in order to try preserve an advantage)  as otherwise Black will play ...c4 and gain great space on the Queenside. 6 Nb5 doesn't work as well now, because Black has ideas of ...c4 which gains an important tempo against the Bishop on d3.  6...O-O  7.Nf3  Bxc5   7...Nbd7  8.b4 !  Nh5  9.Rb1  It was not clear how Black could win the pawn back in Jobava vs Andreev, 2013.  8.O-O  Nc6  9.e4 !  This is a key idea. After exchanges, White hopes that his light-squared Bishop will give him an advantage due to being superior over the Bishop on c8.  9...dxe4  10.Nxe4  Nxe4  11.Bxe4  White's position is to be slightly preferred. This is because of Black's Bishop on c8. White can even consider playing Bxc6 damaging Black's Queenside pawns.  11...Qf6 !  12.Qc1  +=  6.Nf3  b6  Keep in mind that against ...c5 we always capture the pawn.  7.Ne5 !  This move has the idea of playing Qf3 and Qh3. A standard motif in such positions.   4...Bd6  This is also an idea, but I am not sure Black ever wants to exchange on f4, as after exf4 White has actually improved his structure as we saw at the start of this course in the 'Common Ideas' section.  5.Bd3  O-O   5...Bxf4  6.exf4  This leads to the same thing.  6.Nf3  Bxf4  7.exf4  White has great control of the centre and a good game. He can play Ne5, Qf3 and even Qh3 to start an attack. }
5. Bd3 c5
{ Other moves are less worrying as they would give White time to play Nge2 with a very comfortable position. 5... c5 is critical.   5...Bxc3+  I think this is premature. Black should not break the pin unless he has to. It makes sense in the context that White has not yet played Ng1-e2 so White has to accept doubled pawns, but the c3 pawn supports d4, covers any ...Nb4 and now White will develop the Kingside Knight to the more active square f3 as it is not needed on e2.  6.bxc3  c5  7.dxc5  At first glance this may look odd but it removes any chance of Black playing ...c4 and will support Bd6 which will prove troublesome for Black.  7...Qa5  8.Bd6  Nbd7  9.Ne2  Nxc5  10.O-O  With roughly equal chances. White currently has the bishop pair. If Black wants to remove this feature with Nxd3, White will have his structure back and White's dark-squared Bishop is comfortably better than Black's light-squared Bishop. }
6. dxc5 Nbd7
{ 6...Bxc3+  This is also an option, but it directly transposes into the 5. ..Bxc3+ line. }
7. Ne2 a6
{ This move may look a little odd, but the value of stopping a white piece coming to b5  (the Knight if the Bishop on b4 stops pinning The knight on c3 or after white castles, or in a number of line the Bishop)  proves a little tricky for White to handle but provided he is prepared there should not be any difficulties   7...O-O  8.Bd6  Re8  9.Bb5  a6   9...Ne4  10.a3  Bxc3+  11.Nxc3  Nxd6   11...Nxc3 ?!  12.bxc3  This would make it difficult for Black to win his pawn back.  12.cxd6  a6  13.Bxd7  Qxd7  14.Qd4  Both sides are solid. I would very marginally pick White due to my preference for the Knight over the Bishop in a closed position. A sample line continues  14...Qxd6  15.O-O  b6  16.e4  Bb7  17.exd5  and after  17...exd5  the position is equal.  10.Bxd7  Nxd7  11.Qd4  Qa5  12.a3  Bxc5  13.Bxc5  Qxc5  14.O-O-O  Now this move leads to a pleasant position for White, with very similar ideas to the introductory Jobava vs Korneev game.   7...Nxc5  8.a3  Nxd3+   8...Ba5  This does not really help Black and encourages White to move forward.  9.b4  Nxd3+  10.cxd3  In this position I prefer recapturing with the pawn. The c-file is now accessible for White, the Queen can develop to b3 and White now has another pawn in the centre.  10...Bc7   10...Bb6  11.Na4  Here the dark-squared Bishop will most likely drop back to c7, when White has gained a tempo with moves such as Rc1 and Nc5 to follow. White has a comfortable position.  11.Bxc7  Qxc7  12.Rc1  Qe7  13.O-O  O-O  14.Qb3  Bd7  15.h3  There is not much difference between the two sides. I have a marginal preference for the Knight over the Bishop due to the closed nature of the position. With his King's position secure, White can focus his attention on the c-file and queenside.  9.Qxd3  Ba5  10.O-O-O  +=   7...Bxc5  This is not often played but it is certainly a viable choice and one we should consider. It looks less natural than capturing with the Knight but as we have seen these pieces rapidly get kicked back so Bxc5 makes sense.  8.h3  An important move, giving White's dark-squared Bishop a square to drop back to if Black should play ...Nh5. It also prevents any black piece from moving to g4.  8...a6  Controlling the b5-square. White must be alert to e5-e4 trapping his light-squared Bishop.  9.Bh2  Ensuring any e5 advance does not come with tempo.  9...Qe7  10.O-O  O-O  11.e4  This important move challenges Black's centre and intends to free up squares for the white pieces.  11...d4   11...dxe4  12.Nxe4 =  With equal chances. Both sides will seek to centralise. There are few weaknesses to exploit.  12.e5  dxc3  13.exf6  Nxf6  14.Nxc3  Once again there is little between the prospects of both sides. White would be happy in principle with exchanges as this brings his 3 vs 2 Queenside majority more into play. Centralisation should be the key to White's plans. }
8. Bg3
{ I believe this is the soundest reply as it means that Black cannot play ...e5 with tempo. ...e5 followed by ...e4 was a threat as the light-squared Bishop would be trapped - herein lies one of the points of Black' move 7... a6. }
8... Nh5 9. e4 Nxg3 10. hxg3 dxe4 11. Bxe4 Bxc5 12. Nf4
{ A clever move rerouting the Knight to d3 from where it covers b2, f2 and pressures the dark-squared Bishop. }
12... Qb6 13. Nd3 Bd4 14. Qd2
{ With roughly equal chances. Black has the two Bishops but White's pieces are well placed, he has a half open h-file and will most likely castle queenside. }

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Bf4 Bd6
{ This is a perfectly reasonable move by Black. Playing ...e6, which restricts the light-squared Bishop, followed by ...Bd6 is not the most aggressive, but it is definitely solid. Many of our opponents will be relatively unfamiliar with the Jobava London set-up so may not be well prepared for it. As a result they may deliberately try to seek out a solid position in order to avoid any sharp lines which their opponent  (you)  will know better than them. 3... Bd6 definitely fits this bill and I feel many of you will on occasion find yourselves in this position. }
4. e3
{ This is not White's only decent response, but in deciding on this move I felt that learning an opening is easier when we have a regular set-up and common themes and plans. So unless there is a strong reason to deviate, we probably should not. Jobava himself tends to play e3 against both 3... Bb4 and 3... Bd6, which retains the set-up of the opening. However, each line is different so the differences need to be understood individually. If Jobava himself has this approach I am very comfortable recommending this. }
4... Nf6
{ 4...Bxf4  5.exf4  This will most likely transpose to later lines in which Black takes on f4 one or two moves later. }
5. Nf3 O-O

{ This was played in model game #28 but there are other moves to consider here - mainly 6... c5.   6...c5  7.dxc5  Bxc5  8.O-O  Nc6  We now arrive at a position which is important. Currently it is Black whose pawns control more of the centre. If White does not combat this, Black will catch up in development and potentially have a preferable position.  9.e4  Therefore this is my strong recommendation. Black has 2 main replies.  9...dxe4  This is comfortable to play as White.   9...d4  I think most people as White would prefer not to face this move by Black. It is nothing to fear, but White will benefit from knowing what to do.  10.Ne2  Nd7  This move supports e5 which Black would very much like to play.   10...Nh5  Trying to exchange Knight for Bishop, but White can avoid this.  11.Bg5  Qb6   11...f6  12.Bd2  The advance to g5 followed by retreating to d2 seems odd, but Black's Knight on h5 could rapidly find itself in difficulty as it currently is unprotected with no safe square. There are chances for both sides here. Despite Black's current central control White will very quickly seek to undermine it with c3, when the awkward placement of some of Black's pieces gives White somewhat the better prospects.  12.Nexd4  Very cleverly taking advantage of the discovered attack on Black's Knight on h5.  12...Nxd4  13.Nxd4  Bxd4  14.Qxh5  Qxb2  Black regains his pawn but White's position has improved after the exchanges. There is a growing threat to Black's king and there are not many defenders in the immediate vicinity. White has the better chances. There are other lines which are trickier for White to handle.  11.e5  This is an important move in this position as it prevents Black playing ...e5 immediately and any time soon. The downside is that pushing e4 to e5 weakens the e-pawn so White must be careful that Black does not win this pawn.  11...Qc7 ?  This attempt to immediately attack the e5-pawn fails spectacularly. It turns out it is Black who must be careful as this allows a classic chess sacrifice - The Greek Gift which features a Bishop sacrifice on h7.   11...h6  +=  so it actually turns out that Black is compelled to play a defensive move as the threat of Bxh7 is incredibly strong.  12.c3  White does not rush as despite the prospects of a sacrificial breakthrough they are unsound. White calmly switches play to the centre. Black is both lagging in development and the pieces he does have developed are passively placed. White will continue to develop, most notably by centralising his rooks.  12.Bxh7+  Kxh7  13.Ng5+  Kg8  14.Qd3  Threatening mate and the switch to h3 for a renewed angle of attack.  14...Re8  14... f5 fails to exf6 e.p. threatening mate on h7 and opening up a discovered attack on the Queen on c7. Black cannot prevent both.  15.Qh7+  Kf8  16.Ne4 !  A tough move to see over the board. It frees up the g5-square for White's Bishop to attack or cover the e7 escape square.  16...Ncxe5  17.Qh8+  Ke7  18.Bg5+  f6  19.Qxg7+  Kd8  20.Nxf6  +-  Black will lose material or get mated or both.  10.Nxe4  Nxe4  11.Bxe4  +=  Just from a visual impression White is a bit better with 2 strong Bishops and a reduction in Black's central control.  11...Qf6  This is met by Qc1 defending the Bishop and b2.  12.Qc1  In the game Nabaty - Murtazin there was a nasty shock in store for Black.  12...e5  13.Bg5  Qd6  14.Rd1  Qc7  15.c3  Kh8  16.b4  Bb6 ??  17.Bf6 !!  +-  Black cannot prevent White playing Qh6 when mate on g7 or h7 or f8 follows. }

So unless there is a strong reason to deviate, we probably should not. Jobava himself tends to play e3 against both 3... Bb4 and 3... Bd6, which retains the set-up of the opening.

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 a6
{ This is a logical yet rather time consuming move. Black stops any ideas of Nb5, which as we have seen is a very annoying move, yet wastes some time playing a move on the side of the board. Another disadvantage of the move ...a6 for Black is that when he plays ...c5, an approach with dxc5 becomes much stronger for White. The reason for this is that there is a big hole on b6 and Na4-b6 becomes a very potent idea. }
4. e3
{ There is no reason for us to drift from our normal plan. Let's develop and see how Black will set up. }
4... e6
{ This is again logical, Black simply develops. There are now two plans for White. For Chessable I normally only suggest one plan for White, but in this case I am giving two ideas. That is because one idea is very aggressive - 5. g5, while the other idea - 5. Bd3 - is a solid option. You can decide which one suits your needs more. They are both of equal-ish value, yet lead to different games.   4...g6  This invites an advance of the h-pawn.  5.h4 !  Bg7  6.h5  This is a very playable sacrifice which Jobava has employed. The position may not be objectively better for White, but from a practical point of view it's strong. If Black accepts the sacrifice a computer may have a balanced assessment, but whenever this happens with such a material balance it requires computer-like defence for Black to hold on. It's hard to imagine any human would take Black.  6...gxh5  7.Rxh5  Nxh5  8.Qxh5  c6  9.Nf3  h6  10.O-O-O  Nd7  11.Qh2  Nf8  +=  This was seen in Jobava - Savchenko  (1-0 in 35 moves)  . Already White has an edge due to the cramped and passive positioning of the black pieces.   4...c5  This allows White the following option.  5.dxc5 !  White should take on c5 before Black has the natural reply ...Bxc5.  5...Nc6   5...Qa5  This runs into natural development.  6.Nf3  e6   6...Qxc5  7.Be2  e6  8.O-O  This is nice for White with a lead in development and two main ideas: 1: a3 and b4, 2: e4.  7.Bd3  Bxc5  8.O-O  O-O  9.a3  Be7  10.e4  This is an important break for White and should lead to a slight advantage, as Black is behind in development.  6.a3   6.Nf3  is also good.  6...e5  7.Bg5 !  With pressure against d5.  7...Be6  8.b4  White is a pawn up. Although Black has compensation through central control and a lead in development, a pawn is still a pawn and it's worth more than Black's compensation here.  8...Be7  9.Nf3  O-O  10.Be2  +=   4...Bf5  5.f3  Planning g4 and h4 as we have seen in Theory 2. }
5. g4
{ The aggressive option ! I am unsure that I would be able to resist such a plan... White gains space and starts a Kingside attack. By playing 4... e6, Black is no longer covering the g4-square with his light-squared Bishop, so this becomes a new option. This was also Carlsen's choice. This Kingside expansion is a running theme of the Jobava London.   5.Bd3  This is a much safer option, and a move that some players may prefer. White simply aims to develop and at later moment - normally after Nf3 and O-O - play the typical break e4 !  5...c5  The most logical move in conjunction with the earlier ...a6, which made Nb5 impossible for us.   5...b5  6.Nf3  b4 ?!   6...c5 =  7.Na4  Bd7  8.c4  +=   5...Nbd7 !?  This is logical and rare. Black wants to play ...c5 and then after dxc5 capture back with the Knight. This may actually be one of Black's better options. It took me a while to come up with an answer to this move that I was happy with.  6.Nce2 !?   6.e4  was my first thought, and it still remains interesting. The key variation is  6...c5  7.exd5  cxd4  8.dxe6  fxe6  9.Ne4  e5  when White has some compensation for the pawn. The more adventurous of you out there might wish to try this aggressive line.   The problem with  6.Nf3  is that I couldn't find a good answer to  6...c5  , as  7.dxc5  Nxc5  must be completely fine for Black.  With 6. Nce2 White aims to play in a more traditional London System way, with c3 coming up next to keep the pawn structure in touch. The computer at first doesn't like this, but it gradually comes around.  6...c5   6...Nh5  is likely to lead to a similar position.  7.c3  White wants to continue with Nf3 and Ne5 with chances in the centre and Kingside, in order to counter Black's Queenside advance.  7...Nh5  The computer's top choice.  8.Nf3 !?  Aiming to play against Black's c8-Bishop.  8...Nxf4  9.exf4  c4  Still following the computer's top choice, but only now does it start to think the position is ok for White.  10.Bc2  b5  11.O-O  White will play with Ne5, Qd2-e3 and hopefully the f5-break at some point. That being said, I certainly cannot say that White has an advantage - mainly due to Black's space on the Queenside. This one line does seem to be a good option for Black. Luckily it is very rare, and if you do not feel comfortable here then 6 g4 is always an alternative.  6.dxc5  White's automatic answer to ...c5 when there is a Bishop on d3. Otherwise ...c4, gaining a tempo for Black, is very annoying.  6...Bxc5  7.Nf3  Simple development. White lacks a bit of space at the moment, but once e4 is played all will be ok. We have seen this idea already in Theory 4, and it worked out well for White.  7...Nc6  8.O-O  White is now fully developed and must come up with a middlegame plan.  8...O-O   8...b5  This is a way for Black to advance and gain immediate space on the Queenside. This shouldn't deter us from our natural plan though.  9.e4 !  White must play this advance in this variation; otherwise it is not clear how to proceed.  9...b4  Other options are very similar to what we see after 8...O-O.  10.exd5 !  White is better after this. Here is a sample line.  10...exd5  11.Na4  Be7  12.Ne5 !  Black has some noticeable weaknesses, mainly the isolated pawn on d5 but also the c5-square. White can continue by gaining control of d4, most likely by playing Bxe5 and Bd4. After that Nc5 and b6 become options, and later in the game Black's pawn on d5 will become a real target.  9.e4 !  The position seems easier for White to play.  9...h6  This stops one of White's main ideas which was e5 and then Bxh7+.   9...dxe4  This is a typical reaction.  10.Nxe4  Nxe4  11.Bxe4  White is slightly better. Compare the light-squared bishops of both sides. White can advance his pawn majority on the Queenside with c3 and b4 etc. White also has some nasty ideas on the Kingside. For example a typical mistake here would be:  11...Bd7 ??  12.Bxh7+ !  This is a typical Greek Gift, leading to a won position for White.  10.exd5   The simplest.  10.e5  was possible, but without a pawn on d4 to support e5 and without any attacking chances against h7, Black will play the break ...f6 at the moment, gaining good counter chances.  10...exd5   10...Nxd5  This is possible if Black wants to try and avoid getting an isolated pawn. White's play is very simple though.  11.Nxd5  Qxd5 ?!   11...exd5  is better, but we have already looked at this type of position.  12.Re1 !  White should aim to stop Black from playing ...e5, as then the bad Bishop on c8 has chances to escape into the game. This also prepares Be4 against any b-pawn move.  12...Rd8  13.Qe2  White is much more comfortable, with ideas of c3, Be4 and Rd1 to follow. Black still has problems developing his Queenside pieces.  11.Qd2 }
5... c5
{ Black decides to counter immediately in the centre of the board, which makes logical sense. It also makes use of 3... a6 which prevents the desirable Nb5.   5...Bb4  This is often a good idea against the Jobava-London, yet I am not so sure here due to White's next move.  6.Nge2 !  We saw this simple developing move in the introductory game. It is also an idea that we should remember. Given a choice we would of course rather not double our pawns on c3. The simple plan now is to play a3 and take over the dark squares.  6...c5 ?!  This natural looking break is one of the reasons why playing ...Bb4 as Black is not always as strong as it seems. White's reply is very instructive.   6...O-O  This makes more sense as ...c5 doesn't really work out for Black.  7.a3  Now that we can capture back on c3 with the Knight, this makes perfect sense.  7...Be7  Black has wasted a lot of time.  8.Rg1 !?  This leads us to a very interesting and exciting position. The concept of pushing with g4 is one that AlphaZero would approve of ! The position can be defined as dynamically equal. White is ready to advance with h4 and g5 etc., but Black remains solid. Of course this is all new stuff so lets take a bit of a deeper look...  8...Nbd7  9 Ng3 is another idea. From g3 the Knight controls h5 therefore after g5 Black must play the passive ...Ne8 rather than ...Nh5.  9.h4  c5  10.g5  Nh5  11.Bh2  With mutual chances. White will aim to play Nf4, Be2, O-O-O and eventually h5 with some attack.  7.a3  The bishop on b4 is required to defend c5, so retreating would allow White to capture on c5.  7...cxd4  8.axb4  dxc3  9.Nxc3  White is much better as in the introductory game Alekseenko vs Kokarev.   5...b5  We have not seen many lines with such an early queenside thrust by Black. It is instructive and important not to panic, and to understand how a Grandmaster handles such a move and strategy.  6.g5  As ever when White and Black are attacking on opposite sides of the board, time and tempos are critical.  6...Nfd7  7.h4  White is making good strides on the Kingside.  7...c5   7...b4 ?!  This would actually help White, as placing the knight on a4 reduces the impact of ...c5.  8.Na4  c5  9.c4 !?  This seems to lead to slightly better chances for White.  9...bxc3  Best as otherwise White's pawn on c4 is a real pain for Black.  10.bxc3  cxd4  11.exd4  I slightly prefer White, as he is solid yet retains chances of attacking on the Kingside with h5 and g6.  8.Nf3  A simple developing move. White will always meet ...b4 with Nge2. In theory this position should be roughly equal. White has space on the Kingside and Black has space on the Queenside. I would prefer to be White though, as there is more potential to start an attack with a blow such as g6. We saw 8 Nce2 in the introductory game, and things will probably transpose here.  8...Nc6  Logically developing.  9.Ne2 !?  I like this sensible move, transposing to Alekseenko vs Riazantsev. White keeps options of c3 available, therefore ensuring a strong centre.  9...Nb6  10.c3  Bd7  10... cxd4 was seen in the model game.  11.h5 !  White must be better. The threat of g6 hovers over Black's head, which is unpleasant. It is not entirely clear just where Black went wrong. }
6. g5
{ You cannot play g4 without going g5 ! This gains space and pushes Black's Knight to a worse square. }
6... Nfd7 { Other squares would seem to be too passive. } 7. Nf3
{ This kind of position should be about equal, but it looks to me to be more fun pushing on the Kingside than the Queenside. The idea of g6 is a key thing to remember in this position. }
7... Nc6 8. a3
{ The choice of Magnus, and a good one as it prevents a black piece from landing on b4, particularly the bishop. ....Bb4 is a move that many Jobava London System players would perhaps prefer to avoid. 8 h4, simply getting on with things, was the other option. }
8... b5 9. h4
{ Supporting g5 in the short term, but as we will see the pawn will not stop at h4. The plan of Kingside expansion/pressure should be clear. h5 and g6 is one breakthrough to remember. }
9... Bb7 10. h5
{ This opens up two main concepts. 1  g6 at the right moment; 2  Bh3 with pressure against e6. }
10... Nb6
{ Logically aiming for ...Nc4.   10...h6  This simply invites the following response.  11.g6 !  fxg6  12.Bd3  Developing with tempo.  12...Ne7  When you force a retreat such as this, you can be fairly confident the opening has gone well.  13.Ne5  White is very much on the front foot. Black had best watch out for the weaknesses around his King. }
11. Qd2
{ This is better than  11.Ne5  ,  which Magnus played against Fabiano. White keeps things flexible and may even capture on c5 followed up with Queenside castling, a brave idea ! Let's take a look at a couple of options that Black may try here. }
11... Be7
{ A very logical move.   11...Nc4 !  Black dives in ! This forceful move seems to be one of Black's best options.  12.Bxc4  dxc4  Opening the Bishop on b7.  13.Rh3 !  A useful prophylactic move. White gets ready with Ne5 in some cases. 13 dxc5 runs into 13... e5 !  13...b4  14.axb4  cxb4  15.Na4  c3 !  Aiming for ...Bb4.  16.Qd3  cxb2  Otherwise b3 from White secures everything on the Queenside.  17.Nxb2  With an interesting position where White's chances are slightly to be preferred. This is because White has many more options to break with a pawn - g6, h6 and e4 being the main three. }
12. dxc5
{ This pawn needs to be captured before playing O-O-O. If   12.O-O-O  Black could play  12...c4  with a ready-made attack. }
12... Bxc5 13. O-O-O
{ A very double edged position. White is relying on two main pawn breaks: e4 and g6, but Black does have some Queenside counterplay. }
13... b4 { Black starts his Queenside action. } 14. h6
{ Opening up the dark squares. } 14... g6
{ 14...bxc3 ?  This is a mistake.  15.Qxc3  Bd6  16.hxg7  Rg8  17.Rxh7  White is winning. }
15. axb4 Bxb4 16. Ne5
{ White is aiming to take over the dark squares with a capture on c6 and Qd4 to follow. The computer assesses this as being better for White. }

Nce2 White aims to play in a more traditional London System way, with c3 coming up next to keep the pawn structure in touch. The computer at first doesn't like this, but it gradually comes around. }
6... c5 { 6...Nh5  is likely to lead to a similar position. } 7. c3
{ White wants to continue with Nf3 and Ne5 with chances in the centre and Kingside, in order to counter Black's Queenside advance. }
7... Nh5 { The computer's top choice. } 8. Nf3
{ Aiming to play against Black's c8-Bishop. } 8... Nxf4 9. exf4 c4
{ Still following the computer's top choice, but only now does it start to think the position is ok for White. }
10. Bc2 b5 11. O-O
{ White will play with Ne5, Qd2-e3 and hopefully the f5-break at some point. That being said, I certainly cannot say that White has an advantage - mainly due to Black's space on the Queenside. This one line does seem to be a good option for Black. Luckily it is very rare, and if you do not feel comfortable here then 5. g4 is always an alternative. }

Another disadvantage of the move ...a6 for Black is that when he plays ...c5, an approach with dxc5 becomes much stronger for White.

{ There is no reason for us to drift from our normal plan. Let's develop and see how Black will set up. }
4... e6
{ This is again logical, Black simply develops. There are now two plans for White. For Chessable I normally only suggest one plan for White, but in this case I am giving two ideas. That is because one idea is very aggressive - 5. g4, while the other idea - 5. Bd3 - is a solid option. You can decide which one suits your needs more. They are both of equal-ish value, yet lead to different games. }
5. Bd3
{ This is a much safer option, and a move that some players may prefer. White simply aims to develop and at later moment  (normally after Nf3 and O-O)  play the typical break e4 ! }
5... c5
{ The most logical move in conjunction with the earlier ...a6, which made Nb5 impossible for us. }

{ Those of you who know me will not be surprised that against a ...g6 setup, pushing Harry the h-pawn is my clear choice. Many players of the black pieces underestimate the potential danger. The clear plan is to push h5 especially after Black plays O-O. Many players of Black do indeed play 5...O-O which as we will see in this game is highly risky. }
5... O-O
{ A brave choice. Two other recent games saw Black hold back on housing the King:   5...h6  was seen in Grischuk-Khusnutdinov - model game #21,   while  5...h5  was played in Navara-Bobras, model game #20.   5...c5  is also an option. These will all be looked at subsequently in the theory section. }
6. h5 Nxh5
{ This is a dubious move at best. Black plays right into White's hands. You may be surprised how often this is played, but it should come as no surprise how strong White's attack is and how hard it is for Black to defend  !  6...c5  is a much stronger move. }
7. Rxh5 gxh5 8. Qxh5 e6 9. Bd3
{ A natural and good developing move, but White had a strong alternative with   9.Qh2  which both threatens c7, prevents Black gaining any immediate counterplay with 9... c5  (as the Knight on b8 would be lost)  , and perhaps most importantly removes the Queen from h5. This means that should a Knight come to the aid of the defence by getting to f6 it does not gain a tempo attacking the Queen. }
9... f5 10. Nf3 Nc6 11. O-O-O

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 g6 4. e3 Bg7
{ 4...c6  I think White should meet this as follows:  5.Nf3  This can lead to lines similar to the Grischuk games. An example of how play might go is as follows.  Bg4  6.Be2  Bg7  7.Ne5  Bxe2  8.Qxe2  O-O  9.h4  +=  White's plan is clear - to push forward on the Kingside with g4 and h5 etc. }
5. h4 O-O
{ 5...c5  6.Nb5  This is an important move to remember when Black plays c5  (while forgetting the preparatory ...a6)  .  6...Na6  7.c3  O-O   7...Bg4  This is safe but should not bother White. For example:  8.Be2  Bxe2  9.Qxe2  O-O  10.Nf3  White has a very pleasant position with more options and better piece placement.   10.h5  may not be 100% sound but can definitely played by the more adventurous people out there.  8.h5  Nxh5  9.Rxh5  gxh5  10.Qxh5  =∞  I would want to be White here every time. The exchange sacrifice is well worth it and Black is a long way from any counterplay. The plan of increasing the Kingside attack presents itself.   5...h5  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...O-O  7.Be2  Nc6   7...c5  8.dxc5  Qa5  9.O-O  White castles Kingside in this specific position to avoid the open g7-a1 diagonal, and to have the immediate option of Nb5.  9...Qxc5  10.Nb5  a6  11.Nc7  Ra7  12.a3  b6  13.b4  Qc6  14.Nb5  axb5  15.Bxb8  +=  This is slightly better for White due to the disconnected and weak nature of Black's pawn structure.  8.O-O  a6  9.Ng5  Ng4  10.Qd2  Bf5  11.Rad1  I think White's position is more pleasant given that it's easier for him to advance in the centre - with f3 and e4 - due to the placement of his Qd2 backed up by Rd1.  7.Qd2  Bxf3   7...Nc6  8.Ng5  O-O  9.f3  Bd7  10.O-O-O  +=  White's pieces are significantly better placed than Black's. Kb1 and e4 are likely to follow.  8.gxf3  Nc6   8...O-O  was seen in the introductory Navara game.  9.O-O-O  O-O  10.e4  +=  This position is comfortably better for White: better development, piece placement and control of the centre. White may continue with moves such as Kb1, e5 and perhaps Bh6.   5...h6  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...c5  7.Nb5  This leads us into a position where White gets in Nb5, which effectively forces the reply ...Na6 when White's pieces are dominant over Black's.  7.Be2  c6   7...Nc6  This is an alternative that gives us a clear indication of what Black's plans are.  8.Ne5  Bxe2   8...Nxe5  9.Bxe5  Bxe2  10.Qxe2  This transposes to the previous line.  9.Qxe2  Nxe5  10.Bxe5  c6  11.g4  +=  White will continue with a Kingside expansion/assault. It's easy to see that White has the better position and chances.  8.Ne5  Bxe2  9.Qxe2  Nbd7  10.O-O-O  h5   10...Qa5  was seen in the introductory Grischuk game.  11.f3  Nxe5  12.Bxe5  +=  Once again White is to be preferred with better control of the centre, a lead in development and a clear way forward with e4, dominating the centre. }
6. h5
{ This is the most aggressive and best move after Black played 5... O-O. I think Black is inviting trouble. White has to be prepared to sacrifice an exchange, but it's well worth it. }
6... Nxh5
{ This is the type of position which a computer might be able to hold as Black but it requires very accurate defence which is well beyond the powers of most people.   6...c5  7.hxg6  hxg6   7...fxg6  8.dxc5  This move was the choice of Aronian on 2 occassions, both leading to online victories over Nepomniatchi.  8...b6  The most active response, going for counterplay.   8...Nc6  9.Nf3  Qa5  10.Qd2  Qxc5  There are chances for both sides here. A sample line may be as follows:  11.Be2  Bf5  12.Nd4  e5  13.Nxf5  exf4  14.Nxg7  Kxg7  15.O-O-O  This is roughly equal. On the plus side White currently has a better structure and a Bishop vs. a Knight. With pawns on both sides of the board any endgames could well favour White.  9.cxb6  Qxb6  10.Rb1  Nc6  11.Nf3  Qa5  12.Bb5  +=  I think this is an improvement over 12. Nd2 as played by Aronian. White has an extra pawn and Black does not have sufficient counterplay.  8.Qd2  Nc6  This is the only move Black has played in my database.   8...cxd4  +=  is not a problem for White. Any source of counterplay against White's impending Kingside attack will most likely take place in the centre, so breaking the tension and allowing the Queen on d2 to support Bh6 favours White.  9.Nge2  Strong players, including Nigel Short, have favoured this move. At first glance it may look a little odd but it develops a piece, supports the centre and if White put the Knight on f3 here Black would have a strong reply with ...Ne4.  9...Re8  10.dxc5   10.O-O-O  led to a reasonably comfortable game for Short in the introductory game. White is patient enough to shore up the centre and Queenside before embarking on his plan of a Kingside attack, but Black could have improved on 10... b5 with 10... Qa5. It is for that reason that I think White should switch his attention to the centre by capturing on c5 and putting pressure on the d-file.  10...e5  This is Black's only realistic move to fight.   10...Bf5  11.O-O-O  Black will probably need to play e5 now, but the insertion of Bf5 and O-O-O favours White due to the pressure along the d-file.  11.Bg5  Pinning the Knight on f6 and putting pressure on d5.  d4  This is Black's only realistic way to fight.   11...Be6  12.O-O-O  Qe7  13.Nb5 !  b6  14.Nec3 !  when  14...bxc5  is met by  15.Bxf6  Bxf6  16.Nxd5  +-  White is a clean pawn up with a better position.  12.Nb5  b6  Black is a pawn down and must be as active as possible in creating counterplay.  13.Nd6  With chances for both sides, for example:  13...Re6  14.Ng3  bxc5  15.Nxc8  Rxc8  16.Bc4  Re7  17.Rd1  I somewhat prefer White. He has two Bishops and good attacking files and diagonals, but Black currently has central control. }
7. Rxh5 gxh5 8. Qxh5
{ White's plan is not subtle but it doesn't need to be. It's a direct attack on Black's King. Currently Black only has his dark-squared Bishop defending the King. If he has any realistic chance of surviving he will need to bring in reinforcements and blunt White's threats. }

Just aim to stop ...e5 with moves such as O-O-O, Qe3, Nf3 and even Bg5.

{ In this game we look at what happens when Black aims to counterplay on the Queenside with ...c6. I feel this plan is too slow. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 { We prefer the move order   2.Nc3  g6  3.Bf4. } 2... g6 3.
Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Qd2 h5
{ A strange but interesting move, taken from lines of the Dragon variation of the Sicilian. Black wants to stop White from playing Bh6 at all costs. The downside is that White now has an outpost on g5, as he doesn't have to fear ...h6, and ideas of playing g2-g4 opening up the Kingside. }
6. O-O-O c6 7. Nf3 { Simple play in the centre. } 7... b5
{ This all seems rather slow and White now aims to punish that. } 8. e5
{ White is much better positioned to hit in the centre. This opens things up to White's advantage. }
8... dxe5
{ 8...b4 !  was a much better and a more typical idea. If the c3-Knight moves Black has ...Nd5, and after  9.exf6  bxc3  10.Qxc3  Bxf6  11.Bc4  Nd7  Black can claim a certain amount of counterplay, but I think White is still better. }
9. Nxe5
{ There was nothing wrong with   9.dxe5  Qxd2+  10.Rxd2  Nfd7  11.e6 !  ,  when Black would be really struggling. For example,  11...fxe6  12.Bd3  Nf8  13.Nxb5 !  Tactics !  13...cxb5  14.Be4  and White is winning. }
9... Be6 10. Kb1 Qa5 11. a3
{ A rather blunderfull rapid game ! There was a nice tactic here:   11.d5 !  would have won on the spot ! The idea is  11...cxd5  12.Nxd5  Qxd2  13.Nc7+  Kd8  14.Nxe6+  fxe6  15.Rxd2+  with a winning game. }
11... b4 12. axb4 Qxb4 13. Nb5

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. Bf4
{ This works best for our opening.   3.e4  tranposes to the Pirc defence, if you are interested in playing that. }
3... Bg7
{ 3...d5  transposes to Theory 6.   3...c5  4.dxc5  This is an interesting way to play which merits further investigation.   4.d5  will be examined later.  4...Qa5  5.e4  Qxc5   5...Nxe4  6.Qd4  Nxc3   6...Nf6  7.b4  Qd8  8.Nb5  Na6  9.Qe3  Nxb4  10.Nd6#  7.Qxh8  6.Qd2  White has the usual attacking ideas of O-O-O and h2-h4-h5. }
4. e4
{ And why not ! It seems so logical to take over the centre. White is now planning to stop Black from playing ...e5 and mate Black on the h-file, with the standard plan Bh6, O-O-O, h4 etc.! Take a look at the 'informational' games to see what I say about how White should stop ...e5.   4.Qd2  is also interesting, but  d5  may be a good response that takes us out of our repertoire. }
4... d6
{ The first thing that most people have said to me about this position is, 'This is just a Pirc/Modern defence !?'. Well, yes and no ! I will let you into a little secret that I heard from a good 'informant'. Magnus stated that this line with Bf4 is one of the reasons he doesn't go into this position as Black. He feels it is very bad for Black. Not sure if that piece of information is true or not, but I totally agree with it ! This position looks very positive for White. It is not a normal Pirc or Modern as Black has messed his move order up by playing ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 too early. This is a problem for Black as now he cannot play ...e5 ! easily, which is a move he would love to play.   4...O-O  5.e5 !  I was going to suggest the simple move 5. Nf3, but then I found the interesting novelty 5... d5 !? 6. exd5 c6 !  which looks dangerous for White. 5 e5 ! is also just a strong move that gives White an advantage.  5...Ne8  Black's one chance of breaking out here is ...d6 so it now makes sense to prepare against that move.   5...Nh5  In the words of Ben Finegold - 'suspicious'. What a hero that guy is.  6.Bd2 !  The Bishop gets out of the way of ...c5 and ...cxd4 when the Bishop on e3 is attacked. There is now no good way for Black to avoid g4 !  6...c5  6... Bh8 and 7... Ng7 is too ugly to be considered.  7.g4  cxd4  8.Nce2  The point of putting the Bishop on d2.  8...Nc6  9.gxh5  I simply do not believe that Black has enough compensation here. White is a piece up with no real weaknesses. Just develop and get that King safe.  6.Qe2 !  So that a Rook can come to d1.  6...d6  7.O-O-O  White is clearly better, with more space and chances to start a typical attack with h4-h5.   4...d5 !?  Is an interesting way to try and gain some active counterplay against White's strong centre.  5.e5  Positionally correct. The pawn on e5 is a powerhouse that blocks out Black's Bishop on g7.  5...Ne4  6.Nxe4  Let's not let that Knight linger for too long.  6...dxe4  7.Bc4 !  This logical developing move seems best. The Bishop swings into play on an active square. I would prefer to be in White's shoes here as Black has to be quite careful playing against the two central pawns.  7...c5  This break will have to be played at some point, otherwise those pawns are just too strong.  8.dxc5 !  Otherwise Black gets good play against the pawns with ...Nc6 and ...Bg4. This keeps some pressure against Black's position.  8...O-O  9.Qxd8  Rxd8  10.c3  Preparing b4 in some situations.  10...Nc6  11.e6 !  The key move. This pawn will be lost anyway, so why not do some damage to Black's position in the process ?  11...Bxe6  12.Bxe6  fxe6  13.Ne2  I am sure most players would prefer to be White here. White can aim for simplifications and then use his Queenside pawn majority to make a Queen. Easy really... }
5. Qd2 Nc6
{ This seems best. Black actively aims to play ...e5 - a move that we are well positioned to stop, or at least discourage.   5...O-O  Castling into it ! Just what any red blooded chess player would love to see !  6.O-O-O  Other moves are possible, but this makes White's intentions clear: Bh6, h4, h5 and mate !  Nbd7   6...c6  This is far too slow. White should just get on with the job in hand.  7.f3  We can state a mini rule here... 1: Against ...Nc6 White is better off playing Nf3 as control of e5 is the most important thing to consider. 2: Against ...c6, f3 is best. That is because Black is planning ...b5 ...b4 and ...Nxe4, it makes sense to defend e4 and then turn all efforts against Black's King.  7...b5  8.Kb1  A useful move. White can now always play Nce2 and Nc1 if  (and it is a big 'if')  Black generates any attack.  8...a5  9.Bh6  Standard stuff.  9...a4  10.h4 !  With h5 hxg6 Bxg7 and Qh6 to follow, I would be amazed if Black avoids being checkmated.  7.e5 !  Now that Black has blocked his pieces up this move seems very appropriate.  Nh5  8.Bh6  This was seen in the game Rapport vs. Getz, which finished in a quick win for White.  8...c5  9.exd6  exd6  10.Nf3  White has great positional pressure along the d-file ensuring him a great game.   5...c6  Playing in 'Pirc' fashion. Black wants to start counterplay on the Queenside with ...b5. It does all seem a bit slow to me though.  6.Bh6  Here we go !  6...Bxh6  7.Qxh6  And with Black not being able to castle White should feel confident. Kuzubov vs. Benidze, 2019, now continued as follows:  7...e5   7...Qa5  This looks like a better try, at least Black has created a threat...  8.Bd3  c5  9.dxc5  Again, simple chess just like in most lines of the Jobava-London attack !  9...Qxc5  10.h3 !  There was a threat of ...Qxf2+ and . ..Ng4+.  10...Nc6  11.Nf3  Be6  White is a bit better with his King about to castle. There are also ideas of Ng5 for Black to worry about.  8.Nf3  Qe7  9.dxe5  dxe5  10.Bc4  Simple chess. Develop and attack.  10...b5  11.Bb3  Be6  12.O-O  White has everything out and Black will still struggle to get his King safe. The next step would be to take control of the d-file with Rfd1, Rd2 and Rad1. }
6. O-O-O O-O
{ Preventing e5. White continues to do this for the next few moves. } 7. Nf3
{ Against ...Nc6 this is best as it helps control e5, which is a key square. }
7... Bg4
{ Again fighting for ...e5. Other moves allow ideas such as h4 or Be2 first and then h4/Bh6. }
8. Qe3
{ This looks very clear to me. The Queen slides out of the way of the Rook on d1 and in the process stops ...e5. Black may be ok here, but as we saw in the 'informational' game he has to be very careful. }
8... Nd7
{ An understandable but passive move as we saw earlier.   8...Nh5 !  The best move and a find of Nepomniachtchi, but you must ask yourself; How many players would find such a move ?  9.Bg5 !  Stopping the e-pawn from moving. Bh6 is still on the cards but there is no rush to play it.  9...f6  A clumsy pawn.  10.Bh6  e5  Black finally gets his move in !  11.Bc4+  Kh8  12.Bxg7+  Kxg7  13.Ne2 !?  Controlling d4 and f4. Black is most likely fine here, but no more than fine. White should aim to play h3 and g4, which may well lead to a Kingside attack. It also holds up Black's main pawn break ...f5. }
9. Bg5
{ 9.Bh6  is most likely good as well, but this is a cute way to stop Black's plans. }
9... Qe8 { Black is desperate to play ...e5. } 10. Bh6
{ Only now that the Queen has misplaced itself. } 10... Bxf3
{ 10...e5  This should be met as follows:  11.dxe5 !  This is important in this variation. It is tempting to push with d5, but capturing on e5 is often best.  11...dxe5  12.Nd5 !  White is much better. }
11. gxf3
{ Another good move. Let's open the g-file and bring another pawn to the centre. }
11... e5 12. Bxg7 Kxg7 13. dxe5 Qxe5 14. Nd5
{ White has a great attacking position with f4 and h4 as likely follow ups. } *

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nc6
{ A rather rare move that one may face. Saying that, this move should also come as a pleasant surprise to the player of the white pieces due to White's next move. It should be noted that some players will try to copy your moves, but we see now another advantage why 2 Nc3 is my preferred move, compared to 2 Bf4. After 2 Bf4 the reply 2... Bf5 is a decent move, yet against 2 Nc3 the move 2... Nc6 doesn't fare as well. }
3. e4
{ Transposing to a line of the Nimzowitsch Defence 1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 which has been known to be better for White for some time. }
3... dxe4
{ The most logical move. Other options leave White with a safe and secure advantage. Saying that, so does 3... dxe4... The other options are looked at in the theory section. }
4. d5 Ne5 5. Qd4 Ng6 6. Be3
{ 6.h4 !?  is one move I would find hard to avoid.   6.Qxe4  is what I suggest in the theory section, as it seems like a simple way to a good chance of gaining an edge. Saying that, the move picked by Jobava - 6. Be3 - keeps more tension in the position and is a good alternative option for White.  6...Nf6   6...a6 ?!  is rather over cautious. White is now safely better after  7.h4 !?  who would have thought that I would suggest such a move... It makes perfect sense to dislodge the g6-Knight.  7...Nf6  8.Qa4+  Bd7  9.Qb3  e6  10.h5  Ne5  11.Bf4  Bd6  12.h6 !  With an advantage for White, for example  12...g6  13.O-O-O.  7.Qa4+  Bd7  8.Bb5  See the theory section. }
6... e5
{ Black must gain some space.   6...Nf6  7.Nxe4  can be fun. For example,  7...e5  8.Nxf6+ !  is tactically fun for White.  8...Qxf6  9.Bb5+  c6  10.dxc6 !  ,  with the idea  10...bxc6   10...exd4 ?  11.cxb7+  Kd8  12.bxa8=Q  is just winning for White.  11.Qe4 !  Bd7  12.O-O-O  ±  White has some useful pressure against Black's position and is ahead in development. }
7. dxe6 Bxe6 { 7...Qxd4  allows the intermezzo  8.exf7+. } 8. Nge2
{ A new idea at the time from Jobava. Black now has to tread with care. Instead,   8.Qxe4  causes Black only minor issues. }
8... Nf6
{ Sensible, but so is   8...Qxd4  9.Nxd4  ,  when  9...Bb4  is a good try from Black, with the idea  10.Nxe6  Bxc3+  causing some pawn problems.  11.bxc3  fxe6  12.Bc4  with a strange middlegame/endgame. White has the two Bishops but I am not so sure this position is too bad for Black. White can castle and then place a Rook on e1. Then, if White does manage to pick up the Black pawn on e4, he would have great chances to be better. If you like the look of this variation then Jobava's 8. Nge2 may be the move for you. }
9. O-O-O Qxd4
{ It is high time to remove the Queens, especially as Qa4+ was becoming an idea. }
10. Nxd4
{ This seems like an important position to assess to determine if 8 Nge2 is a good idea for White. My general feeling is that the position should be equal but it is much easier for White to play, which is a major factor. In the game Jobava makes things look simple. }
10... Bg4
{ A risky move that complicates matters. But according to my computer this seems ok !   10...O-O-O !  looks safer:  11.Nxe6  Rxd1+  12.Kxd1  fxe6  13.Bc4  Black is a pawn up but under some pressure from White's Bishops. This should be roughly equal after  13...Kd7 !  Black needs to keep his extra pawn otherwise he will suffer in the Endgame.  14.Bg5  I think it's time to bail out. White can capture on f6 and then e4. }
11. Bb5+ c6 12. Nxc6 { Here we go  !  12.Be2  O-O-O  is nothing for White. }
12... a6
{ The best defence.  12...Bxd1  would be better for White after  13.Nxa7+  Ke7  14.Rxd1.  Black's King is just too unsafe, for example,  14...Rd8  15.Re1  Ke6  16.Bb6  with a big attack. White is planning Bc4+ and Nxe4. }
13. Ba4 Bxd1
{ Grabbing material but handing White the initiative. Instead   13...Nd7  was another option, but things look very scary for Black after  14.Nd5  with some nice checkmate threats ! The computer keeps his cool here though with  (Bd6,)  when White seems to have nothing immediate, but can keep the pressure on with  15.Nd4  b5   15...Bxd1  16.Nf5 !  is better for White  16.f3 !  exf3  17.gxf3  Bh3  18.Bb3  O-O  when Black has survived with an equal game, but there were a lot of bullets to dodge in that sequence ! }
14. Rxd1 Be7 { Black is actually ok here according to the computer. } 15. Nxe7+
{ 15.Nb8+ !?  was one weird try, with a mess after  15...Kf8  16.Nd7+  Nxd7  17.Rxd7  and even though Black is an exchange up it is a bit tricky to unravel. Saying that, Black is doing ok. }
15... Kxe7
{ A hard position to judge ! According to the computer Black is ok, but things are not simple ! }
16. Bc5+ { Come forwards my friend... } 16... Ke6 17. Ne2
{ Or   17.f3 !?  ,  opening up more lines !  17...Rad8  18.Bb3+  Ke5  19.Re1  0.00 according to the computer - of course it is... }
17... Rhd8 18. Nd4+ Ke5 19. Bb6 { Aiming for Bc7+. } 19... Rdc8 20. Ne2
{ Such a fun game ! Can Black survive ? } 20... Nf8 21. Bd4+ Kf5 22. Ng3+ Kg6
23. f4 { White keeps on coming ! } 23... exf3
{ It is dangerous to open up lines for White to attack. Another idea would have been   23...h5  ,  aiming to run to safety.  24.f5+  Kh6  White has good compensation but that is all. }
24. c3 { Bc2+ is a useful check. } 24... fxg2
{ Too greedy ! Black was doing ok if he had instead played   24...Ne6 !  25.Bc2+  Kg5  ,  but what human would do this ?  26.Be3+  Kh4  It looks so scary but is 0.00 apparently... }
25. Bc2+ Kg5
{ Black had to try   25...Kh6 !  but after  26.Nf5+  Kg5  27.Be3+  Kg4  28.Rd4+  Ne4  29.Bxe4  things are very bad for Black. }
26. Be3+ Kg4 27. Rd4+ { Come to Daddy ! } 27... Kh3 28. Bf5+ Kxh2 29. Rh4+

{ The most logical move. Other options leave White with a safe and secure advantage. Saying that, so does 3... dxe4...   3...Nf6  This leads to a bad French Defence for Black. The issue is that Black already has a Knight on c6 so the typical break ...c5 is no longer available.  4.e5 !  Simple and good.  4...Nd7   4...Ne4  5.Nxe4  dxe4  6.Ne2  ±  This is much better for White. The pawn on e4 will probably drop with Ng3 at some point. Black would love to play ...c5 here but can't because of the misplaced c6-Knight.  5.Nxd5  There are other good options, but this forcing move gives Black a number of chances to go wrong.  5...Ndb8  Otherwise Black is simply a pawn down.  6.Nc3  Qxd4  7.Be3 !?  A gambit line which is very dangerous for Black. White has many ideas with Nb5 hanging over Black.  7...Qxe5   7...Qxd1+  This may be the lesser evil, but Black is still struggling here.  8.Rxd1  +=  Nxe5 ?  This is a big mistake, which may trick a fair few people.   8...e6  Entombing the Bishop on c8.  9.f4  White has a space and positional edge. He can continue with standard development and even consider playing Nb5.  9.Nd5 !  +-  And White is winning !  Kd8  10.Nb6+  This forces resignation, for example.  8.Bc4 !  This is a new idea. The point is that Nf3 can wait and we want to meet ...Qd6 with Qe2. No Queen exchanges please !  8...e6  9.Nf3  Qd6  10.Qe2  Now that the Bishop is on c4 this looks very good for White. A Rook will come to d1, a Knight to b5 and Black is massively behind in development.   3...e6  This is a bad French that can be reached after the moves. 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 Nc6 ? The Knight on c6 is a real hindrance for Black as Black needs to play ...c5 in the French. Standard developing moves will now work well. Play could continue as follows:  4.Nf3  +=  Bb4  5.e5  Nge7  6.Bd3  White is hoping for O-O when I will let you work out the rest. }
4. d5 Ne5
{ I expect most people will jump forwards here.   4...Nb8  This is pretty uninspiring. I would try to punish such a move as follows:  5.f3 !?  Nxe4 is of course ok, but Black actually has pretty good equalising chances after 5... c6 ! 5 f3 !? seems totally logical, lets punish our opponent for moving his pieces backwards. How dare he !  5...exf3  There are other moves, but this is so unlikely to appear on the board that it feels silly to waste too much time on it.  6.Qxf3 !  So when Black plays ...c6 or ...e6 we are not in danger of exchanging Queens.  g6  7.Bf4  With great development and a nice space adavantage. White will play O-O-O, Bc4 and then start pushing with g4 and h4. Such a fun position to play. }
5. Qd4 Ng6 6. Qxe4

With an advantage for White, for example:  12...g6  13.O-O-O  Black is cramped and will feel pressure along the d-file. }
7. Qa4+ Bd7 8. Bb5

{ It should be noted that some players will try to copy your moves, but we now see another advantage why 2 Nc3 is my preferred move compared to 2 Bf4. After 2 Bf4 the reply 2... Bf5 is a decent move, yet against 2 Nc3 Nc6 doesn't fare as well. }

{ Transposing to a line of the Nimzowitsch Defence 1 e4 Nc6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 which has been known to be better for White for some time. }
3... Nf6
{ This leads to a bad French Defence for Black. The issue is that Black already has a Knight on c6 so the typical break ...c5 is no longer available. }
4. e5 { Simple and good. } 4... Nd7 5. Nxd5
{ There are other good options, but this forcing move gives Black a number of chances to go wrong. }
5... Ndb8 { Otherwise Black is simply a pawn down. } 6. Nc3 Qxd4 7. Be3
{ A gambit line which is very dangerous for Black. White has many ideas with Nb5 hanging over Black. }
7... Qxe5 8. Bc4
{ This is a new idea. The point is that Nf3 can wait and we want to meet ...Qd6 with Qe2. No Queen exchanges please ! }
8... e6 9. Nf3 Qd6 10. Qe2
{ Now that the Bishop is on c4 this looks very good for White. A Rook will come to d1, a Knight to b5 and Black is massively behind in development. }

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 c5
{ A logical enough move, but one that is not so popular at the higher levels. I believe the reason for this is that it allows White the option of sacrificing into an Albin Countergambit, but with an extra tempo - a strategy that players of the black pieces will be afraid of meeting. For this course I am going to suggest two set-ups for White. In this game we look at the more refrained set up, where White doesn't sacrifice a pawn but keeps some pressure on Black's set-up. }
3. e4
{ This is the move that has put Black off playing 2... c5. We should make those fears come real ! Other moves are no threat to Black and allows him easy equality. }
3... dxe4 4. Bb5+
{ 4.d5  ,  'The Turbo Albin Counter Gambit', is looked at in the next introductory game and in the theory section, but first this safe approach.  With 4 Bb5+ White keeps some pressure on Black yet doesn't go 'all in', as White will win his pawn back by capturing on c5. I decided to give you guys two options here as it is really a matter of style with what option you decide upon. This check leads to pretty equal positions but Black has to find the more accurate defensive moves. }
4... Bd7 { Other options are looked at in the theory section. } 5. dxc5
{ recapturing the pawn and increasing the pressure along the d-file. } 5... Nf6
6. Be3 e6 7. Nge2
{ This is a very simple line for White, but again I must stress that White really doesn't have any advantage in such lines. Black has the central pawn mass and will wriggle out of any minor issues that he has on the d-file with accurate play. }
7... Qc8
{ Attacking c5 and making ...Bxb5 an important idea, as now there is no Queen to capture on d8. }
8. Qd4
{ The position is equal. White should aim to play along the d-file and support his pawn on c5 with an eventual b4. }
8... a6
{ Yet again very sensible. Black asks the Bishop where it wants to move to. }
9. Ba4
{ 9.Bxd7+  helps Black develop with  (Nbxd7,)  when White should think about doing some bailing out with  10.Nxe4  Nxe4  11.Qxe4  Bxc5.  Things are equal and dare I say it a bit boring... }
9... Nc6
{ 9...Bxa4  10.Qxa4+ !  Nbd7  11.O-O-O  creates some pressure against Black's position, even though Black is equal here after  11...Bxc5  12.Bxc5  b5 !   12...Qxc5  13.Nxe4  is something that Black should avoid.  13.Nxe4 !  Otherwise White would be in danger of being worse.  13...Nxe4  14.Qxe4  Nxc5  with equality. }

10... Bxc6 11. Rd1

5... a6 6. Qe2
{ This is what most top players play, but I give my reasons for not picking this as my main move in the theory section. Saying that, I would still be very tempted to play this move in a practical game. The positions that we reach may not be 100% correct, but as we see in this game things are very double edged and anything can happen. Do remember to not get too carried away with what the computer always gives. Practical chess is different ! }
6... g6
{ The best move. Black should aim to castle as quickly as possible. Against other moves White will play O-O-O or just capture on e4.   6...Bf5 ?!  ,  trying to hold on to the pawn, is just a mistake. White will have chances to play f3 and g4, for example:  7.f3  exf3  8.Nxf3  g6  9.h3 !  With g4 and the advantage to come. }
7. O-O-O
{ 7.Nxe4  is possible, but often transposes or leads to a very similar position. }
7... Bg7 8. Nxe4 Nxe4 9. Qxe4 O-O
{ A key position that I spent ages looking at ! Unfortunately I ended up coming to the conclusion that with precise play Black is doing fine, if not a bit better than White. Saying that, life should be a gamble now and again right !? }
10. Qe3
{ This is suggested in most sources as White's best move. It does seem logical to follow up with Bh6 weakening Black's Kingside. }
10... Qa5
{ This is ok, but not as strong as   10...Nd7  followed by ...Nf6 in my opinion.   10...Bf5  seems to make the Bishop a target more than anything.  11.Bh6  and White just gets on with things.   10...Nd7 !  is a new and good idea. This is what I struggled to find anything against, for example  11.Bh6  Bxh6 !  12.Qxh6  Nf6  When Black seems to be quicker in attacking compared to White:  13.h4  Qa5 !  14.a3  b5 !  15.h5  b4  16.hxg6  Bg4 !!  This is an amazing move which is also very annoying ! Maybe there is something here, but I couldn't find it for White. }
11. Kb1 Bf5
{ Just a bit slow. The Bishop may look active here, but there are no real threats.  11...Nd7 !?  was better. }
12. Bh6
{ Both sides are hammering at each other on opposite sides of the board. Who will land their blow first !? }
12... Rd8
{ Another slightly dubious move. This is just too slow and now White takes over.  It does seem that Black's best option in most cases is the risky move   12...Bxh6 !?  Which allows the White Queen in but also gains some time for the attack.  13.Qxh6  Nd7  14.g4  Very interesting !   14.f3  was also possible, but this is crazy fun.  14...Bxg4   14...Bxc2+ !?  is crazy:  15.Kxc2  Qa4+  16.Kc1  Qxa2  17.Bd3 !  This Bishop can be used to defend and attack.  17...c4 !  Messy !  15.f3  Bf5  16.Bh3 !  The point ! This is a tactical idea that I have never seen before.  16...Bxh3  17.Nxh3  White has good attacking chances. The Knight should actually move to f4, to be combined with h4-h5. }
13. Bxg7 Kxg7 14. Be2
{ A bit slow as well. A more fun move would have been   14.g4 !?  ,  with the idea  14...Bxg4  15.Be2  Bxe2  16.Nxe2  and the h-pawn will come ! This looks very nice for White. }
14... Qa4 15. Qc1 Rd6 { 15...Nd7  made more sense. } 16. f3 h5 17. b3
{ Far too passive. It seems that White has forgotten about his attack. It was still there after  17.h4 !  with g4 ! and h5 ! to follow. Black's King will struggle to survive, for example  17...Nd7  18.g4 !  hxg4  19.h5  Nf6  20.b3  Qa5  21.hxg6  And the Queen on c1 is ready to enter. }

{ The best defence seems to be   21...g3 !  22.hxg6  fxg6  23.Qh6+  Kf7  which is defending for Black.  24.Be2 }
22. hxg6 Qxg6

Be4 24. Bf3 Bc6

{ This is a safe option. With 4 Bb5+ White keeps some pressure on Black yet doesn't go 'all in', as White will win his pawn back by capturing on c5. This check leads to pretty equal positions but Black has to find the more accurate defensive moves. White's plan is to capture on c5 in nearly all positions. }
4... Bd7
{ A sensible move that I imagine most players would play.   4...Nc6!?  This is an interesting choice, as the natural 5 d5 leads to nothing after 5... a6. For that reason I would suggest that White plays as follows:  5.Nge2!  Developing and holding the centre together.  5...a6!  Keeping it simple. Other options were worse.   5...cxd4?!  This is rather natural but not as good as 5... a6. White can now gain some pressure.  6.Nxd4  Bd7  7.Bxc6  Simple chess works well here!  7...bxc6   7...Bxc6  This is worse.  8.Nxc6  Qxd1+  9.Kxd1  bxc6  10.Nxe4  White has a safe and stable advantage due to his better pawn structure.  8.Nxe4  Nf6  9.Nxf6+  gxf6  This is quite an interesting position which feels like it should be more fun for White.  10.Qh5!  The Queen is well placed here. The position is equal but with a lot of play for both sides. As White I would be castling and then aiming for pressure down the e-file. Another idea would be to maneuver the Knight to c5 via b3. c5 is a nice outpost that can be supported with Be3.  6.Bxc6+  bxc6  7.Be3  White has good compensation for the pawn. Black has numerous pawn weaknesses and is not as well developed as White. White should naturally castle and then either aim to win the pawn on e4 back, or try the more adventurous f3 idea with Rxf3 to follow. It would be nice to see some practical examples of this!   4...Nd7  This may well be playable but it does look rather strange to block the Bishop on c8 in.  5.dxc5  Sensible and good here.  5...Ngf6  6.Qd4  A common idea in these positions. The Queen is a good piece and White prepares to castle Queenside in some cases. White has the advantage, for example,  6...e5!?  This is a rather desperate move, but with Bf4 and c6 coming Black had to do something.   6...e6?  This is a normal move, but it allows the following:  7.Bf4  With c6 or O-O-O to follow Black's position is on the verge of falling apart.  7...Be7?  This falls into a trick.  8.c6!  bxc6  9.Bxc6  White is winning material and hopefully the game!  7.Qxe5+  Be7  8.Be3  Bringing the bits out. White doesn't need to do anything heroic.  8...O-O  9.Bxd7  Simplifying into a good position.  9...Nxd7  10.Qg3  Nxc5  Black has won a pawn back, but at what cost?  11.Rd1  Qa5  12.Nge2  White has great piece development. He will castle and play Nd5 and Bd4 with an attack against Black's King. }
5. dxc5 { Regaining the pawn and increasing the pressure along the d-file. }
5... Nf6
{ 5...e6  This is another option but things will likely transpose to the main line as follows:  6.Be3  Nf6.   5...Bxb5?!  There is no reason for Black to give up castling rights.  6.Qxd8+  Kxd8  7.Nxb5  With Be3-f4 and O-O-O+ to follow Black has some issues along the d-file. }
6. Be3 e6 7. Nge2
{ A very simple line for White, but again I must stress that White really doesn't have any advantage in such lines. Black has the central pawn mass and, with accurate play, will wriggle out of any minor issues that he has on the d-file. }
7... Qc8
{ Attacking c5 and making ...Bxb5 a bigger idea, as now there is no Queen to capture on d8. }
8. Qd4
{ The position is equal. White should aim to play along the d-file and support his pawn on c5 with an eventual b4. Take a look at the informational game to gain some more experience with this line. }

{ Certainly the best move. Other options are weaker.In this chapter I am going to give you two options as to how to play on the 4th move. One is rather more reserved and doesn't sacrifice anything, so is suited to players who prefer minimum risk. The other option is to enter into a famous gambit line that Black plays  (The Albin Countergambit)  but a tempo up. This is a very fun way to play and would be my personal preference. }
4. Bb5+
{ This is a safe option. With 4 Bb5+ White keeps some pressure on Black yet doesn't go 'all in', as White will win his pawn back by capturing on c5. This check leads to pretty equal positions but Black has to find the more accurate defensive moves. White's plan is to capture on c5 in nearly all positions. }

White can often win the pawn back on e4, but first he should think about plans with Nb5 and Nd5. This position is uncomfortable for Black. A sample line is as follows:  6...Nf6  Holding on to Black's one trump, the extra pawn on e4.  7.O-O-O+  Bd7  8.f3 !  A logical follow up, which is actually quite a common theme in a number of these gambit lines. White quickly brings his Knight on g1 into the game.  8...exf3  9.Nxf3  Ke8  The only move.  10.Nb5  Bxb5   10...Na6  This runs into problems.  11.Ne5  The pressure is becoming too much.  11...Bc6  12.Nxc6  bxc6  Now White has a clever and devastating move:  13.g3 !  This has the following idea:  13...cxb5  14.Bxb5+  Nd7  15.Bxd7+  Kd8  16.Bb5+  Kc8  17.Bxa6#  A pretty checkmate !  11.Bxb5+  Nc6  12.Ne5  White has a great attack and is doing well.  5.Qxd5  Bd7  Black has ideas of ...Nf6 and some play. I doubt it is enough though.  6.a3  A safe move to stop anything nasty coming into b4.  6...Nf6  7.Qd3  e5  8.Nf3  White will castle soon with an extra pawn. This can't be bad !   3...e6 ?!  This is far too timid.  4.exd5  exd5  5.dxc5  White has immediate pressure against the isolated pawn on d5 with an advantage. }
4. d5
{ This is a reversed Albin Countergambit with an extra tempo. According to my work this does require a leap of faith. White gets good practical chances but Black is fine and even better with perfect play. }
4... Nf6
{ We have reached the Albin Counter Gambit a tempo up for White. White now has a number of options. For the sake of this course we will concentrate on the straightforward approach of playing Bf4, a typical idea in the Albin. I must say that after the research that I have done here, I don't have a lot of faith in the Albin, even with an extra tempo ! So, the main line I am giving ends in a draw by perpetual check after following some long computer lines. Practically though the Albin does give White a fun and exciting game with great practical chances. If you want something more stable then 4 Bb5+ is the way to play. }
5. Bf4
{ Other options that I spent some time investigating included  5.f3  ,   5.Nge2 !?   and  5.Bg5.  However, 5 Bf4 is very logical. The Bishop on f4 finds a good diagonal where we can meet ....e6 with d6 or ...g6 with Qd2 and Bh6. And there cannot be anything wrong with developing a piece ! This position is often more commonly arrived at via the move order 1 d4 d5 2 Bf4 c5 3 e4 dxe4 4 d5 Nf6 5 Nc3 which some of you could find useful if you also play the straight London System, as this is a dangerous plan against 2... c5 there as well. }
5... a6
{ This is the move that most top players pick. Black rules out the idea of any White piece coming to b5, a sensible approach. This combined with ...g6 is the best approach for Black, according to my research.   5...e6  This move aims to break the tension immediately, but it does allow the following response.  6.Bb5+ !  This is a very annoying check for Black to cope with.  6...Bd7   6...Nbd7 ?!  Here the Knight just gets in the way of Black's pieces.  7.dxe6  fxe6  8.Qe2  White will follow up with O-O-O and a great game. Here is a sample line.  8...a6  9.Bc4  Nb6  10.Rd1  Qe7  11.Be5 !  White is in no rush to capture the pawn, but instead aims for Nh3 and Ng5 in some cases. This is a great position for White.  7.dxe6  fxe6   7...Bxb5 ?  This loses a pawn because White has an intermezzo.  8.exf7+  Ke7  Black can't recapture the pawn because his Queen would be hanging.  9.Qxd8+  Kxd8  10.Nxb5  -+  White has an extra pawn and, with O-O-O to follow, a winning initiative.  8.Qe2  White is doing well and will more likely than not win a pawn back at some point.  8...Nc6  9.Bxc6  Exchanging the Knight before Black is able to play ...Nd4.  9...Bxc6  10.Nh3  With Ng5 on its way. White will soon regain the pawn.   5...g6  This allows the following move.  6.Nb5  This is annoying for Black as we saw in the introductory game. But again, according to computer analysis Black is doing ok.  6...Na6  7.d6 !  This pawn forces an opening in the position.  7...Qa5+ !?  This is an interesting new idea.   7...Bg4  8.f3  This pawn sacrifice gives White plenty of play.  exf3  9.Nxf3  Bg7  10.Bc4  Natural quick development.  10...O-O  11.O-O  White is very active for his pawn. He can concentrate his forces down the e- and d-files.   7...exd6  This was seen earlier.  8.Nxd6+  Bxd6  9.Qxd6 !  This is actually the best way to play. White has plenty of compensation for the pawn.  9...Qxd6  The dangerous Queen should be removed !  10.Bxd6  White has an edge with Black's King stuck in the centre. One idea is the simple Bxa6 and Bxc5, but also natural moves like O-O-O and Bb5+ will prove to be very difficult for Black.  8.c3  Be6 !?  Black wants ...Rd8 in order to target the d6-pawn !  9.Nh3 !  White must act quickly.  9...Rd8  10.b4 !?  Leading to more chaos !  10...cxb4  11.cxb4  Nxb4  11... Qxb4+ loses to 12 Bd2.  12.Nc7+  The point. White will get castled !  12...Kd7  13.Bb5+  Kc8  14.O-O  With an exciting position and mutual chances for both sides. On the positive it is White who is attacking ! White can now coordinate his forces against Black's King with Rc1, a4 and Qd4 etc. }
6. f3
{ In my opinion this is the best move against 5... a6. I spent ages  (days !)  trying to make GM Luc Winants idea of 6. Qe2 to work, but without joy.   6.Qe2  is the most popular move at top level, but I believe it to be inferior to 6 f3. For those chess scholars out there, the line that I could not find an answer to was the following.  6...g6 !  and now two lines which both look worse for White.  7.Nxe4  Nxe4  8.Qxe4  Bg7  9.O-O-O  O-O  10.Qe3  (given a '!' in many sources)  10...Nd7 !  a new move which is very strong  !  11.Bh6  Bxh6 !  12.Qxh6  Nf6  and Black is better. One of the key lines being  13.h4  Qa5  14.a3 !?  b5 !  15.h5  b4  16.hxg6  Bg4 !!  which the computer confirms as being good for Black. This is all unplayed as yet, and maybe a good weapon for any players playing this line as Black !  After   6.Qe2  g6  7.O-O-O  ,  White's position also didn't impress me after  7...Bg7  8.d6 !?  e6 !  which again is given as a nice advantage to Black by the computer.  6 f3 !? looks logical to me as Black has wasted some time playing 5... a6. So lets concentrate on bringing our pieces into the game as quickly as possible. }
6... exf3 7. Nxf3
{ A rare position, but one that I believe offers White plenty of good attacking chances. }
7... g6 { The most logical way to develop. } 8. Qd2 Bg7 9. O-O-O O-O
{ So how to continue now ? The computer does give a line with 10 Be2 as being best, so we will stick with that for now. A decent waiting move that develops the last piece. However, this is a position that requires some investigation as other tempting moves include Bh6, h4 and even d6. }
10. Be2 b5 { This is a hard move to resist ! } 11. Ne5
{ An important idea. White decides to play in the center, making it hard for Black to play ...Nbd7 due to Nc6. }
11... b4
{ The most aggressive, where now the computer indicates the position is equal after the following moves. }
12. Na4 Bd7
{ A hard move to find ! Only computer preparation would find such an idea. }
13. Nxc5
{ We now enter a tactical line, with some very violent moves being played from both sides ! }
13... Qa5 { Starting an attack against a2. } 14. Ncxd7 Nbxd7
{ 14...Qxa2  This is met as follows:  15.Nxf6+  exf6  16.Qxb4  And now Black cannot regain his piece.  16...fxe5  17.Bc4 !  Qa1+  18.Kd2  Black's Queen is trapped. }
15. Nc6 { This leads to a complete mess. } 15... Qxa2 16. Qxb4
{ White is material up but Black does have some initative. This is given as 0.00 and remains a very interesting position. If this is too much for you then do go and have a look at the safer 4 Bb5+. I will show you the two critcial lines now. }
16... Ne4
{ This looks best. Black forces a draw this way.   16...Nxd5  This leads to a sequence of tactical moves.  17.Rxd5  Qa1+  18.Kd2  Qxh1  19.Rxd7  Qxg2  20.Qb7  Qf2  21.Nxe7+  Kh8  22.Qf3  With a very unclear position. }
17. Qxe4
{ And White should take the Knight, other options just look too scary. } 17...
Qxb2+ 18. Kd2 Qc3+ 19. Kc1
{ Here Black has numerous ways to force a draw. So you may be wondering, why is Simon suggesting this line ? I do feel like I need to explain in more detail.   1  The Albin Counter gambit is slightly dodgy, even with an extra tempo when playing and analyzing with a computer.  2  This line seems to be one of the best 'according to the computer', with fighting chess and an exciting draw.  3  Black will very unlikely find the moves that I have shown here, unless he is very well prepared.  4  When playing Gambit lines like the Albin you have to enter into them with hope and a brave heart. Yes, if Black plays properly he may get a fine position, but he has to dodge a lot of bullets. And if you do not like this, then there is always the option of playing 4 Bb5+. }

This is a strategy that players of the black pieces will be afraid of meeting.For this course I am going to suggest two set ups for White. I should note that my research has indicated that even with an extra tempo, The Albin Counter Gambit is not such a good opening when analyzing against a computer ! On the plus side you will always be attacking... }

The other option is to enter into a famous gambit line that Black plays  (The Albin Countergambit)  but a tempo up. This is a very fun way to play and would be my personal preference. }

So, the main line I am giving ends in a draw by perpetual check after following some long computer lines. Practically though the Albin does give White a fun and exciting game with great practical chances. If you want something more stable then 4 Bb5+ is the way to play. }
5. Bf4
{ The Bishop on f4 finds a good diagonal where we can meet ....e6 with d6 or ...g6 with Qd2 and Bh6. And there cannot be anything wrong with developing a piece ! This position is often more commonly arrived at via the move order 1 d4 d5 2 Bf4 c5 3 e4 dxe4 4 d5 Nf6 5 Nc3 which some of you could find useful if you also play the straight London System, as this is a dangerous plan against 2... c5 there as well. }

Yes, if Black plays properly he may get a fine position, but he has to dodge a lot of bullets. And if you do not like this, then there is always the option of playing 4 Bb5+. }

White takes the bishop pair and follows up with e4 with a great position.  4...f6  This leaves White with the following blow:  5.Nxd5 !  Qxd5  6.Nf4  It turns out Black's Queen has no good squares on the 5th rank. White will regain the piece and follow up with e4 with a fantastic position. }

This is inferior as it gives White the f3-square for his Knight.  5.fxe4  Bg6  6.Nf3  White already has a very nice position with a big centre, two developed Knights and the open f-file. White should just continue developing in normal style.  6...Nf6  7.Bd3  Be7  8.O-O  O-O  9.e5 !?  In order to free the e4-square for White's Knight.

1. d4 f5 { Of course this is a good move. ;- } 2. Nc3
{ It makes sense to stick to our main move. I could have suggested a number of options here, but 2. Nc3 fits our system the best. }
2... Nf6
{ 2...e6 ?!  This position can also be reached via 1... e6 2. Nc3 f5 ?! This has been known to be a mistake by Black for a long time. Black should fight against White's advance e4 and not encourage it. White is simply better after the following moves.  3.e4 !  White is already better ! Black should really avoid this position. White has easy development and chances to attack Black's King on the light squares.  3...fxe4  Other options are even worse for Black.  4.Nxe4  Be7  4... Nf6 5 Bd3 is similar.  5.Nf3  White's pieces flow into the game.  5...Nf6  Black must develop.  6.Bd3  White has a number of ideas. I would be aiming to punish Black with such simple moves as Qe2, Bd2, O-O-O, h4 and put one of the Knights on g5 ! White always has ideas of starting an attack against h7. Kasparov vs. Fernandez, 1991, continued as follows:  6...d6  7.Qe2  O-O  8.h4 !  White is ready to support a Knight landing on g5. This is already horrible for Black.  8...Qe8  9.Nfg5 !  Targeting h7.  9...Nxe4  10.Qxe4  Rf5  11.g4  and Black could have resigned.   2...d5  This move cuts out some options for Black.  3.Bf4  Black has committed his pawn to d5. I would rather have met Bf4 with ideas of ...d6 and ...e5. This is no longer possible. Bg5 may well transpose into lines we look at after 2... Nf6.  3...e6   3...Nf6  This stops g4.  4.e3  e6  5.Nf3  Continuing to develop and aiming to control e5.  5...Bd6  6.Be2  O-O  ...Bxf4 just helps Black as he increases his grip over e5.  7.Nb5 !  This offers chances for an advantage. White wants to capture the Bishop on d6 and open the position with c4.  4.g4 !?  A fun and exciting move ! Of course you could play in a more solid way, but let's looks at this sharp idea. If you do not like this, then I suggest developing and then playing to control the e5 square. This kind of way of playing is looked at in the line 3... Nf6, so go there to look deeper.  4...fxg4  This is key, but other moves are playable as well.   4...Nf6  This is a normal developing move  5.gxf5  exf5  6.e3  I have played this type of position with both Black and White. It is fun to play. Maybe White has no advantage but he does have an exciting game.  6...Bd6  7.Qf3 !  An important move. White wants to castle Queenside and attack Black's centre.  7...Be6  8.O-O-O  White will continue with developing and then Rg1 attacking on the open line.  5.e3 }
3. Bg5
{ In this case I believe the Bishop is better placed on g5. This is because one of White's main ideas is to capture on f6 and play e4. You can experiment with Bf4 as in the normal Jobava London System, but Bg5 is more testing for Black. }
3... d5
{ Otherwise White will often manage to play e4 with an advantage.   3...e6 ?  4.e4 !  This leads back into a line that we have already seen.   3...d6  This is too meek. White will capture on f6 in many variations and when that happens Black would prefer to have a pawn on d5. On d5 the pawn protects more central squares.  4.Bxf6  A simple solution. 4 f3 was interesting as well, aiming for 5 e4 !  4...exf6  5.e3  White is aiming to place pressure on f5 with Bd3 and Qf3. After this, h3 and g4 becomes a very dangerous plan.  5...c6  This occurred in Yermolinsky vs J.Williams, 1996. White was very happy after the following moves:  6.Bd3  Na6   6...g6  This may be best, but now White should attack with h3 and g4.  7.h3 !  Bg7  8.g4 !  Black has big problems on the Kingside. White is much better.  7.Qf3 !  g6  8.Bxa6  bxa6  9.Qxc6+  Bd7  10.Qxa6  With a winning game. Two pawns is two pawns !   3...g6  this is what a dedicated Leningrad player or fool would play ! There are a couple of options here, but one is clearly best.  4.h4 !  This is a very dangerous move for Black to deal with, as the natural move allows White the initiative.  4...Bg7  5.h5 !  With a big attack.  5...Nxh5 ?  This is asking for it !  6.e4 !  Rxh5 is coming !  6...h6  I would say that everything else is hopeless.   6...Nf6  7.exf5  gxf5  8.Bxf6  Bxf6  9.Qh5+  Kf8  10.Qxf5  When Black's King is just too weak. White can play normal moves and gain a great position.   6...O-O  This is just suicidal !  7.Bc4+  Kh8  8.e5  Stopping ... Nf6. There were other ways as well but I already think it is too late for Black here.  8...Nc6  9.Be2  This is simple and good. White will capture on h5 and probably checkmate Black on the h-file. }
4. e3
{ I expect things are roughly equal, but Black has to be more accurate in the following variations. I will give one new idea here for White - an idea that didn't occur to me in my Dutch course  (!)  . I might have to go back and fix that course now ! }
4... e6 5. Nf3 a6
{ This looks best, similar to some of the more standard lines of the Jobava London system. In this case Black stops ideas of Bb5+ and Bxf6 followed up with Nb5 and c4.   5...c5  This is logical but allows two decent White ideas, both to do with the b5 square. For example,  6.Bxf6 !?  6 Bb5+ can also be a bit annoying for Black.  6...Qxf6  7.Nb5 !?  White's main idea, putting some pressure on Black.  7...Qd8  8.c4  Black should be equal here, but White has a little bit more pressure.  8...cxd4   8...dxc4  9.Bxc4  a6  10.Nc3  b5  11.Be2  With ideas of Ne5 and Bf3. The position is equal, yet more dangerous for Black.  9.Qa4 !  Things are becoming very dangerous for Black. White will castle Queenside and open up the centre. This is all new, but in this case White is better. }
6. g4
{ A novelty !!! I am giving this as a fresh idea that keeps the position unique. Of course, White can play in a quieter fashion but this is quite fun. }
6... fxg4
{ 6...Bb4  This is one way to decline the gambit. White should continue as follows.  7.gxf5  exf5  8.Qd3  With O-O-O, Rg1 and Ne5 to follow. }
7. Ne5 Be7
{ Black should probably break the pin.   7...c5  This aims for immediate counterplay in the centre, but White has a simple response.  8.Nxg4  Now Black has to be careful. There is a nasty idea of capturing on f6 and then playing Qh5+.  8...Be7  9.dxc5  White has chances of gaining an advantage on the dark squares. }
8. h3
{ Making it a full gambit ! White wants to obtain pressure along the h-file now. }
8... g3
{ A standard counter-sacrifice.   8...gxh3 ?  This is a losing mistake !  9.Rxh3  And with Bd3 to follow, White simply has too many threats.   8...Nbd7  This logically aims to exchange off some of White's attacking pieces.  9.hxg4  Nxe5  10.dxe5  Nd7  11.Bxe7  Qxe7  12.f4  White is better due to the pressure along the h-file. }
9. f4
{ With a fun and interesting position in which White is no worse. White will play Qf3 and aim to win the pawn back with a good game. }
