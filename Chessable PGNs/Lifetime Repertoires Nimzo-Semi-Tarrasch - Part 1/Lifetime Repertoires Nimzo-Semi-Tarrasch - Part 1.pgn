{ @@HeaderStart@@ Introduction@@HeaderEnd@@  A very warm welcome to all the readers of my first-ever course on chessable. In fact, it is my first chess course ever :  Naturally, I did this with a lot of passion and wanted to be flawless. First of all, a big thank you to the Chessable team, who were kind enough to extend the deadline multiple times, understanding that I was not buying time to sleep over the lines but actually was going very deep into it.   At some point, we realized that making two parts of this course would make justice to the notes. The first part would cover Nimzo Indian and most of the other major sidelines like Trompowsky, Veresov, London System, etc. In the second part of the course, QGD Semi Tarrasch, Catalan, and some more sidelines like Colle System will be covered. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Why his course and some introduction about the author:@@HeaderEnd@@  The first question I had was why should I make an opening course and why would people be interested in buying it? A brief introduction of mine before I go deep into this: I am Surya Ganguly, a Grandmaster from India. My rating hovers somewhere between 2640-2675. Some of my recent major achievements could be pointed out as Winning the Hunan International Open in 2019 ahead of many 2700+ players; getting an Individual Gold medal in World Team 2019. You can always find more about me on Wikipedia or Google, so let us skip giving my entire biodata here. What could be relevant information about myself for the course is that I have been working with Viswanathan Anand since 2007.   I was his second for all the world championship matches that he won  (against Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand)  . I was also part of the Magnus match training team, but I was not present during the match. Having worked for these world championship matches as close as possible, I know how to prepare openings at the highest level and, most importantly, how to find novelties and how to create your own theory. So I thought if I write a course on opening it should draw some attention. Why did I do this? Just like many other players, during the lockdown, I also started various ventures.   First, I started with my own channel on YouTube and then opened an online training platform called Pro Chess Training. Finally, I stumbled into chessable and fell in love with their high-quality materials. It was at this point that I felt it would be an excellent idea to build a lifetime repertoire. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@World Championship Match preparation@@HeaderEnd@@I have been a Nimzo player for a long time, and during these World Championship matches, we had overwhelming work on these lines. In a match, at best, about 12 novelties get played, and hundreds or thousands of novelties remain buried and get used only much later. In this course, you will see many such World Championship match preparation novelties. You will find some novelties that had to wait 9 years to get played. Working with Anand and many top players in Anand's team for decades, I realized that it is of utmost importance to understand the lines and find your own way rather than following theory or memorizing many computer lines without understanding a thing about it.   In this course, you will see that we break the traditional path in most cases. We challenge the existing theory, and we find our own way. Not just finding some computer suggested new moves, but finding an entirely new system that has never been tried before. In today's world, everyone has access to good engines, and everyone works hard. To say that I found a novelty in a position which is Stockfish NNUE or LC0 suggestion that can be found in cloud and assuming that others would not know about it is foolishness.   The credit comes only when one can find something that is not the computer's top choice. That is how most of the World Championship matches novelties were found. Here you are going to see a lot of such novelties. It is also backed up with the best of the engines, engine games, and correspondence games. Once again, having constantly helped top players with the opening, I am perfectly aware of which engine to use and what kind of engines to be used. So no worries on that part. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Should we memorize all the lines given in the notes?@@HeaderEnd@@For me, memorization without understanding is a sin. You are bound to forget everything that you don't understand. First and foremost, one must understand the logic behind the moves before trying to gobble it up and vomit it on the board. I have explained every move methodically to make sure you get the reasoning behind every move. Let us not fool ourselves.   I am not trying to sell you here something by saying, 'if you buy this course, you are all set, and you won't face any novelties over the board.' If you want such a course and buy it, I can assure you got conned there. Novelties we have to face. No matter how deep we go. Despite having lifetime work and a huge army of seconds, and access to the greatest engines, Anand had to face so many novelties over the board. What is of utmost importance is that if we know the ideas, strategy, and reasoning behind the moves, then even if we face a novelty, it won't matter much, and we can handle it over the board.   Then what am I giving in guarantee if you might have to face novelties over the board? The guarantee is that there is no chance any of these lines will be refuted entirely. Novelties might come as some new move, but there won't be a flaw that big where the evaluation will change drastically.   @@HeaderStart@@Memory jog technique:@@HeaderEnd@@I will also provide you with more than 100 puzzles from this course, mixed with combination/strategy/positional moves, etc. This will help you enhance your chess skills and help you remember the critical positions. Often I keep photos on mobile or take a print screen of such critical positions from the openings and see it from time to time. Sometimes even in flights.    During matches, we used to do this to Anand, constantly bombard him with challenging positions from his repertoire. This is an excellent technique to stay sharp and at the same time get some revision done on the opening. }

[Black "Spielmann Variation: 4.Qb3"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qb3
{ At first glance, this looks like one of the most natural moves. White makes sure the pawn structure won't be broken after ...Bxc3+. He develops the queen and attacks the b4-bishop - it all sounds very logical. One of the earliest games I can find is played in the 19th century by first world champion William Steinitz in 1882. The line is named after Rudolf Spielmann, who played it thrice at Carlsbad, 1929, and it became popular soon when the Bugoljubow vs. Alekhine World Championship match saw this line many times.   However, soon practice showed that White's queen does not belong on d3 or b3, as in both cases she can be attacked in various ways. The strongest placement of White's queen is, after all, on c2, which over the years became one of the main lines, unlike 4. Qb3 and 4. Qd3. }
4... c5 { This protects the bishop and also keeps an eye on the d4-pawn. } 5.
dxc5
{ A logical follow-up after 4.Qb3. White typically answers c5 with dxc5 just the way he would have done in 4.Qc2 lines, hoping that Black will take it back with the bishop, which would mean we have wasted a tempo with Bb4-xc5. }
5... Nc6

7. Bd2
{ Practically forced. A few games went with  7.e3  ,  and after  7...Bxc3+  8.bxc3  Nxc5  Black got an excellent position due to White's horrible structure. Soon after Black played ...O-O-b6-Bb7 and took control in every single game. 7.Bd2 is the only way for White not to get into serious trouble. }

{ White prevents ...Nd4 and makes a path to develop the f1-bishop. } 9... Bxc5
10. Nde4
{ White hopes to get his knight to d6. This is a good idea, but it's not happening without a concession. }
10... Be7 11. O-O-O
{ 11.Rd1  Qc7  prevents Nd6 and threatens ...f5 next. With the king on e1, White is unable to play  12.Nb5  due to  12...Qa5+  when White's knight must go back to where it came from. }
11... a6
{ White fulfills his wish of planting the knight on d6, but it comes at a very high price. The deal was made by compromising White's king's position. On c1, the king does not feel comfortable, and Black does not hide his intentions. He is planning slowly but surely to play ...b5 and open up the queenside. }
12. Nd6
{ 12.c5  does not stop  12...b5  since after  13.cxb6  Rb8  Black picks up the pawn and gets strong play over the b-file. If we compare the safety of the kings Black's advantage becomes apparent. }
12... b5
{ Nothing can stop Black from opening up the queenside. He is very willing to give a pawn for this. }
13. cxb5 axb5 14. Bxb5
{ 14.Ncxb5  Ba6  would have been equally disastrous. Soon the f8-rook will come to b8 when White has to resign. His queen and king both are in the wrong place at the wrong time. }
14... Qc7
{ The final subtle move. Black removes the d6 knight and makes a path for his f8 rook to join the battle. Once again, White's king and queen are in the wrong place. With the king on g1, White would have a great position, but that is far from reality. Right now, the White king is getting into a devastating attack through the half open files on the queenside, which Black soon will occupy. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 O-O 5. Bg5
{ This is the best version of the Leningrad System that White can get. Black is committed to ...O-O, which reduces his options significantly. White starts with the Kasparov variation by playing 4.Nf3 and only once Black is committed to castling short does he switch to the Bg5 system. This line has been trendy ever since Kasparov used this against Karpov in the 1985 World Championship match.   In 2020 it got back into fashion when Magnus and Dubov started using this in a number of games. In modern theory, the lines have exploded with insurmountable computer lines leading to huge complications. I will offer something very fresh, which avoids the long theory. Black remains very solid and he does not have to remember oceans of lines with million forced moves to make a draw.   I am confident that the line I am offering here will soon become the mainline for Black. }
5... c5 6. e3
{ Magnus has tried this seemingly harmless-looking move as many as four times! This move first became popular when in the Moscow 1985 World Championship match Kasparov used this against Karpov in game 11 As per Kasparov's analyses in his My Great Predecessors books, 6.e3 is a dubious move, and he thought that the move:   6.Rc1  is the strongest continuation, which is also our mainline. }
6... cxd4 7. exd4
{ The logical follow-up on 7.e3. If White wanted to take on d4 with any other piece, there was no rush to play e3. }
7... d5 8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order. 8.Bd3 is the mainline, and after   8...dxc4  9.Bxc4  b6  10.O-O  Bb7  we transpose to the Karpov system, which is covered in the chapter Nimzo 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3. }
8... h6 9. Bh4 Nc6
{ The famous Kasparov vs. Karpov game from the 1985 match reached the same position.   Karpov immediately took  9...dxc4  , which was criticized by Kasparov heavily in his comments. According to him, Karpov typically was looking for simplifying the position and avoided direct complicated play when it demanded so. It is true that  9...dxc4  , in a way, gives White a free tempo since Bxc4 comes in one single move without wasting time on Be2/Bd3. It was far more important to play 9...Nc6 here. }
10. a3
{ Playing Bd3/Be2 would transpose to the main Karpov-Nimzo line after dxc4. This line is covered in the e3 Nimzo Karpov chapter extensively. }
10... Be7 11. c5
{ That was White's plan. This time, cunningly, he got out of any ...e5 tactics and grabbed more space on the queenside while keeping control over the e5-square. This was played by Magnus and Wojtaszek once. }
11... Ne4
{ Black is not giving White any time to consolidate. White has to take on e7, which helps Black to prepare the thematic break ...e5. }
12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. Bb5
{ Not giving up so easily. White is desperate to stop Black from playing ...e5. }
13... Nxc3 14. Rxc3 e5
{ Taking advantage of the pin.   15.Bxc6  now runs into  15...exd4+  . } 15.
O-O Bg4
{ A nice move. By pinning the f3-knight Black gains more control over the center. }
16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. dxe5 Bxf3 18. Rxf3 Qxe5
{ Black has regained the pawn and has an equal position. Black has some weaknesses on the queenside but his passed central pawn compensates for that. Black had no problems in the game Carlsen,M   -Nakamura,H Leuven 2016. }

[Black "Kmoch Variation with 4.f3"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is 5.a3. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory. Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.   By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5. White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Ne2
{ White tries to complete his development. He is still hoping to transpose into the old line with  7...O-O  8.Nf4  . However, Black has an entirely different plan in mind. }
7... bxc4
{ Capturing the c4 pawn and building up more pressure on d5. White must try to recapture the c4-pawn at the earliest before Black brings more pressure to bear on White's centre. }
8. Nf4
{ The most sensible move. In one go, White attacks the c4-pawn and brings more support to the d5-pawn. White could include  8.a3  Ba5  if he wanted to, but I don't see a single variation in which this inclusion benefits White. Only Black will have the advantage of having the bishop on a5, which was in a way blocking the b8-rook in many main lines. }
8... e5
{ Forcing White to go back to e2. White is ready to take that compromise since now he has got more space in the center. All that remains for him is to retake the c4-pawn with impunity. }
9. Ne2
{ The only move, but this was part of White's plan when he played 9. Nf4. Now that Black has clearly shown that he has no intention of breaking open the center, White claims that he can play slowly with Ng3 and then take the c4-pawn and build up a kingside attack with O-O and f4. }
9... Nbd7
{ We should not allow White to recapture the c4-pawn so easily. It is of the utmost importance to protect the pawn for now. Black is ready to play ...Nb6 and keep the extra pawn on c4. It is now White who has to prove that he has enough compensation. }
10. Ng3
{ This is the main move in this position. White is aiming for quick development and trying to immediately crush Black with the f4 break. Once again, we are happy if White wants to include the moves a3 and ...Ba5. It would just help us to get more play on the b-file. }
10... Nb6
{ As per the plan, we are not giving up the c4-pawn without a fight. It is not easy for White to further attack this pawn. Therefore he switches to a completely different plan. He will develop quickly with Be2 and O-O, play f4 as early as possible, and claim that he has a good kingside initiative. Our knight b6 is quite secure. We can meet the pawn advance a4 by playing ...a5 ourselves.   Now after  11.Be2  Black's next move is crucial. If you have not seen the move by now, I suggest pausing in this position and try to find a plan for Black. The entire line with 7.Nge2 depends on this particular plan. It is with the following idea Black stops White's entire initiative on the kingside. }
11. Be2
{ White clearly shows his hand. O-O and f4 are coming quickly. If Black castles  11...O-O  , then White will play  12.O-O  and immediately go for f4. Once the pawns are exchanged in the center, Bg5 becomes an annoying threat. The knight on f6 will be more of a burden that can come under pressure after White plays Bg5. }
11... Ng8
{ What on earth is Black thinking? White is trying to smash Black by playing a quick O-O and f4, and here Black is bringing back his pieces as if he is preparing for the next game. However, the reality is far from this seemingly obvious explanation. The weird-looking 11... Ng8 has a deep positional strategic idea. Let us try to understand it step by step.White has only one sensible break in the center/kingside, and that is f4. Once f4 happens, Black will take ...exf4, and then White's bishop will come to f4, putting pressure on the d6-pawn and threatening to pin the f6-knight with Bg5 at some point. Now with ...Ng8 Black solves many issues permanently. He realized that the knight on f6 was his main problem! This knight should be ready to come to e5 once the exchange on f4 happens.Then why didn't Black play 11...Nfd7? Well, it is important not to allow White to play Nf5. With the knight on g8, Black keeps the diagonal of the c8-bishop open, which controls the f5-square. Also, ideally, Black's knight would be great on g6 from where not only is it ready to jump to e5, but more importantly, it attacks the f4-bishop.If White doesn't play 12. f4 now, then in any case Black will get his knight to e7, and he is ready to meet f4 for the rest of the game, which is, by the way, White's only active plan in the center/on the kingside. Meanwhile, Black is a pawn up, and now the ball is in White's court. }
12. Qc2
{ In the correspondence games which were mentioned before, White played this move. It doesn't make the slightest difference in our plan, and we shall continue with the same strategy we had in mind while playing 11...Ng8. }
12... Ne7 13. O-O O-O
{ We could also get this position from a different move order starting with 12. O-O. }
14. a4 Ba5
{ A cool way to stop a5. This way Black doesn't weaken the b5 square and makes sure that on anytime Nb5 can be answered with ...a6. }
15. Nb5 Ng6
{ This position was reached twice in correspondence games. Both games ended in a draw, and Black did not have the slightest problem. White now gets back the c4-pawn, but in return, Black has established total control over f4 and soon will play ...Nf4 or ...Nh4 himself to gain more space on the kingside. His bishop on a5 stops any play on the queenside for White. White doesn't have a clear plan on either side of the board. Black has a very comfortable position and cannot complain about the outcome of the opening. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3
{ This line is officially known as the Sämisch variation named after Friedrich Sämisch. Back in 1928, he played it against Richard Reti in Dortmund. I think this speaks a lot about the ancient history of this line as well as the Dortmund tournament. :- @@EndBracket@@ However, this line was not really that popular at the top level, although many strong players have occasionally used it from time to time. It was more about getting away from the main theory and having some surprising value. It came back to fashion very recently when Magnus started employing this line regularly. He played as many as 8 games with 4. a3 during the period of 2019-2020, although it was mostly in rapid and blitz. But when the World Champion uses a line, even in rapid and blitz, it becomes trendy.The idea of 4. a3 is pretty straightforward. White says I don't care about your pawn structure strategy. I want the bishop pair. Please give it to me right away. }

{ Obviously, we didn't play the bishop to b4 only to chicken out once White attacks it. Our argument is that position will remain closed in nature, and our knights are ideal from this perspective. White will have a weak doubled pawn on the c-file for a long time, and in particular, the c4-pawn could come under serious attack. }
5. bxc3 c5
{ The most common move in the position. Black goes for a long-term strategic plan. In the long run, he wants to attack the c4-pawn. There will be many ways to do so, and some of the typical ones are ...Nc6-Na5, ...Ba6, ...Rc8, etc. We definitely want the position to be closed, so we encourage White to play d5 at any point in time. On the other hand, White has the bishop pair and he would like to keep the game open. }
6. f3
{ An important move. White plans to go for a direct e4 without wasting a move on e3. Usually, this position arises from a 4.f3 Nimzo move order. }
6... Nc6
{ If Black plays  6...d5  then after  7.cxd5  we would directly transpose to the mainline of the 4. f3 Nimzo, where Black plays an early ...d5. First of all, our repertoire against the f3 Nimzo is not to play 4... d5. Secondly and more importantly, via this move order 6... Nc6 is a much stronger move, getting ready for White's e4 ideas by increasing the pressure on the d4-pawn. }
7. e4
{ As per White's plan. The inclusion of the moves  7.d5  Na5  would only help Black since it keeps the position closed. He could respond to  8.e4  with  8...d6  followed by the standard plan of going for the c4-pawn with ...b6 and ...Ba6. }
7... d6
{ It is time for White to decide how he is going to develop his g1-knight. There are three possible ways: to go Nh3, to play Ne2 with the bishop still on f1, and finally to play Bd3 and only then play Ne2. To execute the final plan, White must first take care of his d4-pawn so that he can play Bd3. Thus  8.Nh3  ,  8.Ne2  , and  8.Be3  are the moves we will examine next. }
8. Be3 { The standard move. White wants to follow up with Bd3 and Ne2. } 8...
b6
{ We follow the same typical plan of Ba6-Na5, putting pressure on the c4-pawn. }
9. Bd3 Na5
{ In this particular position there is nothing wrong with  9...O-O  either, but I like 9...Na5 more for a couple of reasons.   1.@@EndBracket@@  It is similar to what we are planning to do in the 6. e3 b6 7.Bd3 Bb7 8.f3 lines #10 to #16, making it easier to understand.   2.@@EndBracket@@  Avoiding the traditional theory makes it more difficult for White to prepare and follow some known path.   3.@@EndBracket@@  I personally think this is a stronger move, keeping maximum flexibility. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
10. Nh3
{ 10.Ne2  is the most logical response when we can directly transpose to #14 till #16 with  10...Ba6  11.O-O  Qe7  . Apart from transposing Black can also choose to play  10...Qc7  , taking advantage of the move order and putting the queen in a better place. }
10... e5 { The typical response to Nh3 when we have our bishop on c8. } 11. Nf2
Ba6 12. O-O Nd7
{ Getting away from the Bg5 pin, which would have been possible after  12...O-O  13.Bg5  . Now Black is threatening to take the c4-pawn. White's main play in this system is to create an attack on the kingside by often ignoring the queenside and giving the pawn on c4. Often White pins the f6 knight once Black castles and tries to create threats on the kingside.   This can get particularly dangerous with White's knight being on f2 when ti can jump to g4. However, it is still possible to play h6-g5 once White plays Bg5, but there is absolutely no need to get there. It is also to be noted with White's knight on e2 and bishop on f1, we could afford to allow Bg5 pin as White then cannot play Ng3 due to h6-g5 when the bishop on h4 gets trapped. }
13. Qa4
{ An unfortunate placement of the queen, but this is forced.  13.Qe2  is met nicely by  13...Nb3  going for the d4-pawn. }
13... cxd4 14. cxd4 O-O
{ By including ...cxd4 Black made sure that the c5-square is available for his d7-knight. ...Rc8 will come next, and either Black will take on d4 and play ...Nc5 or White will play d5, and then Black would go ...Nc5 - either way, the knight is coming to c5, and Black gets a lovely position. White's pawns in the center have become more of a burden than a strength. }

[Black "Classical Variation: 4.Qc2 O-O 5.a3 #1"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical variation or the Capablanca variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move  8...d4  is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rc1
{ One of the primary reasons for this line being not so popular earlier. Only recently has Black found an impressive way to deal with this move, which completely revives this entire system. }
10... h6
{ First things first. White has to take the call now about what to do with his bishop. His choices are limited to Bf4/Bh4 and Qxc7. Taking on f6 doesn't make any sense as Black would get the active bishop for free, and White still can't take on c7 due to the reply ...Rc8.   11.Bxf6  Qxf6  12.Qxc7?  Rc8  and Black wins. }
11. Bh4 c5
{ A lot of correspondence games have continued:   11...Nbd7  12.Qxc7  Rc8  13.Qxd8  Rxc1+  14.Kd2  Rxd8+  15.Kxc1  g5  16.Bg3  Ne4  , which gives Black sufficient compensation for the pawn. That is a perfectly fine alternative, but I like 11...c5 because it keeps more winning chances and gives White more options to go wrong. It is the most direct approach and has been tried only once so far by GM Nikita Vitiugov, who played it as Black against Yu Yangi in the 2019 World Cup.The idea of 11... c5 is crystal clear: White tried to prevent ...c5 with all his force, and Black played it anyway, forcing White to accept the sacrifice - otherwise the move 10.Rc1 makes no sense whatsoever. }
12. dxc5
{ Nothing else can justify White's 10. Rc1 move. Black would reply ...Nbd7 and ...Rc8 in any case. }
12... Nbd7
{ Once again forcing White to play c6.   13.cxb6  runs into  13...Rc8  when White will be obliged to play  14.Qf4  and then Black would take on b6 with the queen, leaving White's kingside completely stupefied. The computers are giving -6 in favor of Black as White cannot save the upcoming attack on his king. ...Ne4/...Qb2/ ...Nd5 various threats are on the way.   Also, White cannot save the c5-pawn by playing  13.b4  due to  13...bxc5  14.bxc5  Nxc5  15.Qxc5  Rc8  16.Qe3  Qa5+  17.Kd1  Rfd8  leading to mate in 12 as per the machines, which is not difficult to see. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
13. c6 Rc8
{ Finally White gets a choice. His c6-pawn is attacked, and he can either go for  14.c7  and try to hold the pawn on the c7-square, or White can attempt to play   14.Qa4  and try to keep the pawn on c6.  14.Nd4  won't help as that allows  14...Ne5  . }
14. Qa4 Qc7
{ A powerful novelty based on a queen sacrifice. The only game that reached this position continued with  14...Nb8  ,  which is also strong enough, but I think the move 14... Qc7 is more imaginative and interesting. Currently, we have the simple threat of taking on c6 with the bishop. }
15. Qxa7 Ne4
{ Preparing to bring either knight to c5. Then White cannot take cxb7 due to ...Nd3+ followed by ...Qxc1. On the previous move this was not an option as White would have taken on c5 with the rook first and then taken on b7. This line is analyzed in great detail in the main course. }

This is very typical of Anand's preparation, finding a new direction as early as possible and making it sharp and concrete. Needless to say, this line has since become trendy at the highest level. It is easy to understand and it forces White to get into some concrete variations. White can forget about getting a slight and long-term edge based on the bishop pair. }
8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play   8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }

It was a novelty back then when only  9.Qc2   and  9.Qg3  were the popular moves. However, there was a major block in the line which was causing us a lot of trouble to make this line work from White's perspective. No one ever played this, and as a result 9.Qf3 and the counter- novelty against it remained buried for 9 years. :- @@EndBracket@@    In the 2019 Asian Championship, I took an early lead by defeating Sethuraman and Maghsoodloo and drawing with Wei Yi.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. Nf3
{ This move is definitely not as popular as  5.a3  and  5.e4  , which are the main ideas after White plays 4. Qc2. However, 5. Nf3  has been seen at the top level many times. White, for now, delays his decision to play a3 or e4 and instead first wants to know which setup Black is going to pick. }
5... d5
{ The most popular move in this position is  5...c5  , but the move we are playing fits in perfectly with our repertoire. A lot of players do not play 5... d5 mainly because in the following line:   @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Qc2  O-O  5.a3  Bxc3  6.Qxc3  , they do not go for  6...d5  and instead play the old classical mainline  6...b6  .  In our case, since we are happy to play 6... d5 in the Classical, it makes perfect sense to play the same after 5. Nf3 as now 6.a3 will transpose to the Classical chapter. This way, we also manage to bypass some heavy theoretical lines that can arise after  5...c5  . Above all, logically speaking, the move 5... d5 just looks correct. White has delayed playing e4, so we grab the center immediately, not giving White another chance. }
6. Bg5
{ As we can see after both:  6.a3  and  6.e3  , this entire line starting with 5... d5 suits our repertoire because regularly it will transpose to different lines that we will be seeing or have already seen. The only two other moves that we need to address are 6.Bg5 and  6.cxd5  , which are covered in this chapter. The point of the move 6. Bg5 move is obvious. It pins the f6-knight and develops the bishop outside the pawn chain, which means White is ready to play e3 next. }
6... c5
{ An important move order subtlety. We first play  6...c5  , and only if White takes  7.dxc5  do we go  7...h6  .   Not the other way round. If we start with  6...h6  , then after  7.Bxf6  Qxf6  8.a3  Bxc3  9.Qxc3  , we will have a tough time getting ...c5 in as after  9...c5  10.cxd5  White keeps a slight edge.   By playing 6... c5 first we avoid this line and are ready to open up the center before White finds time to consolidate his position and take care of his king's safety. Now White has to take a concrete decision in the center. Either he takes on d5 or c5, or he protects the d-pawn by playing 7. e3. Once again,  7.a3  Bxc3  8.Qxc3  would transpose to the Nimzo 4.Qc2 O-O 5.a3 chapter. }
7. dxc5
{ As of today I could only find 11 games that have reached this position, which is very strange considering it is only move 7 and so far not a single move has been illogical. White's main point is that Black cannot play  7...d4  due to  8.O-O-O  . White takes advantage of having played both Bg5 and Qc2, which helps him castle long and pin the d-pawn on Black's queen. If Black takes on c5 with the bishop, it would justify White's play since he gains an important tempo.   As we have seen in the Nimzo, in many lines Black usually prefers to take on c5 by developing his b8-knight and almost never takes back the c5-pawn with his bishop. This position is no exception. }
7... h6
{ The typical move in this line, asking White to make a committal decision. He obviously would not like to give up the bishop in such an open position. That would allow Black to develop his queen and threaten ...d4. Thus White should retreat with the bishop to h4 in order to maintain the pin. This, however, moves the bishop far away from White's king and opens up the option of a future ...g5 for Black. }
8. Bh4 Na6
{ Going for the c5-pawn and heading for the e4-square to put more pressure on c3. }
9. a3
{ Trying to eliminate the bishop which is causing a lot of problems for White. This is a good idea, but the disadvantage is that it brings White's queen to c3, from where she can be attacked by a black knight on e4 in the future. }
9... Bxc3+ 10. Qxc3 g5
{ The point of including ...h6 and Bh4 is highlighted here. Without those moves it would not have been possible to play 10... g5. }
11. Bg3 Ne4
{ The most direct. There is nothing wrong with  11...Nxc5  either, but this forces matters. }
12. Qc2 Qa5+ 13. Nd2 Bd7
{ Once again, an alternative and simple path to a balanced game is:  13...Nxd2  14.Qxd2  Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  Nxc5  with the threat of ...Nb3+ and ...dxc4. That is doable and gives Black a fine position, but with 13... Bd7 Black is aiming for more. Now ...Ba4 and ...Rc8 are threatened.   The machine prefers Black, which is easy to understand once we look at White's kingside and his majesty himself. There is no good way for White to finish development without allowing Black to gain the initiative on the queenside. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4
{ Just like 5. a3, this move is also in sync with White's previous move. This was the other plan of Team Anand which we wanted to use against Kramnik in the Bonn match back in 2008. That never happened, although Anand later used it against Kramnik in the 2013 Tal Memorial. I also used this World Championship preparation once against George Meier and won a nice game in Hungary in 2009 after the Bonn Match.   Back then this move had more surprise value and was treated as a one-game idea. Over the years Black has found multiple ways to hold the balance, and nowadays there are many ways Black can force equality. }
5... d5
{ The most principled decision. Black strikes in the center immediately. } 6.
e5
{ White also fights with all his might for the center and grabs as much space as possible. Playing  6.cxd5  helps Black to get his c8-bishop in the game faster and after  6...exd5  7.e5  Ne4  8.Bd3  c5  we will transpose to the mainline that is also covered in the course. }
6... Ne4
{ Taking advantage of the pin on the c3-knight, Black puts his knight on e4 with the idea of playing ...c5 next. White has more space while Black is better developed, so it is now a struggle between strategic advantage and dynamic play. Black must act quickly and should not allow White to consolidate his position. Thankfully Black has already castled and thus is ready for open combat. }
7. Bd3
{ More than a thousand games have been played already with this move. White tries to eliminate the knight on e4.   7.Nf3  c5  8.Bd3  transposes to the mainline.  7.a3  is also a serious try from the White side, which we will look at later in the main course. }
7... c5
{ Once again Black opens up the position, taking advantage of White's uncastled king. }
8. Ne2
{ 8.Nf3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  transposes directly back to this variation.   8.cxd5  exd5  9.Nge2  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nd7  also transposes back to the sideline 10. cxd5. }
8... cxd4 9. Nxd4
{ Why did Black waste two moves with ...c5 and ...cxd4, allowing White's knight to come d4 all the way from g1? The point can be seen in the following couple of moves, which will make it all clear why the naive-looking ...c5/...cxd4 is so strong. }
9... Nd7
{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }
10. Bf4
{ White tries his best to keep the game under control. He protects the e5-pawn and develops a piece. }
10... Qh4
{ There is nothing wrong with the old classical  10...Ndc5  followed by taking on  d3  , which gives Black equality. The move 10... Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after  12.O-O-O  in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. h4
{ A tricky move that has decent popularity. Once again, Black has multiple ways to deal with it. White's threat is to play Be2. By playing h4 he makes sure Black's queen cannot go to h3, and more importantly if Black continues by playing ...Qg6 White has the annoying move h5. }
12... Nxe5
{ We play in the most principled manner. The e5-pawn is hanging so we take it. It was also possible to play  12...f6  as played in a couple of recent ICCF games. I like 12... Nxe5 more because it is easy to understand and thus easy to remember. }
13. Be2 Qg6
{ In this position we are spoilt for choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with  13...Ng4  which is clearly the main move, and almost every single game has proceeded that way. After  13...Ng4  14.Bxg4  Qxg4  15.f3  Qh5  16.g4  Qg6  17.fxe4  e5  the position becomes very wild. Black gains back the piece and White tries to castle long and attack Black. Theoretically speaking it is totally fine for Black.However, I still like the following move, a novelty I kept for a long time, but it has now been played once in a Titled Tuesday online blitz tournament.  Earlier such things would have never occurred. If there was a surprising novelty available, people would keep it for an important tournament to be played over the board when the stakes are higher. Nowadays, due to the lockdown situation, no one knows when over-the-board tournaments will be back. Hence we get to see many interesting novelties being played in online tournaments. With 13... Qg6 Black offers a full piece on  e5! }
14. Bxe5 f6
{ Attacking the e5-bishop and intending to play ...Nxc3 next. White is unable to move the bishop. For instance, both moves:15. Bc7  and   15.Bf4  will run into  15...Nxc3  16.bxc3  Qxc2  17.Nxc2  Bxc3+  and Black will pick up the a1-rook, after which Black has a rook and two pawns for bishop and knight. White's extra knight will be sleeping on a1 while he will have an exposed king on d1.   All Black would need to do is to develop his c8-bishop either on d7 or by playing ...b6 and ...Bb7. In any case, he remains clearly better, and it is not surprising that the computer says the position is close to -1. }
15. h5 Qf7
{ Controlling the c7-square, forcing White to play Bf4. This line is analyzed in great detail in the main course. }

5... d5
{ With the bishop on f4 and queen on c2, ...d5 makes a lot of sense. Think about it from a QGD point of view. White has played the Bf4 line of the QGD with the queen on c2 and no development of his kingside. Our bishop is way stronger on b4 than the typical QGD-bishop on e7. Soon ...c5 will come with great force, creating immediate issues for White's uncastled king. }
6. cxd5 Nxd5
{ Taking back with ...exd5 is almost always correct in the Nimzo, except when it's not  @@StartBracket@@such as here@@EndBracket@@. Black exploits the poor placement of White's bishop, which now comes under direct attack. }

{ White has lost his central control, and in return, he did not even get our dark-squared bishop. Black has castled, and his pieces are developed nicely towards the center. Our knight on  d5  is well centralized and cannot be chased away easily since  9.e4  is met by  9...Nb4  , attacking the queen on c2. Black will finish development with ...Nc6,  ...b6,  etc. Black has absolutely nothing to complain about. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3
{ The modern way of aiming for the Bd2 line is to start with the Rubinstein system @@StartBracket@@4. e3@@EndBracket@@. There are a few more ways to reach a similar position of this Bd2 system, and one of the possible transpositions could be  4.Nf3  O-O  5.Bd2  We will transpose to the mainline in any case. }
4... O-O 5. Bd2
{ I have a close connection to this line from its modern inception at the GM level. My childhood friend Sandipan Chanda's last 41 games against the Nimzo went like this. I think we can safely call him the expert of this line from the white side. Inspired by him, I have also played a few games as White in this line. When Sandipan started playing this line back in 2014-2015 exclusively; there were not many games at the top level.   As mentioned in the 4. Bd2 variation, Sandipan was in a way inspired by GM Stern's play in this system and then revived the move order. In the last few years, the theory has exploded, and thanks to the new engines and the trend set by some top players, this line has reached new heights. GM Bluebaum picked up this line during 2019-2020 and has already played about 50 games with it  @@StartBracket@@although most of them were online!@@EndBracket@@ Top players like Caruana, Grischuk, Yu Yangi have also tried it recently. When Fabiano played this against Magnus in the 2020 Chessable Masters Final, it once again showed that we cannot any more call this a sideline. .I wanted to devote an  entire chapter to this line explaining its subtle move order and ideas to the readers as this line is becoming super trendy. It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details. Once you go through this chapter, I am confident you will get the utmost clarity of this system and have at least one way of dealing with this line.   5.Nf3  d5  6.Bd2  would be a transposition to the mainline. }
5... d5
{ There are several possible ways of dealing with this system. I am recommending the mainline, which is also the most principled. Black breaks in the center and tries to prove that the d2-bishop will remain passive for White. }
6. Nf3
{ This position could also be reached from a Ragozin move-order, but obviously, it is not by far the mainline of Ragozin. Basically, if White wants to play like this, he can do that almost in any system and it should not scare us :-@@EndBracket@@ }
6... b6
{ Another mainline for Black is  6...c5  7.a3  Bxc3  8.Bxc3  Ne4  9.Rc1  . Black manages to hold in that line also, but I personally disliked it as White is playing for two results.   By playing the text move @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 6@@EndFEN@@  6...b6  we keep the game open and fight for three results. }
7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines.   while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order finesse. White first stops Black from getting a setup with ...Bd6 and ...c5. To play ...c5, Black must pull back his bishop from b4, and now he cannot do put it on d6 - A cunning way of playing from the white side. White still keeps the option of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 open. First, he tries to slow down Black's plan of getting ...c5 in an ideal manner. This is White's second most popular move after 8.Bd3 }
8... Bb7
{ Taking control over the e4-square and developing the pieces most naturally. }
9. Bd3
{ Having stopped the Bd6-c5 plan successfully, White now focuses on continuing with his own plan of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 and building a kingside attack. }
9... Be7
{ Did we compromise by not playing ...Bd6 and agree to White's terms and conditions? Not at all! On the contrary, this time, we are saying that time is of utmost importance, and White has wasted a move with Rc1, which doesn't help him directly build his kingside attacking plans.   Thus here we don't mind having our bishop on e7 since the moves ...c5 and ...Nc6 will happen before White can start anything on the kingside. Once again, we must understand that the b8-knight belongs on c6 in this position, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. }
10. O-O c5
{ As per our standard plan, getting ready to meet Ne5 with ...Nc6. White still has to justify the poor placement of his dark-squared bishop. }
11. Ne5
{ White also continues with his standard plan of establishing the knight on e5. }
11... Nc6 { By keeping an eye on the d4-pawn we destabilize the knight on e5. }
12. Be1
{ The most popular move in the position. White finally tries to improve his bishop's position - he is hoping for f4-Bh4 ideas in the future. He also sets a nice positional trap. If Black goes  12...cxd4  then after  13.Nxc6  Bxc6  White has the nice intermediate move  14.Ne2  attacking the c6-bishop and playing Nxd4 next. }
12... Bd6
{ This is a direct approach and something that we should understand clearly. Black wants to take ...cxd4, but that does not work immediately due to trick  12...cxd4  13.Nxc6  Bxc6  14.Ne2  , which was mentioned in the last line. So Black first wants to provoke White into playing f4 before taking ...cxd4. White cannot maintain the knight on e5 anymore without playing f4, which is the most natural move in the position.   It is also to be noted that White does not really have special plans apart from f4. So strictly speaking, there was no need to play ...Bd6 immediately, and a move like  12...g6  would also be perfectly fine for Black. However, playing  12...Bd6  brings immediate clarity to the position, and against most of the other moves we respond with ...Bd6, so it helps to keep it simple and makes it easy to remember. }
13. f4 { White is determined to keep the knight on e5. } 13... cxd4
{ We take ...cxd4 only once White is committed to f4 and has weakened the e3- and e4-squares. That way ...cxd4 becomes much more effective. }
14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15. exd4 Qd7
{ Protecting the c6-bishop first in order to play ...Ne4 next. This line is analyzed in great detail in the main course. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. a3
{ When the great Rubinstein faced this line as White, in his first game he opted for this move. Later he switched to  5.Nge2  .  Playing 5. a3, White doesn't mind compromising his pawn structure. This line is quite similar to the 4. a3 system that we have already seen, with a few differences that we will soon discuss. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3
{ The primary difference between this line and 4. a3 is that White has committed to e3, and Black has committed to ...O-O, and this means that both players are less flexible in their options. Having already played e3, White loses one of his main critical ideas - playing f3 and then e2-e4 in one go. On the other hand, Black has committed to castling, something that we avoided doing too soon in the 4. a3 chapter. This is the primary reason we don't want to play the main move 6...c5 here, since after the moves:   @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4.a3  Bxc3+  5.bxc3  we played  5...c5  only because we still had the flexibility to decide on which side to the castle.

6... Nc6
{ In terms of popularity, this is the fifth most played move in this position, with only about 35 games played. The idea is to play a quick ...e5. Rubinstein's above-mentioned game continued with  6...d6  , which is also the suggestion of GM Roiz in his famous Nimzo book. The idea of  ...d6  is the same as 6... Nc6 - Black wants to play ...e5. The main difference is that after 6... Nc6 Black sometimes goes without playing ...d6, as we will see in some variations. For now, Black wants to play  ...e5  and he waits to see how White is going to develop his pieces. Black is currently ahead in development, which means it makes sense to strike in the center. }
7. Bd3
{ Typically in this line White wants to put his bishop on d3 and the knight on e2, after which he can roll his central pawns forward to gain maximum space. So naturally 7. Bd3 is the most popular move in the position. }
7... e5
{ As Black has planned, he strikes in the center. Given a chance he will also play ...e4 next and counter White's plan of gaining space in the center. }
8. Ne2
{ Once again the most popular move.   8.Qc2  stops the move ...e4 temporarily, but after  8...Qe7  or  8...Re8  the threat of ...e4 becomes even more deadly. By playing 8. Ne2 White challenges Black's strategical threat and wants him to show the strength of his plan. }
8... e4
{ We continue with our plan. Here White has two options, and both are similar in nature. }
9. Bc2 b6
{ Here we see the advantage of playing ...Nc6 instead of ...d6 on move 6. Black ignores ...d6 and instead directly starts to target the c4-pawn, which is the weakest link in White's position. ...Ba6 and ...Na5 cannot be prevented. }
10. Ng3 Ba6
{ There is no time to protect the e4-pawn as White is ready to play f3. Since White has not castled yet, Black takes advantage of that and aims for the c4-pawn with his bishop, stopping White from castling for a long time. }
11. f3
{ This is a cunning move. White will either get his pawn on e4 or, after ...exf3, activate his queen on f3. }
11... Bxc4
{ Black is keen on getting his bishop to c4 quickly in order to stop White's castling. }
12. fxe4 d6
{ This position already looks fine for Black from an opening point of view, since White's king is stuck in the center. I'm still going a bit deeper to understand in an actual game how someone might continue as White, and the following idea looks attractive. }
13. Kf2
{ It is understandable that White would like to get his king to a safe square, and this way of castling artificially comes to mind from a human point of view. }
13... Na5
{ Black ties White's queen to the protection of the b3-square by creating a positional threat of ...Bb3. }
14. Re1 Re8 15. Kg1 g6
{ I love this move. Once this has been played the knight on g3 becomes useless, and Black no longer has to worry about ideas like Nf5, Nh5, or e5. An interesting plan going forward could be to play ...Qe7 and ...h5 with the idea to dislodge the knight from g3 and increase the pressure on the e4-pawn. An idea like ...Nh7 followed by ...Ng5 also comes to mind, especially if White keeps his queen on f3. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Ne2
{ The first four out of five games with this move were played by Rubinstein. According to MegaBase the very first game was Rubinstein against Saemisch in 1925. The line is, however, known as the Reshevsky Variation. The American GM Samuel Reshevsky first played this move in the famous AVRO tournament in 1938 when he was paired against Botvinnik, and he eventually played it about 20 different times in tournament games.White wants to play a3 next to kick the b4-bishop away and then move the knight to f4 or g3. Sometimes he can also keep the knight on e2 and play g3 and Bg2 instead. }
5... c6
{ This is a very modern line compared to all other black moves. The first game with this move that I can see in MegaBase took place in 1992, but it became popular only after 2010. I first stumbled onto this line when the game between Rapport and Wei Yi took place in the World Junior Championship in Athens 2012. I picked up the variation soon afterward and played a few games with it - successfully.The move 5... c6 may look odd but the idea is crystal clear. White's main plan, or rather the only plan, is to chase the bishop from b4 by playing a3 next. There cannot be any other upside of playing Ne2. Meanwhile Black wants to retain his bishop on the best possible diagonal, which is the b8-h2 diagonal. He would like to play ...d5 and keep the bishop on d6. One of the main lines continues with   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5...d5  6.a3  Bd6  7.c5  , when Black's bishop must leave this nice diagonal.  By playing 5...c6, Black wants to play ...d5 and yet be able to keep the bishop on the b8-h2 diagonal. He has created a square for his bishop on c7 so that when a3 is played, it can move to a5 and then eventually land on c7. }
6. a3
{ Sooner or later White will play this move, and irrespective of what White plays, it will eventually transpose back to this line. }
6... Ba5 7. b4 Bc7 8. e4
{ Once again, the most principled reaction. White grabs the center and tries to prove that he gets full domination over it. The only problem is development and king's placement. White is far behind in development, and he is still three moves away from castling.    8.Bb2  d5  9.Ng3  is covered in the  8.Ng3  line   8.g3  we have seen from 7.g3 lines.   After  8.c5  d6  9.cxd6  Bxd6  , there is no way to stop Black from playing  e5  , and playing  10.f4  creates further weakness when Black can play a5 and White is behind development while the game opens up. }
8... d5
{ Beyond a doubt, Black would be more than happy to blast open the center with White's king still on e1. I also find the triangle from g8 to a8 aesthetically pleasing, which has absolutely zero relevance to the evaluation of the position but I still felt like mentioning it. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
9. e5
{ Of course White declines the offer to open up the center. This is also the most popular choice for White. Including  9.cxd5  exd5  would only help Black bring the c8-bishop into play and thus has never been a popular move for White. }
9... Nfd7
{ Here Black has two moves  9...Ne8  or the text move 9... Nfd7. Both involve a future ...f6 break. I recommend playing the knight to d7, keeping a potential threat of sacrificing the knight on e5, which we will see multiple times in this variation. Given a chance, Black can also just take on c4 and then protect the pawn with ...Nb6. }
10. Nf4
{ White stops Black from playing ...f6 by keeping the e6-pawn under attack. }
10... a5
{ Unexpectedly the attack comes from a completely different corner. Black strikes on the queenside to break open the center! The point is that by attacking the b4-pawn Black is laying the groundwork for a future ...c5. For instance, a move like 11. b5 is met by a timely ...c5 break. }
11. Rb1
{ 11.b5  dxc4  12.Bxc4  c5  White won't be able to save the e5-pawn. Interestingly, to get to this-e5 pawn, Black had to play ...c5 to attack the d4-pawn. To play ...c5, he first had to get to the b4-pawn; hence he played ...a5. So, in short, the move 10...a5 was in a way aimed against the e5-pawn. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
11... axb4 12. axb4 c5
{ A spectacular move! Despite controlling the c5-square with two pawns, White could not prevent the move ...c5. Black shows great imagination and comes up with a nice combination. From a purely logical perspective, the move also makes sense: White is totally under-developed compared to Black, so it is high time to open up the center. That is the philosophy of this move, but what actually happens if White takes the pawn? We will take a look at that next. }
13. bxc5
{ White does not want to give the e5-pawn and wants Black to show his idea. }
13... Ba5
{ Another deep point of playing 10...a5 is revealed. Black switches his bishop back to the diagonal which it previously occupied on move three! By attacking and pinning the c3-knight Black forces White to waste another move to defend this piece. For the last few moves, White was kept busy protecting his pawns and pieces and he had no time to develop the light-squared bishop, which he wanted to do after 10. Nf4.Now after  14.Bd2  White removes the pin and it looks like White has consolidated his position and simply remains a pawn up. However, this is far from reality and Black has a nice tactic. I suggest you pause the MoveTrainer and try to find Black's tactic after 14. Bd2. }
14. Bd2
{ Avoiding the pin. It looks like White consolidated his position and remained one pawn up. This is far from reality. Black has a very nice tactic here, which I suggest the readers take a pause and try to find on their own. This will be a good tactic training. }
14... dxc4 15. Bxc4 Nxe5
{ 15...Nc6  also gives Black enough compensation, but 15... Nxe5! is a direct and concrete way for Black to get a fine position.  This line is analyzed in great detail in the main course. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3
{ We have seen the same 6th and 7th moves with 5. Nf3 instead of 5. Bd3. Both Nf3 and Bd3 have their pros and cons. By playing 5. Nf3, White is keen on keeping the bishop on f1 to save a tempo in case Black takes ...dxc4. Hence after 5. Nf3 we refrained from taking on c4 and opted for 7... c5 instead.  Here White kept his g1-knight uncommitted, which means it can be developed to e2 instead of f3. For instance, in the current position, if Black goes  7...c5  , then White would play  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Ne2  , an option that he has only because he didn't commit to Nf3. However, White has already played Bd3 this time, which means he will directly lose a tempo if we take on c4. }
7... dxc4 8. Bxc4
{ Black has gained a tempo for free, which White did not mind giving as he wants to prove that his bishop pair is more important than the loss of a tempo. As we will see, however, this bishop on c1 has a hard time getting into play. }
8... c5 9. Nf3
{ A normal way of developing in order to castle next move. The only disadvantage of this move is that the pawn on c3 remains unprotected. }
9... Qc7
{ With the bishop still, on c4 our move remains the same. We attack the bishop on  c4  indirectly by putting the queen on c7. Note that since White's knight is not on e2, this time, he cannot reply  10.Bd3  due to  10...cxd4  11.cxd4  Qc3+  when either the a1-rook or the d3-bishop falls. }
10. Qd3
{ This move protects the bishop and stops Black's strategic plan of exchanging the light-squared bishop with b6-Ba6, but it has an obvious disadvantage that Black will exploit nicely. }
10... b6 11. O-O Bb7 12. Ne5 Bd5
{ The same queen which prevented the light-squared bishop exchange on a6 now becomes the reason for the upcoming trade. White's bishop is unable to retreat along the f1-a6 diagonal as his own queen is blocking him. Going forward to b5 is the only way to avoid the trade, but that allows ...a6 and ...b5 after which White's bishop would have to go to d1 to avoid the trade since going to c2 would be answered by ...Be4.Once the light-squared bishops are off, White remains with his bad bishop on c1 and a broken pawn structure. His control over the center gives him enough to maintain the balance, though. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Ne2
{ By including the moves 6. cxd5 exd5 White avoids the possibility of Black playing ...dxc4, which we play after 6. Nge2. In doing so the c8-bishop now has an open diagonal and becomes more active. Given the chance, White's long-term plan is to play f3 and e4.To counter this plan we want to keep the option of playing ...c5 ready. By playing ...c5 we put pressure on d4 and prevent the e4 push. To play ...c5 we first need to remove our bishop from b4. Otherwise White will play a3 and our bishop is a goner. The question is: to where do we move this bishop? The typical plans are to put it on d6 or bring it back all the way to f8 after playing ...Re8.   7.a3  Bd6  8.Nge2  was played by Duda recently against Wesley in an online Blitz event. Typically this move is aimed against the ...Re8/...Bf8 plan. In our repertoire, it makes absolutely no sense since after  7.Nge2  we are playing 7... Bd6. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
7... Bd6
{ This move is less frequently played compared to  7...Re8  , which keeps the option of playing either ...Bf8 or ...Bd6 open. I suggest playing an early ...Bd6 because it avoids certain lines and makes our preparation a lot easier. We want to be ready to play ...c5 quickly. If we start with  7...Re8  , then in the variation  8.Bd2  Bd6  White plays  9.Rc1  , almost forcing us to waste a move to defend against the threat of Nb5. that. By playing ...Bd6 first we avoid this line. }
8. O-O
{ The most natural move, and now we continue with 8... Re8 and transpose to the mainline which is typically reached via the 7...Re8 move order. White is not scared of  8...Bxh2+  because after  9.Kxh2  Ng4+  10.Kg3  Qg5  White has  11.f4  when Black cannot reply  11...Qg6  due to the bishop on d3. }
8... Re8 9. Bd2
{ Not committing to f3 immediately. White first wants to play Bd2 and Rc1 and he keeps the option of playing f3 and e4 open. This particular move has been played by Grischuk three times in 2020 alone. David Navara is another specialist who has played this line as White a couple of times. In the case of  9.Nb5  Black is ready with  9...Bf8  when the knight on b5 is not doing much, and Black doesn't mind having his bishop on f8 as it does not hinder his plan of playing ...b6 and ...c5.   Some games have then continued with  10.h3  , which makes zero sense as there is no ...Bxh2+ with the bishop on f8. }
9... b6
{ This is the most flexible approach. Black is ready to meet both Rc1 and f3 with ...c5, and in either case, after dxc5 he won't get an isolated pawn. }
10. Rc1
{ 10.Ng3  c5  11.Rc1  is covered after 10. Rc1 c5 11. Ng3 in variations 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6.cxd5 7.Ne2 #14 and 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6.cxd5 7.Ne2 #15. }
10... c5
{ Black is right on time to meet Rc1 with ...c5. This is also the reason why we begin with ...Bd6 instead of ...Re8. This position could have been reached without the inclusion of O-O and ...Re8, and we would respond in the same manner. With our pawn on c5, it is possible for White to carry out his plan of f3 and e4.   This particular position has been played only 7 times so far, but four of those games took place in 2019-2020 and had the following players: Grischuk - Karjakin, Grischuk - Domingues, Ivanchuk- Ding, and Carlsen - Anand. The high level of these players speaks to the importance and critical nature of this line. Thus it is not surprising that this is the mainline of this chapter. }
11. dxc5
{ This move was played by Grischuk in his last game in this variation. Also, it was the choice of Ivanchuk against Ding Liren in the Online Olympiad 2020. White gives Black hanging pawns on c5 and d5, hoping to create pressure against these pawns. However, Black is well prepared to take care of these hanging pawns which control important squares in the center. }
11... bxc5 12. Nf4
{ Directly going for the d5-pawn. Black can simply save the pawn with  12...Bb7  , which promises him a decent position, but Ding opted for an even stronger move. }
12... Bxf4 13. exf4
{ Here Ding played  13...Nc6  , which maintains the balance, but at this point, I prefer exchanging light-squared bishops by playing ...Ba6. }
13... Ba6 { Black removes one of White's strongest pieces. } 14. Bxa6 Nxa6
{ Black's central pawns are more of a strength than a target. Black is ready to play ...d4 followed by ...Ne4. White has doubled pawns and the bishop on d2 is not doing anything. This promises Black a slight but stable advantage. }

It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  .

After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament.  The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!

His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness. As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance.) }

10... Bxc3 11. bxc3 Qc7

12. Bd3
{ Fabiano's latest try  in the Online Rapid Clutch tournament against Dominguez. }
12... Qxc3
{ I think this is the most principled response. Unlike in the 12. Bb3 line, here White is unable to chase the queen with  13.Bd2  .   In the game Dominguez played  12...Ba6  and after  13.Bg5  Bxd3  14.Qxd3  Nbd7  he had a solid position, which is enough for equality. It is understandable that facing 12. Bd3 against a prepared opponent, Dominguez didn't want to enter the theoretical battle and continued logically. From a theoretical point of view, taking on  c3  is fine, while from a practical point of view, there is nothing wrong with playing the way Dominguez played. Readers can choose either move based on their tastes. }
13. Bg5
{ There is no other good way to get rid of the queen on c3. White plans to attack the queen with Rc1 next. }
13... Nbd7 14. Rc1 Qa5
{ If Black is able to play ...Ba6 next, White might as well resign. Black is a pawn up, and White must show his compensation right now. }
15. a4
{ Stopping ...Ba6 due to the reply Bd2. Due to the move:  15.a4  Black won't have ...Qxa3 after White plays Bd2. White has also set a trap by threatening to play Bb5 followed by Bd2, trapping the queen on a5. }
15... Qd5
{ It is not ideal to block an isolated pawn with the queen, but this is just a general principle. In this particular situation Black is one pawn up and he is trying to save his queen. Soon the queen will move from d5, and a different piece can block the d4-pawn. }
16. Rc7 h6 17. Bh4 Ne8
{ The rook must go back and Black will slowly consolidate his position by playing ...Bb7 followed by ...Ndf6/...Nd6 etc. White remains a pawn down, and he must show his compensation, which is not clearly visible currently. I like Black's position. }

10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.  10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Ne5
{ A common idea for White. He is pretending to stop Black from playing ...Nbd7. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black simply ignores White's main idea and bites the bullet. He doesn't mind breaking his own kingside pawn structure, which might occur if White takes on d7 and f6. }
13. Nxf7
{ Usually this sacrifice never works, and this case is not an exception. White plays this kind of moves seldomly, but it is good to know what we should do. }
13... Rxf7
{ I know that Black can accept the challenge and take:  13...Kxf7  , which eventually ends in a perpetual. I am never keen on analyzing or remembering unnecessary lines. All I need to know here is that  13...Kxf7  works, but it requires some memory work while 13... Rxf7 also works equally well without having to remember a bunch of lines. More importantly, I don't need to take my king for a stroll from g8 to f5 and then back to g8 again which is one of the computer lines after 13... Kxf7. }
14. Bxe6 Qf8
{ White will have a rook and two pawns against bishop and knight from a material point of view. However, the b7-bishop has no counterpart, and it can put huge pressure on the g2-pawn. The engines think that if White plays any normal-looking waiting move, then after  15...Kh8  Black already takes over due to his potential kingside attack. Thus White must continue energetically to keep Black tied down to the f7-rook. }
15. Qb3 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Re8
{ Black wants to get rid of White's light-squared bishop and then play ...Nh5 and ...Nf4. White has extra pawns but these pawns are too weak, and once again there is no match for the b7 bishop. }
17. Bc4 Rc8
{ Once again, Black wants to take the light-squared bishop off. One correspondence game and two tournament games reached this position, and in all games, White was happy with repeating the position by playing  18.Be6  . In the correspondence game and a game by Alekseev, Black rejected the peace offer and played  18...Rc6  instead of repeating with  18...Re8  . This shows that Black is looking for more while White is happy with a draw. Whether to play  18...Rc6  or  18...Re8  is a personal choice. The computers say that both options are equally good. :- @@EndBracket@@ }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. Nf3
{ This is the mainline of the Rubinstein system. White develops his pieces most logically. There is an enormous amount of games and analyses available in this variation. Interestingly, in all the World Championship matches that I was working for Anand as a second  @@StartBracket@@Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand@@EndBracket@@, we prepared this line for both colors.While preparing this line as White, our major block was the Karpov System. It's one of the most solid systems, and we could never break this line as White. Curious readers might ask in the match against Gelfand in game 11 why Anand played the weird-looking 8... Bd7 instead of playing 8... cxd4 9. exd4 b6, which is known as the Karpov system. The reasoning is simple. It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.  8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter, from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.  9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament.  The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  (My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness. As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance.) }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.  10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Qe2
{ The main move in the Karpov System. This is the most popular move in the position without ...h6 and Bh4 included. White quickly wants to put his rook on d1 and keeps the option open to play either d5 or Ne5.It should be noted that Black can already no longer get to this position from the traditional move order. The game Mamedyarov - Hou Yifan, World Cup 2015 is the classic example. After:   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10@@EndFEN@@  10...Bb7  11.Qe2  Hou Yifan played  11...h6  hoping to transpose to our current position after  12.Bh4  , but Mamedyarov came up with the brutal piece sac  12.d5!!  .  This is a game that one should know to understand what Black should avoid in the Karpov System. I encourage the readers to have a look at this game to get a better sense of the dangers that lurk in this harmless-looking variation. This game also shows why the move order of 10... h6 11. Bh4 Bb7 is so important. This way we completely avoid Mamedyarov's piece sacrifice. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black normally plays ...Nc6 to force White's queen to remain on d1,  protecting the pawn on d4. Here White has already played Qe2,  which means  12...Nc6  doesn't make any sense since as White is ready to continue with  13.Rad1  . Here Black instead develops the knight to d7, giving extra protection to the f6-knight, thus releasing the queen on d8 from her burden. }
13. Rac1
{ A natural developing move that transposes to one of the main lines in the Karpov system which usually starts with the traditional 10... b6 move. With our subtle move order 10... h6 we will bypass a lot of theory-heavy lines, but not all. Also, there are lines that we don't really want to avoid. :-@@EndBracket@@  13.Rfd1  Bxc3  14.bxc3  Rc8  15.Rac1  transposes back to the 13. Rac1 variation. }
13... Rc8 { Keeping an eye on c4 and threatening to take on f3. } 14. Rfd1
{ 14.Ne5  runs into the exact same tactic that we saw after  13.Ne5  . Black plays  14...Nxe5  15.dxe5  Qd4  with similar consequences as after  13.Ne5  . By playing  14.Rfd1  White is finally ready to play Ne5 without allowing the aforementioned tactic. }
14... Bxc3
{ This is the perfect moment to take the knight on c3 without being provoked. Black takes advantage of the vulnerability of the c4-bishop. }
15. bxc3 Qc7
{ Black could take:  15...Bxf3  and shatter White's pawn structure, but this is much stronger. Black is planning to move his queen to f4 before taking on f3. Right now the c4-bishop is hanging. }
16. Nd2 Qf4 17. Bg3 Qg5
{ Black once again has no weaknesses while his pieces are harmoniously developed. He is planning to play ...Nh5 next. White's pawn structure issues are still there. His bishop pair is not looking particularly dangerous. Note that the g3-bishop cannot move due to mate on g2. }

I would prefer to not have to ask myself when I should take on c3 and when the bishop should come back to e7. In this chapter we play ...Be7 almost exclusively in every other line, so I don't see a particular need to make an exception here. }
14. Qd3
{ We now have the same position as in my game against Wang Hao, as mentioned in the notes in the 12. Rc1 variation. It is important to understand that ...Nh5 works only with the rook on c1 and not with the rook on e1. Now the safest is to first include ...Rc8 and only then go ...Nh5. That way, there is no chance we will mix things up. }

{ The crucial difference after:  14...Nh5  15.Bg3  Nxg3  15.hxg3  Bf6  16.d5!  is already mentioned in the notes to the 12. Rc1 variation. By playing 14... Rc8 Black prepares ...Nh5 and avoids lines where White plays an immediate d5. }
15. Rad1 Nh5
{ We have seen this theme multiple times. Here White is ideally prepared to strike in the center. He has placed all his pieces on the right squares via a very subtle move order and now he will strike in the center. However, even this does not bother Black, and will escape unscathed from the fight.  This line is analyzed in great detail in the main course. }

Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Qd3
{ White keeps the queen on  d3  to facilitate the d5 break. This way, he makes sure Black is unable to play  12...Nc6  due to  13.d5 }
12... Nbd7
{ Apart from when White plays an early Qe2,  we usually develop our knight to  c6  to tie White's queen to the d4-pawn. Here White is ready to play d5 which means we reply ...Nbd7. White's queen's position is ideal for if Black plays ...Nc6,  but with a knight on  d7  Black is always ready to meet  13.d5  with  13...Nc5  attacking the queen on d3. }
13. Rad1
{ This fits in with White's plan of putting the queen on d3. He is further preparing to play d5. }
13... Bxc3
{ Right on time, Black removes the c3-knight to take care of the d5 plan permanently. }
14. bxc3 a6
{ Black stays loyal to his strategic play. With the plan of ...b5, ...Qa5 and ...Bd5 he wants to exchange light-squared bishops and play on the light squares and against the weak c3-pawn. }
15. a4 Qc7
{ ...Rac8 and ...Bxf3 are equally annoying threats. White has the bishop pair but he has too many weaknesses to deal with in return. The position is balanced. }

9. e4
{ Practically, this is the only move that looks interesting for White. All other moves are not that critical.   9.Bg5  is a rare guest and after  9...h6  White has to give the bishop while Black still keeps the extra pawn. Almost all games have ended in Black's favor, which is not surprising as Black remains a pawn up while he also has the bishop pair.   9.Qa4  has been tried once, but after giving up a second pawn on d4, White simply does not have enough compensation to prove his point. A possible continuation could be  9.Qa4  Nxd4  10.Nxd4  Qxd4  11.Be3  Qg4  12.h3  Qh5  . Computers give -1.5 for Black as White has no compensation for the sacrificed pawns. }
9... a6
{ Black is adamant about keeping the pawn on c4. That is his main asset, after all. White is still yet to prove his compensation. In correspondence chess, Black has a positive score of 70% from this position with not a single loss. That shows the strength of Black's position. Although it is easy to play with a computer, we should understand a few things clear to avoid getting into dangerous situations. }
10. Be3
{ This is the most critical move. White could also play:   10.Qe2  b5  11.Be3  , and it would transpose to the mainline. Typically White wants his a1-rook to be on d1 as his plans are connected with the central break d5 and a kingside attack. }
10... b5 11. h4
{ This is a rare move, having been played only once in a correspondence game. For me, this was the hardest move to crack despite computers saying everything is good for Black. If I were White in this position, I would go for such a plan as one mistake from Black could be fatal. White slowly prepares a kingside attack. Let us have a look at how the game can proceed. White plans to throw everything at Black by going  11...--  12.e5  Nd5  13.Ng5 }
11... Rb8
{ The above-mentioned correspondence game continued with:   11....Na5  12.e5  Nd5  13.Ng5  Bb7  . Here both  14.Qh5  and  14.Qg4  are extremely complicated and something I would like to avoid it. Black is not worse, but to have to play a series of computer moves just by pure memorization with multiple options for White is not practical, in my opinion. 11... Bb7 also falls into White's main idea, which was mentioned in the notes to 11. Qe2. }
12. e5 Nd5 13. Ng5
{ Here, there are many options for Black, and everything is playable while Leela and Stockfish debate on the evaluation of the position as usual. One such option is to play:  13...Nxe3  14.fxe3  Bxg5  15.hxg5  Qxg5  , sacrificing the knight on c6. Black will collect the g3- and e3-pawns and get good compensation - although most likely, the game ends in some sort of perpetual. I want to keep the game going, so I dug further and found the following. }
13... Bxg5 14. Bxg5
{ 14.hxg5  And we have the thematic  14...Nxc3  15.bxc3  Ne7  . Black will exchange light-squared bishops and then go ...Qd5 and ...Nf5. White's dark-squared bishop remains very bad, and Black gets a clear strategic advantage. }
14... Nce7
{ It is also possible to take on c3 first and then play this move, but there is nothing Black should be afraid of. }
15. Ne4 h6 16. Qh5
{ I wanted to go a bit deeper here to show a typical defensive idea for Black. You will not necessarily get this position, but it is good to know this particular idea which might come in handy in similar positions. }
16... Qe8
{ A very cunning move. It was not completely necessary to go this deep for a rare line that you will likely never see over the board. Both sides' moves leading up to this position are not the engine's top choices. However, I really wanted to show this particular idea, which I feel is an important theme in such setups.With this silent move, Black threatens to play ...g6 next when White cannot take on h6 as ...Nf5 would trap his queen. But what about 17. Bxh6? Doesn't that look super scary? }
17. Bxh6 f5
{ That is the point! White cannot take en passant as he is forced to exchange queens, after which he will lose a piece. }

White wants to fight for the center and is ready to give his bishop to damage Black's pawn structure.Black has multiple ways to deal with this line. I chose a system that is easy to remember and keeps dynamic chances for Black.

4. Bxf6
{ Like in the Trompowsky, in this line, White also sometimes takes on f6 to break Black's pawn structure. However, our response remains the same in all these lines. We are always taking with the g-pawn, gaining more control over the half-open g-file while also bringing our pawn towards the center. Basically, we play similarly as we did in the Trompowsky chapter. This way, it is also easier to remember the lines and takes less energy to prepare.   Note that after:  4.dxc5  d4  5.Bxf6  gxf6  , we transpose to 4.Bxf6 lines. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4
{ This line came into fashion in the 1922 London tournament and since then has been known as The London System. For a long time, it had a stamp of being boring and a way to avoid theory. At some point, Gata Kamsky was exclusively playing this line.Things have changed a lot in the last few years, especially when Kramnik and Carlsen started using this line heavily as White. I would say this is also a mainline now, and definitely not boring by any means! This opening occurs very frequently, so it makes sense to go deep into this variation and try to understand the subtleties of various move orders. First, try to understand the logic behind the moves. Then you will remember the lines by default. If we try to memorize without understanding, then no matter what, eventually, we tend to forget.Note that:   2.Nf3  d5  3.Bf4  will transpose to the mainline. }

{ An honest confession: before making this course, I didn't know the name of this opening. I did not have a SINGLE note on this line. In my 33 years of chess, I have never faced this line even once, including the countless blitz I played online and offline. Thanks to this course I now know some history of this line and know how to play as Black against it - although I must admit that none of the moves looked difficult, and even without knowing the theory, I would have played the same. No wonder this line is not popular as such as compared to other 1. d4 sidelines.In any case, this is a transposition to the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. I read a bit on Wikipedia, too, to understand how the name was given. For now, let's skip that part. Those who are interested can always check the Wiki for further details.   This line is often reached via the @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.e4  dxe4  3.Nc3  Nf6  move order. }
3... Nxe4
{ Sam Shankland suggests  3...dxe4  in his Semi Slav course, which is fine too, but I think he also had the same logic as mine. Basically, it is always better to have our preparation in such a way so that we can play similarly in most of the lines. His repertoire was Slav-based, which means he also had to cover 2. e4 and thus could get to this position from either move order. Hence 3... dxe4 made more sense for him as White could force that position via the 2. e4 move order as well.In our case, we start with 1... Nf6 and thus cannot ever be forced to take on e4 with the pawn. Once again, I will apply the same logic which we had in Veresov and Jobava. 'If we take ...dxe4 instead of ...Nxe4, our knight will be busy protecting the e4-pawn while his knight will be attacking it. Hence we want to remove the knights for now'. }
4. Nxe4 dxe4
{ I think this is the main reason why this line is even less popular through this move order. Black has managed to trade his defending knight on f6 for the attacking knight on c3. I really don't see any compensation for the pawn for White. No wonder I've never had this position in my lifetime. }

8. f3 exf3 9. Nxf3 f6
{ With our knight on e7 there will never be any Nxe5 trick since ...Ng6 will be available any time White wants to play Qh5+. }
10. O-O Nf5

{ Opening up the position with the move  10.cxd5  exd5  is exactly what Black wants. Playing  11.e3  is the only way to stop the thematic ...d4 idea, which would prevent White from developing freely. Moreover, 11. e3 shuts in the c1-bishop, and Black can develop at ease with Re8-Bf5-Ne4 getting the initiative quickly as White still needs to complete castling. }
10... e5 { Grabbing more space in the center. } 11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. Bd3 Nf6
{ A nice cool retreat. Black plans to play ...e4 which means White is now forced to move the d3-bishop. Playing  13.Qc2  can stop it for one move but as soon as Black plays  13...Qe7  , the threat of ...e4 is renewed. Black will connect the rooks and occupy the d- and c-files before White can connect their rooks. This gives Black a comfortable position. }

However, soon practice showed that White's queen does not belong on d3 or b3, as in both cases she can be attacked in various ways.

12. Bxe6 Bxe6 13. Qxc6 Bd5
{ To prevent the kingside from being damaged White has to waste a few more tempos with the queen. }
14. Qc3 Rc8
{ After the queen moves, we can play simply by taking on f3 and then taking on d4, getting a completely equal position. It is also possible to keep the complex battle by playing the even stronger move 15... Rc2 and retaining the strong bishop on d5 which retains potential kingside attacking chances for us by keeping an eye on the g2-pawn. }

7. Rc1 d6
{ There are too many ways for Black to play here. I suggest a simple approach: we will collect the c3-bishop soon, which means both sides will be left with the light-squared bishop. Thus we should aim to break with ...e5 or ...c5 and not with ...d5. By playing e5/c5, our bishop will be stronger than its counterpart. }
8. Nf3 Nxc3 9. Rxc3 Nd7
{ Black can either break with ...e5 and get the c5-square for his knight, or opt for the ...c5 break and develop the c8-bishop via b6-Bb7. Either of these two breaks would allow Black to get a comfortable position with zero weaknesses and a good bishop. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd2
{ This is the move order preferred by GM Stern that became the inspiration of the same line's modern move order starting with  4.e3  O-O  5.Bd2  .   The latter move order became much more popular, and we will speak about that in the mainline when we reach that position. Historically speaking, the line goes back to the early 20th century when players like Tarrasch, Tartakower, Rubinstein, Alekhine, etc., tried this system once in a while. The line never really became popular back then. Once GM Stern started playing this line regularly, soon my friend GM Sandipan Chanda picked it up and revived it completely.   More about this when we get to the modern move order of this line 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd2. The idea of this line is transparent. White is unwilling to double his pawn structure and instead wants to get his bishop to c3 after Black takes the c3-knight. }

{ The most straightforward approach. White immediately wants to apply his idea behind 4.Bd2.

{ White is unable to save his bishop after all. It looks like  7.Bb4  would make this possible, but that is not the case. }
7. Qc2 Nxc3 8. Qxc3
{ If White had a bishop on c1 and Black had a knight on f6,  we would have the mainline of the @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Qc2  O-O  5.a3  Nimzo. The difference is subtle and can easily be misguiding. With the knight on f6, we will play actively by breaking with ...d5 and ...c5 quickly. A key factor is that the knight on f6 often harasses the c3-queen, which is not possible in the current position. It is also important to note that unlike in the classical Qc2 variation, here White does not have a bishop pair advantage, which means Black doesn't need to hurry. White's advantage is not static anymore. He has a better central control but is four moves away from castling short. That will give Black ample time to challenge the center, so Black can take things slowly. }

{ A logical response. Black would obviously like to challenge the center with ...c5 or ...e5, keeping his light-squared bishop as active as possible. }
11. Be2 Nd7 12. O-O c5 13. Rad1 Qc7
{ Black has a good bishop, and he has managed to challenge White in the center, right on time. Without having any weaknesses, Black has achieved a comfortable position to play out of the opening. }

7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Bb5
{ This move was seen only once at the GM level. Grandmaster Riazantsev played this move in Aeroflot 2020. An interesting fact is that he played this move after exactly 35 seconds. This indicates that it was part of his preparation. For our repertoire, this particular move does not have any special significance since it might be avoiding some other lines for Black, but not the one we wanted to play. White stops ...Re8 plans and provokes Black into playing ...a6. Playing 8... a6 is fine here, and I don't see any obvious disadvantage. However, when I can simply transpose to our mainline, why bother probing into an entirely different plan? }
8... Bd6 9. O-O c6
{ 9...Bg4  was played by GM Sychev Klementy in Riazantsev's game, instead I recommend playing this move, directly transposing to the mainline. }
10. Bd3
{ It's hard to imagine any other better square for the bishop apart from d3. }
10... Re8
{ Typically we get this exact position with the Black pawn on c7 instead of c6. This does not make any particular difference as our next move is ...c5 in any case. After  11.Qc2   or  11.Rc1  we would go  11...c5  and that would transpose to the mainline. Usually, with the pawn on c7 after almost every other move we play ...c5 except for Re1. Thus we should check Re1 in the current position. }
11. Re1 Ne4
{ A small difference with the lines where our pawn was on c7 instead of c6. There we play ...Bb7 to stop e4. In the current position, ...Ne4 is available as the c6-pawn protects our d5-pawn. Now the knight on e4 will be well protected, and White cannot get rid of it.   A move like  12.Qc2  is answered with  12...Qe7  giving Black a fine position and leaving White with a bad bishop on d2. }

Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Be2
{ This move has been played a few times. It has some independent value in the case of the traditional mainline for Black. However, against the move  8.Bd3  we are playing the modern line  8...Bd6  with the idea to play ...Re8 next, stopping Ne5 ideas. I do not see a single advantage to placing White's bishop on e2 instead of d3, so we continue in the same way we would have played against 8.Bd3. }
8... Bd6
{ Black wants to stop Ne5 by playing ...Re8 next. If at any point White opts for Rc1 with the idea of playing Nb5, then we play ...c5. We are playing in the exact same way as we play in the 8.Bd3 lines. }
9. Ne5
{ White wants to get in Ne5 before Black can stop it. After  9.O-O  Re8  10.Rc1  c5  we would get a standard position, which would be similar to the 8. Bd3 line. Even with the bishop on d3 White does not have any advantage, so we can play in the exact same way without worries. }
9... c5 10. O-O Bb7 11. Rc1 Nc6
{ Once again, we have a similar position with the bishop on e2 instead of d3. White is not in time to create an attack on the kingside. He has to either play f4 or compromise his knight's position and get it exchanged. Playing  12.f4  doesn't help either. After  12...cxd4  13.Nxc6  Bxc6  14.exd4  Qd7  White's e5-knight is gone and this leaves him with multiple weaknesses on e4 and e3. Having played f4 already the e4-square becomes a target. Black enjoys a good position. }

Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Qc2
{ Just like  8.Rc1  which we will examine next, 8. Qc2 also tries to prevent Black from playing ...Bd6. Without pulling back the bishop Black won't play ...c5, so in a way, this move has its own logic. However, there is one major flaw: usually, White's play is based upon building a kingside attack in the future with Bd3-O-O-Ne5-f4 plans. The queen is often better placed on its initial square from where it can come to the kingside quickly via f3. }
8... Re8 9. Bd3 Bf8
{ Unable to play ...Bd6, Black moves the bishop to its second-best possible square. Black claims that the queen on c2 is misplaced, and once he gets in ...c5 and ...Nc6 White will have to waste a tempo to stop ...Nb4 ideas. Hence it is fine to play ...Bf8 instead of ...Bd6. }
10. O-O c5 11. Ne5 { The best bet. White prevents ...Nc6 for now. } 11... Bb7
{ black will get in ...Nc6 irrespective of White's play. White can stop this move once again by going  12.Bb5  , but after  12...Re6  once again, Black is intending to play ...Nc6 next. }
12. f4
{ White still attempts to create something on the kingside. Black's counterplay remains the same. He targets the d4-pawn with immediate effect.   12.f4  is not the best move for sure, but if not this move, White has no concrete plans to claim anything from the opening. Thus we need to check it once. }
12... Nc6 13. Ne2
{ White manages to save the d4-pawn, and the knight on e5 also remains stable. The misplacement of the queen on c2 becomes clear with Black's next move. }
13... c4
{ White's queen is blocking the bishop which means it cannot be maintained on the beautiful b1-h7 diagonal. The bishop will be chased away from the diagonal completely. }
14. Bf5 Ne7
{ The bishop must leave the diagonal and allow Black to play ...Ne4. This guarantees Black an excellent position. He can also include the move ...Bc8, forcing White to weaken further or allow the bishop exchange. }

A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with.

What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity.

It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details. Once you go through this chapter, I am confident you will get the utmost clarity of this system and have at least one way of dealing with this line.   5.Nf3  d5  6.Bd2  would be a transposition to the mainline. }
5... d5
{ There are several possible ways of dealing with this system. I am recommending the mainline, which is also the most principled. Black breaks in the center and tries to prove that the d2-bishop will remain passive for White. }
6. Nf3
{ This position could also be reached from a Ragozin move-order, but obviously, it is not by far the mainline of Ragozin. Basically, if White wants to play like this, he can do that almost in any system and it should not scare us :-@@EndBracket@@ }
6... b6
{ Another mainline for Black is  6...c5  7.a3  Bxc3  8.Bxc3  Ne4  9.Rc1  . Black manages to hold in that line also, but I personally disliked it as White is playing for two results.

7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order finesse. White first stops Black from getting a setup with ...Bd6 and ...c5. To play ...c5, Black must pull back his bishop from b4, and now he cannot do put it on d6 - A cunning way of playing from the white side. White still keeps the option of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 open. First, he tries to slow down Black's plan of getting ...c5 in an ideal manner. This is White's second most popular move after 8.Bd3. }
8... Bb7
{ Taking control over the e4-square and developing the pieces most naturally. }
9. Nb5
{ This move is not as popular compared to  9.Bd3  . However, this move makes sense since White is exchanging his bad bishop against Black's good bishop. }
9... Bxd2+
{ We have no other choice. We give up our good bishop but will encash on our lead in development. }
10. Nxd2
{ This position was reached twice in 2020 in the games Artemiev - Le Quang and Firouzja - Giri. }
10... c5
{ A strong novelty. Both Anish and Le Quang played  10...c6  instead. I am convinced that in an OTB tournament with classical time control, they would have found the more energetic ...c5, sacrificing a pawn for the sake of rapid development. }
11. dxc5 bxc5 12. Rxc5
{ White must accept the challenge.   12.Nb3  does not help as after  12...Nbd7  White is unable to take  13.Nxc5  due to  13...Qa5+  14.Qd2  Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  Nxc5  16.Rxc5  Ne4+  and Black wins the c5-rook with a fork. }
12... Nc6 { Black is ready to play ...d4 before White can run away with O-O. }
13. Qa4 Qe7 14. Nb3 Ne4 15. Rc2
{ To keep b2 and f2 protected White keeps his rook on c2. This gives Black another vital tempo. }
15... Nb4
{ There are multiple ways to play this position, and readers are welcome to choose anything as per their own taste. If you want to keep the game complicated and going, then moves like Rae8/Ne5/d4 are interesting. I am giving a line that ends in a draw, but White must find some only moves to achieve that. }
16. Rc7 Qf6 17. Qxb4 Qxf2+ 18. Kd1 Qxb2
{ The computer calls it 0.00. The game is likely to end with a perpetual. For instance, after  19.Rxb7  Qb1+  20.Ke2  Qxa2+=  . }

White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order finesse. White first stops Black from getting a setup with ...Bd6 and ...c5. To play ...c5, Black must pull back his bishop from b4, and now he cannot do put it on d6 - A cunning way of playing from the white side. White still keeps the option of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 open. First, he tries to slow down Black's plan of getting ...c5 in an ideal manner. This is White's second most popular move after 8.Bd3. }
8... Bb7
{ Taking control over the e4-square and developing the pieces most naturally. }
9. Bd3
{ Having stopped the Bd6-c5 plan successfully, White now focuses on continuing with his own plan of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 and building a kingside attack. }
9... Be7
{ Did we compromise by not playing ...Bd6 and agree to White's terms and conditions? Not at all! On the contrary, this time, we are saying that time is of utmost importance, and White has wasted a move with Rc1, which doesn't help him directly build his kingside attacking plans. Thus here we don't mind having our bishop on e7 since the moves ...c5 and ...Nc6 will happen before White can start anything on the kingside. Once again, we must understand that the b8-knight belongs on c6 in this position, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. }
10. O-O c5
{ As per our standard plan, getting ready to meet Ne5 with ...Nc6. White still has to justify the poor placement of his dark-squared bishop. }
11. dxc5 bxc5 12. Re1
{ This clever move is underestimated and not so popular yet. White has also tried the move  12.Na4  but after  12...Ne4  White has achieved nothing and Black gets full activity with his knight on e4.   The purpose of the move 12.Re1 is subtle. White waits for Black to commit with his b8-knight. If Black goes after the text move  12.Re1  12...Nbd7  then after  13.e4  d4  14.Nb5  White gets a dominant position as the b5-knight heads for the c4-square via a3.   In the case of  12.Re1  12...Nc6  White opts for  13.Bb1  and gets ready to break with e4. This move 12.Re1 could be tricky if Black gets caught unaware. }
12... Re8
{ An important waiting move, not yet deciding where to develop the b8-knight. Black stays noncommittal with his b8-knight and waits to see White's plan. The move ...Re8 makes good sense as it adds potential pressure on the e4-square. }
13. Bb1 { Preparing to play e4. } 13... Nbd7
{ Now that White wasted a move with Bb1 Black chooses to play ...Nbd7. We will see that this extra tempo of Bb1 and ...Re8 favors Black in the upcoming complications. }
14. e4 d4 15. Nb5 Bf8
{ White would have a lovely position if he could consolidate and bring his knight to c4. Unfortunately for him, there is no time left. Thanks to the inclusion of Bb1 and ...Re8 the e4-pawn is under direct attack, and there is no good way to save it. Black has fine play. }

{ I have a close connection to this line from its modern inception at the GM level. My childhood friend Sandipan Chanda's last 41 games against the Nimzo went like this. I think we can safely call him the expert of this line from the white side. Inspired by him, I have also played a few games as White in this line. When Sandipan started playing this line back in 2014-2015 exclusively; there were not many games at the top level.   As mentioned in the 4. Bd2 variation, Sandipan was in a way inspired by GM Stern's play in this system and then revived the move order. In the last few years, the theory has exploded, and thanks to the new engines and the trend set by some top players, this line has reached new heights. GM Bluebaum picked up this line during 2019-2020 and has already played about 50 games with it  @@StartBracket@@although most of them were online!@@EndBracket@@ Top players like Caruana, Grischuk, Yu Yangi have also tried it recently. When Fabiano played this against Magnus in the 2020 Chessable Masters Final, it once again showed that we cannot anymore call this a sideline. The line's history has already been discussed in the 4.Bd2 line, so I won't repeat that.I wanted to devote an entire chapter to this line explaining its subtle move order and ideas to the readers as this line is becoming super trendy. It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details. Once you go through this chapter, I am confident you will get the utmost clarity of this system and have at least one way of dealing with this line.   5.Nf3  d5  6.Bd2  would be a transposition to the mainline. }

7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too.

14. Na4 Qxb3 15. axb3 Ba6
{ This is a nice touch. Either White must give away his good bishop or he has to retreat and give up the a6-f1 diagonal. Black will save the c5-pawn by playing either ...Nxa6 or ...Nbd7, giving him a comfortable position. }

I did not expect to get the exact same position on the board as Fedoseev plays pretty much everything as White. I knew the top choice of computers in this position was Be1 and not Ne2. During the game, when my opponent was thinking, I realized that looking at this position for the first time, Be1 is not such a human move and this Ne2 move is rather logical. White protects the d4-pawn and is ready to play Ng3-Nf5 in the near future. }
12... Rc8
{ Black is waiting for White to play f4 so that he can jump with his knight to e4. }
13. Ng3
{ Here I found a strong move which is also the most natural move in the position. }
13... g6
{ Black immediately restricts the g3-knight. An important trick is that after  14.Qf3  Black has the cunning  14...Ne4!!  When after  15.Nxe4  Black takes  15...Nxe5  16.dxe5  dxe4  and the d2-bishop falls. We want White to play f4 soon so that we can take ...cxd4.   If White volunteers by playing  14.f4  , then Black would go  14...cxd4  15.Nxc6  Rxc6  and once White recapture on d4 Black will get the ideal ...Ne4 working. There is no hint of any attack for White while Black takes control over the center. }
14. a3
{ White is trying to play a slow game and see how Black proceeds. This is not a tough thing to guess. Black wants White to play f4, so at the first chance, he will add more pressure on e5 to force White to play f4 or give up the e5-knight. }
14... Bd6 15. Nxc6
{ Seeing that after  15.f4  cxd4  16.Nxc6  Rxc6  Black takes over the e4-square, White looks for a way to bail out and get some kind of equal position. }
15... Rxc6
{ 15...Bxc6  There was nothing wrong with this move either. White has lost the vital knight on e5 and the g6-pawn restricts his other knight. Black has good central control, and White's d2-bishop is still out of play. The position remains balanced, and Black can look forward to a nice middlegame. }

{ I have a close connection to this line from its modern inception at the GM level. My childhood friend Sandipan Chanda's last 41 games against the Nimzo went like this. I think we can safely call him the expert of this line from the white side. Inspired by him, I have also played a few games as White in this line. When Sandipan started playing this line back in 2014-2015 exclusively; there were not many games at the top level.   As mentioned in the 4.

In the last few years, the theory has exploded, and thanks to the new engines and the trend set by some top players, this line has reached new heights.

It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details. Once you go through this chapter, I am confident you will get the utmost clarity of this system and have at least one way of dealing with this line.   5.Nf3  d5  6.Bd2  would be a transposition to the mainline. }

6... b6
{ Another mainline for Black is  6...c5  7.a3  Bxc3  8.Bxc3  Ne4  9.Rc1  . Black manages to hold in that line also, but I personally disliked it as White is playing for two results.

7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order finesse. White first stops Black from getting a setup with ...Bd6 and ...c5. To play ...c5, Black must pull back his bishop from b4, and now he cannot do put it on d6 - A cunning way of playing from the white side. White still keeps the option of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 open. First, he tries to slow down Black's plan of getting ...c5 in an ideal manner. This is White's second most popular move after 8.Bd3. }
8... Bb7
{ Taking control over the e4-square and developing the pieces most naturally. }
9. Bd3
{ Having stopped the Bd6-c5 plan successfully, White now focuses on continuing with his own plan of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 and building a kingside attack. }
9... Be7
{ Did we compromise by not playing ...Bd6 and agree to White's terms and conditions? Not at all! On the contrary, this time, we are saying that time is of utmost importance, and White has wasted a move with Rc1, which doesn't help him directly build his kingside attacking plans. Thus here we don't mind having our bishop on e7 since the moves ...c5 and ...Nc6 will happen before White can start anything on the kingside. Once again, we must understand that the b8-knight belongs on c6 in this position, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. }
10. O-O c5
{ As per our standard plan, getting ready to meet Ne5 with ...Nc6. White still has to justify the poor placement of his dark-squared bishop. }
11. Ne5
{ White also continues with his standard plan of establishing the knight on e5. }
11... Nc6 { By keeping an eye on the d4-pawn we destabilize the knight on e5. }
12. f4
{ This makes zero sense to me. If we look at the lines  12.Be1  or  12.a3  ,  we will see that Black usually provokes White to play f4 by playing ...Bd6 and attacking the e5-knight. White is doing something that Black would love for him to do. }
12... cxd4
{ As we have seen in this line multiple times we take ...cxd4 only when White is committed to f4. }
13. Nxc6 Bxc6
{ 14.Ne2  This typical tactic does not work as Black has a nice intermediate  14...dxe3  ,  attacking the d2-bishop. }
14. exd4 Qd7
{ This position occurred in the game Krasenkow vs. Wojtasszek in the 2018 Polish Championship.   Here instead of  14...b5  ,  I like  14...Qd7  even more. It has the same idea of playing ...b5 but avoids an unnecessary pawn sacrifice. }
15. f5 b5
{ Going for the c3-knight to get full control over the e4-square. Black has already taken over as White cannot really stop this plan. ...Bd6 and ...Re8 are also on the way to make the ...Ne4 plan more effective. }

It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details. Once you go through this chapter, I am confident you will get the utmost clarity of this system and have at least one way of dealing with this line.   5.Nf3  d5  6.Bd2  would be a transposition to the mainline. }

7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order finesse. White first stops Black from getting a setup with ...Bd6 and ...c5. To play ...c5, Black must pull back his bishop from b4, and now he cannot do put it on d6 - A cunning way of playing from the white side. White still keeps the option of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 open. First, he tries to slow down Black's plan of getting ...c5 in an ideal manner. This is White's second most popular move after 8.Bd3. }
8... Bb7
{ Taking control over the e4-square and developing the pieces most naturally. }
9. Bd3
{ Having stopped the Bd6-c5 plan successfully, White now focuses on continuing with his own plan of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 and building a kingside attack. }
9... Be7
{ Did we compromise by not playing ...Bd6 and agree to White's terms and conditions? Not at all! On the contrary, this time, we are saying that time is of utmost importance, and White has wasted a move with Rc1, which doesn't help him directly build his kingside attacking plans. Thus here we don't mind having our bishop on e7 since the moves ...c5 and ...Nc6 will happen before White can start anything on the kingside. Once again, we must understand that the b8-knight belongs on c6 in this position, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. }
10. O-O c5
{ As per our standard plan, getting ready to meet Ne5 with ...Nc6. White still has to justify the poor placement of his dark-squared bishop. }
11. Ne5
{ White also continues with his standard plan of establishing the knight on e5. }
11... Nc6 { By keeping an eye on the d4-pawn we destabilize the knight on e5. }
12. a3
{ An interesting choice by GM Bluebaum. He played it against Vidit in the FIDE Grand Swiss 2019. In this game, he got nothing out of the opening, and three days later vs. Alekseenko in the same tournament he opted for  12.Be1  , which is our mainline. Staying non-committal White waits for Black to show some plan. }
12... Bd6
{ In the 8.Bd3 line we had the exact same position with White's pawn being on a2. Vidit claims that there is no difference in this case, and I totally agree with him. Although strictly speaking Black could just as well make some waiting moves like   12...a6  and ask White to show his plan. This is the computer's first choice. I like Vidit's move more from a human perspective. It is easy to remember and seems pretty direct. }
13. Ng4
{ 13.f4  , like in every other variation, runs into  13...cxd4  , and White is unable to stop the ...Ne4 invasion after  14.Nxc6  Bxc6  . }

Black wants to take ...cxd4, but that does not work immediately due to trick  12...cxd4  13.Nxc6  Bxc6  14.Ne2  , which was mentioned in the last line. So Black first wants to provoke White into playing f4 before taking ...cxd4. White cannot maintain the knight on e5 anymore without playing f4, which is the most natural move in the position.   It is also to be noted that White does not really have special plans apart from f4. So strictly speaking, there was no need to play ...Bd6 immediately, and a move like  12...g6  would also be perfectly fine for Black.

7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time.

He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Rc1
{ A tricky move order finesse. White first stops Black from getting a setup with ...Bd6 and ...c5. To play ...c5, Black must pull back his bishop from b4, and now he cannot do put it on d6 - A cunning way of playing from the white side. White still keeps the option of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 open. First, he tries to slow down Black's plan of getting ...c5 in an ideal manner. This is White's second most popular move after 8.Bd3. }
8... Bb7
{ Taking control over the e4-square and developing the pieces most naturally. }
9. Bd3
{ Having stopped the Bd6-c5 plan successfully, White now focuses on continuing with his own plan of Bd3-O-O-Ne5 and building a kingside attack. }
9... Be7
{ Did we compromise by not playing ...Bd6 and agree to White's terms and conditions? Not at all! On the contrary, this time, we are saying that time is of utmost importance, and White has wasted a move with Rc1, which doesn't help him directly build his kingside attacking plans. Thus here we don't mind having our bishop on e7 since the moves ...c5 and ...Nc6 will happen before White can start anything on the kingside. Once again, we must understand that the b8-knight belongs on c6 in this position, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. }
10. O-O c5
{ As per our standard plan, getting ready to meet Ne5 with ...Nc6. White still has to justify the poor placement of his dark-squared bishop. }
11. Ne5
{ White also continues with his standard plan of establishing the knight on e5. }
11... Nc6 { By keeping an eye on the d4-pawn we destabilize the knight on e5. }
12. Be1
{ The most popular move in the position. White finally tries to improve his bishop's position - he is hoping for f4-Bh4 ideas in the future. He also sets a nice positional trap.   If Black goes  12...cxd4  then after  13.Nxc6  Bxc6  White has the nice intermediate move  14.Ne2  attacking the c6-bishop and playing Nxd4 next. }
12... Bd6
{ This is a direct approach and something that we should understand clearly. Black wants to take ...cxd4, but that does not work immediately due to trick  12...cxd4  13.Nxc6  Bxc6  14.Ne2  , which was mentioned in the last line. So Black first wants to provoke White into playing f4 before taking ...cxd4. White cannot maintain the knight on e5 anymore without playing f4, which is the most natural move in the position.   It is also to be noted that White does not really have special plans apart from f4. So strictly speaking, there was no need to play ...Bd6 immediately, and a move like  12...g6  would also be perfectly fine for Black. However, playing  12...Bd6  brings immediate clarity to the position, and against most of the other moves we respond with ...Bd6, so it helps to keep it simple and makes it easy to remember. }
13. Ng4
{ This idea is also quite common in this line. We will see a similar idea in the 8. Bd3 line as well. White wants to eliminate the f6-knight to increase pressure on the d5-pawn. }
13... Nxg4
{ This is an important moment. In most of the other lines  @@StartBracket@@The mainline 8.Bd3, #3 #4 for instance@@EndBracket@@ , White's Ng4 move is met by ...Ne8 with the idea to chase the g4-knight later with ...f5 or ...h5.   Here if we try the same we will notice there is a minute difference:  13...Ne8  14.Nxd5  h5  15.Ne5  Bxe5  16.dxe5  , and now Black is unable to take  16...Qxd5  due to  17.Bh7+  and Black loses the queen. This was possible for White since his bishop is on e1 and not on d2. It is a small difference that Black should keep in mind.   True, even in the abovementioned line, Black can play  16...Nxe5  @@StartBracket@@ instead of  16...Qxd5  @@EndBracket@@  and the game remain dynamically balanced. However, with the bishop being placed on e1 currently, Black has a much stronger response in hand. }
14. Qxg4 cxd4 15. exd4 f5
{ A move that works only with the bishop on e1. We will soon see the reason for that. }
16. Bxf5 Nxd4
{ Usually this combination does not work as White wins a pawn after Bxh7+ next. }
17. Bxh7+ Kxh7 18. Qxd4 Ba6
{ Finally, we get to see the deep point of the combination. The bishop that is oddly placed on e1 traps White's rook, and there is nothing White can do to avoid losing an exchange. }
19. Nxd5
{ This is clearly the best bet for White, giving up the exchange and trying to get some compensation. }
19... Bxf1 20. Kxf1 Qg5
{ Materially speaking the position is even, but if we look at the piece activity it becomes clear that Black has the upper hand. White must take care of his c1-rook and Black will bring the a8-rook into the game by playing ...Rae8 next. Black's king is pretty safe and no piece can create any serious threat while White's king, on the other hand, could get into some danger when Black brings his a8-rook into play. }

{ The entire point of luring White to play f4 before taking ...cxd4. The same position with the pawn on f2 would be a completely different story. Currently White must take care of his e3-pawn and he has no time to get his bishop to h4 either. }
17. Qf3 Qe7
{ To save the e3 pawn, White must either compromise his knight's position by playing Nc2 or forget about getting his bishop to h4 and play Bf2/Bd2. In either case, Black gets the upper hand since the weakness of e3 is much more prominent than the weakness of d5. }

{ I have a close connection to this line from its modern inception at the GM level. My childhood friend Sandipan Chanda's last 41 games against the Nimzo went like this. I think we can safely call him the expert of this line from the white side. Inspired by him, I have also played a few games as White in this line. When Sandipan started playing this line back in 2014-2015 exclusively; there were not many games at the top level.   As mentioned in the 4. Bd2 variation, Sandipan was in a way inspired by GM Stern's play in this system and then revived the move order. In the last few years, the theory has exploded, and thanks to the new engines and the trend set by some top players, this line has reached new heights.

The line's history has already been discussed in the 4.Bd2 line, so I won't repeat that.I wanted to devote an entire chapter to this line explaining its subtle move order and ideas to the readers as this line is becoming super trendy. It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details.

{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time.

7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Bd3

Black wants to play ...c5 and thus pulls back his bishop from b4, keeping the d2-bishop inactive and making sure his own bishop on d6 will remain very active. As we know, White's main plan is to get his knight to e5 and push f4. By starting with   8...Bd6  , Black intends to play ...Re8 next which would stop all White's attacking plans. Note that without the move Ne5 White has no hope to create any kingside attacking plans.Black could also start with  8...Re8  with the same idea, but I like 8... Bd6 more for two simple reasons. First of all, Black can keep the option open of playing either ...c5 or ...Re8. Also, White can stop ...Bd6 next by playing  9.Rc1  to meet  9...Bd6  with  10.Nb5  .

{ The typical play in this system. We bring our knight to c6, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. Especially the d4-pawn becomes weak. The moment White plays f4, we will then take on d4, forcing White to give up his e5-knight for the c6-knight to save the d4 pawn. First, we would like White to play f4 before taking on d4. We achieve that by directly attacking the e5-knight. }
12. Ng4
{ This is a cunning move. Seeing that he won't be able to keep the knight on e5, White decides to exchange the knight, but not for the c6-knight; for the f6-knight instead. This is clever as the f6-knight plays a vital role in protecting our d5-pawn and controlling the key e4-square. }

However, I would still recommend the move 12... Ne8 which is much stronger and has a hidden threat. We have already seen a similar position with the extra move a3 in the game Bluebaum vs. Vidit. By playing 12...Ne8 Black wants to play ...f5 next, trapping the knight on g4. The same could have been achieved by playing  12...Nd7  , but unfortunately, that turns out to be a blunder. The famous game Wei Yi vs. Karjakin from Jerusalem GP 2019  (is a classic example of that where White found the refutation over the board. It is a very long combination, and I urge all the readers to sharpen their tactical skills by trying to figure out the details after)  12...Nd7  13.Nh6+  . Once you are done with the exercise, then later, you can look for this fantastic game mentioned above. To sum it up, by playing 12...Ne8, we keep the same threat of ...f5 but avoid the Nh6+ combination that does not work for White with a black knight on e8 instead of d7. }

{ The above-mentioned combination of Wei Yi vs. Karjakin does not work here because after  13.Nh6+?  gxh6  14.Qg4+  Black has the simple  14...Ng7  killing White's attack after which Black is just a piece up. 13.Nxd5 is definitely the move that one should first consider when playing 12...Ne8. After all, we are giving up a central pawn. }
13... h5
{ Suddenly the knight on  g4  is actually trapped as  14.Ne5  can be answered with  14...Bxe5  and the d5-knight falls. White has a few ways to sacrifice the knight, but everything loses for him. }
14. Nh6+
{ 14.dxc5  Bxc5  And both knights are hanging and Black will pick up one of them. By playing 14.Nh6+ White tries to create some kind of kingside attack. }
14... gxh6 15. Qxh5 Qg5
{ Without this resource White's attack could have been devastating, but Black has everything well planned. With this move he not only protects everything but also chases away White's queen. White remains a piece down for nothing and a completely hopeless position remains for him. }

{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time.

7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Bd3
{ White follows with the most human-looking move. He plans a slow kingside attack and, to start with, gets his bishop on the best possible square. White can start with  8.Ne5  but after  8...Bb7  9.Bd3  Bd6  both  10.O-O  c5  and @@StartFEN@@rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p1b1n2/3pN3/3P4/2NBP3/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 10@@EndFEN@@  10.Rc1  c5  11.O-O  would transpose to the mainline given below. }
8... Bd6
{ Out of about 300 games that reached this particular position, only less than 10 games continued with this move. In 2019-2020 it was played by Anish, Vidit, and Benjamin Bok. This shows the solidity of this line.As usual, before going a single move forward, we have to understand the reasoning behind this move. Here the plan is easy to understand. Black wants to play ...c5 and thus pulls back his bishop from b4, keeping the d2-bishop inactive and making sure his own bishop on d6 will remain very active. As we know, White's main plan is to get his knight to e5 and push f4. By starting with   8...Bd6  , Black intends to play ...Re8 next which would stop all White's attacking plans. Note that without the move Ne5 White has no hope to create any kingside attacking plans.Black could also start with  8...Re8  with the same idea, but I like 8... Bd6 more for two simple reasons. First of all, Black can keep the option open of playing either ...c5 or ...Re8. Also, White can stop ...Bd6 next by playing  9.Rc1  to meet  9...Bd6  with  10.Nb5  .    By playing @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p4/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Bd6  , Black simply avoids all such lines. Now,  9.Rc1  can be answered with  9...c5 }
9. Ne5
{ Seeing that White might not get a second chance to play Ne5 once Black plays ...Re8, White directly starts with Ne5. He is now ready to meet Re8 with f4. }
9... c5
{ White is committed to Ne5 early and this has made the d4-pawn a target. Black directly aims for that pawn. It is important to understand that our b8-knight almost always goes to c6 from where it keeps pressure on d4 and e5, and it also keeps the ...Ne7-...Ne4 ideas in mind for the future. Most importantly, we want to target the d4-pawn at the earliest to destabilize the e5-knight. }
10. O-O Bb7
{ As per the plan, Black should not allow the f4-Be1-Bh4 maneuver without compromising in the center. He is now up to speed, and before White gets his pieces to the right square Black will target the d4-pawn, forcing White to concede something. }
11. Rc1
{ This position can be reached via several move orders, and thus, it is important to analyse it carefully and understand the hidden subtleties of the position. }
11... Nc6
{ The typical play in this system. We bring our knight to c6, keeping an eye on d4 and e5. Especially the d4-pawn becomes weak. The moment White plays f4, we will then take on d4, forcing White to give up his e5-knight for the c6-knight to save the d4 pawn. First, we would like White to play f4 before taking on d4. We achieve that by directly attacking the e5-knight. }
12. Ng4
{ This is a cunning move. Seeing that he won't be able to keep the knight on e5, White decides to exchange the knight, but not for the c6-knight; for the f6-knight instead. This is clever as the f6-knight plays a vital role in protecting our d5-pawn and controlling the key e4-square. }
12... Ne8
{ A counter-intuitive brilliant move. The most natural response would have been to take the knight with  12...Nxg4  and after  13.Qxg4  g6  Black is doing fine. However, I would still recommend the move 12... Ne8 which is much stronger and has a hidden threat. We have already seen a similar position with the extra move a3 in the game Bluebaum vs. Vidit. By playing 12...Ne8 Black wants to play ...f5 next, trapping the knight on g4. The same could have been achieved by playing  12...Nd7  , but unfortunately, that turns out to be a blunder. The famous game Wei Yi vs. Karjakin from Jerusalem GP 2019 is a classic example of that where White found the refutation over the board. It is a very long combination, and I urge all the readers to sharpen their tactical skills by trying to figure out the details after  12...Nd7  13.Nh6+  . Once you are done with the exercise, then later, you can look for this fantastic game mentioned above. To sum it up, by playing 12...Ne8, we keep the same threat of ...f5 but avoid the Nh6+ combination that does not work for White with a black knight on e8 instead of d7. }
13. f4 { Renewing the threat of Nxd5. } 13... f5
{ Once and for all, Black takes care of White's kingside project. Now nothing can scare Black on the kingside and in the center. The main diagonal is blocked, and the bishop on d3 becomes useless. }
14. Ne5 cxd4
{ Precise play. Black forces White to take on c6 to save the d4-pawn. } 15.
Nxc6 Bxc6 16. exd4 Qd7
{ The structure remains similar. Now the battle could be which knight will reach the golden central square faster, and we can see that there is no ace on that subject. Black will play ...Nf6 and ...Ne4 much faster than White will get his knight to e5. The computer still calls it equal but I think Black is more equal than White. :- @@EndBracket@@ }

10... Bb7 11. Qc2
{ Threatening to play both e4 and Nb5. Black should now play with an equal amount of energy and slow down White's play. }
11... Na6
{ A multi-purpose move! Black protects the c7-pawn, so Nb5 is no longer a threat as we can then play ...Bf8. White is not in time to play e4 currently as he must first take care of the threat of ...Nb4.   Playing:  11...c5  would not be ideal as after  12.dxc5  bxc5  the move  13.e4  could be annoying. Compared to the 10.Qc2 c5 line the inclusion of Re1 and ...Bb7 becomes clear in this line, since after  13...c4  White can play  14.e5  , when the pawn is protected by the e1-rook. Hence we start with ...Na6 first. }
12. a3 c5
{ Right on time! Before White can break in the center Black has managed to strike first. The Nb5 issue has been solved - it can always be answered with ...Bf8. The only question that remains is whether White can still play e4 or not. }
13. e4 cxd4 14. Nxd5
{ 14.Nxd4  dxe4  leads to a mass liquidation after which the position fizzles out completely. }
14... Rc8
{ Black brings his last piece into the game with tempo. ...Nc5 is coming next, and White has nothing to claim for an advantage. The d4-pawn might look weak but there is no way to make use of it. The d5-knight is under attack, and if White takes on f6 Black's queen will add to the protection of the d4-pawn. By bringing his knight to c5, Black keeps an eye on the d3-bishop, which promises him ample counterplay. }

{ I have a close connection to this line from its modern inception at the GM level. My childhood friend Sandipan Chanda's last 41 games against the Nimzo went like this. I think we can safely call him the expert of this line from the white side. Inspired by him, I have also played a few games as White in this line. When Sandipan started playing this line back in 2014-2015 exclusively; there were not many games at the top level.   As mentioned in the 4. Bd2 variation, Sandipan was in a way inspired by GM Stern's play in this system and then revived the move order. In the last few years, the theory has exploded, and thanks to the new engines and the trend set by some top players, this line has reached new heights. GM Bluebaum picked up this line during 2019-2020 and has already played about 50 games with it  @@StartBracket@@although most of them were online!@@EndBracket@@ Top players like Caruana, Grischuk, Yu Yangi have also tried it recently.

The line's history has already been discussed in the 4.Bd2 line, so I won't repeat that.I wanted to devote an entire chapter to this line explaining its subtle move order and ideas to the readers as this line is becoming super trendy. It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger. Hence we will pay full attention to this rapidly developing line and try to understand all the minute details.

{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }

{ Black has unpinned himself and White is unable to stop Black from getting in ...Ne4 eventually. The knight on a3 finally starts to show its worth.

Black wants to play ...c5 and thus pulls back his bishop from b4, keeping the d2-bishop inactive and making sure his own bishop on d6 will remain very active.

Note that without the move Ne5 White has no hope to create any kingside attacking plans.Black could also start with  8...Re8  with the same idea, but I like 8... Bd6 more for two simple reasons.

It also stops the vital threat of e4. }
10. Qc2

{ Vidit opted for the move  10...Ba6  , aiming to exchange bishops. However, the problems on the half-open c-file and issues on the queenside remain the same. In the game, White had slight pressure, and after a lot of dramatic moments, Vidit managed to wrest the win. I like 10....c5 more because it directly stops c4, and we are also ready to meet Nb5 with ...Bf8. It is important that White is unable to play e4 here tactically. }
11. e4
{ Other than this move, White would not be able to justify his Qc2 move.   11.Nb5  Bf8  is welcomed by Black where the position of White's queen on c2 makes no sense, and her majesty will soon become an obligation once Black's rook comes to the c-file. }

The knight on d2 is misplaced, and it won't come to its ideal square e5 as Black will be on time to stop it with ...Nc6. Black thus has a comfortable position. }

{ Anish played the correct move in the 2020 Skilling Open. The reason why Vidit's 10...a6 is inaccurate is obvious from the 9.Ne5 line that we saw above. The inclusion of Rc1 and ...a6 favors White massively. He won't have to sacrifice the bishop on c7 as we saw in the 9.Ne5 line, because here it will be protected by the rook on c1.

15... exd3
{ Black gives up the exchange, which would have been impossible with the pawn still on c7, since after 16.Bxe5 it would be difficult to stop the threats of Qf3 and Bxc7/Rxc7. }
16. Bxe5 Qd5
{ Here comes the main difference. There is no hanging pawn on c7 and Black takes over the initiative completely. The d3-pawn becomes a monster and with ...Bb7 and ...Nc6 coming there is very little White can do to save the game. ...Bb7 also comes with a tempo, and in the current position White has to waste another tempo to save the e5-bishop.

As we know, White's main plan is to get his knight to e5 and push f4. By starting with   8...Bd6  , Black intends to play ...Re8 next which would stop all White's attacking plans. Note that without the move Ne5 White has no hope to create any kingside attacking plans.Black could also start with  8...Re8  with the same idea, but I like 8... Bd6 more for two simple reasons. First of all, Black can keep the option open of playing either ...c5 or ...Re8. Also, White can stop ...Bd6 next by playing  9.Rc1  to meet  9...Bd6  with  10.Nb5  .

9. O-O
{ 9 games out of 10 went this way. White has made the most obvious move once again: castling first before taking any measures on the center and kingside. }
9... Re8
{ Vidit had this position thrice in 2020. Once with the Re8-Bd6 move order and twice with the Bd6-Re8 move order, #1 #2. Anish also got this position in November 2020 as Black via the Bd6-Re8 move order. The idea of 9... Re8 is transparent. Black stops Ne5 first before taking any decision on the queenside. It also stops the vital threat of e4. }
10. Rc1
{ We have seen a similar Rc1 move earlier as well. We meet Rc1 with the active ...c5 once we have played ...Bd6. On the same day of 24 Nov 2020, Anish opted for 10...c5 while Vidit played 10...a6. Vidit's move had a clear flaw, which was demonstrated in his game against Anton Guijarro. Strategically speaking, Vidit's move is good, but it has a tactical issue which we should be aware of. }
10... c5
{ Anish played the correct move in the 2020 Skilling Open. The reason why Vidit's 10...a6 is inaccurate is obvious from the 9.Ne5 line that we saw above. The inclusion of Rc1 and ...a6 favors White massively. He won't have to sacrifice the bishop on c7 as we saw in the 9.Ne5 line, because here it will be protected by the rook on c1.  Therefore it is important to understand that White was actually threatening Nb5 and e4 both by playing 9. Rc1. Now, after 10... c5 it is difficult for White to come up with a good plan. Black has managed to stop Ne5 @@StartBracket@@we will see below why this does not work@@EndBracket@@ and got ...c5 in while he is also ready to meet  11.Nb5  with  11...Bf8  .  White's bishop on d2 remains passive, and there is no clear plan for White to activate that piece. The ball is in White's court, and we will see a couple of different tries by White. }
11. Nb5
{ White desperately wants to get his knight to e5. Thus he tries to dislodge the d6-bishop first. }
11... Bf8
{ Black tucks in the bishop all the way to f8 and allows White to play Ne5. White has already made a concession. He kept his knight on b5, which is far from the action area and soon will become an obligation, as we will witness in the coming variation. }
12. Ne5 Bb7
{ The knight belongs to c6 to keep an eye on the d4-pawn. Black focuses on that and ignores White's kingside plans. His point is that the assault on the center will be faster than White's slow attacking plan on the kingside. }
13. f4 Nc6
{ The knight on b5 protects the d4-pawn for now, but it can be kicked away at any time. This knight actually belongs to e2 to protect the d4-pawn and create some kingside aggression with Ng3-Nf5. That dream is not going to get fulfilled in this position for sure. That also means there is not a single good way for White to maintain the center. The plan of Be1-Bh4 is just one move too slow. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
14. Be1
{ White just needs one move to have the better position. If he gets in Bh4 Black will be in grave danger. In chess, we play one move each, and that will make all the difference in this position. }
14... a6 15. Nc3 cxd4
{ Black clarifies the situation in the center before White can start a kingside attack. }
16. Nxc6
{ The main asset is gone in order to protect the d4-pawn. Now before White can pin the f6-knight, it will jump to e4. }
16... Bxc6 17. exd4 Ne4
{ Black was on time to plant his knight on  e4  , and White is left with no attack on the kingside. The e4-square remains weak while the tactics favor Black here, as in the line  18.Nxe4  dxe4  19.Rxc6  runs into  19...Qxd4+  and Black picks up the  d3  bishop. Black stays clearly better as White created too many weaknesses without getting any compensation in return. }

It is easier to play from the white side where not a lot of memory work is involved, and if Black is unaware of where to put his pieces or underestimate this seemingly harmless-looking line, he could be in real danger.

7. cxd5
{ White was waiting for Black to play ...b6, and only then would he take on d5. The reasoning is simple. Once Black has played ...b6, after the exchange on d5, playing ...c6 will not be easy. So now White doesn't mind opening up the c8-h3 diagonal. On the other hand, Black is willing to give this concession, and he claims that White's d2-bishop will be bad for a long time. Strategically speaking Black is doing fine. He will now exploit the placement of the d2-bishop.   7.Rc1  Bb7  8.cxd5  exd5  transposes into  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Rc1  lines, while  7.Be2  dxc4  8.Bxc4  transposes to the 7.Bd3 line. }
7... exd5
{ Our first moment to take a break and understand what has changed with this new pawn structure. White gave Black a tough choice on deciding where to develop his c8-bishop. Developing the bishop to f5 or g4 looks active, but it can weaken the c6-square permanently. This is something that Black must take care of. The same applies if Black wants to exchange the bishop with ...Ba6. Keeping the bishop on b7 takes care of the c6-square but makes the bishop inactive.  However, Black has his own advantages too. He is saying, what about the d2-bishop? I will not take on c3 anymore, and I will preserve my dark-squared bishop and observe how exactly the bishop on d2 comes into play. A typical plan for Black to develop would be to play Bb7-c5-Nc6, but before playing ...c5, Black must pull back his b4-bishop.  The position is far more complex than this simple explanation. White has a vicious cunning plan of attacking the kingside! It is a long-term plan but extremely effective, especially if Black is unaware of it. I have seen Sandipan winning numerous games almost without effort. By the time Black understands the idea of White, it could be too late. White wants to go Bd3-O-O-Ne5 to start with. This he can do with or without including Rc1. Then he would like to get either Qf3-Qh3 or f4-Qf3/g4 or f4-Be1-Bh4. Each of these plans is fatal and equally strong. What does Black have in return then? Black will simply not allow all of this with impunity. Now, let us see how Black should respond to White's long-term attacking plans by playing sensible and easy-to-understand moves. }
8. Bd3
{ White follows with the most human-looking move. He plans a slow kingside attack and, to start with, gets his bishop on the best possible square.

We can stick to the same plan, which we will execute in the line 6. e3. It is very strategic, and nothing can go wrong here. }

I want to make sure that you don't miss this explanation because moves are not as important as such anymore. It is all about the strategy and plan. So here it is:White has the bishop pair but a broken pawn structure. His advantage of the two bishops will flourish only once the position gets opened up. Where can he open the position? The queenside is deadlocked. Only the b-file is open, but Black can easily take care of his b-pawn. White can try a4, but Black would answer ...a5. Once again, it will be locked down. So the breaks happen on the kingside through f4 and an attack on Black's king.So now we are getting to the main issue. It is all about the placement of the king! Let us ask ourselves where the king is ideal where it cannot be touched easily, and we will also be able to block White's evil plan of opening up the kingside. It becomes all clear now. Our king, at the first opportunity, should walk towards the queenside. That can be achieved either by playing Kd7-Kc7 or Qe7-Kd8-Kc7. Once the king arrives on c7, he can never be attacked. Most importantly, once our king reaches c7, we will slowly but surely plan and open up the kingside where White's king would be hiding. So in one shot, Black solves two major issues: his own king's safety and preventing White from opening up the kingside. }
11. Bd3 Kc7 12. Ne2 Nh5
{ Black's king is super safe, and White cannot open on either side. Black is in the driving seat and can dictate the game. The bishop on g3 is dead, and so is the bishop on d3. The knight on e2 does not have a good square either. We will answer a4 with ...a5 typically blocking the queenside. Our knight will soon jump to f4, and slowly we will build on the kingside. White has a tough strategic position. }

White counter pins the f6-knight in response to Black's ...Bb4 pinning the c3-knight. }
4... c5
{ Black strikes in the center, allowing a Benoni-type of structure. Here White must play d5 if he is ambitious. With d5, White gains more space, and the debate then becomes if White's space advantage will be enough to match Black's counterplay. }
5. d5
{ Clearly, the main move, fighting for the initiative.   5.Nf3  O-O  would transpose to the mainline of this chapter which begins with 4. Nf3. }
5... d6 6. e3
{ The main move. After gaining enough space in the center, White focuses on finishing development on the kingside.   6.Nf3  exd5  7.cxd5  O-O  would transpose to the mainline that begins with:   @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  O-O  5.Bg5  6.Qc2  exd5  7.cxd5  O-O  transposes to the chapter:Nimzo  4.Qc2  O-O  5th moves. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This sidesteps a lot of theory starting with  6...exd5  7.cxd5  Nbd7  . The lines are long and complex. Black can play that if he wants to, but the line I am suggesting here is a lot easier to play, and it is based on a fine strategy that won't require any long lines. Most importantly, it will come as shocking for White players without a doubt. To start with, we double White's pawn structure. }
7. bxc3 h6 8. Bh4
{ White already has the worse pawn structure, so to keep something in return he must keep the bishops at least. After  8.Bxf6  Qxf6  White has no compensation for his pawn defects. }
8... e5
{ Black closes the center. This is nothing new so far; thousands of games have reached this position. The nature of the position is strategic, and nothing immediate is going to happen. I am suggesting a fresh plan. It is definitely not very popular since, at first sight, the plan is not obvious.   Let us try to understand the subtleties in the position. Once we get that, the play will be effortless as the move order does not matter much.White has the bishop pair but a broken pawn structure. His advantage of the two bishops will flourish only once the position gets opened up. Where can he open the position? The queenside is deadlocked. Only the b-file is open, but Black can easily take care of his b-pawn. White can try a4, but Black would go ...a5. Once again, it will be locked down. So the breaks happen on the kingside through f4. Black can play ...g5 but then where does he put his king?   So now we are getting to the main question. It is all about the placement of the king! Let us ask ourselves where the king is ideal - where it cannot be touched easily, and we will also be able to block White's evil plan of opening up the kingside. It all becomes clear now. Our king, at first chance, should walk towards the queenside. We play ...g5 and create a safe place for our king on c7!! That can be achieved either by playing Kd7-Kc7 or Qe7-Kd8-Kc7.   Once the king arrives on c7, it can never be attacked. Most importantly, once our king reaches c7, we will slowly but surely plan and open up the kingside where White's king would be hiding. So in one shot, Black solves two major issues. His own king safety and preventing White from opening up the kingside. }
9. f3
{ White wants to play f4 eventually. For this, he needs his knight on e2 and the bishop on d3. Playing  9.Bd3  first allows  9...e4  .  So White first stops ...e4 to play Bd3-Ne2 next. }
9... g5 10. Bg3
{ The bishop has to be here to be ready to meet Black's ...e4 with f4. } 10...
Kd7
{ Those who read the explanations after 8...e5 will not frown at this move. It's a brilliant strategy by Black. The king is heading for the safest place on the board: the c7-square. }
11. Bd3 Kc7
{ Look at our shield on c5. If only White could play b4 and break the shield, he would succeed in attacking. We made sure no such thing could ever happen by taking on c3 well in advance. White can try to play a4-a5, but it will be in vain as Black will always respond to White's a4 by playing ...a5 himself. Later once Black plays Nbd7-b6, there will be again no entry on the queenside.Wait, but if we play a5, we will weaken the b5-square, right? What if White puts his knight on b5? Hmm, an interesting thought. Let us see how the g1-knight can get to b5!! After one light year when the knight finally manages to reach the a3-square with Einstein's imagination we will calmly play Ba6/Bd7 and stop his plan. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
12. Ne2 Qe7
{ It should be noted that the move order in this line doesn't really matter. The concept is more important. Remember to play ...a5 as soon as White plays a4 and Black will do excellently. Where is White going to put his king now? That is a problem White has to solve. }
13. a4
{ White could castle short, but after a move like ...Nbd7 soon Black would play h5-h4-Nh5, and there is not a single decent plan that looks attractive for White. }
13... a5 14. Rb1 { Trying to create some imaginary attack on the queenside. }
14... Ra6
{ We are waiting for White to castle so that we can go h5-h4. If White plays h4 himself, then we go ...Rg8 and put pressure on the g2-pawn. I really don't know what I can suggest for White. His position looks pretty difficult to play. Even computers are getting outplayed at times here. Black will play ...Nbd7 if White waits. He can also bring his f6-knight to g7 to facilitate ...f5 ideas. As soon as White goes O-O we start on the kingside with h5-h4. I like Black's position - it is easy to play, and there is not much to remember. It is all about understanding. }

5... c5 6. d5
{ White takes play into a Benoni-type structure. It is immediately visible that compared to the typical Benoni Black has made more useful moves than White. It will take three more moves for White to castle and Black can create more than enough counterplay by then. }
6... exd5 7. cxd5 d6 8. e3 Bg4
{ This move is as of yet unheard of at the GM level. While preparing this line, I felt that this avoids all sorts of computerized lines where Black grabs a pawn on d5 or c3, and White goes for huge compensation. The traditional theory continues with:   8...Nbd7  9.Bd3  h6  10.Bh4  and now either Black takes the c3-pawn with  10...Qa5  11.O-O  Bxc3  or goes for the d5-pawn with  10...Nb6  when the game gets equally complicated after  11.O-O  or  11.e4  . These lines are doable for Black, but it gets out of control, and one can run into deep preparation. The move 8... Bg4 takes care of everything, and Black gets easy play without having to worry about coming under attack for grabbing a pawn. }
9. Be2
{ 9.h3  Bxf3  Black welcomes  10.Qxf3  as after  10...Nbd7  the threat of ...Qa5 becomes deadly.   White can take  10.gxf3  , but after  10...h6  11.Bh4  Nbd7  I don't see how White can take advantage of the g-file while Black threatens to play ...Qa5 and continues his attacking plans there. }
9... Nbd7 10. O-O h6 11. Bh4 Re8
{ By playing ...Bg4 Black in a way forced White to play Be2. Now the important square e4 is controlled by Black very nicely, and it is not clear how White can ever get in e3-e4. The bishop on b4 can at any moment eliminate the c3-knight, which is White's only hope to help him play e4. The knight on f6 also controls e4 as the pin is ineffective since Black can anytime unpin himself with ...g5 if needed.   12.Nb5  does not help either as Black responds with  12...Qb8  and  13.Bg3  is well answered by  13...Ne4  . Black can continue his plans on the queenside with a6-b5, while for White, playing e4 does not look like an easy task.With some subtle move orders, Black managed to avoid long lines with huge complications and yet got a fine position. I would play this any time in a tournament game rather than get into long theoretical lines to defend precisely in order not to be mated. }

9. cxd5 Bxc3+
{ I am willing to go as far as to give this move an exclamation mark when no one has ever tried it at a high level despite a significant amount of games reaching this position. The move order is of the utmost importance here. Black can take on c3, take on d5 and play ...g5, and all of these are possible in every possible permutation and combination.   The main move has been  9...g5  when the game continues  10.Bg3  Qxd5  when White starts sacrificing material with  11.e3  Qxa2  12.Qc2  or  12.Bd3  etc. Several high-level games continued in this way, and that line holds for Black. I have checked it with the best of the machines and have done a lot of work in that area - Black is fine there. But then I asked myself: would I play this line as Black in a tournament game? What has Black done wrong so far that he won't have a simpler solution and must remember many computerized crazy lines to make a draw? Magnus played this twice as White against So and Ding. These games show how difficult it is for Black to hold against such an attack in a practical game.

For now, we want to eliminate the deadly d4-knight. If that knight moves then first we trade queens and only then take on c3. The advantage of keeping the knight on e4 and not taking on c3 will be clear in the mainline of this variation. }

I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation.

Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }

Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Bd3
{ A very natural move which controls the center. White wants to finish his development and castle. If he is allowed to do that with impunity he can claim a slight edge. }
7... O-O
{ Now after  8.Nge2  White is just one move away from castling and getting an excellent position. But then again, chess is all about these important one move details. Here is a small exercise for those who want to train their tactical skills. Pause the MoveTrainer and try to find a way for Black to stop White from getting what he wants after  8.Nge2  . }
8. Ne2 bxc4 { The first step towards breaking the center. } 9. Bxc4 Nxd5
{ There is nothing wrong with starting with  9...exd5  either. I like  9...Nxd5  more because here  10.exd5  simply loses after  10...Qh4+  picking up the bishop on c4. In the case of  10.Bxd5  we transpose to the mainline that can be reached via both 9...Nxd5 and 9...exd5. }
10. Bxd5 exd5 11. Qxd5
{ At first sight, it looks like Black has blundered since he is going to lose the a8-rook. That is a fact. However, once White takes the rook on a8 his queen will perish as well. }
11... Be6 { We insist that White takes on a8. } 12. Qxa8
{ Accepting the challenge. } 12... Qb6
{ This queen on a8 is dead no matter what. ...Nc6 is unavoidable. } 13. O-O Nc6
14. Qxf8+ Kxf8
{ White has two rooks for the queen so he should be doing fine, materially speaking. His main problem is the coordination of his pieces. Black's knight will come to d3 via e5. White would love to stop Black from playing ...c4+ and rather play  15.Be3  right away to stop that. This, however, opens up another tempting square for Black's knight, as it will then come to c4 via e5, attacking both e3 and b2.The computer calls Black's position better already. We shall go a bit deeper to understand the reasoning.  Also an idea like ...Bc4 pinning the e2-knight is possible. White's next move is in a way forced. }
15. Nf4
{ Gaining control over the d3-square and aiming at the e6-bishop simultaneously. Above all White is threatening to install a knight on d5. }
15... Bxc3 { No more Nd5 business. } 16. Nxe6+ fxe6 17. bxc3 c4+
{ To make White's king weaker and gain control over the d3-square which now belongs to our knight. }
18. Kh1 Ne5
{ Our knight will come to d3 soon. White cannot gain control over the b-file as when he moves the c1-bishop this can be answered either or both with ...Nd3 and ...Qb2. Black keeps the initiative. }

17. Rd1 Ne5
{ Once again White is a bit tied down. If he moves his c1-bishop Black will enter with ...Qb2, when at absolute best White can hope for some repetition of moves by keeping the bishop on d2 and attacking our queen with the a1-rook. White can try to improve his king's position by playing Kh1 but so can we. Ideally we would like to play ...h6, ...Kg8 and ...Kh7 and wait for White to show his plan.White's main problem is that all of his pieces are stuck in a way. The bishop on c1 is stuck due to the ...Qb2 invasion. The knight on f4 cannot move as it must stop Black from playing ...Nd3. The a1-rook doesn't have a square. An idea like Rd2-Rb2 immediately runs into ...Qa5 when White is obliged to put his bishop on b2, after which Black can plan a timely ...Nc4. Stockfish gives a big advantage to Black, while Lc0 thinks Black is just slightly better. I will go with Leela's evaluation here. }

{ White was planning mass exchanges by taking on d5. Our knight is very strong on d5, and we don't want to lose that asset yet. }
11. bxc3 O-O
{ White remains one pawn up, but I don't see any upside in his position. None of his pieces are developed. The king is exposed in the center. ...Re8 is coming. The position reminds me of some of Morphy's games from the 19th century. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. dxe6
{ Not a very popular move from the white side as it involves a substantial amount of risk. However, we must know how to respond to this variation since play becomes very concrete and complicated soon. White will directly attack the d6-pawn by playing Bf4 next. }

{ Preventing e5 and renewing the threat of ...dxe4. Comparing our pieces with White's pieces will suffice to say that White will have a tough time. First of all, it is not clear how he will deal with the threat of ...dxe4, and on top of that, Black is going to bring more force on the e4-pawn with ...O-O and ...Re8 soon. }

{ White is being really greedy, ignoring development completely and going for material only like they used to play in the 19th century. }
10... Qb6
{ Black, on the other hand, is developing all his pieces with every single move. Now ...Rd8 is a serious threat that will force White to play e5, and then our f6-knight will get a juicy square on d5 from where it keeps an eye on c3 and is ready to jump to e3. }
11. Bf4
{ White creates a double threat. He wants to exchange queens by playing Qd6 and is also planning to play Be3 to take control over the important a7-g1 diagonal, which will make it easier for him to castle kingside. }
11... c4
{ This stops both threats mentioned above and opens up the important a7-g1 diagonal for the queen, which prevents White from castling. If White chases the b4-bishop, it can come to the beautiful c5-square attacking the g1-knight. Black can think about playing ...a6 soon and develop all of his pieces, while White currently has no clue how to develop or castle. Material doesn't really count here. Black is clearly better. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5

The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4

6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. dxe6
{ Not a very popular move from the white side as it involves a substantial amount of risk. However, we must know how to respond to this variation since play becomes very concrete and complicated soon. White will directly attack the d6-pawn by playing Bf4 next. }
7... Bxe6
{ Of course, we want to take with the bishop and develop another piece towards the center. }
8. Bf4
{ That was the idea behind 7. dxe6. White directly goes for the d6-pawn. } 8...
O-O
{ We are looking at White's kingside army and the king in the center. From that perspective, this is the most natural way to play. We are ready to sacrifice material as long as it gives us rapid development and an attack. }
9. Qxd6
{ The most critical move. White gets the pawn and offers a queen exchange. }
9... Qa5
{ With White's king stuck in the center there is no way Black is going to trade queens. }
10. Ne2 Bxc4
{ It might be tempting to play  10...Rd8  , but that immediately allows a queen trade with  11.Qc7  . For now, we just take back the pawn and ask White to show us how he is going to castle. }
11. a3
{ Here  11.Qc7  made no sense as Black can decline the queen trade offer by playing  11...Qa6  . White queen on  c7  will be even more vulnerable. White now ruthlessly goes for the b4-bishop. Next, he wants to unpin the  a3  pawn by moving the rook from  a1  , which will force Black to take on  c3  . This is something that we want to avoid. }
11... Na6
{ A lovely move. Developing another piece with a threat. Black takes control over the  c7  square and now finally threatens to play  Rad8  making White's queen's life miserable. The obviously tempting and greedy  11...Bxe2  doesn't lead anywhere after  12.Bxe2  Bxc3  13.bxc3  Qxc3  14.Kf2  . That would give White a safe king, double bishop, and connected rooks while Black's knight on a6 will be hanging, and his other knight will remain out of the game. }
12. Bg5 { Creating an escape route for his queen. } 12... Bxe2
{ Why do we take on e2 when just one move before we said we don't want to give up our bishops? Well, we are not going to give up the bishops. 11...Na6 has another subtle idea, which we will witness now. }
13. Bxf6 { White can and should force the draw with this move. } 13... gxf6 14.
Bxe2
{ 14.Qxf6  Bxf1  would have lead to a perpetual with  15.Qg5+  Kh8  16.Qf6+  etc. }
14... Bxc3+ 15. bxc3 Qxc3+ 16. Kf2 Rad8
{ This time we are the ones who will force the perpetual. } 17. Qxa6
{ Otherwise Black remains a pawn up. } 17... Qd4+ 18. Kg3 Rd6
{ The final touch. Now the rook joins the attack. } 19. Qxb5 f5
{ Rg6 is a deadly threat. The a1-rook plays a vital role for Black in this combination. If White now plays  20.h3  , then after  20...Rg6  21.Kh2  Qe5!  White can't return to g1 as the a1-rook hangs! So, first, he has to take care of the a1-rook! }
20. Rad1 f4+
{ When I first saw this position I could not believe that  20...Rg6+  21.Kf4!  wins for White. But it is what it is. No matter how tempting 20... Rg6+ looks, we have to settle for a draw here. }
21. Kxf4 Rf6+ 22. Kg3 Rg6+ { Ending in perpetual check. } *

{ The only move, but this was part of White's plan when he played 9. Nf4. Now that Black has clearly shown that he has no intention of breaking open the center, White claims that he can play slowly with Ng3 and then take the c4-pawn and build up a kingside attack with O-O and f4. }
9... Nbd7

10... h5
{ Let us not forget that we have not castled yet! This gives us the liberty to counterattack right away on the kingside where White wants to build up an attack. Thanks to the pin on the h-file, White cannot maintain the pawn on g4 by playing  11.h3  .  Thus he is now obliged to go for 11. g5. }
11. g5 Nh7 { White must now waste another tempo to protect the g5-pawn. } 12.

{ This is the main move in this position. White is aiming for quick development and trying to immediately crush Black with the f4 break. Once again, we are happy if White wants to include the moves a3 and ...Ba5. It would just help us to get more play on the b-file. }
10... Nb6
{ As per the plan, we are not giving up the c4-pawn without a fight. It is not easy for White to further attack this pawn. Therefore he switches to a completely different plan. He will develop quickly with Be2 and O-O, play f4 as early as possible, and claim that he has a good kingside initiative. Our knight b6 is quite secure. We can meet the pawn advance a4 by playing ...a5 ourselves.   Now after  11.Be2  Black's next move is crucial. If you have not seen the move by now, I suggest pausing in this position and try to find a plan for Black. The entire line with 7.Nge2 depends on this particular plan. It is with the following idea Black stops White's entire initiative on the kingside. }

The only way to stop both would be  13.Qe2  ,  after which White's kingside is paralyzed and his king has no safe place to run to. On the other hand, now our king will be very safe on the kingside as it would take ages for White to get his rook to the half-open f-file. Black is winning here. }

That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Ne2
{ White tries to complete his development. He is still hoping to transpose into the old line with  7...O-O  8.Nf4  . However, Black has an entirely different plan in mind. }
7... bxc4
{ Capturing the c4 pawn and building up more pressure on d5. White must try to recapture the c4-pawn at the earliest before Black brings more pressure to bear on White's centre. }
8. Nf4
{ The most sensible move. In one go, White attacks the c4-pawn and brings more support to the d5-pawn. White could include  8.a3  Ba5  if he wanted to, but I don't see a single variation in which this inclusion benefits White. Only Black will have the advantage of having the bishop on a5, which was in a way blocking the b8-rook in many main lines. }
8... e5
{ Forcing White to go back to e2. White is ready to take that compromise since now he has got more space in the center. All that remains for him is to retake the c4-pawn with impunity. }
9. Ne2
{ The only move, but this was part of White's plan when he played 9. Nf4. Now that Black has clearly shown that he has no intention of breaking open the center, White claims that he can play slowly with Ng3 and then take the c4-pawn and build up a kingside attack with O-O and f4. }
9... Nbd7
{ We should not allow White to recapture the c4-pawn so easily. It is of the utmost importance to protect the pawn for now. Black is ready to play ...Nb6 and keep the extra pawn on c4. It is now White who has to prove that he has enough compensation. }
10. Ng3
{ This is the main move in this position. White is aiming for quick development and trying to immediately crush Black with the f4 break. Once again, we are happy if White wants to include the moves a3 and ...Ba5. It would just help us to get more play on the b-file. }
10... Nb6
{ As per the plan, we are not giving up the c4-pawn without a fight. It is not easy for White to further attack this pawn. Therefore he switches to a completely different plan. He will develop quickly with Be2 and O-O, play f4 as early as possible, and claim that he has a good kingside initiative. Our knight b6 is quite secure. We can meet the pawn advance a4 by playing ...a5 ourselves.   Now after  11.Be2  Black's next move is crucial. If you have not seen the move by now, I suggest pausing in this position and try to find a plan for Black. The entire line with 7.Nge2 depends on this particular plan. It is with the following idea Black stops White's entire initiative on the kingside. }
11. Be2
{ White clearly shows his hand. O-O and f4 are coming quickly. If Black castles  11...O-O  , then White will play  12.O-O  and immediately go for f4. Once the pawns are exchanged in the center, Bg5 becomes an annoying threat. The knight on f6 will be more of a burden that can come under pressure after White plays Bg5. }
11... Ng8
{ What on earth is Black thinking? White is trying to smash Black by playing a quick O-O and f4, and here Black is bringing back his pieces as if he is preparing for the next game. However, the reality is far from this seemingly obvious explanation. The weird-looking 11... Ng8 has a deep positional strategic idea. Let us try to understand it step by step.White has only one sensible break in the center/kingside, and that is f4. Once f4 happens, Black will take ...exf4, and then White's bishop will come to f4, putting pressure on the d6-pawn and threatening to pin the f6-knight with Bg5 at some point. Now with ...Ng8 Black solves many issues permanently. He realized that the knight on f6 was his main problem! This knight should be ready to come to e5 once the exchange on f4 happens.Then why didn't Black play 11...Nfd7? Well, it is important not to allow White to play Nf5. With the knight on g8, Black keeps the diagonal of the c8-bishop open, which controls the f5-square. Also, ideally, Black's knight would be great on g6 from where not only is it ready to jump to e5, but more importantly, it attacks the f4-bishop.If White doesn't play 12. f4 now, then in any case Black will get his knight to e7, and he is ready to meet f4 for the rest of the game, which is, by the way, White's only active plan in the center/on the kingside. Meanwhile, Black is a pawn up, and now the ball is in White's court. }
12. Qc2
{ In the correspondence games which were mentioned before, White played this move. It doesn't make the slightest difference in our plan, and we shall continue with the same strategy we had in mind while playing 11...Ng8. }
12... Ne7 13. O-O O-O
{ We could also get this position from a different move order starting with 12. O-O. }
14. a4 Ba5
{ A cool way to stop a5. This way Black doesn't weaken the b5 square and makes sure that on anytime Nb5 can be answered with ...a6. }
15. Nb5 Ng6
{ This position was reached twice in correspondence games. Both games ended in a draw, and Black did not have the slightest problem. White now gets back the c4-pawn, but in return, Black has established total control over f4 and soon will play ...Nf4 or ...Nh4 himself to gain more space on the kingside. His bishop on a5 stops any play on the queenside for White. White doesn't have a clear plan on either side of the board. Black has a very comfortable position and cannot complain about the outcome of the opening. }

{ Flexibility of mind is of the utmost importance in chess. The moment Black saw that White is trying to stop the ...Ne7-Ng6 plan, he switches to another plan. White has compromised his kingside position by playing h4. Now his h1-rook will be tied down to protect the h4-pawn, which means he won't be able to castle quickly.

{ Black still has an extra pawn. White's pawn on c3 is weak too. White's bishop pair gives him some compensation, but it is not enough to give any advantage. We will move our f6-knight to d5 and stabilize it with the bishop on b7 if needed. The engine calls it equal and I agree with that. A correspondence game of 2018 also confirms the same. }

If White runs to the queenside, then ...Rb8 will be especially annoying, and White must always look out for threats like ...Bxc3 followed by ...Na4. Thus apart from 14.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Ne2
{ White tries to complete his development. He is still hoping to transpose into the old line with  7...O-O  8.Nf4  . However, Black has an entirely different plan in mind. }
7... bxc4
{ Capturing the c4 pawn and building up more pressure on d5. White must try to recapture the c4-pawn at the earliest before Black brings more pressure to bear on White's centre. }
8. Nf4
{ The most sensible move. In one go, White attacks the c4-pawn and brings more support to the d5-pawn. White could include  8.a3  Ba5  if he wanted to, but I don't see a single variation in which this inclusion benefits White. Only Black will have the advantage of having the bishop on a5, which was in a way blocking the b8-rook in many main lines. }
8... e5
{ Forcing White to go back to e2. White is ready to take that compromise since now he has got more space in the center. All that remains for him is to retake the c4-pawn with impunity. }
9. Ne2
{ The only move, but this was part of White's plan when he played 9. Nf4. Now that Black has clearly shown that he has no intention of breaking open the center, White claims that he can play slowly with Ng3 and then take the c4-pawn and build up a kingside attack with O-O and f4. }
9... Nbd7
{ We should not allow White to recapture the c4-pawn so easily. It is of the utmost importance to protect the pawn for now. Black is ready to play ...Nb6 and keep the extra pawn on c4. It is now White who has to prove that he has enough compensation. }
10. Ng3
{ This is the main move in this position. White is aiming for quick development and trying to immediately crush Black with the f4 break. Once again, we are happy if White wants to include the moves a3 and ...Ba5. It would just help us to get more play on the b-file. }
10... Nb6
{ As per the plan, we are not giving up the c4-pawn without a fight. It is not easy for White to further attack this pawn. Therefore he switches to a completely different plan. He will develop quickly with Be2 and O-O, play f4 as early as possible, and claim that he has a good kingside initiative. Our knight b6 is quite secure. We can meet the pawn advance a4 by playing ...a5 ourselves.   Now after  11.Be2  Black's next move is crucial. If you have not seen the move by now, I suggest pausing in this position and try to find a plan for Black. The entire line with 7.Nge2 depends on this particular plan. It is with the following idea Black stops White's entire initiative on the kingside. }
11. Be2
{ White clearly shows his hand. O-O and f4 are coming quickly. If Black castles  11...O-O  , then White will play  12.O-O  and immediately go for f4. Once the pawns are exchanged in the center, Bg5 becomes an annoying threat. The knight on f6 will be more of a burden that can come under pressure after White plays Bg5. }
11... Ng8
{ What on earth is Black thinking? White is trying to smash Black by playing a quick O-O and f4, and here Black is bringing back his pieces as if he is preparing for the next game. However, the reality is far from this seemingly obvious explanation. The weird-looking 11... Ng8 has a deep positional strategic idea. Let us try to understand it step by step.White has only one sensible break in the center/kingside, and that is f4. Once f4 happens, Black will take ...exf4, and then White's bishop will come to f4, putting pressure on the d6-pawn and threatening to pin the f6-knight with Bg5 at some point. Now with ...Ng8 Black solves many issues permanently. He realized that the knight on f6 was his main problem! This knight should be ready to come to e5 once the exchange on f4 happens.Then why didn't Black play 11...Nfd7? Well, it is important not to allow White to play Nf5. With the knight on g8, Black keeps the diagonal of the c8-bishop open, which controls the f5-square. Also, ideally, Black's knight would be great on g6 from where not only is it ready to jump to e5, but more importantly, it attacks the f4-bishop.If White doesn't play 12. f4 now, then in any case Black will get his knight to e7, and he is ready to meet f4 for the rest of the game, which is, by the way, White's only active plan in the center/on the kingside. Meanwhile, Black is a pawn up, and now the ball is in White's court. }
12. f4
{ It is possible to break directly, but eventually, this most likely transposes to the mainline  12.O-O  . }
12... exf4
{ If White plays f4 we always take the pawn. That was the plan when we played  11... Ng8. Our knight is aiming for the g6-square. White is now obliged to take Bxf4 as13.Nh5  is met by  13...Qh4+  . }
13. Bxf4 Ne7
{ Here  14.O-O  would directly transpose to our mainline. White's king will be only safe on the kingside. In the center it is pinned by the b4-bishop, and the e-file is half-open from where Black can create some threats against the e4- and d5-pawns. If White runs to the queenside, then ...Rb8 will be especially annoying, and White must always look out for threats like ...Bxc3 followed by ...Na4. Thus apart from 14. O-O the only move that needs to be checked is 14. Nh5. }
14. Nh5 O-O
{ We will put our knight on g6, which will take care of all the attacks, so there is nothing to worry about castling short here. }
15. Qd2
{ The only independent try.  15.O-O  Ng6  would have transposed to the mainline. White is going all out for the attack on g7 by playing Bh6. }
15... Ng6
{ Now White is intending  16.Bh6!  , a beautiful move that could have forced Black's resignation if he did not have an even more brilliant move as a response.  16...gxh6?  simply leads to mate after  17.Qxh6  .  What is Black supposed to do after 16. Bh6? Well, time to pause the MoveTrainer and think for yourself. This is a good way to sharpen your tactical vision too. }
16. Bh6 Bg4
{ Pat yourself on the back if you  spotted this brilliant move. When White was thinking of giving checkmate, Black came up with an absolutely brilliant resource! So what is the point of 16... Bg4? White can now either take the free piece on g4 or take on g7 with either the knight or the bishop. Only one of these moves does not lose for White. Let us check them one by one to get more clarity. }
17. Bxg4 { The most natural move. White accepts Black's piece sacrifice. }
17... Qh4+
{ Now, if White plays  18.Ke2   or  18.Kd1  , then  18...Qxg4+  comes with a check, and subsequently Black takes another piece either on h5 or on h6.   If White goes  18.Ng3  we just take  18...Qxg4  and White has no more pressure on g7.   18.Qf2  is also met by  18...Qxg4  when White cannot take  19.Bxg7  because he loses a piece after  19...Qxh5  . @@StartFEN@@r4rk1/p4ppp/1n1p2nB/2pP3N/1bp1P1q1/2N5/PP3QPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 19@@EndFEN@@  19.Nxg7  does not work due to  19...Qxe4+  followed by ...Bxc3 and ...Nxd5 when White's entire center collapses like a house of cards.   The same happens after  18.g3  Qxg4  when either the e4-pawn or h5-knight hangs. So the only try left that we need to check is 18. Kf1. }
18. Kf1 f5
{ Who was supposed to attack and who is attacking? Black now opens up the f-file and tries to put White's king out of his misery. Only after  19.exf5  will he then take  19...Qxg4  when the open f-file will create a huge mess around White's king.  19.Bxf5  is met by  19...Qxh5  when Stockfish's evaluation of -4 in favor of Black confirms that White cannot save himself. }

{ The best offense is the best defense. We are striking before White can create even a hint of a threat against our king. Now the e4-pawn is hanging. }
20. Rhf1
{ Strangely enough, the only move to save the game.  20.Qe3  is of no use since it is met by  20...Rfe8!  threatening Rxe4. With 20. Rhf1 White creates a safe square for his king on g1 which will work in the case of ...Qxe4+ Kf2. }
20... Qxe4+ 21. Kf2 Nxd5 22. Kg1
{ Now White is ready to attack again. One final touch is needed for Black to make sure everything is under control. }
22... Qd3
{ Finally, Black will exchange the queens. If White plays  23.Qg5  then  23...Qe3+  forces the queen trade. Black is two pawns up, and at best, White will get equality. I wouldn't be sure here as White since the c3-pawn is also weak. However, the computer manages to hold the position and gets away with a draw. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Ne2

18. Qc2 { White protects the e4-pawn and once again threatens to play Nb5. }
18... f5
{ A fantastic move that stops Nb5 ideas. Now, if White takes  19.exf5  , then Black gets in  19...Bxf5  with a tempo. Black is still one healthy pawn up, and there is no way for White to get it back soon. Stockfish evaluates the position as close to -1 while Lc0 gives around -0.50 for Black. I think it is safe to say that Black is clearly better. Targeting the e4-pawn, Black aims to grab the d5-pawn shortly. }

{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Ne2
{ White tries to complete his development. He is still hoping to transpose into the old line with  7...O-O  8.Nf4  . However, Black has an entirely different plan in mind. }
7... bxc4
{ Capturing the c4 pawn and building up more pressure on d5. White must try to recapture the c4-pawn at the earliest before Black brings more pressure to bear on White's centre. }
8. Nf4
{ The most sensible move. In one go, White attacks the c4-pawn and brings more support to the d5-pawn. White could include  8.a3  Ba5  if he wanted to, but I don't see a single variation in which this inclusion benefits White. Only Black will have the advantage of having the bishop on a5, which was in a way blocking the b8-rook in many main lines. }
8... e5
{ Forcing White to go back to e2. White is ready to take that compromise since now he has got more space in the center. All that remains for him is to retake the c4-pawn with impunity. }
9. Ne2
{ The only move, but this was part of White's plan when he played 9. Nf4. Now that Black has clearly shown that he has no intention of breaking open the center, White claims that he can play slowly with Ng3 and then take the c4-pawn and build up a kingside attack with O-O and f4. }
9... Nbd7
{ We should not allow White to recapture the c4-pawn so easily. It is of the utmost importance to protect the pawn for now. Black is ready to play ...Nb6 and keep the extra pawn on c4. It is now White who has to prove that he has enough compensation. }
10. Ng3
{ This is the main move in this position. White is aiming for quick development and trying to immediately crush Black with the f4 break. Once again, we are happy if White wants to include the moves a3 and ...Ba5. It would just help us to get more play on the b-file. }
10... Nb6
{ As per the plan, we are not giving up the c4-pawn without a fight. It is not easy for White to further attack this pawn. Therefore he switches to a completely different plan. He will develop quickly with Be2 and O-O, play f4 as early as possible, and claim that he has a good kingside initiative. Our knight b6 is quite secure. We can meet the pawn advance a4 by playing ...a5 ourselves.   Now after  11.Be2  Black's next move is crucial. If you have not seen the move by now, I suggest pausing in this position and try to find a plan for Black. The entire line with 7.Nge2 depends on this particular plan. It is with the following idea Black stops White's entire initiative on the kingside. }
11. Be2
{ White clearly shows his hand. O-O and f4 are coming quickly. If Black castles  11...O-O  , then White will play  12.O-O  and immediately go for f4. Once the pawns are exchanged in the center, Bg5 becomes an annoying threat. The knight on f6 will be more of a burden that can come under pressure after White plays Bg5. }
11... Ng8
{ What on earth is Black thinking? White is trying to smash Black by playing a quick O-O and f4, and here Black is bringing back his pieces as if he is preparing for the next game. However, the reality is far from this seemingly obvious explanation. The weird-looking 11... Ng8 has a deep positional strategic idea. Let us try to understand it step by step.White has only one sensible break in the center/kingside, and that is f4. Once f4 happens, Black will take ...exf4, and then White's bishop will come to f4, putting pressure on the d6-pawn and threatening to pin the f6-knight with Bg5 at some point. Now with ...Ng8 Black solves many issues permanently. He realized that the knight on f6 was his main problem! This knight should be ready to come to e5 once the exchange on f4 happens.Then why didn't Black play 11...Nfd7? Well, it is important not to allow White to play Nf5. With the knight on g8, Black keeps the diagonal of the c8-bishop open, which controls the f5-square. Also, ideally, Black's knight would be great on g6 from where not only is it ready to jump to e5, but more importantly, it attacks the f4-bishop.If White doesn't play 12. f4 now, then in any case Black will get his knight to e7, and he is ready to meet f4 for the rest of the game, which is, by the way, White's only active plan in the center/on the kingside. Meanwhile, Black is a pawn up, and now the ball is in White's court. }
12. O-O
{ White is now fully ready to break with f4, and we are reaching the climax point. It will be of the utmost importance to see whose strategy works here. Black is a pawn up and hopes to create a nice blockade in the center, while White wants to crash through in the center, claiming that he has a lead in development. }
12... Ne7
{ Perfect timing! Just when White is planning to launch a massive attack on the center with f4, Black is right in time to stop everything. I found this ...Ng8-Ne7-Ng6 idea to be very pretty and strong. I have been waiting to play it myself for quite a long time. It was only played in Correspondence games back in 2017-18. However, very recently, in October 2020, my friend and colleague and another member of Team Anand, Radoslav Wojtaszek @@StartBracket@@more commonly known as Radek@@EndBracket@@ played this in one of the 'Titled Tuesday' matches!Due to the special lockdown situation we see many strong novelties being used in online chess. Players are aware that if they don't use it, someone else will eventually play it. Anyway, I just wanted to point out that when a strong player and theoretician like Radek plays this, that gives this move a stamp solidity. Let us keep digging a bit more into the position to get absolute clarity and understand its intricacies.With 12... Ne7 are continuing as per our plan. The knight is heading for the g6-square. }
13. f4 exf4 14. Bxf4 Ng6
{ With this knight now superbly placed on g6, nothing can go wrong for Black. Imagine the same knight being on f6 in this position. That would have been a total mess for Black. }
15. Nh5 O-O 16. Be3 Qe7
{ This is somewhat similar to what we will be seeing in the mainline. White has placed his knight on h5, aiming at the g7-pawn, but there is no way to get another piece to attack g7. Black's pawn on c5 nicely controls the d4-square, preventing White from getting a piece on the a1-h8 diagonal. Black still remains one pawn up. }

{ With this knight now superbly placed on g6, nothing can go wrong for Black. Imagine the same knight being on f6 in this position. That would have been a total mess for Black. }
15. Qc1
{ This is the critical move. White wants to put his queen on f4 once we take on f4. We now have one final issue to take care of: the d6-pawn! White wants to continue with Nb5, going ruthlessly for the d6-pawn. Note that he cannot begin with  15.Nb5  as then we can take  15...Nxf4  when White's queen isn't yet ready to come to f4; thus, our d6-pawn would have been safe. Now that White is ready to recapture on f4 with the queen, he is threatening to play Nb5 next. }
15... Bxc3
{ Now the d6-pawn is safe! We permanently took care of it. White can no longer attack it twice. We will also never allow White to play Nf5 as our bishop remains on the c8-h3 diagonal. }
16. bxc3
{ This keeps the option of retaking Qxf4 open, but White has compromised his queenside structure. }
16... O-O
{ Let us try to evaluate the position and understand why the engines prefer Black. First of all, he is one pawn up. Secondly, his position is perfectly sound strategically. The knight on g6 is taking care of any possible kingside attacks, controls the e5 break, and keeps an eye on the f4-bishop. There is no way for White to restore the material balance soon. Our next few moves will be ...Qe7, ...Bd7, ...Rb8, ...Re8 etc. For emergency purposes, we can play ...f6 at any moment and stop any tactical shots White might have in the center.   If White could play h4-h5, that would have given him some hope, but I don't see that happening in the near future.  17.Bg5  can be answered with  17...f6  ,  killing White's ambition of playing h4-h5. White should also watch out for ...Na4  in the future, especially once a black rook comes to b8. Black is, after all, a pawn up and at any time can return the pawn to get create more play on the queenside. }

With the knight on g8, Black keeps the diagonal of the c8-bishop open, which controls the f5-square. Also, ideally, Black's knight would be great on g6 from where not only is it ready to jump to e5, but more importantly, it attacks the f4-bishop.If White doesn't play 12. f4 now, then in any case Black will get his knight to e7, and he is ready to meet f4 for the rest of the game, which is, by the way, White's only active plan in the center/on the kingside. Meanwhile, Black is a pawn up, and now the ball is in White's court. }
12. O-O
{ White is now fully ready to break with f4, and we are reaching the climax point. It will be of the utmost importance to see whose strategy works here. Black is a pawn up and hopes to create a nice blockade in the center, while White wants to crash through in the center, claiming that he has a lead in development. }
12... Ne7
{ Perfect timing! Just when White is planning to launch a massive attack on the center with f4, Black is right in time to stop everything. I found this ...Ng8-Ne7-Ng6 idea to be very pretty and strong. I have been waiting to play it myself for quite a long time. It was only played in Correspondence games back in 2017-18. However, very recently, in October 2020, my friend and colleague and another member of Team Anand, Radoslav Wojtaszek @@StartBracket@@more commonly known as Radek@@EndBracket@@ played this in one of the 'Titled Tuesday' matches!Due to the special lockdown situation we see many strong novelties being used in online chess. Players are aware that if they don't use it, someone else will eventually play it. Anyway, I just wanted to point out that when a strong player and theoretician like Radek plays this, that gives this move a stamp solidity. Let us keep digging a bit more into the position to get absolute clarity and understand its intricacies.With 12... Ne7 are continuing as per our plan. The knight is heading for the g6-square. }
13. f4 exf4 14. Bxf4 Ng6
{ With this knight now superbly placed on g6, nothing can go wrong for Black. Imagine the same knight being on f6 in this position. That would have been a total mess for Black. }
15. Qc1
{ This is the critical move. White wants to put his queen on f4 once we take on f4. We now have one final issue to take care of: the d6-pawn! White wants to continue with Nb5, going ruthlessly for the d6-pawn. Note that he cannot begin with  15.Nb5  as then we can take  15...Nxf4  when White's queen isn't yet ready to come to f4; thus, our d6-pawn would have been safe. Now that White is ready to recapture on f4 with the queen, he is threatening to play Nb5 next. }
15... Bxc3
{ Now the d6-pawn is safe! We permanently took care of it. White can no longer attack it twice. We will also never allow White to play Nf5 as our bishop remains on the c8-h3 diagonal. }
16. Qxc3 Nxf4
{ When our pieces are properly placed, tactics will always favor us. Now,  17.Qxg7  would be a great move for White, but alas,  17...Nxe2+  comes with a check and White loses a full piece. Hence he is now obliged to recapture on f4 with the rook. }
17. Rxf4 O-O
{ If we get a chance, we will right away play ...Nd7 followed by ...Ne5. Once we get our knight to e5, everything will work in our favor. White has to stop this plan. Otherwise, Black will be clearly better with a hostile knight on e5, killing all of White's play in the center and on the kingside. }
18. Nh5 Qg5
{ 18...f6  is possible too, and engines call that equal. I find  18...Qg5  to be more direct, once again killing White's attacking plans. As long as our queen stays on g5, White cannot create any threats on the kingside. Meanwhile, Black can calmly play a move like ...Rb8 threatening ...Na4.It would be excellent for White to get his rook to g3, but that is not feasible as the h5-knight hangs when he plays his rook to f3, which is the only route to g3 available for now. White can at any moment play h4, and then we answer it with ...Qe5 exchanging queens.   We still keep that extra pawn and will build pressure on the b2-pawn by playing ...Rb8, aiming for ...Na4 at the right moment. We can also play ...Qe5 at any time we feel like, but I would rather wait for White to play h4 so that we gain a tempo. White has some compensation for the pawn due to his extra space in the center, but that will only give him enough for equality. After all, we are one healthy pawn up.   Hence every single machine calls it equal. I like Black, but I can't prove an advantage here. Let's just call it equal :-@@EndBracket@@ }

I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }

I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Bd2
{ One of the  4. f3 mainlines. Top players that have recently ventured this move are Fabiano, Levon, Mamedyarov, etc. White secures his pawn center first, and unlike c4 pawn so easily. He is now threatening to take on b5 with the knight. " target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-tippy-content="Link to variation">in the7.Ne2  line, }
7... a6
{ Simple and sound. We prevent White's main threat of Nxb5. Next, we want to castle and continue developing with Nbd7. White has to decide how he is going to develop his kingside pieces. Typically the inclusion of a3-Ba5 favors Black so White usually doesn't play like that. His best tries here are 8. Nge2 and 8. a4. }
8. a3
{ This move has been played only twice so far, and for a good reason. Black is more than happy to get his bishop to the a7-g1 diagonal to stop White from castling. White is helping that process by playing a3. Even after  8.a4  there are games where Black voluntarily plays  8...Ba5  . }
8... Ba5 9. b4
{ I can't think of any other way to make some sense of White's previous move. }
9... Bb6 10. Bg5 O-O
{ With the bishop on b6, I don't see a way for White to castle. Soon the center will open up and White's king will not find safety anywhere. No wonder nobody plays like this as White. }

According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Bd2
{ One of the  4. f3 mainlines. Top players that have recently ventured this move are Fabiano, Levon, Mamedyarov, etc. White secures his pawn center first, and unlike c4 pawn so easily. He is now threatening to take on b5 with the knight. " target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-tippy-content="Link to variation">in the7.Ne2  line, }
7... a6
{ Simple and sound. We prevent White's main threat of Nxb5. Next, we want to castle and continue developing with Nbd7. White has to decide how he is going to develop his kingside pieces. Typically the inclusion of a3-Ba5 favors Black so White usually doesn't play like that. His best tries here are 8. Nge2 and 8. a4. }
8. a4
{ White desperately wants to maintain his center. Black's pawn on b5 is indeed creating a lot of trouble for him, so White decides to take care of that pawn. Note that White was not happy to take the b5-pawn with the c4-pawn since that would allow us to immediately open up the e-file once we exchange on d5. Naturally, with his king in the center, White is not keen on opening up the e-file.With the cunning move 8. a4, White, at any cost, wants to remove the b5-pawn but at the same time makes sure his d5-pawn remains protected either by the c4-pawn or by the f1-bishop in case Black takes ...bxc4. }
8... bxc4
{ Black has also tried  8...Ba5  ,  which is another very interesting approach to prevent White's axb5 idea. I like  8...bxc4  more as it fits in with our direct attacking plans in the center. It is important to understand that we play ...bxc4 only once White has committed to a4 and made our bishop on b4 a powerful piece. This bishop cannot be attacked with a3 anymore. }
9. Bxc4 Nbd7
{ A very inspired idea by Black. No one has ever tried this move either in human games, correspondence, or computer games. In the online Olympiad 2020, Radek had this position as Black,  and he opted for  9...O-O  , which is possible but not as strong as this brilliant pawn sacrifice.   The idea of 9... Nbd7 is simple. Black wants to play ...Ne5 next, attacking the c4-bishop, which is a very annoying piece. Why has this move never been tried? Well, obviously for one single reason: it drops the e6-pawn!The above text is what I wrote on the evening of 1st December 2020, after which I sent my PGN file to Chessable for a quality check. The Chessable team was happy, and I was also happy with my novelty, which lasted precisely for a fortnight. Guess who played this novelty? It was none other than Alina Kashlinskaya, who is married to our beloved Radek.Kudos to team Radek for also discovering this strong idea. When I saw this game, my jaw dropped as Alina's game followed my analysis precisely up to move 22!With slight sadness, I now take the novelty sign off this move yet with a smile on my face as it shows that I was going in the right direction, as Radek also had concluded the same.This text is now becoming like a diary! Two days later, after I wrote the above paragraph, Radek himself played the same move as Black!! }
10. dxe6
{ No other move is justifiable for White. If Black gets his knight to e5 without any concession, he will just be better. }
10... fxe6 11. Bxe6 Ne5
{ Black's idea is crystal clear. We want to put our knight on d3 and make sure that White can't castle. }
12. Bd5
{ White tries to gain control of the d5-square. This is too naive. Time is the key factor here, and this move only gives Black more time to create threats around White's king. }
12... Nxd5 13. Nxd5 Bxd2+ 14. Qxd2 O-O
{ Not only has Black managed to castle, but also, thanks to the knight on e5 and the half-open f-file, White is now unable to move the g1-knight for tactical reasons -  15.Ne2  Rxf3!  Black's other rook will soon come to b8 threatening a ...Rxb2 Qxb2 Nd3+ fork! With so many fork threats and the king stuck in the center, White is clearly worse. }

{ A very inspired idea by Black. No one has ever tried this move either in human games, correspondence, or computer games. In the online Olympiad 2020, Radek had this position as Black,  and he opted for  9...O-O  , which is possible but not as strong as this brilliant pawn sacrifice.   The idea of 9... Nbd7 is simple. Black wants to play ...Ne5 next, attacking the c4-bishop, which is a very annoying piece. Why has this move never been tried? Well, obviously for one single reason: it drops the e6-pawn!The above text is what I wrote on the evening of 1st December 2020, after which I sent my PGN file to Chessable for a quality check. The Chessable team was happy, and I was also happy with my novelty, which lasted precisely for a fortnight. Guess who played this novelty? It was none other than Alina Kashlinskaya, who is married to our beloved Radek.Kudos to team Radek for also discovering this strong idea. When I saw this game, my jaw dropped as Alina's game followed my analysis precisely up to move 22!With slight sadness, I now take the novelty sign off this move yet with a smile on my face as it shows that I was going in the right direction, as Radek also had concluded the same.This text is now becoming like a diary!

{ Black's idea is crystal clear. We want to put our knight on d3 and make sure that White can't castle. }
12. Bxc8 Qxc8
{ Black is now going to play ...Nd3+. White can stop it for the moment by moving his d2-bishop or by controlling the d3-square with his queen. Either way, Black will then play ...c4 and renew the threat to play ...Nd3+ and take away White's castling rights. The best way for White to continue is by eliminating the e5-knight immediately by playing 13. Bf4. Once Black's knight lands on d3, the white king will be in big trouble. }
13. Bg5 c4 { Nothing can stop ...Nd3+ anymore. } 14. Bxf6 Nd3+
{ Let us first take away White's castling rights before recapturing the piece. }
15. Kf1 gxf6 16. Nd5
{ Pretending to scare Black. With just one knight White can never create an attack on Black's king even if it stays right in the center. There are a lot of strong ideas for Black here. I will give one simple sample line to show that Black is doing great. Feel free to choose any normal move, and you will do well. }
16... Qc5 { Threatening mate in one on f2. } 17. Nh3 O-O
{ White really has one single asset, and that is his knight on d5. One might ask if it is really doing a great job there or that if it just looks good. The answer is that is good for nothing in reality! White's king is stuck, and the rooks cannot get connected either. Black will now play ...f5 and bring his a8-rook to either e8 or b8. Every single piece is playing, and I believe this gives us huge compensation. The computer manages to hold the balance, but I doubt White will manage to keep his cool in a practical game. I prefer to be Black here. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Bd2
{ One of the  4. f3 mainlines. Top players that have recently ventured this move are Fabiano, Levon, Mamedyarov, etc. White secures his pawn center first, and unlike c4 pawn so easily. He is now threatening to take on b5 with the knight. " target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-tippy-content="Link to variation">in the7.Ne2  line, }
7... a6
{ Simple and sound. We prevent White's main threat of Nxb5. Next, we want to castle and continue developing with Nbd7. White has to decide how he is going to develop his kingside pieces. Typically the inclusion of a3-Ba5 favors Black so White usually doesn't play like that. His best tries here are 8. Nge2 and 8. a4. }
8. a4
{ White desperately wants to maintain his center. Black's pawn on b5 is indeed creating a lot of trouble for him, so White decides to take care of that pawn. Note that White was not happy to take the b5-pawn with the c4-pawn since that would allow us to immediately open up the e-file once we exchange on d5. Naturally, with his king in the center, White is not keen on opening up the e-file.With the cunning move 8. a4, White, at any cost, wants to remove the b5-pawn but at the same time makes sure his d5-pawn remains protected either by the c4-pawn or by the f1-bishop in case Black takes ...bxc4. }
8... bxc4
{ Black has also tried  8...Ba5  ,  which is another very interesting approach to prevent White's axb5 idea. I like  8...bxc4  more as it fits in with our direct attacking plans in the center. It is important to understand that we play ...bxc4 only once White has committed to a4 and made our bishop on b4 a powerful piece. This bishop cannot be attacked with a3 anymore. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3
{ My first proper introduction to this line was when I started working with Anand for his World Championship match against Kramnik back in 2007. I vividly remember that for about 8-9 months, we worked for this match. Anand's main repertoire for the match was 1. d4, and the Nimzo was one of the lines Kramnik was most expected to play. As a result, the very first white game of the match was this particular variation. Since then, I myself have picked up the 4.f3 Nimzo as White and played many games with fantastic results. Needless to say, the World Championship match preparation helped me a lot to score some very crucial points. :-@@EndBracket@@ Being a Nimzo player myself, I have also faced this line many times from the Black side, so I am perfectly aware of how important it is to understand this line properly. That was about sharing my personal experience with this line. I hope I have not made the readers bored with this little personal touch.So what is this 4.f3 move? When and how did it become popular? According to MegaBase, this seemingly anti-positional looking move was first played at a high level by Bogoljobov and then by World Champion Max Euwe in 1934. Then it was tried by players like Keres, Korchnoi, Benko, Polugaevsky, Taimanov, Tal, etc. What is very interesting to see is that mainly the top players were playing this move back in the days. I think the reasoning is simple. At first sight, this move really looks ugly and against all principles of chess. White is taking away the f3-square for his g1-knight. This looks especially ugly when Black can answer it with a move like ...d5. Hence only very strong players played this move because they were not scared of breaking general rules of thumb and could see beyond basic opening principles.However weird it looks, the move 4. f3 does have a valid foundation. White is fighting for the center with full force. As we all know by now, this line is considered one of the mainlines nowadays. }
4... c5
{ One of the most dynamic lines for Black. There is nothing wrong with the move  4...d5  , which is by far the mainline. I have played both 4...c5 and 4...d5 and also faced both as White. I like 4...c5 more as it is more dynamic and gives Black an equal amount of winning chances. We charge at the center and stop White from playing e4 immediately. }
5. d5
{ White immediately takes more control of the center and makes sure nothing can stop him from playing e4 next. It's no wonder that this has been the most popular choice for White. The only other major move in this position is  5.a3  , which after  5...Bxc3+  6.bxc3  transposes to the next chapter. }
5... b5
{ The fight for the center is on. The c4-pawn is the backbone of the d5-pawn. Hence Black targets the weakest link at his first chance. }
6. e4
{ Practically forced. There is no other way to keep the center intact. This move is played almost exclusively when White reaches this position. }
6... d6
{ A very modern line that heavily cuts down on the theory.  6...bxc4  and  6...O-O  have been played for many years, leading to an insurmountable amount of theory.   Instead, the move  6...d6  has only become popular since 2019 when many top players started playing this move. Especially when Magnus played this in 2019 FIDE Grand Swiss, the entire chess world became more and more interested in its subtleties. In this system, White typically keeps the option of Nh3 and Ne2 ideas open.  By playing 6... d6 Black removes White's option of Nh3 as that can now be met with ...exd5 and ...Bxh3. It also prevents White from playing 7. e5, which is the mainline after 6...O-O. White is obliged to develop his knight to e2. As and when White takes cxb5, Black will open up the e-file by taking on d5.   White is hugely behind in development on the kingside, so naturally no one really ever tried this stupid cxb5 move at any point. }
7. Bd2
{ One of the  4. f3 mainlines. Top players that have recently ventured this move are Fabiano, Levon, Mamedyarov, etc. White secures his pawn center first, and unlike c4 pawn so easily. He is now threatening to take on b5 with the knight. " target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-tippy-content="Link to variation">in the7.Ne2  line, }
7... a6
{ Simple and sound. We prevent White's main threat of Nxb5. Next, we want to castle and continue developing with Nbd7. White has to decide how he is going to develop his kingside pieces. Typically the inclusion of a3-Ba5 favors Black so White usually doesn't play like that. His best tries here are 8. Nge2 and 8. a4. }
8. a4
{ White desperately wants to maintain his center. Black's pawn on b5 is indeed creating a lot of trouble for him, so White decides to take care of that pawn. Note that White was not happy to take the b5-pawn with the c4-pawn since that would allow us to immediately open up the e-file once we exchange on d5. Naturally, with his king in the center, White is not keen on opening up the e-file.With the cunning move 8. a4, White, at any cost, wants to remove the b5-pawn but at the same time makes sure his d5-pawn remains protected either by the c4-pawn or by the f1-bishop in case Black takes ...bxc4. }
8... bxc4
{ Black has also tried  8...Ba5  ,  which is another very interesting approach to prevent White's axb5 idea. I like  8...bxc4  more as it fits in with our direct attacking plans in the center. It is important to understand that we play ...bxc4 only once White has committed to a4 and made our bishop on b4 a powerful piece. This bishop cannot be attacked with a3 anymore. }
9. Bxc4 Nbd7
{ A very inspired idea by Black. No one has ever tried this move either in human games, correspondence, or computer games. In the online Olympiad 2020, Radek had this position as Black,  and he opted for  9...O-O  , which is possible but not as strong as this brilliant pawn sacrifice.   The idea of 9... Nbd7 is simple. Black wants to play ...Ne5 next, attacking the c4-bishop, which is a very annoying piece. Why has this move never been tried? Well, obviously for one single reason: it drops the e6-pawn!The above text is what I wrote on the evening of 1st December 2020, after which I sent my PGN file to Chessable for a quality check. The Chessable team was happy, and I was also happy with my novelty, which lasted precisely for a fortnight. Guess who played this novelty? It was none other than Alina Kashlinskaya, who is married to our beloved Radek.Kudos to team Radek for also discovering this strong idea. When I saw this game, my jaw dropped as Alina's game followed my analysis precisely up to move 22!With slight sadness, I now take the novelty sign off this move yet with a smile on my face as it shows that I was going in the right direction, as Radek also had concluded the same.This text is now becoming like a diary! Two days later, after I wrote the above paragraph, Radek himself played the same move as Black!! }
10. dxe6
{ No other move is justifiable for White. If Black gets his knight to e5 without any concession, he will just be better. }
10... fxe6 11. Bxe6 Ne5
{ Black's idea is crystal clear. We want to put our knight on d3 and make sure that White can't castle. }
12. Bxc8 Qxc8
{ Black is now going to play ...Nd3+. White can stop it for the moment by moving his d2-bishop or by controlling the d3-square with his queen. Either way, Black will then play ...c4 and renew the threat to play ...Nd3+ and take away White's castling rights. The best way for White to continue is by eliminating the e5-knight immediately by playing 13. Bf4. Once Black's knight lands on d3, the white king will be in big trouble. }
13. Bf4
{ This is the only way to permanently prevent the threat of ...Nd3+ as White will eliminate this knight on the next move. }
13... c4
{ We not only welcome White to take on e5 but literally force him to do so! }
14. Bxe5 dxe5
{ What is our compensation for the pawn? We want to play ...Qc5 next, making it more difficult for White to castle. It will cost White some time to achieve castling. Meanwhile we will bring our rooks to d-file and double them. }
15. Nh3 Qc5
{ Immediately stopping castling ideas and threatening Qe3+. I checked that Sopiko Guramishvilli, in her Chess24 course on the f3 Nimzo from White's side, recommends this very line. To my utter surprise, this was her mainline too. She also came to the same conclusion that the 9... Nbd7 pawn sac is the most critical try for Black. I cannot be sure who was part of team Sopiko but I think this player must be particularly strong :-@@EndBracket@@ However, the move 15... Qc5 was not analyzed in that course, and only  15...Bc5  was given, which is much weaker. }
16. Nf2 { Trying to get the king to safety by giving back the extra pawn. }
16... Qe3+ { Now we just take back the pawn. } 17. Kf1 Bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3
{ Material is equal. We have a passed pawn on c4, which will be well protected by ...Rc8. We are one move away from castling. This is more than sufficient to hold the balance. }

7. e5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Nc6
{ White will lose his bishop pair advantage and he is also losing a central pawn. Black has a double threat: he threatens to take on c3 and also to take on d2 followed by ...cxd4, and after the inevitable queen exchange the d4-pawn will fall. Black is clearly better. }

{ A very counter-intuitive move! White was hoping for Black to castle on the kingside so that he can attack there. Black castles but first decides to create a target for White by playing h6, literally asking White to attack with full force! Before I explain the subtle logic behind this move, let me point out that there was absolutely nothing wrong with  10...Na5  followed by ...Qc7 and not castling on the kingside. I decided to show this variation because it is the strongest move in the position.So what is the point? Think about a way White can attack the kingside. Nf4/Ng3 both are directly met by g5, which will win a full piece. White can think about playing g4-g5, but that will be answered with ...Nh7 when the h4-bishop will be hanging. The computer thinks accepting that he has made a mistake and playing with a slightly worse position by going Nc1-Nb3 is the best way for White. That doesn't bother us. The only challenging idea that remains is f4-e5. We will consider that now. }
11. f4 e5
{ Obviously we are not going to allow e4-e5. It is time to charge in the center. }
12. d5
{ White wants to play f5 and gain maximum space. That would help him to continue his attack with g4-g5. But first, he needs to make sure Black doesn't get a chance to open up the e-file by playing ...exd4, so he closes the center before going for f5. }
12... Na5 13. f5 g5
{ A brilliant move! Now White cannot retreat with the bishop since the e4-pawn hangs. If he takes  14.fxg6  , then after Black recaptures  14...fxg6  the f-file gets opened up, making it impossible for White to castle, and Black threatens ...g5 followed by ...Ne4. The computers give -3 already. }

{ Obviously, we didn't play the bishop to b4 only to chicken out once White attacks it. Our argument is that position will remain closed in nature, and our knights are ideal from this perspective. White will have a weak doubled pawn on the c-file for a long time, and in particular, the c4-pawn could come under serious attack. }
5. bxc3 c5
{ The most common move in the position. Black goes for a long-term strategic plan. In the long run, he wants to attack the c4-pawn. There will be many ways to do so, and some of the typical ones are ...Nc6-Na5, ...Ba6, ...Rc8, etc. We definitely want the position to be closed, so we encourage White to play d5 at any point in time. On the other hand, White has the bishop pair and he would like to keep the game open. }
6. f3
{ An important move. White plans to go for a direct e4 without wasting a move on e3. Usually, this position arises from a 4.f3 Nimzo move order. }
6... Nc6
{ If Black plays  6...d5  then after  7.cxd5  we would directly transpose to the mainline of the 4. f3 Nimzo, where Black plays an early ...d5. First of all, our repertoire against the f3 Nimzo is not to play 4... d5. Secondly and more importantly, via this move order 6... Nc6 is a much stronger move, getting ready for White's e4 ideas by increasing the pressure on the d4-pawn. }
7. e4
{ As per White's plan. The inclusion of the moves  7.d5  Na5  would only help Black since it keeps the position closed. He could respond to  8.e4  with  8...d6  followed by the standard plan of going for the c4-pawn with ...b6 and ...Ba6. }
7... d6
{ It is time for White to decide how he is going to develop his g1-knight. There are three possible ways: to go Nh3, to play Ne2 with the bishop still on f1, and finally to play Bd3 and only then play Ne2. To execute the final plan, White must first take care of his d4-pawn so that he can play Bd3. Thus  8.Nh3  ,  8.Ne2  , and  8.Be3  are the moves we will examine next. }
8. Be3 { The standard move. White wants to follow up with Bd3 and Ne2. } 8...
b6
{ We follow the same typical plan of Ba6-Na5, putting pressure on the c4-pawn. }
9. Bd3 Na5
{ In this particular position there is nothing wrong with  9...O-O  either, but I like 9...Na5 more for a couple of reasons.   1.@@EndBracket@@  It is similar to what we are planning to do in the 6. e3 b6 7.Bd3 Bb7 8.f3 lines #10 to #16, making it easier to understand.   2.@@EndBracket@@  Avoiding the traditional theory makes it more difficult for White to prepare and follow some known path.   3.@@EndBracket@@  I personally think this is a stronger move, keeping maximum flexibility. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
10. Nh3
{ 10.Ne2  is the most logical response when we can directly transpose to #14 till #16 with  10...Ba6  11.O-O  Qe7  . Apart from transposing Black can also choose to play  10...Qc7  , taking advantage of the move order and putting the queen in a better place. }
10... e5 { The typical response to Nh3 when we have our bishop on c8. } 11. Nf2
Ba6 12. O-O Nd7
{ Getting away from the Bg5 pin, which would have been possible after  12...O-O  13.Bg5  . Now Black is threatening to take the c4-pawn. White's main play in this system is to create an attack on the kingside by often ignoring the queenside and giving the pawn on c4. Often White pins the f6 knight once Black castles and tries to create threats on the kingside.   This can get particularly dangerous with White's knight being on f2 when it can jump to g4. However, it is still possible to play h6-g5 once White plays Bg5, but there is absolutely no need to get there. It is also to be noted with White's knight on e2 and bishop on f1, we could afford to allow Bg5 pin as White then cannot play Ng3 due to h6-g5 when the bishop on h4 gets trapped. }
13. Qa4
{ An unfortunate placement of the queen, but this is forced.  13.Qe2  is met nicely by  13...Nb3  going for the d4-pawn. }
13... cxd4 14. cxd4 O-O
{ By including ...cxd4 Black made sure that the c5-square is available for his d7-knight. ...Rc8 will come next, and either Black will take on d4 and play ...Nc5 or White will play d5, and then Black would go ...Nc5 - either way, the knight is coming to c5, and Black gets a lovely position. White's pawns in the center have become more of a burden than a strength. }

He must bring another piece to make that break possible, and that would take a huge amount of time, if at all feasible. Meanwhile, Black has a direct plan of going h5-h4-Nh5/Nd7-g5, etc., creating a kingside attack, which is the only place for White's king to hide. I don't see a way for White to create threats that could scare Black. It is time he should think about how to keep his own position safe. }

4... Bxc3+
{ Obviously, we didn't play the bishop to b4 only to chicken out once White attacks it. Our argument is that position will remain closed in nature, and our knights are ideal from this perspective. White will have a weak doubled pawn on the c-file for a long time, and in particular, the c4-pawn could come under serious attack. }
5. bxc3 c5
{ The most common move in the position. Black goes for a long-term strategic plan. In the long run, he wants to attack the c4-pawn. There will be many ways to do so, and some of the typical ones are ...Nc6-Na5, ...Ba6, ...Rc8, etc. We definitely want the position to be closed, so we encourage White to play d5 at any point in time. On the other hand, White has the bishop pair and he would like to keep the game open. }

For now, I'll just say that this move allows Black to keep an eye on the g2-pawn, making it impossible for White to reach the Bd3-Ne2 setup without playing f3. }
7. Bd3
{ Usually this setup is critical when Black castles short. White opts for a Bd3-Ne2 setup with the idea of going for a direct kingside attack by pushing his f-pawn. }
7... Bb7
{ One of the points of delaying ...Nc6. If White wants to play the Bd3-Ne2 setup, he must waste a move with f3 to protect the g2-pawn first. }
8. Nf3
{ White tries to play in a simple manner without getting going for f3 and e4. Here too we will take advantage of not playing ...Nc6 early, which gives us more control over the critical e4-square. }
8... O-O
{ White must play e4 to gain control over the center and open up his dead bishop on c1. Usually, with a black knight on c6, this is relatively easy to achieve, but in this position, things are a bit more complicated for White.   How does he prepare e4? Black is ready to play ...Ne4 next, taking control of the e4-square. One way to stop it is  9.Nd2  , but that gives a free pawn with  9...Bxg2  .   If White goes for  9.Qc2  , he allows Black to shatter White's pawn structure on the kingside with  9...Bxf3  . }
9. Nd2
{ Trying to get e4 quickly at the cost of a pawn. Black can take this pawn without hesitation. The knight on d2 has no way to create any threats. It also stops the c1-bishop from coming into play. }
9... Bxg2 10. Rg1 Bb7
{ Now Black will quickly develop with ...Nbd7/...Qe7 and play ...e5 to gain more control over the center. White's g1-rook and d3-bishop look good, but they don't have enough support as all the other pieces are out of play. In particular the bishop on c1 and rook on a1 will take a huge amount of time to get into play. }
11. e4 d6 { We obviously do not want to allow White to play e5. } 12. Qf3
{ Hoping to stop ...Nbd7 by intending Qg3 with a double attack. } 12... Nbd7
{ Ignoring White's threat of Qg3 completely. White has to go for this move - otherwise Black has prevented e4-e5 with impunity. }
13. Qg3 g6
{ Now if White doesn't take on d6, Black is a solid pawn up and White has no attack.  14.f4  can be answered with the strong  14...Nh5  . Our king will be super safe on h8. }
14. Qxd6 e5
{ This was our trap. White loses the queen due to the threat of ...Ne8. } *

If White plays  12.f4  , then we go  12...Ne4  burying the c1-bishop permanently.     If he goes  12.h4  , then after we play  12...Nf7  the h4-pawn comes under direct attack and also becomes permanently weak. Black can play ...Nc6 next, stopping e4 further by keeping an eye on the d4-pawn. It is not clear how White is going to play e4 without making some serious concessions. Black has sufficient play to keep the dynamic balance. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3

I think this speaks a lot about the ancient history of this line as well as the Dortmund tournament. :- @@EndBracket@@ However, this line was not really that popular at the top level, although many strong players have occasionally used it from time to time.

But when the World Champion uses a line, even in rapid and blitz, it becomes trendy.The idea of 4. a3 is pretty straightforward. White says I don't care about your pawn structure strategy. I want the bishop pair. Please give it to me right away. }
4... Bxc3+
{ Obviously, we didn't play the bishop to b4 only to chicken out once White attacks it. Our argument is that position will remain closed in nature, and our knights are ideal from this perspective. White will have a weak doubled pawn on the c-file for a long time, and in particular, the c4-pawn could come under serious attack. }
5. bxc3 c5
{ The most common move in the position. Black goes for a long-term strategic plan. In the long run, he wants to attack the c4-pawn. There will be many ways to do so, and some of the typical ones are ...Nc6-Na5, ...Ba6, ...Rc8, etc. We definitely want the position to be closed, so we encourage White to play d5 at any point in time. On the other hand, White has the bishop pair and he would like to keep the game open. }

If Black plays  6...d5  we would transpose to a famous classical game between Botvinnik vs. Capablanca from Avro 1938. :- @@EndBracket@@  White takes things slowly. He would like to first develop his light-squared bishop to d3. Then he can go for the simple Nf3-O-O or the more dynamic Ne2-O-O when he keeps the option to play f3 and e4 open. The battle now begins in the center. Will White be able to get maximum control in the center by slowly preparing e4? We shall now see how to counter White's idea. }
6... b6
{ This is not as popular as the classical moves  6...Nc6  or  6...O-O  , but I like it a lot because it helps us to unleash a completely new novelty/plan/strategy in the future, which we will soon see. For now, I'll just say that this move allows Black to keep an eye on the g2-pawn, making it impossible for White to reach the Bd3-Ne2 setup without playing f3. }
7. Bd3
{ Usually this setup is critical when Black castles short. White opts for a Bd3-Ne2 setup with the idea of going for a direct kingside attack by pushing his f-pawn. }
7... Bb7

8. f3 Nc6
{ Now that we have achieved our aim by forcing White to play f3, we develop our knight to c6. }
9. Nh3
{ This move has been played a few times. It is directly aimed against Black's plan of castling short which, by the way, is totally fine. However, we can stick to the same plan we adopt in the mainline, which is even stronger here. We will soon see how to respond in a similar fashion as we will be doing in the 9.Ne2 variation. }
9... d6 10. O-O Qe7
{ A more detailed explanation will be given in the mainline with 9. Ne2-O-O, where we will be playing in exactly the same way. As we will be seeing later, once Black castles long White's only way to open up the queenside is a4-a5, and Black can prevent that by playing ...Na5 at the right moment. There is no way to remove this knight on a5 other than getting White's knight to b3, but it is on a different planet right now. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
11. Rb1 O-O-O
{ The a4-a5 plan is long gone with the knight standing on h3. Black will now start a massive kingside attack with ...Nd7 followed by ...g5 and ...h5. He will also play ...e5 at the right moment to White from playing Nf4 after ...g4. Remember to keep the a5-square accessible for our c6-knight. That is the best piece on the queenside. Singlehandedly it will stop White's entire queenside attack. }

This is a completely new concept that was never tried before by any strong players, not even in correspondence or computer games. More than remembering many variations  @@StartBracket@@which by the way I always discourage@@EndBracket@@ , we should try to understand the ideas/reasoning behind the move. Once we understand the reasoning we won't forget the moves ever, and even if we do, then using the same reasoning, we will be able to find the moves over the board.With that small prologue, let us try to understand what Black wants to achieve! I am sure the readers by now have figured out that Black is keeping his options of castling on either side open! But who castles on the queenside in such lines? Won't we get mated there? Well, think about a way to open up the queenside for White. The only option that comes to mind is to play a4-a5, and a timely ...Na5 blocks that. How will White ever remove our knight from a5?   Again the only option that comes to mind is to play Nc1-Nb3. So What if White prepares a quick Nc1-Nb3? Wait, we said we kept the option open for O-O-O, but we didn't promise! Once White's knight moves far away from the kingside, we can always change plans and castle kingside, and then attack the c4-pawn in the old classical way by playing ...Ba6 and ...Rc8. That will slow down White's kingside attacking plans. So what if White instead tries Ng3 followed by e4? Well, then we castle long and our knight on a5 alone will take care of any queenside attack. Let us not forget that the tables have turned, and instead of White attacking the kingside, we will start the pawn avalanche by going ...h5-h4 and ...g5, etc.   So what happens if White waits on e2, keeping the option open of going either Nc1 or Ng3? Now it is time to go through some variations. Once the concept is clear, understanding the moves will become a piece of cake. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
11. e4 Na5
{ As discussed before, Black keeps his options open to castle on either side. If White goes on the kingside attack by playing Ng3 we castle long, while if White goes for Nc1-b3 we castle short. We shall, of course, also see what happens if White decides to wait. Our advantage is that we have more useful waiting moves than White. In the classical continuation, White would often sacrifice the c4-pawn and go for a fast kingside attack. So time is the key. If White waits too long, we can simply switch to the classical approach by going for the c4-pawn. As long as it's possible, we don't commit to castling. }
12. Ng3
{ If you have read the explanation on move 10 you already know Black's answer. The white knight is very far away from the b3-square, which is the only way White can eliminate Black's knight on a5 that is covering all queenside play. It is time to run to the queenside. }
12... O-O-O
{ With our king being safe on the queenside we can start play on the kingside. It is to be noted that  12...Nd7  is also an equally strong move, delaying castling for another move and first going for ...h5-h4. }
13. Be3
{ We will now see a sample variation of what can happen if White tries to bring the knight to b3 to eliminate the a5-knight and push a4-a5. Note that moves like f4 or e5 will only help Black to open up the b7-bishop. Then eventually, once Black starts pushing pawns on the kingside, White will have lots of trouble with his king. }
13... h5 14. Ne2
{ The computer is very happy as Black. There are many plans that Black can choose depending on his personal taste. I will give one simple sample line to show the solidity of Black's position. }
14... Nd7
{ There was nothing wrong with either  14...Rdg8  followed by ...g5 or  14...Ba6  to attack the c4-pawn. Either way Black is fine. }
15. Nc1 g5 16. Nb3
{ Finally, White manages to challenge the a5-knight in order to open up the queenside. }
16... Nxb3 17. Qxb3 e5 { First, we make sure the center is closed. } 18. a4 a5
{ We seal the queenside too, leaving White with no hopes of opening up the position. Once we play ...Kc7 nothing can scare us on the queenside. If necessary we will always have ...Rb8. Both of White's bishops are not doing anything and we can slowly start playing on the kingside. With the setup of Kc7-Rb8-Ba6 the knight on d7 will also be released from its job of protecting b6, after which it can start its journey to f4 via f8-e6. White has long-term strategic issues. }

12... Nd7
{ The typical idea of our entire system in this variation. We don't show our intentions and keep the option of castling on either side. With this move we have prevented White from playing Bg5 and are threatening to go for the c4-pawn by playing ...Ba6. The knight on d7 adds protection to b6/c5 and facilitates a kingside attack with ...h5 and ...g5. Our next move is ...Ba6 to take the pawn on c4. White must show his cards, because if he waits further and responds to our ...Ba6 with a move like Qa4, we go ...Rc8 and castle short, putting more pressure on the c4-pawn and claiming that White's queen is too far away to create any threats on the kingside. }
13. f4
{ It is already difficult to suggest a decent plan for White. The most logical would be  13.Be3  , which would transpose into the mainline that we see after 12.Be3. If White had played Ng3, then obviously Black would go for ...h5-h4 plans that we have already seen. By playing 13.f4 White has shown his colors, and now it is time for us to run to the queenside. Once again, note that White had no time to wait with useful moves as we were threatening to play ...Ba6 and take the c4-pawn. Thanks to 12... Nd7 there is no Qa4+ trick available. }
13... O-O-O 14. Bd2
{ Trying to get Nc1-Nb3 ideas worked out. White cannot play  14.Be3  as then Black would immediately open up his b7 bishop's diagonal by playing  14...f5  . White won't be able to take on f5 twice since the e3-bishop is hanging.   Once again,  14.Ng3  as usual is met by  14...h5  . }
14... g6
{ I absolutely love this move! Black decides to open up the b7-bishop. ...f5 is coming no matter what!   White cannot think of playing  15.f5  himself as that would not only open up the b7-bishop, but after  15...gxf5  the g-file is also opened.   If White goes  15.Ng3  then Black can choose between  15...f5  and  15...h5  , both being equally strong. }
15. Nc1 f5
{ White is far from generating any threats on the queenside. Black is much faster here. The center is collapsing and White has nothing in return. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }

I would not be surprised if Robert mixed up his preparation or it was just a mouse slip while trying to play Bg5. :-@@EndBracket@@  In any case, for the sake of completeness, let us have a look at this dubious move. }
7... c5 { Charging immediately at the center. } 8. dxc5 Nc6
{ Black has numerous threats - ...Ne4, ...d4, ...e5. The queen on c3 is miserable, and White is way behind in development. }
9. O-O-O
{ After this move in the game, White was completely lost, and Benjamin had no trouble converting it into a full point. }
9... Ne4
{ The queen is attacked, as well as the pawns on f2 and c5. Once the knight comes to f2, the h1-rook is lost, while if it comes to c5, it creates havoc on the queenside. Thus Qe3 is the only way to stop both these knight moves. }
10. Qe3 Na5
{ 10...Qa5  was played by Benjamin, which is also strong, but it seems that  10...Na5  simply seals the game immediately. The computers are giving -4 in favor of Black. Concretely speaking, the c4-pawn is hanging. }
11. cxd5 exd5 12. f3 Nxc5
{ There is a fork on b3, so White cannot take on c5. His king is completely exposed while his kingside is frozen. White is dead lost. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. e3
{ This is a classical move, and sometimes we can reach this position via different move orders too. According to Mega Database, this position was reached in 1926 for the first time. The white player was none other than the great Akiba Rubinstein. That game came from the 4.Qc2 d5 5.e3 O-O 6.a3 move order.   The idea of 7. e3 is simple: White says, 'I have my bishop pair advantage, and now I just want to complete my kingside development instead of trying something special.' White is ready to meet the move  7...dxc4  with  8.Bxc4  , but in the process, he has locked his dark-squared bishop inside the pawn chain by playing e3. }
7... c5
{ I suggest deviating from the mainline of  7...b6  and try the very interesting  7...c5  , which is currently hugely underrated. It makes sense to strike immediately when we are ahead in development. I found this move back in 2011 but have never yet had a chance to use it.

8. Nf3 cxd4

9. exd4 dxc4 { The simplest solution, giving White an isolated pawn. } 10. Bxc4
Nc6 11. O-O
{ The only question that remains is how to develop the c8-bishop.  11...b6  followed by ...Bb7 would be ideal, but that apparently runs into  12.Bxe6  . }
11... b6
{ Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn for the sake of activity yet once again. }
12. Bxe6
{ Otherwise Black just plays ...Bb7 and ...Rc8, putting pressure on the f3-knight, queen on c3, and the isolated pawn on d4. }
12... Bxe6 13. Qxc6 Bd5
{ White's structure will be ruined if he doesn't go back to c3.  14.Qc3  allows another tempo with  14...Rc8  . The other rook will then occupy the e-file, the knight will soon come to d5, etc. If White wants to save the d4-pawn, he must retake on f3 with his g-pawn, permanently damaging the kingside. Black has great compensation - in fact, engines already like Black. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. e3
{ This is a classical move, and sometimes we can reach this position via different move orders too. According to Mega Database, this position was reached in 1926 for the first time. The white player was none other than the great Akiba Rubinstein. That game came from the 4.Qc2 d5 5.e3 O-O 6.a3 move order.   The idea of 7. e3 is simple: White says, 'I have my bishop pair advantage, and now I just want to complete my kingside development instead of trying something special.' White is ready to meet the move  7...dxc4  with  8.Bxc4  , but in the process, he has locked his dark-squared bishop inside the pawn chain by playing e3. }
7... c5
{ I suggest deviating from the mainline of  7...b6  and try the very interesting  7...c5  , which is currently hugely underrated. It makes sense to strike immediately when we are ahead in development. I found this move back in 2011 but have never yet had a chance to use it. Probably the readers will get to use it before I do. :- @@EndBracket@@  Let us look at some moves to understand the key ideas behind this move. }
8. dxc5
{ White must accept the pawn sacrifice. Declining it doesn't make sense. If White normally declines such a pawn, then in every game that reached the position after 7. e3, Black would have played 7... c5. }
8... Ne4
{ Going for activity again. The queen on c3 is attacked, and apart from c2, she does not have any peaceful square from where she won't be harassed again. }
9. Qc2
{ Hoping for  9...Nxc5?!  10.b4!  when the advantage of the bishop pair will become clearly visible. }
9... a5
{ This is the point! Black is trying to restrict the c1-bishop and is planning to take the c5-pawn slowly with ...Nd7 followed by ...Ndxc5. This was the big idea that I have been waiting to try since 2011. It has not been played on the GM level until very recently, when in May 2020, Delgado used this idea against Paravyan and won a game as Black. }
10. cxd5
{ 10.Bd3  Nd7  11.cxd5  exd5  would transpose to the mainline.   White could try to achieve b4 by going  10.Rb1  , but Black would then immediately stop it by playing  10...a4  . }
10... exd5 11. Bd3
{ Setting a cunning trap. The normal  11...Bf5  will get Black into serious trouble after  12.Ne2  when f3 is threatened to win a piece.   11.f3  Qh4+  12.g3  Nxg3  13.Qf2  doesn't work for White as Black has the simple  13...Nf5  getting out of the pin. }
11... Nd7 12. Ne2
{ 12.Nf3  Ndxc5  13.O-O  Nxd3  14.Qxd3  , the move  14...Ra6!  is a brilliant reply, transferring the rook to g6 and creating threats on the kingside with ...Bh3. White's bishop remains shut on c1 and Black gets an initiative on the kingside. }
12... Ndxc5 13. Bxe4 Nxe4
{ Black will quickly occupy the c-file by developing his bishop to d7 or f5 depending on White's next move. The other rook will come to e8 and the queen could go to h4. White's major issue is the c1-bishop which will still take time to come into play. However, we do have an isolated pawn which White's knight can block with Nd4. Thus the position remains equal. Black's moves are more energetic and easy to play while White must find a way to consolidate his position. }

7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. g3
{ White has tried this move several times, trying to get a Catalan-type position. The main problem for White is that Black is way ahead in tempi compared to the Catalan. Usually in the Catalan White would have castled by now, but here Black can get a comfortable position in several different ways. I will show what I consider the cleanest method. }
9... Ba6 { Immediately attacking the queen and developing with tempo. } 10. Qa4
Qd7
{ A subtle move. Normally it would not be ideal to exchange queens, but Black has found a hole in White's plan and immediately exploits it. Once the queens are exchanged, Black will develop his queenside pieces freely and plays ...c5. The fact that White has not castled yet makes all the difference. After playing Bg2 White still won't be able to castle as the e2-pawn is hanging! Based on this simple but effective idea Black decides to trade queens. }
11. Qxd7 Nbxd7 12. Bg2 Rac8
{ Black connects rooks and is ready to play ...c5 while White still cannot castle. This gives Black an easy position to play. }

9... Ba6 { Immediately attacking the queen and developing with tempo. } 10. Qc2
{ It isn't easy to find a better square. On b3 the queen would allow Black to play ...Nbd7 followed by ...c5 after which her majesty would soon come under attack once Black gets the knight to c5. 10. Qc3 on the other hand allows Black to attack the queen in the future with ...Nd5 or ...Ne4. Therefore White chooses a safe-looking square on c2. }
10... Bb7
{ Having forced White to play Qc2, the bishop returns to b7. It had no more job on a6 since the e2-pawn is protected by White's queen and White can freely play Bg2 followed by O-O. Black now takes advantage of White's queen's position on c2 in a different way. }
11. Bg2 Be4
{ We see the point of luring White's queen to c2. This tempo is what Black was looking for. }
12. Qc3
{ 12.Qc4  Nc6  would create more problems for White's queen with ...Na5 coming next. }
12... Qd5
{ Black has found a lovely setup. Now the g2-bishop has become useless. } 13.
O-O
{ The c7-pawn is untouchable. After  13.Qxc7  Nc6  White's queen would be in big trouble, and thanks to the pin on the f3-knight the pawn on d4 also hangs. }
13... Nc6 14. Be3 Rfd8
{ Black's queen on d5 together with the bishop on e4 nicely restricts the g2-bishop. The d4-pawn is under pressure, which in turn restricts the e3-bishop to a passive role. Next Black wants to play ...Rac8 and ...Na5 and look for the right moment to jump with ...Nc4/...Nb3 or go for ...c5. White cannot get his typical Catalan pressure, and the position remains dynamically balanced. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. h4
{ Kasparov's comeback novelty! When in 2017 Kasparov finally decided to come back to over the board play, the entire chess world was eager to see how Garry would fight back against the young generation after such a long vacation. His last over-the-board game was against Topalov back in 2005. 12 years of not playing seriously and he finally returned to play in a rapid tournament where the world's top players are playing. Despite not getting the result we are used to seeing from Kasparov, he did produce some great games. One of the gems was in this line where he unleashed a fascinating novelty against Nakamura by playing the move 9. h4.Earlier many top players reached this position, more than 500 games were played, but no one ever tried the move 9. h4. Gary tried this move not just once, but as many as three times in the same tournament. He defeated Nakamura but then lost to Aronian and drew with Anand in this line. It briefly came into fashion, but soon everyone realized it was more of rapid game preparation and was mainly based on surprise value. If Black knows how to deal with this move it is not at all scary. }
9... Ba6
{ Our typical response in this line. Nakamura played  9...c5  and lost, which was the very first game played with 9. h4. }
10. Qc2 c5
{ The most active and principled response. White has ignored his development by playing h4, so it is time to strike in the center at the first possible opportunity. }
11. dxc5 Nbd7
{ In the June 2020 Chessable Masters, Nakamura played  11...bxc5  against Ding Liren. I like the move  11...Nbd7  way more as it immediately creates issues with White's position, while it is also the fastest way Black can finish his development. }
12. c6
{ 12.cxb6  Rc8  White will soon run into huge trouble. Black's pieces are very active while White's pieces are still on their initial squares and his king is stuck in the center. After 12.c6 White at least keeps the c-file closed for the moment. }
12... Rc8 { Creating the threat of  13.--  Bb7  to pick up the c6-pawn. } 13.
b4 { Hoping for  13...Bb7  14.b5  . } 13... Nb8 14. Qb2
{ Playing for a trap. Black is unable to take on c6 due to the fork after  14...Nxc6?  15.b5  . }
14... Bb5
{ Black finally collects the c6-pawn and gains control over the c-file. The idea of ...Ba4 and ...Rc2 could be annoying for White in the future. h5 will be answered by ...h6 every time. After ...Ba4 there is also a mate threat on d1. Black has a comfortable position with enough counterplay. }

Also, the fact that White is still yet to develop f1 bishop and take care of his king adds up in favor of Black. The position remains balanced with all three results possible. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bf4
{ Nowadays this particular line is not so popular anymore as Black has found a nice way to counter the direct threat of taking on c7 that White created with 9. Bf4. }
9... Ba6
{ For the sake of rapid development Black is willing to sacrifice this pawn. This is a typical theme in this line. In many lines, we will be seeing that Black doesn't bother to protect the pawn since White's king remains in the center. }

11. Rd1

White can hold on by playing  12.Rc1  , but again, after  12...Qe7  , it would be difficult to deal with the double threat of ...Nb8/...Nc5 going for the c7-bishop. Once the c7-bishop is gone, Black typically will gain entry on the c-file before White can finish his development and take care of his king.   11.e4  was seen in Morozevich - Kramnik back in the 2009 Tal Memorial. Kramnik had effortless play after  11...Bxf1  12.Kxf1  c5  . Once again, Black quickly took control over the c-file and White's king remained weak on f1. Kramnik converted his advantage nicely and won the game. }
11... Rc8
{ I like 11... Rc8 among many other possible moves. It has never been seen before at the GM level. We want to play ...c5 using the advantage of the upcoming X-ray on White's queen with our rook on c8. The only disadvantage of 11... Rc8 is that our a7-pawn is vulnerable in the case of 12. Qa4. This must be the main reason why most players have refrained from playing 11... Rc8. }
12. Qa4 { The only attempt to punish 11... Rc8 } 12... Bb7 13. Qxa7 Be4
{ Along with White's uncastled king his queen is also exposed on a7. The only escape he has after Black goes ...Ra8 is to play Qxc7. This means that after a move like ...Nd5 or ...Nh5, moving the bishop from f4 could be very deadly. It is because of this bishop that White's queen is not getting trapped immediately. }
14. Nd2 Bd5
{ White cannot play e4 yet and Black is planning to trap the queen by playing ...e5 followed by ...Ra8. }
15. Qa4 Qe7
{ Finishing development. Black is completely ready to open up the game with ...c5. }
16. e3
{ 16.f3  c5  17.e4  Bc6  allows Black to win back the d4-pawn and maintain the balance. }
16... c5 17. Bb5 cxd4
{ White's main problem is that he cannot take back with  18.exd4  due to  18...e5  when after  19.dxe5  Black has the nice intermezzo  19...Bxg2  followed by  20.--  Nxe5  . White's king will be completely exposed in the center.     Hence the engine thinks it is time White admits his mistake and plays  18.O-O  , returning the extra pawn and allowing Black to grab the center with  18...e5  . This way White is at least not worse and the game remains equal. }

16... Qa5+ 17. Qc3 { Forced. Otherwise the a3-pawn would have been lost. }
17... Qxc3+ 18. bxc3 Bxd5

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rd1
{ When the 10. Rc1 idea did not work for Yu Yangi against Nikita Vitiugov, he switched to 10. Rd1 with the same aim of stopping Black from playing ...c5. }
10... Nbd7
{ Black prepares ...c5. In the case of  11.e3  he can already play  11...c5  as  12.dxc5  is nicely answered by the intermezzo  12...Bd5  attacking the queen on  c4  and then taking on  c5  with the knight. }
11. Ne5
{ This looks like a perfect way to distract Black from playing ...c5. White maximizes the strength of the pins that he has. The d8-queen is under a pin of the d1-rook indirectly and of the g5-bishop directly. The move Ne5 facilitates both the pins. }
11... h6
{ We want to get rid of one pin at a time. This ...h6 move is often beneficial in the Nimzo. On h4 White's bishop is somewhat out of play and loses control over the c1-square. Basically, the bishop on h4 cannot come to rescue the white king if Black launches an attack by opening up the c-file. This we will see in the 10. Rc1 line too. Now White must choose whether to put the bishop on h4 or give it by playing 12. Nxd7 }
12. Nxd7
{ At least by giving the bishop this way White manages to break up Black's kingside pawn structure. }
12... Qxd7 13. Bxf6 gxf6
{ This particular position was reached twice in a tournament game. The first game was between Sethuraman vs. Gelfand in 2017 and then in the Skilling open between Wesley and Magnus in November 2020. I think this shows the freshness and trendiness of this line. In both games, White chose to play the most critical  14.d5  , opening up his queen to attack Black's king. }
14. d5 Rad8
{ Going for the broken pawn structure that Black has on the kingside. Here Black has a lot of decent options. There is nothing wrong with Sethu's  14...Bxd5   or Magnus's  14...exd5  . Both are fine for Black and keep the balance. I personally like that the dynamic 14... Rad8 keeps open the option of retaking on d5 in multiple ways. }
15. Rd3 Kh7
{ First things first: let us secure the king. White has only two active pieces while we have four. Both logic and intuition say Black should be fine. }
16. Qf4
{ White could also try  16.Qh4  which would lead to the same position after our text move 16... Rg8. }
16... Rg8 17. Qxf6 exd5
{ With ...Rg6 we want to chase the queen away, and by playing ...d4 next we want to freeze White's kingside development. }
18. Rf3
{ A smart decision, attacking f7 and also vacating the d3-square for his bishop. }
18... d4
{ Of course, we are not going to allow White to develop his bishop that easily. We don't mind giving up pawns as long as White remains virtually two pieces down. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
19. Qxf7+
{ Nothing else would make sense at this point. White cannot develop the kingside, so he would rather grab a pawn and exchange queens. }
19... Rg7 20. Qxd7 Rgxd7 21. Rf4 c5
{ White remains a pawn up but it is unclear how or when he will develop his pieces. Black's queenside pawns look scary, since they are ready to march in full force right away. All of Black's pieces are well placed. It is actually strange that the computer thinks White is still okay and can escape with a 0.00 evaluation. In a practical game I think it is much easier to play Black. }

{ An equally strong reply. Black wants to eliminate White's main source of defense. Without the d1-rook, the king on e1 will be extremely vulnerable. By bringing the f8-rook to d8 Black keeps the c8-square for the other rook and creates an escape plan for his king via f8 in case of an emergency. }
17. Rxd8+
{ 17.Rc1  Rac8  18.Rh3  , the move  18...Qe5!  is very nice, threatening to take on both b2 and c5. Thanks to the f8-square Black doesn't have to worry about his king's safety. Black gets full compensation for his pawn as White's king remains shaky and the f1-bishop is asleep. }
17... Rxd8 18. Rh3
{ Yu Yangi had this position twice as White in the 2019 World Cup. First, he got it against Nikita Vitiugov, who played 18... Bd5, and three days later a second time against Ding Liren, who found an improvement and played the best move in the position. }
18... Rd5
{ Much stronger than Vitiugov's  18...Bd5  .  After 18... Rd5! Black threatens the deadly ...Rxc5-Rc1, directly going for White's king. Once Ding played and proved this line is totally fine for Black, this position was reached three more times at a high level. Each time Black had a comfortable position, and all games ended in a draw. }
19. Qg4+ Kf8 { Black's king remains safe on f8. } 20. Rc3 Rxc5 21. Rxc5 Qxc5
{ This position was reached in a correspondence game in 2020. The position remains completely equal by every means. Black's active pieces justify his broken pawn structure. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rd1
{ When the 10. Rc1 idea did not work for Yu Yangi against Nikita Vitiugov, he switched to 10. Rd1 with the same aim of stopping Black from playing ...c5. }
10... Nbd7
{ Black prepares ...c5. In the case of  11.e3  he can already play  11...c5  as  12.dxc5  is nicely answered by the intermezzo  12...Bd5  attacking the queen on  c4  and then taking on  c5  with the knight. }
11. Ne5
{ This looks like a perfect way to distract Black from playing ...c5. White maximizes the strength of the pins that he has. The d8-queen is under a pin of the d1-rook indirectly and of the g5-bishop directly. The move Ne5 facilitates both the pins. }
11... h6
{ We want to get rid of one pin at a time. This ...h6 move is often beneficial in the Nimzo. On h4 White's bishop is somewhat out of play and loses control over the c1-square. Basically, the bishop on h4 cannot come to rescue the white king if Black launches an attack by opening up the c-file. This we will see in the 10. Rc1 line too. Now White must choose whether to put the bishop on h4 or give it by playing 12. Nxd7 }
12. Bh4
{ Keeping the pin but agreeing to move the bishop off the h6-c1 diagonal. }
12... c5
{ Now that the h4-bishop is out and far from controlling anything that will happen on the queenside, Black rightly opens up the c-file. }
13. Nxd7 Qxd7 14. dxc5
{ 14.Bxf6  gxf6  15.dxc5  Qc7  would transpose to the main line. } 14... Qc7
15. Bxf6 gxf6
{ Black doesn't mind ruining his kingside pawn structure because White does not have that many pieces available for an attack. }
16. h4
{ A brilliant move. White tries to bring the dead rook on h1 into play via h3. }
16... Rfd8
{ An equally strong reply. Black wants to eliminate White's main source of defense. Without the d1-rook, the king on e1 will be extremely vulnerable. By bringing the f8-rook to d8 Black keeps the c8-square for the other rook and creates an escape plan for his king via f8 in case of an emergency. }
17. Rxd8+
{ 17.Rc1  Rac8  18.Rh3  , the move  18...Qe5!  is very nice, threatening to take on both b2 and c5. Thanks to the f8-square Black doesn't have to worry about his king's safety. Black gets full compensation for his pawn as White's king remains shaky and the f1-bishop is asleep. }
17... Rxd8 18. Rh3
{ Yu Yangi had this position twice as White in the 2019 World Cup. First, he got it against Nikita Vitiugov, who played 18... Bd5, and three days later a second time against Ding Liren, who found an improvement and played the best move in the position. }
18... Rd5
{ Much stronger than Vitiugov's  18...Bd5  .  After 18... Rd5! Black threatens the deadly ...Rxc5-Rc1, directly going for White's king. Once Ding played and proved this line is totally fine for Black, this position was reached three more times at a high level. Each time Black had a comfortable position, and all games ended in a draw. }
19. Rg3+
{ Forcing the king to go to f8 so that after ...Rxc5 White can pin the c5-rook with Qb4. }
19... Kf8 20. Rc3 Rxc5 21. Qb4 Kg7
{ Unpinning with immediate effect and going into an equal endgame. This position was reached twice in the games Yu Yangi - Ding Liren and Yilmaz - Berkes. Both times Black had no issues. The rooks are exchanged and the upcoming queen+bishop endgame is balanced. }

10. Rc1

10... h6
{ First things first. White has to take the call now about what to do with his bishop. His choices are limited to Bf4/Bh4 and Qxc7.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rc1
{ One of the primary reasons for this line being not so popular earlier. Only recently has Black found an impressive way to deal with this move, which completely revives this entire system. }
10... h6
{ First things first. White has to take the call now about what to do with his bishop. His choices are limited to Bf4/Bh4 and Qxc7. Taking on f6 doesn't make any sense as Black would get the active bishop for free, and White still can't take on c7 due to the reply ...Rc8.   11.Bxf6  Qxf6  12.Qxc7?  Rc8  and Black wins. }
11. Bh4 c5

That is a perfectly fine alternative, but I like 11...c5 because it keeps more winning chances and gives White more options to go wrong. It is the most direct approach and has been tried only once so far by GM Nikita Vitiugov, who played it as Black against Yu Yangi in the 2019 World Cup.The idea of 11... c5 is crystal clear: White tried to prevent ...c5 with all his force, and Black played it anyway, forcing White to accept the sacrifice - otherwise the move 10.Rc1 makes no sense whatsoever. }
12. dxc5
{ Nothing else can justify White's 10. Rc1 move. Black would reply ...Nbd7 and ...Rc8 in any case. }
12... Nbd7
{ Once again forcing White to play c6.   13.cxb6  runs into  13...Rc8  when White will be obliged to play  14.Qf4  and then Black would take on b6 with the queen, leaving White's kingside completely stupefied. The computers are giving -6 in favor of Black as White cannot save the upcoming attack on his king. ...Ne4/...Qb2/ ...Nd5 various threats are on the way.   Also, White cannot save the c5-pawn by playing  13.b4  due to  13...bxc5  14.bxc5  Nxc5  15.Qxc5  Rc8  16.Qe3  Qa5+  17.Kd1  Rfd8  leading to mate in 12 as per the machines, which is not difficult to see. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
13. c6 Rc8
{ Finally White gets a choice. His c6-pawn is attacked, and he can either go for  14.c7  and try to hold the pawn on the c7-square.   or White can attempt to play  14.Qa4  and try to keep the pawn on c6.   14.Nd4  won't help as that allows  14...Ne5  . }
14. c7 Qe7
{ With the simple threat of playing  15.--  Nc5  and taking the c7-pawn. } 15.
e3 Nc5
{ On the next move Black will pick up the c7-pawn, and White's queen will suffer on the c-file. Playing  16.b4  doesn't make any sense as Black can still take the pawn with  16...Rxc7  since the c5-knight is untouchable due to the hanging rook on c1 after  17.bxc5  Rxc5  .   Supporting the pawn by  16.Bg3  is of no help either. Black will simply eliminate the bishop first by going  16...Nfe4  when White is unable to save the bishop further as  17.Bf4  runs into  17...g5  . Eventually, Black will win the c7-pawn, and White's queen on c4 will be in trouble. ...Ba6 ideas could also be annoying. }
16. Be2
{ This makes sense. Realizing that he cannot save the pawn anymore, White decides to castle and take care of his hanging rook on c1. }
16... Rxc7 17. O-O Rfc8
{ Once again going for the c1-rook. White must now dislodge the c7-rook in order to protect his c1-rook. He cannot allow Black to play ...Nce4. }
18. Bg3 Rd7
{ White has managed to save his c1-rook, but now the material is even. All of Black's pieces are active and occupying nice squares. In theory White has the bishop pair, but practically it is of no use. The e2-bishop is significantly inferior to the b7-bishop. The other bishop on g3 will soon come under attack by a move like ...Nce4. Currently, ...Nd3 is a super annoying threat that will win material. White should also watch out for ...Ba6. The computer calls it flat 0.00, but I would take Black if I have to pick a color. I think his moves are easier to find than White's. }

16. e3
{ Seeing that he cannot stop ...Nd5 by normal means, White decides to finish his development on the kingside, which was due for a long time. He also has a devilish idea to save the c7-pawn. He is planning to play Bd8 as soon as the f6-knight moves. }
16... Nd5
{ We are not scared of the Bd8 move for reasons that we will see soon. For now, we just force White to fulfill his wish of playing Bd8 and cementing the c7-pawn. If you are interested in testing yourself, try figuring out what Black should play after 17. Bd8 before the MoveTrainer gives it away. }

Once White loses the c7-pawn the d8-bishop also falls, and the skewer on the c-file with hanging rook on c1 will start to speak in favor of Black.   The trick is that White is unable to take  18.cxb8=Q  due to  18...Qxb8  when the c1-rook is hanging at the end!   Using the same theme Black also stops White from  18.b5  because this is met by  18...Rfxd8  18.cxd8=Q+  Qxd8  , and once again the unfortunate c1-rook hangs. Meanwhile, there is nothing to be done about the c7-pawn. }

{ Taking advantage of White's king on the e-file, Black develops his last piece into the game. It is move 20, and White still has done nothing about his kingside. For now, Black just deals with the exd5 threat by introducing a discovered check that would pick up the queen on c4. }
21. Qb3
{ Getting away from the discovered check. Playing  21.Bg3  only helps Black when he can unpin himself with  21...Qe7  and then move his knight away.   21.Be2  doesn't help either as Black would opt for  21...Ba6  and then exchange on e2, again taking advantage of the opposition on the e-file, after which he would unpin his knight. Once this knight is unpinned it will be ready to jump to nice squares like c3 and f4, creating lots of problems for White. }
21... Qf4
{ Time to sac the material and go for an attack. The king in the center will do justice for Black. Right now White is forced to take the piece as  22.Bd3  is well answered by  22...Qg4  23.O-O  Nf4 }
22. exd5 exd5+ 23. Be2 Ba6
{ Thanks to the knight on c7 White is unable to play b5. This means he is going to lose heavy material.   24.O-O  is answered by  24...Bxe2  picking up one of the rooks. The computer evaluation of -6 in favor of Black is totally justified. }

White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rc1
{ One of the primary reasons for this line being not so popular earlier. Only recently has Black found an impressive way to deal with this move, which completely revives this entire system. }
10... h6
{ First things first. White has to take the call now about what to do with his bishop. His choices are limited to Bf4/Bh4 and Qxc7. Taking on f6 doesn't make any sense as Black would get the active bishop for free, and White still can't take on c7 due to the reply ...Rc8.   11.Bxf6  Qxf6  12.Qxc7?  Rc8  and Black wins. }
11. Bh4 c5
{ A lot of correspondence games have continued:   11...Nbd7  12.Qxc7  Rc8  13.Qxd8  Rxc1+  14.Kd2  Rxd8+  15.Kxc1  g5  16.Bg3  Ne4  , which gives Black sufficient compensation for the pawn. That is a perfectly fine alternative, but I like 11...c5 because it keeps more winning chances and gives White more options to go wrong. It is the most direct approach and has been tried only once so far by GM Nikita Vitiugov, who played it as Black against Yu Yangi in the 2019 World Cup.The idea of 11... c5 is crystal clear: White tried to prevent ...c5 with all his force, and Black played it anyway, forcing White to accept the sacrifice - otherwise the move 10.Rc1 makes no sense whatsoever. }
12. dxc5
{ Nothing else can justify White's 10. Rc1 move. Black would reply ...Nbd7 and ...Rc8 in any case. }
12... Nbd7
{ Once again forcing White to play c6.   13.cxb6  runs into  13...Rc8  when White will be obliged to play  14.Qf4  and then Black would take on b6 with the queen, leaving White's kingside completely stupefied. The computers are giving -6 in favor of Black as White cannot save the upcoming attack on his king. ...Ne4/...Qb2/ ...Nd5 various threats are on the way.   Also, White cannot save the c5-pawn by playing  13.b4  due to  13...bxc5  14.bxc5  Nxc5  15.Qxc5  Rc8  16.Qe3  Qa5+  17.Kd1  Rfd8  leading to mate in 12 as per the machines, which is not difficult to see. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
13. c6 Rc8
{ Finally White gets a choice. His c6-pawn is attacked, and he can either go for  14.c7  and try to hold the pawn on the c7-square.   or White can attempt to play  14.Qa4  and try to keep the pawn on c6.   14.Nd4  won't help as that allows  14...Ne5  . }
14. Qa4 Qc7
{ A powerful novelty based on a queen sacrifice. The only game that reached this position continued with 14... Nb8, which is also strong enough, but I think the move 14... Qc7 is more imaginative and interesting. Currently, we have the simple threat of taking on c6 with the bishop. }
15. Qxa7
{ This is the most challenging continuation. White takes the pawn and looks forward to a queen trade when he will be clearly better.   15.Bg3  is bad due to  15...Bxc6  when after  16.Bxc7  Bxa4  the pin on the c-file is fatal for White. He could exchange rooks with  17.Bf4  , but that will only allow another invasion of rook after  17...Rxc1+  18.Bxc1  Rc8  . }
15... Ne4
{ Preparing to bring either knight to c5. Then White cannot take cxb7 due to ...Nd3+ followed by ...Qxc1. On the previous move this was not an option as White would have taken on c5 with the rook first and then taken on b7. }
16. b4
{ Trying to prevent ...Nc5, but this opens up the more attacking prospects for Black. Now the a3-pawn becomes weak too! }
16... Ne5 17. Bg3
{ Trying to pin the knight does not help as Black has a brilliant way to unpin it. }
17... Qd7 18. Bxe5
{ 18.cxd7  Rxc1#  and  18.Nxe5  Qd2#  are both mate, so this remains the only possible move for White. }
18... Rxc6
{ Either White will get mated or his queen on a7 will be lost. He cannot defend against both threats. }

The rook on h1 and the bishop on f1 are of no help either.   It is all about piece placement and domination. Black's rooks are going to enter via the c-file and White cannot prevent this. The strongest machines evaluate the position as 0.00, but it is a tight-rope walk for White.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rc1
{ One of the primary reasons for this line being not so popular earlier. Only recently has Black found an impressive way to deal with this move, which completely revives this entire system. }
10... h6
{ First things first. White has to take the call now about what to do with his bishop. His choices are limited to Bf4/Bh4 and Qxc7. Taking on f6 doesn't make any sense as Black would get the active bishop for free, and White still can't take on c7 due to the reply ...Rc8.   11.Bxf6  Qxf6  12.Qxc7?  Rc8  and Black wins. }

That is a perfectly fine alternative, but I like 11...c5 because it keeps more winning chances and gives White more options to go wrong. It is the most direct approach and has been tried only once so far by GM Nikita Vitiugov, who played it as Black against Yu Yangi in the 2019 World Cup.The idea of 11... c5 is crystal clear: White tried to prevent ...c5 with all his force, and Black played it anyway, forcing White to accept the sacrifice - otherwise the move 10.Rc1 makes no sense whatsoever. }

Black wants to play ...Rb1 next. Then why didn't he play that directly? Answering this question will help us to understand why we played 20...Rc8!

Now it is all crystal clear. To prevent the move 24.Kc2 Black needs to play ...Rc8 first. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
21. Qxb6 Rb1 { Once again going for the ...Nc3+ threat. } 22. Qb4
{ Apparently, the only move. I understand I am going deep here but in general, it is fun to analyze such positions just to enhance one's general understanding of the game. This was the only way by which White could stop ...Nc3+. }
22... f5
{ Seeing that White is completely stuck, Black gives a deadly mate threat. He wants to play:   23.--  Ba6+  24.Kf3  Rxf1+!!  25.Rxf1  Ng5+  26.Kf4  Nd3#  . I encourage the readers to analyze such positions independently and never to memorize the details. Rather try to understand the logic behind it to always figure things out over the board. According to the best engines, this position is still 0.00, but White has to figure out every tiny detail to avoid getting lost. }
23. Be5 Nd3 24. Qxb7 Re1+
{ 25.Kxd3  Rd1+  26.Ke2  Rd2+  again leads to mate, so White's next move is forced. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Nf3
{ This move is just as popular as 7. Bg5. White is focusing on his kingside development first, trying to consolidate as fast as possible to prove his bishop pair advantage. Unlike in the 7. Bg5 variation, here Black cannot play the  7...c5  break since after  8.dxc5  the crucial move 8... d4 is missing, as the d4-square is controlled by the f3-knight. }
7... dxc4
{ A very interesting and concrete decision. Black gives up the center to gain some more time against White's queen. White must take back the pawn - otherwise Black will simply protect it with ...b5. }
8. Qxc4 b6
{ Through a nice cunning move order, Black manages to restrict White from developing his kingside pieces. Black was ready to give up his central d5-pawn to achieve this. Thanks to the idea of ...Ba6 White won't be able to develop normally by playing e3. Each time White tries to play e3 it will be answered by ...Ba6 and ...Bxf1, denying White the option of castling kingside. }
9. Bg5
{ By far the most popular choice. Now that the ...c5 break is not available, White pins the f6-knight to restrict Black's play. Given the chance White will play e4 next. }
9... Bb7
{ This is a trendy way of playing. Earlier Black almost exclusively chose  9...Ba6  attacking the queen on c4. The modern 9... Bb7 is much more subtle. It stops White from playing e4 to start with and prepares ...Nbd7/...c5 ideas.   One of the most important things to understand is how Black intends to deal with  10.Rc1  , which directly attacks the c7-pawn before Black is ready to play ...c5 or ...Rc8. }
10. Rc1
{ One of the primary reasons for this line being not so popular earlier. Only recently has Black found an impressive way to deal with this move, which completely revives this entire system. }
10... h6
{ First things first. White has to take the call now about what to do with his bishop. His choices are limited to Bf4/Bh4 and Qxc7. Taking on f6 doesn't make any sense as Black would get the active bishop for free, and White still can't take on c7 due to the reply ...Rc8.   11.Bxf6  Qxf6  12.Qxc7?  Rc8  and Black wins. }
11. Bh4 c5
{ A lot of correspondence games have continued:   11...Nbd7  12.Qxc7  Rc8  13.Qxd8  Rxc1+  14.Kd2  Rxd8+  15.Kxc1  g5  16.Bg3  Ne4  , which gives Black sufficient compensation for the pawn. That is a perfectly fine alternative, but I like 11...c5 because it keeps more winning chances and gives White more options to go wrong. It is the most direct approach and has been tried only once so far by GM Nikita Vitiugov, who played it as Black against Yu Yangi in the 2019 World Cup.The idea of 11... c5 is crystal clear: White tried to prevent ...c5 with all his force, and Black played it anyway, forcing White to accept the sacrifice - otherwise the move 10.Rc1 makes no sense whatsoever. }
12. dxc5
{ Nothing else can justify White's 10. Rc1 move. Black would reply ...Nbd7 and ...Rc8 in any case. }
12... Nbd7
{ Once again forcing White to play c6.   13.cxb6  runs into  13...Rc8  when White will be obliged to play  14.Qf4  and then Black would take on b6 with the queen, leaving White's kingside completely stupefied. The computers are giving -6 in favor of Black as White cannot save the upcoming attack on his king. ...Ne4/...Qb2/ ...Nd5 various threats are on the way.   Also, White cannot save the c5-pawn by playing  13.b4  due to  13...bxc5  14.bxc5  Nxc5  15.Qxc5  Rc8  16.Qe3  Qa5+  17.Kd1  Rfd8  leading to mate in 12 as per the machines, which is not difficult to see. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
13. c6 Rc8
{ Finally White gets a choice. His c6-pawn is attacked, and he can either go for  14.c7  and try to hold the pawn on the c7-square.   or White can attempt to play  14.Qa4  and try to keep the pawn on c6.   14.Nd4  won't help as that allows  14...Ne5  . }
14. Qa4 Nb8
{ This is an alternative to my main recommendation  14...Qc7  that I would also like to provide just to have more options. Also, some players might not be so keen to make a long-term queen sacrifice. For them, I suggest this line, which involves a short-term queen sacrifice. ;-@@EndBracket@@  This is the move that was played by Vitiugov in his World Cup match against Yu Yangi. }
15. Ne5 Nxc6
{ Despite trying so hard, White could not save the c-pawn. Taking on c6 will be answered with ...Qd6 or ...Qd7 when White will be forced to give back the piece, after which Black will soon gain full control of the c-file. Once again, courtesy of White's sleeping pieces on the kingside. }
16. Ng4 b5 { The pawn is poisoned  17.Qxb5  Nd4  wins for Black. } 17. Nxf6+
Qxf6
{ Now if  18.Bxf6  we play  18...bxa4  ,   while  18.Qxb5  is answered by  18...Qxh4  . }
18. Bxf6 bxa4
{ White still has to develop his kingside. Luckily he doesn't have any serious weaknesses, and without queens, it is not easy to attack White's king. The game soon ended in a draw after the moves  19.Bc3  Ne7  . Eventually, Black's knight went to  d5  and Black achieved a comfortable position. Model Game with analysis }

Black has great compensation and the engine approves it with 0.00, claiming that White should find a good way to liquidate the game somehow. This variation can always be an alternate solution as Black, but I personally prefer the mainline with the long-term queen sac which is way more romantic and challenging to White than this line. :- @@EndBracket@@ }

{ White doesn't wish to ruin his pawn structure, so he makes another move with his queen. This has the same logic that employed on move 4 when he opted for Qc2. However, when we attack the queen with ...Nc6 White will already have to make his 4th move with the queen in the first 10 moves.

8. e3
{ With this move White chickens out immediately and admits that he doesn't want to fight for an advantage. Black gets very comfortable play after this move. }
8... cxd4
{ Forcing White to make a difficult choice. If he takes back with the pawn he will inevitably be saddled with an isolated pawn after Black plays ...dxc4. If White takes with the queen, Black will respond with ...Nc6, gaining more time and forcing White to waste another move. }

He went for ...Nc6 and ...Rd8 to start with, and White had to suffer for a long time before he eventually lost. We will now examine why Turner did not play the natural 11. Bh4. }
11... Nc6 12. Nf3 Nd5
{ A typical tactic in the Nimzo Classical variation with White's queen on c3 and his dark-squared bishop on h4 or g5. Black liquidates the position in order to take advantage of White's worse pawn structure. }
13. Bxd8
{ Otherwise Black will move his queen to a5 or b6, keeping the pressure on the d4-pawn. White's bishop on h4 will then be completely out of play. With 13. Bxd8 White is trying to get rid of his isolated pawn. }
13... Nxc3 14. bxc3
{ Otherwise Black would save the knight and White would have gotten nothing out of the opening. Ideally in the Classical variation White should aim for this type of setup, but I show this variation as an example of why White is unable to play normally. It also explains why, in the previously mentioned game by Adams, White took on f6 instead, accepting a slightly worse position. }
14... Rxd8
{ At first glance, it is Black who looks under-developed with a passive bishop on c8. But if we think slightly deeper, it becomes clear that White is in danger while Black's moves will flow naturally. Black doesn't have any weaknesses and his next few moves could be ...b6, ...Bb7, ...Rac8, ...Na5, etc.   White has managed to get rid of the isolated pawn on d4, but only to create another fresh weakness on c3! His bishop looks active but essentially is doing nothing on c4 and will soon be chased by ...Rac8 and ...Na5. Black also has a lovely square on c4 which he can control with all his pieces. If White could magically switch the position of his minor pieces he would surely be better. Imagine the white bishop on f3 preventing ...b6, and the white knight on c4 preventing ...Na5, making Black suffocate on the queenside.   Unfortunately, it takes four free moves to achieve that, so it is good to imagine but totally unrealistic. Black is way ahead and can finish his queenside development with utmost peace of mind. }

{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact.

5. a3

5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Bg5
{ White wants to play e3 but first makes sure his bishop is outside the pawn chain. This way, he also manages to pin the f6-knight, making it a bit more difficult for Black to open up the game. }
7... c5
{ One of Team Anand's ideas that was found back in approximately 2008. Radoslav Wojtaszek, more commonly known among his friends as Radek, got the first chance to use this idea in a tournament game in March 2009.

8. cxd5
{ This happened in one of my games in 2014 against GM Nijat Abasov. White is opening up the game, exchanging both of his central pawns. White is counting on his bishop pair advantage, while Black claims he is ahead in development. Time is the key factor for Black. He should not give White the opportunity to consolidate by finishing development quickly. If that would happen,   White's bishop pair could become dangerous in this open position. However, just by looking at White's kingside it is clear that White won't be able to finish his development so easily. }
8... cxd4 9. Qxd4 Nc6
{ A nice intermediate move, taking advantage of the pin. Black develops another piece with tempo before retaking on d5. }
10. Qh4
{ It is important that White cannot play:  10.Bxf6  due to the simple fork tactics coming up after  10...Nxd4  11.Bxd8  Nc2+  12.Kd2  Nxa1  , when thanks to the pawn on a3 and White's inactive pieces on the kingside, Black's knight will peacefully escape from a1 via b3. Other queen retreats are not scary either.   If White goes for:  10.Qd2  then after  10...exd5  there is no chance White will complete his development before Black strikes in the center with a timely ...Re8 followed by ...d4. With the queen on d2, ...h6 also becomes annoying since active moves like ...g5 followed by ...Ne4 are in the air if White replies Bh4. With the queen on h4 White hopes to ruin Black's pawn structure with Bxf6 at some point.   Note that he cannot do this by playing:  10.Qf4  , which is met tactically by  10...Nxd5  attacking White's queen on f4 and removing the pin on the knight. }
10... Qa5+
{ There is absolutely nothing wrong with:  10...exd5  , which also gives Black easy play.  11.Bxf6  could then be answered in both ways.  11...Qxf6  aims for a queenless middlegame in which every single white piece will be undeveloped, which allows Black to get a quick entry over the c-file. Black could also take  11...gxf6  , making sure that White's king comes under direct fire with the queens on the board, and Black would play a timely ...d4 break. However, I prefer 10... Qa5 over 10... exd5 as it literally forces White to either get into a worse position or give a perpetual check. Those who want to keep the game going and want to fight on can choose 10... exd5. From an opening point of view, I think it is already good enough when we can force White to choose the correct path to make a draw. Abasov didn't want to go for a perpetual as White and soon got into some serious trouble. I eventually won the game. }
11. b4
{ Forced. Otherwise, White won't be able to take on f6 and soon faces a terrible attack. }
11... Qxd5
{ So what was the subtle point of making White play b4? The idea is to get the c3-square for Black's queen. With the pawn on b4 instead of b2 White's rook is vulnerable and can come under attack. }
12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Qxf6
{ Taking control over the c3-square, but White's kingside army is still sleeping. }
13... e5
{ Blocking the queen, threatening ...Rd8 and opening up the c8-bishop. The c3-square once again becomes weak. }
14. Nf3
{ White could give a perpetual with:  14.Qg5+  Kh8  15.Qf6+  if he wanted to. }
14... Be6
{ White will soon be forced to give a perpetual in order not to get slaughtered in the center. ...Rad8, ...Qb3, ...Nd4 and ...a5 are just some of the moves that are coming. The queen on f6 is optically scary, but a lone queen cannot do anything more than giving perpetual to our king. }
15. e3 Qb3
{ With ...Qc3 coming next, White can barely delay the perpetual another move. }
16. Nd2 Qc3
{ It is now or never. Once Black gets in ...Rfd8, White's perpetual will not be available anymore. It is high time for White to settle for peace. }

8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play  8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }

Black claims that White's king is stuck in the center, so it is high time to open up the game.

This is very typical of Anand's preparation, finding a new direction as early as possible and making it sharp and concrete. Needless to say, this line has since become trendy at the highest level.

{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible.

5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Bg5
{ White wants to play e3 but first makes sure his bishop is outside the pawn chain. This way, he also manages to pin the f6-knight, making it a bit more difficult for Black to open up the game. }
7... c5
{ One of Team Anand's ideas that was found back in approximately 2008. Radoslav Wojtaszek, more commonly known among his friends as Radek, got the first chance to use this idea in a tournament game in March 2009. One week later Anand himself used it against Morozevich in a rapid game, and a new trend was set.Once again the idea is crystal clear. Black claims that White's king is stuck in the center, so it is high time to open up the game. Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn, grab total central control, and quickly develop his queenside pieces. This is very typical of Anand's preparation, finding a new direction as early as possible and making it sharp and concrete. Needless to say, this line has since become trendy at the highest level. It is easy to understand and it forces White to get into some concrete variations. White can forget about getting a slight and long-term edge based on the bishop pair. }
8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play  8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }
8... d4
{ This is the main point of the move 7...c5. Black gains further control over the center by gaining an important tempo. All that remains for Black is to play ...e5 at the earliest possible opportunity. }
9. Qc2
{ This particular response, along with the move  9.Qg3  , became quite popular when the 7... c5 variation became trendy for Black. White tries to hang to the c5-pawn, not fighting for the center, and allows Black to play an immediate ...e5. }
9... e5
{ Without a second thought, we should seize the center. It is high time White should do something about his kingside pieces and his majesty. }
10. e3
{ The most critical move for Black. After  10.O-O-O  h6  11.Bh4  Qe7  12.e3  we would transpose to the mainline. }
10... h6 { Again going after White's most annoying piece. } 11. Bh4
{ This bishop is White's only developed minor piece and the one which causes Black some trouble, restricting Black's queen due to the constant threat of Bxf6 ruining Black's pawn structure. White is not going to say goodbye to this bishop that easily. }
11... Qe7
{ We are threatening to take on e3 and then go for ...Qxc5. There is a subtle reason why we did not reverse the move order of ...dxe3 and ...Qe7. By keeping the pawn on d4, Black will be able to stop White from developing freely with Be2, and Nf3 as that can often be met by tactical fork ideas of ...d3 and ...e4, a motif that we shall see next. }
12. Be2
{ A cunning move. If Black goes for  12...dxe3  13.fxe3  Qxc5  then after  14.Bxf6  Black will not have the intermediate move  14...Qxe3+  . That is the reason White starts with 12.Be2 instead of 12.Nf3. White is planning to finish his kingside development with Nf3 next. }
12... Re8
{ This is important prophylaxis. White is planning to play  Nf3  next, and Black decides to take care of that. Now  13.Nf3?  can be answered with a cute tactical fork combination:  13...d3!  14.Bxd3  e4  winning a piece. This is the reason we need our rook on e8 - to have enough support on the e4-square. A very nice way to stop Nf3! }
13. Rd1
{ Being unable to play Nf3, White makes an innocent-looking move with a subtle idea in mind. On the previous move, he could not play  13.b4  due to  ...a5  ideas. He now moves his rook from the a-file, hoping to play b4 at the right moment. }
13... a5
{ We are in no rush. Nf3 still does not work, so why not stop White from playing b4 too? We are also ready to sacrifice our d4-pawn for the sake of further rapid development. }
14. exd4 exd4 15. Rxd4
{ White ignores his kingside development once again and shamelessly grabs another pawn. This allows us to develop another piece with tempo. }
15... Nc6 16. Rd6 { Making sure the c5-pawn remains safe. } 16... Qe4
{ A counter-intuitive move. White's king is in the middle of the board and White is two pawns up, yet this is the moment Black chooses to force a queen exchange! It has very concrete reasoning. White is not only forced to exchange queens but more importantly, he must play  17.Qxe4  to save the g2-pawn. After  17...Nxe4  Black gains another important tempo, which is why he offers the queen trade. }
17. Qxe4 Nxe4
{ White will have to save his rook and also give up the c5-pawn as  18.Rd5  Be6  is even worse. Black will play either ...Bf5 first and then ...Nxc5 or vice versa, and open up the e-file for his rook. This will make it very hard for White to castle. The computers say Black is clearly better and I can totally understand that by looking at White's king, who will be stuck in the center for quite some time. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible.

14. Nf3
{ This was tried by Nepo against Karjakin once, but to be honest, I do not understand why Karjakin did not accept the piece sacrifice. We see that White has almost no good alternative to developing his knight to f3, so he takes his chance by sacrificing a whole piece. }
14... d3
{ The game Nepo vs. Karjakin continued with:  14...Nc6  , which is a solid option for Black. Karjakin had a stable position throughout the game, which eventually ended in a draw. He eventually took White's piece using the same tactics after Nepo played  15.O-O  , but I think it is better to take the piece right away. }
15. Rxd3
{ The best bet. This way White can open up the g-file, which might have scared Karjakin, who was probably out of his preparation. }
15... e4 16. Rd6 exf3 17. Bxf6 fxg2
{ The g-file would have been opened anyway with gxf3. With this subtle intermezzo, Black grabs another pawn. }
18. Rg1 gxf6 19. Rxg2+ Kh8
{ White is a whole piece down. He does have some compensation due to our exposed king, but I don't see any way for White to make a draw immediately. Lc0 thinks Black is slightly better, while Stockfish thinks Black is just winning. My human evaluation would be that White is struggling as there is no direct way to attack Black's king. One vital resource for Black is to play ...Ra6, which will either eliminate White's active rook from d6 or allow Black's a6-rook to protect the vulnerable h6-pawn after playing ...f5. }

6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense.

However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Bg5

It is easy to understand and it forces White to get into some concrete variations. White can forget about getting a slight and long-term edge based on the bishop pair. }
8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play  8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }
8... d4
{ This is the main point of the move 7...c5. Black gains further control over the center by gaining an important tempo. All that remains for Black is to play ...e5 at the earliest possible opportunity. }
9. Qg3 { A logical way to stop Black from grabbing the center with ...e5. }
9... Nbd7
{ Creating two threats at the same time: ...Nxc5 and ...e5.   10.b4  as always is met by  10...a5  , opening up the a-file for the a8-rook. }
10. Nf3
{ The fight for the e5-square is of the utmost importance. White consistently tries to stop Black from playing ...e5 and at the same time he creates a threat of taking on d4 and a subtle positional threat of playing Qd6, tying down Black's pieces.   This is a critical moment for Black in this line. If he takes with  10...Nxc5  then after  11.Rd1  he might lose the important d4-pawn. }
10... e5
{ A fine imaginative way to make the idea of ...Nxc5 work. Once White takes on e5 with the knight, Black plays ...Nxc5 when the d4-pawn is no longer hanging after Rd1. By sacrificing the e-pawn, Black also opens up the e-file for his rook to bring more pressure toward White's uncastled king.   A move like  11.Bh6  only helps Black as he can parry the mate threat on g7 with  11...Ne8  , which will clear the f-pawn to join the massive block of central pawns with ...f5 next. }
11. Nxe5
{ The principled move. White accepts the pawn sacrifice and tests whether it is poisoned or not! }
11... Nxc5
{ Having cunningly lured White into moving his knight from f3, Black has made sure that his d4-pawn is secure. Another important thing to note is that with a white knight on f3 Black did not have a clear threat since ...Nce4 could be met by Qe5. Here, on the contrary, ...Nce4 is a big threat that would simply win the game. }
12. Qf3
{ Getting away from the ...Nce4 fork and planning to take on f6 next.   12.O-O-O  Bf5  looks awfully scary - with ...Nb3+ ideas hanging in the air White's king won't find any peace of mind. Moving back with the e5-knight would only allow Black to play ...Nce4 or ...Re8, giving him a tremendous initiative. The move  12.Qf3  also leads to a bad position, but Black should know how to respond as White has an immediate threat of taking on f6. }
12... Qb6 { Going for the b2-pawn, giving White no time to take on f6. } 13. b4
Nfe4
{ Another energetic move by Black.  14.bxc5  runs into  14...Qa5+  followed by taking the bishop on  g5  .   14.Bf4  can be answered with the wild and strong  14...g5  , going ruthlessly after the bishop, or the simpler  14...Re8  when White cannot take  15.bxc5  due to  15...Qa5+  16.Kd1  Rxe5  which is completely winning. The e5-rook is immune due to the mate threat on  d2  . }
14. Be7
{ Creating a double attack while Black's rook is tied down to the protection of the f7-pawn. }
14... Qe6 { 14...Qc7  is equally strong with the same idea. } 15. Bxf8 Qxe5 16.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible.

{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3!

12... Qb6 { Going for the b2-pawn, giving White no time to take on f6. } 13.

16. Bb4
{ Trying his best to hang on. This was the only possible way to stop both threats mentioned previously. }
16... a5
{ White cannot allow Black to take on b2 with the queen. The strength of the a1-knight will increase massively once the queen joins the attack. Given a choice, White would rather give the f1-bishop for free, but who wants to take that piece now! }
17. c5
{ This is White's last chance. If Black plays the careless  17...Qb5  , White would turn the tables by playing  18.e4  with a winning position. }
17... Qc7
{ The final precise move. Black aims for the e5-knight. White has to give up a piece after which material will be even. White's king won't have any escape route, and he might have to give more material to ensure his king's safety. The engines evaluate this position as about -3, which underlines the fact that Black is winning. }

{ ...Bf5 followed by ...Nb3+ is a deadly mate threat that Black has in mind. }
13. Nxe5
{ A fearless way to stop the idea of ...Bf5 and ...Nb3+. Now  13...Bf5  is not possible as White has  14.exd4  controlling the b3-square with his queen on g3!  White is also not scared of the direct move:   13...Nb3+  as that can be dealt with by  14.Kc2  attacking the b3-knight. Black must come up with a strong plan. }
13... h6
{ An unexpected resource. First of all, it allows White to play  14.Bxh6  . Black then has the cunning idea of playing  14...Nh5  , attacking the queen on g3. This queen is protecting the e5-knight, which will be captured next by our e8-rook. So 14. Bxh6 is out of the question.   What about the move 14. Bh4?How does that help Black? After  14.Bh4  Nce4  suddenly White cannot play  15.Qf4  due to  15...g5  , which wins a piece.   That leaves two important moves to check, the simple  14.Bxf6   and the wild  14.h4 }
14. h4
{ Trying to spice things up, White keeps the pin intact and skillfully saves the g5-bishop by actually offering to sacrifice it! Of course, taking the bishop would mean opening the h-file which leads to disaster for Black. }
14... Nfe4
{ Once White is committed to h4 this move becomes more powerful, as it will ruin White's pawn structure. }
15. Bxd8 Nxg3 16. fxg3 Rxe5
{ The bishop on d8 is not doing any harm and soon we will gain time by attacking it. Therefore we grab the far more dangerous e5-knight instead. }
17. exd4
{ Black is currently two pawns down, and his pieces are in a fork. What was Black thinking before getting here? The answer lies in Black's next two moves. }
17... Nb3+ 18. Kc2
{ 18.Kb1  is directly answered by  18...Bf5+  19.Ka2  Re3  when the d8-bishop hangs while Black also threatens to win the d1- rook with ...Bc2. White cannot defend against both threats. }
18... Re3
{ Protecting the knight and threatening ...Bf5, attacking the d8-bishop. This forces White to play Bd3 right away, returning his extra material. }
19. Bd3 Nxd4+ 20. Kc3
{ 20.Kd2  is answered with the simple  20...Rxg3  , regaining the sacrificed material and keeping the initiative. With 20. Kc3 White tries to be smart and attacks the d4-knight. This would be great for White if only Black did not have the following stunning comeback. }
20... Bf5
{ 21.Kxd4  Rxd3+  22.Rxd3  Rxd8+  wins a piece for Black. Meanwhile  21.Ba5  is met by  21...Ne6  , maintaining the pin on d3 and planning to play ...b6 followed by ...Rd8. White is in grave danger. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Bg5
{ White wants to play e3 but first makes sure his bishop is outside the pawn chain. This way, he also manages to pin the f6-knight, making it a bit more difficult for Black to open up the game. }
7... c5
{ One of Team Anand's ideas that was found back in approximately 2008. Radoslav Wojtaszek, more commonly known among his friends as Radek, got the first chance to use this idea in a tournament game in March 2009. One week later Anand himself used it against Morozevich in a rapid game, and a new trend was set.Once again the idea is crystal clear. Black claims that White's king is stuck in the center, so it is high time to open up the game. Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn, grab total central control, and quickly develop his queenside pieces. This is very typical of Anand's preparation, finding a new direction as early as possible and making it sharp and concrete. Needless to say, this line has since become trendy at the highest level. It is easy to understand and it forces White to get into some concrete variations. White can forget about getting a slight and long-term edge based on the bishop pair. }
8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play  8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }
8... d4
{ This is the main point of the move 7...c5. Black gains further control over the center by gaining an important tempo. All that remains for Black is to play ...e5 at the earliest possible opportunity. }
9. Qg3 { A logical way to stop Black from grabbing the center with ...e5. }
9... Nbd7
{ Creating two threats at the same time: ...Nxc5 and ...e5.   10.b4  as always is met by  10...a5  , opening up the a-file for the a8-rook. }
10. Nf3
{ The fight for the e5-square is of the utmost importance. White consistently tries to stop Black from playing ...e5 and at the same time he creates a threat of taking on d4 and a subtle positional threat of playing Qd6, tying down Black's pieces.   This is a critical moment for Black in this line. If he takes with  10...Nxc5  then after  11.Rd1  he might lose the important d4-pawn. }
10... e5
{ A fine imaginative way to make the idea of ...Nxc5 work. Once White takes on e5 with the knight, Black plays ...Nxc5 when the d4-pawn is no longer hanging after Rd1. By sacrificing the e-pawn, Black also opens up the e-file for his rook to bring more pressure toward White's uncastled king.   A move like  11.Bh6  only helps Black as he can parry the mate threat on g7 with  11...Ne8  , which will clear the f-pawn to join the massive block of central pawns with ...f5 next. }
11. e3
{ Attacking the d4-pawn. This pawn is very annoying from White's point of view, blocking his kingside development. If White starts with  11.O-O-O  Re8  12.e3  , we can play  12...Nxc5  transposing back to 11. e3. }
11... Re8
{ Taking care of 12. exd4 and 12. Be2 at the same time.  12.exd4  exd4+  will now come with a check.   12.Be2  can be answered with  12...d3  when White cannot capture the pawn due to the ...e4 fork. }
12. O-O-O Nxc5
{ ...Bf5 followed by ...Nb3+ is a deadly mate threat that Black has in mind. }
13. Nxe5
{ A fearless way to stop the idea of ...Bf5 and ...Nb3+. Now  13...Bf5  is not possible as White has  14.exd4  controlling the b3-square with his queen on g3!  White is also not scared of the direct move:   13...Nb3+  as that can be dealt with by  14.Kc2  attacking the b3-knight. Black must come up with a strong plan. }

14. Bxf6 Qxf6
{ White has to take care of his f2-weakness first before he can take on d4. }
15. f4 { 15.exd4  Ne4  is worse for White due to the loss of the f2-pawn. }
15... dxe3 16. Qxe3
{ Black would love to play  16...Qb6  with the idea of  ...Nb3+  , but unfortunately that is now prevented because of  17.b4  . Black comes up with a great idea, however. }
16... a5
{ Realizing that  17.Qxc5  is, after all, not a threat as Black has  17...Qxf4+  and the e5-knight falls. With  16...a5  Black stops White from playing b4 and he threatens to play ...Qb6 with the idea of ...Nb3+. White is more or less forced to take on c5 when Black gets back both the piece and the pawn while keeping the initiative thanks to White's exposed king. }

17... Be6 18. Rd2 Rfd8

19. Qe3 Rd4
{ In the game I played the move  19...Qc6  , which was not in the spirit of the position, and eventually I lost the game after a long endgame fight. I should have gone for 19... Rd4, which gives Black huge compensation for a pawn that he can win back anytime. With the king exposed on c1 and Black's rook occupying the lovely d4-square, White is the one who should be worried. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Bg5
{ White wants to play e3 but first makes sure his bishop is outside the pawn chain. This way, he also manages to pin the f6-knight, making it a bit more difficult for Black to open up the game. }
7... c5
{ One of Team Anand's ideas that was found back in approximately 2008. Radoslav Wojtaszek, more commonly known among his friends as Radek, got the first chance to use this idea in a tournament game in March 2009. One week later Anand himself used it against Morozevich in a rapid game, and a new trend was set.Once again the idea is crystal clear. Black claims that White's king is stuck in the center, so it is high time to open up the game. Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn, grab total central control, and quickly develop his queenside pieces. This is very typical of Anand's preparation, finding a new direction as early as possible and making it sharp and concrete. Needless to say, this line has since become trendy at the highest level. It is easy to understand and it forces White to get into some concrete variations. White can forget about getting a slight and long-term edge based on the bishop pair. }
8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play  8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }
8... d4
{ This is the main point of the move 7...c5. Black gains further control over the center by gaining an important tempo. All that remains for Black is to play ...e5 at the earliest possible opportunity. }
9. Qf3
{ A very interesting move that was prepared by Team Anand for the white side!! We wanted to use this idea in the 2010 World Championship match against Topalov. It was a novelty back then when only 9. Qc2   and  9.Qg3  were the popular moves.   However, there was a major block in the line which was causing us a lot of trouble to make this line work from White's perspective. No one ever played this, and as a result 9.Qf3 and the counter- novelty against it remained buried for 9 years. :- @@EndBracket@@  In the 2019 Asian Championship, I took an early lead by defeating Sethuraman and Maghsoodloo and drawing with Wei Yi.   I was then paired with the extremely well-prepared Vidit Gujrathi. He unleashed the move 9.Qf3 which had only been played once before on a GM level. I was excited to finally used the counter-novelty that we found back in 2009 as preparation for the match against Topalov. The idea of 9. Qf3 is to keep the f6- knight under attack and to prepare a quick O-O-O. }
9... Nbd7
{ Before playing ...e5 Black first takes care of the Bxf6 idea. Nothing can stop Black from playing ...e5 next, while ...Nxc5 is also a threat. }
10. e3
{ Taking advantage of the fact that:  10...Nxc5  can be met by  11.Bxf6  , giving Black a doubled pawn after which White can run with  11...gxf6  12.O-O-O  and claim a clearly better position. In that case, White would have solved the issue with his king in a lovely manner.   Note that White cannot reverse the move order by starting with  10.O-O-O  since after  10...e5  the move  11.e3  is answered with  11...e4  followed by ...d3, entombing the bishop on f1.   White is also not on time to save the c5 pawn with  10.b4  , because this allows  10...a5  , opening up the queenside and pouring water on White's plan of running his king to the queenside. Let us not forget that the white queen occupies the square that belongs to his knight. The only way he can justify this is by castling long which is, by the way, the main idea of 9. Qf3. }

In either case, it gives White a tremendous initiative. His strong queenside majority protected by a lovely bishop and knight guarantee him a clearly winning position. Initially, we were very pleased with this novelty of ours back in 2009, but then one day we came up with a powerful counter idea by Black, sacrificing a third pawn. }

{ White was threatening to play Qa4 and fully consolidate his position. We cannot give White the time to do that. }
18. Rd6
{ Besides  18.Rd2  , this is the other rook move that makes sense. Black is going to play ...Rb3 no matter what, as that is the main idea of 17...e4. Black wants to dislodge White's rook from  d3  and plant his own rook on  b3  , threatening various ...Rxc3+/...Rxa3 ideas. With Rd6 White has the idea Qa6 in mind. If White can exchange queens he is winning, but that is not something Black will allow. }

20. Nb5 Qa4

21. Qa6 { So what is Black's trick? Why is White not winning here? } 21... Bd1+
{ As I said, it is very easy to miss this fantabulous move from a distance. What is this move all about? Let us eliminate White's options. The bishop on d1 is immune. If White takes it with the d6-rook, the a6-queen hangs.   If he takes it with the king, then  22.Kxd1  Rd3+  double-check happens followed by ...Qd1 mate. Black's idea is all about getting this double-check. Just a normal discovered check would not have sufficed as Black's queen is hanging.   That leaves only 22. Kd2 and  22. Kc1. In the case of  22.Kd2  Rxb2+  23.Ke1  Qc2  Black has a mate in four. Therefore the only option that remains is 22. Kc1. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible.

{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2
{ This line is known as the Classical Variation or the Capablanca Variation. The main idea of this move is logical and sensible. White takes control over the central square e4 and at the same time makes sure that when Black takes the knight on c3 White can recapture with the queen, keeping his pawn structure intact. Thus White is threatening to play either  4...--  5.e4  or  5.a3  . The latter is the most logical follow-up after 4. Qc2. }
4... O-O
{ In the Classical variation, there are many ways to play for Black and most of them are equally strong. I am going to suggest one of Black's most active lines, which has been Anand's main weapon for all his World Championship matches. Each time we prepared the Nimzo as Black, we opted for this 4... O-O line. In this file, you will also witness a novelty found in the preparation of the Topalov match in the year 2010. I was only able to play this novelty over the board in 2019. :-@@EndBracket@@ }
5. a3
{ As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most logical follow-ups after 4.Qc2. Once White has made sure that he is ready to recapture on c3 with the queen, keeping his pawn structure unbroken, it makes perfect sense to attack the bishop on b4. }
5... Bxc3+
{ Playing the Nimzo Indian does not make any sense if Black is not ready to give this bishop on c3! But what is the justification for playing ...Bxc3+ when we can't even break up White's pawn structure? The key factor here is development and White's awkwardly placed queen on c3. Black is claiming that he is way ahead in development, having castled already, and White's queen on c3 can also come under some kind of attack once Black opens up the position with ...d5 and ...c5. }
6. Qxc3 { Otherwise 4. Qc2 would be pointless. } 6... d5
{ This line is rare compared to the old classical mainline of  6...b6  . For some reason, the move 6... d5 isn't that popular, although it makes perfect sense. White is under-developed, and the queen on c3 is the only piece that has been moved from its starting position, so this is a perfect time to open up the center with maximum force and harass the queen.It is fascinating to note that despite us having prepared this line very thoroughly since the 2008 Anand - Kramnik match, Anand never could really use it in his matches. However, the line came into fashion when in 2009, Anand and his team started using it heavily in various tournaments. It immediately became clear to the chess world that it was Anand's unused World Championship match preparation that he was using in tournament games. }
7. Bg5
{ White wants to play e3 but first makes sure his bishop is outside the pawn chain. This way, he also manages to pin the f6-knight, making it a bit more difficult for Black to open up the game. }
7... c5
{ One of Team Anand's ideas that was found back in approximately 2008. Radoslav Wojtaszek, more commonly known among his friends as Radek, got the first chance to use this idea in a tournament game in March 2009. One week later Anand himself used it against Morozevich in a rapid game, and a new trend was set.Once again the idea is crystal clear. Black claims that White's king is stuck in the center, so it is high time to open up the game. Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn, grab total central control, and quickly develop his queenside pieces. This is very typical of Anand's preparation, finding a new direction as early as possible and making it sharp and concrete. Needless to say, this line has since become trendy at the highest level. It is easy to understand and it forces White to get into some concrete variations. White can forget about getting a slight and long-term edge based on the bishop pair. }
8. dxc5
{ Clearly the main move. White accepts the challenge and gobbles up the pawn. White does not have time to play  8.Nf3  as Black will respond with  8...cxd4  , and after  9.Nxd4  e5  Black takes over the center while White's knight comes under attack. Once this knight moves, the queen on c3 will also be attacked with 10... d4. White will have a hard time developing his kingside pieces. }
8... d4
{ This is the main point of the move 7...c5. Black gains further control over the center by gaining an important tempo. All that remains for Black is to play ...e5 at the earliest possible opportunity. }
9. Qf3
{ A very interesting move that was prepared by Team Anand for the white side!! We wanted to use this idea in the 2010 World Championship match against Topalov. It was a novelty back then when only 9. Qc2   and  9.Qg3  were the popular moves.   However, there was a major block in the line which was causing us a lot of trouble to make this line work from White's perspective. No one ever played this, and as a result 9.Qf3 and the counter- novelty against it remained buried for 9 years. :- @@EndBracket@@  In the 2019 Asian Championship, I took an early lead by defeating Sethuraman and Maghsoodloo and drawing with Wei Yi.   I was then paired with the extremely well-prepared Vidit Gujrathi. He unleashed the move 9.Qf3 which had only been played once before on a GM level. I was excited to finally used the counter-novelty that we found back in 2009 as preparation for the match against Topalov. The idea of 9. Qf3 is to keep the f6- knight under attack and to prepare a quick O-O-O. }
9... Nbd7
{ Before playing ...e5 Black first takes care of the Bxf6 idea. Nothing can stop Black from playing ...e5 next, while ...Nxc5 is also a threat. }
10. e3
{ Taking advantage of the fact that:  10...Nxc5  can be met by  11.Bxf6  , giving Black a doubled pawn after which White can run with  11...gxf6  12.O-O-O  and claim a clearly better position. In that case, White would have solved the issue with his king in a lovely manner.   Note that White cannot reverse the move order by starting with  10.O-O-O  since after  10...e5  the move  11.e3  is answered with  11...e4  followed by ...d3, entombing the bishop on f1.   White is also not on time to save the c5 pawn with  10.b4  , because this allows  10...a5  , opening up the queenside and pouring water on White's plan of running his king to the queenside. Let us not forget that the white queen occupies the square that belongs to his knight. The only way he can justify this is by castling long which is, by the way, the main idea of 9. Qf3. }
10... h6
{ Before deciding whether to play ...e5 Black first asks White to decide what to do with his dark-squared bishop. }
11. Bxf6 { This is forced as we have seen what happens after 11. Bh4. } 11...
Nxf6
{ Black is not ready to exchange queens or ruin his pawn structure. He forgets about the c5-pawn for now and instead goes for direct ...e5-e4 ideas. Once ...e5 is played ...Bg4 also becomes a nasty threat. }
12. O-O-O
{ This fits in with the entire plan starting with 9. Qf3. White finally manages to castle long and now he is putting pressure on the d4-pawn.   12.Ne2  is answered by  12...d3  13.Nc3  d2+  , which will ruin White's king's position permanently. Black could then follow up with his plan of controlling the center starting with ...e5. }
12... e5
{ White has forced us to play something that we were dying to play anyway - nothing to complain about here! ...Bg4 is coming and ...e4 followed by ...d3 is an annoying threat too. }
13. Ne2
{ The only way to prevent both threats. It comes with a price, however: Black can win an exchange by playing ...d3 and ...Bg4. }
13... d3
{ The only other GM level game that reached this position continued with the move  13...Bg4  . It was played between Riazantsev and Inarkiev.   I personally like  13...d3  more, forcing White to offer an exchange sacrifice. The d3-pawn is not really pinned to Black's queen as Black is threatening  14.--  14...dxe2  next when  15.Rxd8  is met by  15...e1=Q+  :- @@EndBracket@@ }
14. Nc3
{ White gives up the exchange and goes for the d3-pawn. This forces Black to play something he wanted to play anyway. }
14... Bg4 15. Rxd3
{ This is the big idea that Team Anand was counting on. White offers an exchange sac that Black can accept by playing either  15...Qxd3   or  15...Bxf3  . In either case, it gives White a tremendous initiative. His strong queenside majority protected by a lovely bishop and knight guarantee him a clearly winning position. Initially, we were very pleased with this novelty of ours back in 2009, but then one day we came up with a powerful counter idea by Black, sacrificing a third pawn. }
15... Qa5
{ It is interesting to see that the strongest engines did not see this as the best move back in 2009 unless we go deep into the line, but nowadays strong engines quickly see that this is the only way for Black to fight back. It is a fantastic 'counter-novelty' that had to wait 10 long years to be unleashed. Black sacrifices a third pawn, getting a huge attack in return. }
16. Qxb7 { The most critical test. } 16... Rab8 17. Qc6
{ 17.Qe7  Rfe8  18.Qd6  Bf5  White is in some trouble since  19.Rd2  runs into the sweet  19...Qxc3+!  20.bxc3  Rb1#  :- @@EndBracket@@ }
17... e4
{ White was threatening to play Qa4 and fully consolidate his position. We cannot give White the time to do that. }
18. Rd2 { Protecting b2 and renewing the threat of Qa4. } 18... Rb3
{ Tactically preventing Qa4 while bringing ideas like ...Rxc3+ and ...Rxa3 into the position. If you want to do another quick tactics training, pause the Movetrainer here and try to figure out how Black can win after  19.Nb5  when it looks like White has everything protected. }
19. Qd6
{ Making sure the f8-rook cannot come to b8 after Black sacrifices his b3-rook. At the same time White also threatens to play Nb5 next. }
19... Rxc3+
{ Black takes on c3 anyway! But how will the second rook come to b8? Stay tuned to see this mystery solved. }
20. bxc3 Qxc3+
{ Time for another puzzle - if you like, please pause the Movetrainer. Try to figure out Black's brilliant move after  21.Kb1  . We need our rook on b8. How do we achieve that? }
21. Kb1 Nd5 22. Rxd5
{ 22.cxd5  is impossible due to  22...Qxd2  , and  22.Qxd5  cannot be played either due to  22...Rb8  . The only option for White is to take with the rook. }
22... Qb3+
{ 23.Kc1  And now Black can immediately force a draw with  23...Qc3+  or keep the game going by playing  23...Rb8  , forcing White to give up his queen. True, White will then get two rooks for the queen, but his king remains exposed and Black won't be running any risk there. }

21. c6 Nc5
{ White is in some sort of zugzwang. The d2-rook is fixed due to the threat of Qe1 mate and the b1-knight cannot move either. The only square for White's bishop is on e2, from where it can be taken by the g4-bishop after which the fatal ...Nd3+ would lead to mate. The queen on d6 also lacks any useful squares. She can come to d4, but that will only facilitate ...Nb3+ which will then be a royal fork. White must find the absolutely only move to stay in the game. }
22. h3

White's main point is that Black cannot play   7...d4  due to  8.O-O-O  . White takes advantage of having played both Bg5 and Qc2, which helps him castle long and pin the d-pawn on Black's queen. If Black takes on c5 with the bishop, it would justify White's play since he gains an important tempo.

10. a3 Bxc3+ 11. Qxc3 Nce4
{ By giving the bishop Black gains an important tempo attacking White's queen. The White queen cannot stop both ...Qa5/...Qxd5 ideas simultaneously, so she lacks a good square. If Black gets ...Qa5/...Qxd5 in, then White's king is further exposed. }
12. Bxf6 Qxd5
{ A fine touch of class. In a position where Black could take White's queen, bishop, or pawn, he goes for the pawn! Now both White's queen and bishop are hanging. White must move his queen after which Black takes the f6-bishop. Black still needs to develop his queenside pieces, which he will do while White tries to develop his kingside pieces and castle. Neither side has any weaknesses, so the position remains equal. }

White's main point is that Black cannot play   7...d4  due to  8.O-O-O  . White takes advantage of having played both Bg5 and Qc2, which helps him castle long and pin the d-pawn on Black's queen. If Black takes on c5 with the bishop, it would justify White's play since he gains an important tempo. As we have seen in the Nimzo, in many lines Black usually prefers to take on c5 by developing his b8-knight and almost never takes back the c5-pawn with his bishop. This position is no exception. }
7... h6
{ The typical move in this line, asking White to make a committal decision. He obviously would not like to give up the bishop in such an open position. That would allow Black to develop his queen and threaten ...d4. Thus White should retreat with the bishop to h4 in order to maintain the pin. This, however, moves the bishop far away from White's king and opens up the option of a future ...g5 for Black. }

12. Qc2 Qa5+ 13. Nd2 Bd7
{ Once again, an alternative and simple path to a balanced game is  13...Nxd2  14.Qxd2  Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  Nxc5  with the threat of ...Nb3+ and ...dxc4. That is doable and gives Black a fine position, but with 13... Bd7 Black is aiming for more. Now ...Ba4 and ...Rc8 are threatened. The machine prefers Black, which is easy to understand once we look at White's kingside and his majesty himself. There is no good way for White to finish development without allowing Black to gain the initiative on the queenside. }

{ This indeed looks beautiful for White. The f6-knight is in a deadly pin and White is ready to castle long. Suddenly all of Black's pieces are lacking coordination to defend the position.

He now tries to find the best way to keep the position closed so that he can finish his development peacefully. }

19... Nd5
{ Black gets his knight back from c3 in time. ...Bd7 and ...Rc8 will follow quickly. White has to waste one more tempo with his e7-bishop. Black is going to stop White from playing e4-e5 by himself playing ...e5 at the right moment. The d6- pawn will become loose and will soon be gone. White's bishop lacks a good square. White's major problem is once again his lack of development on the kingside. By the time White finishes developing, Black has already started an initiative on the queenside and in the center. }

{ The most popular move in this position is  5...c5  , but the move we are playing fits in perfectly with our repertoire.   A lot of players do not play 5... d5 mainly because in the following line: @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Qc2  O-O  5.a3  Bxc3  6.Qxc3  , they do not go for  6...d5   and instead play the old classical mainline  6...b6  .

This way, we also manage to bypass some heavy theoretical lines that can arise after 5... c5 Above all, logically speaking, the move 5... d5 just looks correct. White has delayed playing e4, so we grab the center immediately, not giving White another chance. }
6. Bg5
{ As we can see after both:   6.a3  and  6.e3  , this entire line starting with 5... d5 suits our repertoire because regularly it will transpose to different lines that we will be seeing or have already seen. The only two other moves that we need to address are 6.Bg5 and  6.cxd5  , which are covered in this chapter. The point of the move 6. Bg5 move is obvious. It pins the f6-knight and develops the bishop outside the pawn chain, which means White is ready to play e3 next. }

11. Bg3 Ne4

12. Bd3 f5
{ We are ruthlessly going for the piece. With our knight sitting on e4, White cannot move his h-pawn as that would damage his structure after ...Nxg3. }
13. h3 Nxg3 14. fxg3 Bd6
{ This bishop's job has been done on b4. Thanks to the pin on the c3-knight Black could get in the moves ...Ne4 and ...f5, which helped him create a weakness on the kingside. Now Black assigns his bishop a new job and aims at the g3-pawn. }
15. Ne2 Qa5+
{ Not letting White have peace of mind. The moment White took care of the g3-pawn by removing the knight from c3, Black's queen jumps back to the a5-e1 diagonal. }
16. Kf2 e5
{ With White's king on f2, Black just needs to open up the center and White will have a hopeless position. Using the best engines of 2020, White was not able to defend this position in a correspondence game. Black has the bishop pair, full control over the center and White has a weak king on f2, which can be attacked - this pretty much sums up the evaluation. }

He will keep all the strategic advantage but simply will not have enough time to take care of his king. }
10... Bxc3+ 11. Qxc3 g5
{ Once again we see the point of including a timely ...h6. White has no choice but to go back to g3. He is clearly not ready to sacrifice on g5 as after:  12.Nxg5  hxg5  13.Bxg5  Black has the typical tactical shot of  13...Ne4!  forcing a queen exchange. }

To make things worse, Black also has a cunning threat on the kingside where he can go ...h5 with the idea to harass the g3-bishop. White cannot play h4 in return since Black will then take on g3, destroying White's pawn structure. It is understandable why every strong engine prefers Black. }

6. Bg5
{ As we can see after both:   6.a3  and  6.e3  , this entire line starting with 5... d5 suits our repertoire because regularly it will transpose to different lines that we will be seeing or have already seen. The only two other moves that we need to address are 6.Bg5 and  6.cxd5  , which are covered in this chapter. The point of the move 6. Bg5 move is obvious. It pins the f6-knight and develops the bishop outside the pawn chain, which means White is ready to play e3 next. }
6... c5
{ An important move order subtlety. We first play  6...c5  , and only if White takes  7.dxc5  do we go  7...h6   Not the other way round. If we start with  6...h6  , then after  7.Bxf6  Qxf6  8.a3  Bxc3  9.Qxc3  , we will have a tough time getting ...c5 in as after  9...c5  10.cxd5  White keeps a slight edge. By playing 6... c5 first we avoid this line and are ready to open up the center before White finds time to consolidate his position and take care of his king's safety.   Now White has to take a concrete decision in the center.

7. cxd5
{ This makes sense from a positional point of view, since Black is unable to take on d5 with the knight, and if Black retakes with the pawn he would get an isolated pawn on d5. However, if we look dynamically we can argue that White has not yet castled and his pieces on the kingside are under-developed. At this moment White decides to open up the center and he also helps Black to develop his c8-bishop. He gets a long-term strategic advantage, but right now he must solve concrete developmental issues. This is not going to be easy as we shall see on the next couple of moves. }
7... exd5 8. dxc5
{ From now on, the fight between strategy and dynamism will be on. If we give White time to develop his f1-bishop and castle with impunity, Black will be clearly worse. That is what White wants to achieve and that is the precise reason he has opened up the position and given Black an isolated d-pawn. In theory this sounds good, but one of the main rules of chess is that each player can only make one move at a time. So before White gets in e3, Bd3 and O-O, we will also make three moves, and we will now witness how much difficulty we can cause to White's dream of castling peacefully on the kingside. }
8... h6
{ First and foremost we play the typical questioning move  ...h6  . Either White must admit that he won't fight for any kind of strategic advantage and give the bishop right away by playing the move  9.Bxf6  or he has to bite the bullet and try to retain the bishop by keeping it on  h4  . }
9. Bh4
{ Giving the bishop with the move  9.Bxf6  makes little sense. Black will eventually get the c5-pawn too, and he can also ruin White's pawn structure by taking on  c3  if White attacks his b4-bishop. Clearly, this was not the purpose of White's cxd5/dxc5 plan. He should instead keep the bishop with 9. Bh4. }
9... Nbd7
{ Going for the c5-pawn and developing the knight to the active c5-square. }
10. e3
{ White executes his plan and is just two moves away from getting a strategically dominant position. We will see how Black deals with this issue within two moves. }
10... g5
{ Before White can castle, Black wants to do some damage to White's pawn structure on the queenside. To achieve this he needs his knight on e4. The first step to get the knight to e4 would be to unpin himself by chasing away White's dark-squared bishop. Hence 10... g5. }
11. Bg3 Nxc5
{ If White could castle right now he would be better, as he avoids Black's idea of ...Nfe4 and ...Bxc3+. Unfortunately he still needs one more move to develop his f1-bishop. }
12. Be2 Nfe4
{ Black has found a nice place for his c8-bishop. Once it reaches the f5-square it will keep an eye on the queen on c2 and come in handy for defending his own king by staying on g6 if needed. }
13. O-O Bxc3
{ Perfect timing. Black manages to ruin White's pawn structure which provides him with counterplay. White was not able to consolidate his position and play against the isolated pawn peacefully. Now he also has a few things to worry about. }
14. bxc3 Bf5 15. Qb2 Qe7
{ Time to take stock. White has the bishop pair and Black has an isolated pawn on d5 with the kingside pawn structured a bit far advanced, which might look weak at first glance. But let us go deeper. Neither of White's bishops is actually doing anything.   The bishop on e2 is especially out of the game, while its black counterpart on f5 is super active. Black's knights are dominating the board. One of them keeps an eye on g3 and c3 while the other knight on c5 is ready to jump to a4, creating more pressure on the c3-pawn. The rooks are ready to come to e8 and c8, again adding more pressure on the c3-pawn. ...h5-h4 ideas are always possible to gain more space on the kingside and to attack the g3-bishop. Black can also play a consolidating move like ...f6 to prevent Be5-d4 permanently.   It is of the utmost importance that White is unable to play Be5 at any point due to ...g4. The computer says the position is equal, but I would rather play Black. He has a lot of very attractive plans at his disposal. }

10. Ne5
{ White goes directly for the Ne5 and f4 plan, trying to get the maximum out of the h4-d8 pin. }
10... Nc6 11. f4
{ Mamedyarov played 11. Be2 against Aronian, which transposes to the mainline given in the next variation which starts from the 10. Be2 move order. 11. f4 is the most direct way to stabilize the knight on e5. This way White is hoping to start a kingside attack. However, this move is awful since Black would have forced White to play f4 anyway in the case of 10. Be2 by playing ...Re8, which is what happened in the Mamedyarov - Aronian game. In other words, White plays a weakening move voluntarily that we wanted to force him to play anyway. }
11... Ne7
{ This is the same way that we will play in the mainline. Here this move is even stronger as our rook remains on f8 instead of e8. By unpinning the knight and taking control over the f5-square, Black is threatening to play ...Bf5/...Ne4/...Nf5 all at the same time. This forces White to take on f6.   If White sacrifices a pawn with  12.g4  Nxg4  13.Nxg4  Bxg4  14.Rg1  , this allows Black to play  14...Bf5  with a tempo, after which Black will close the kingside with ...g6, and White's king gets into trouble. }
12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Nf3 Nf5
{ The e3-pawn and e4-square are both terribly weak. Black will play ...Re8 attacking the e3-pawn a second time. White might have to play Kf2 and Re1 to keep it alive. That can be dealt with by playing ...Nd6 and ...Bf5, taking control over the b1-h7 diagonal and the e4-square. White is busted. }

12. Bg3 Ne7
{ A lovely move. Thanks to ...c4 White is unable to play Bd3, and next Black will take control over the b1-h7 diagonal. On paper, our light-squared bishop is supposed to be 'bad' while White's light-squared bishop is 'good'. In reality, after this move, Black will get his bishop to f5, after which it is much stronger than its white counterpart. It keeps an eye on the queenside, where Black has more space. It also protects the black king by retreating to g6/h7 and clearing the f5-square for the knight on e7.   It is important that White is unable to play  13.e4  and break open the position since Black replies by taking on c3 first and then picks up the e4-pawn:  13...Bxc3  14.bxc3  Nxe4  . }
13. Be5
{ Posing Black some real problems, since it looks like he will have to move the f6-knight and give up his control over the e4-square. Luckily Black has no such ideas in mind. He will gain full control of the e4-square with an easy intermezzo. }

{ Getting rid of the hostile bishop on e5, which could come to f6 at some point. }
17. Bg3 Rc8
{ Black has more control on every side of the board. He has a pawn majority on the queenside where he can build further with ...Qd7 ...b5 in the future, and later he can retreat the bishop from b4 and push b5-b4 himself. On the kingside ...Bg6 followed by ...h5 is a nice idea. The bishop on g6 also vacates the f5-square where our knight can jump to from e7. ...Re8 is a good prophylactic move that Black makes at the right time to take measures against any future e4.   White's only hope is to get in the e4 break, but that is not happening soon, thanks to Black's superior control over the e4-square and the pin on the c3-knight. Black's position is preferable. The fact that even in a correspondence game in 2019 White could not hold this game with engine support just underlines how good Black's position actually is. }

There is no way to stop  15.--  15...h5  when White is forced to move the g4-knight, and Black knight will capture on e3 attacking the queen on c2. The position is already -3 according to the engine. I am not surprised. I think after 15... h5 the wise thing to do would be to sac the knight. That is why it is -3. }

Hence the engine evaluates the position as -4.   This line was crucial to figure out while playing 11... Re8, which forced White to play 12. f4, and after which we were obliged to play 12... Ne7. It all depended on whether this attack worked or not. Hence I see this as the mainline of the 4. Qc2 O-O 5. Nf3 variation. }

{ Black has three pawns and a rook for White's bishop and knight - materially speaking he is doing great. }
18. Nf3 f6
{ A nice move that restricts the knight on f6. White's king remains weak and Black will soon finish his development. The main problem with White's king is that it doesn't really have a safe place. If White could play a quick Bd3 that would be nice, but that is not feasible. Also, White must keep in mind that Black can take on g4 at any moment. The computer evaluates the position as -2.6. I don't know how exactly this evaluation works, but from a human perspective, I can say that Black is close to winning if not winning already. }

16. Bc2 Nxg4 17. fxg4 Qxg4
{ Unlike in the 16. Be2 variation, here we have four pawns plus rook for bishop and knight instead of three pawns and rook. But we should be a bit more careful since White has managed to open every single file on the kingside for his pieces, so we have to avoid running into a massive attack. }
18. Nf3
{ Sooner or later this move is needed for White to castle long. He could also start with:  18.Bb2  or  18.Be3  . In any case, our response is the same. }
18... e5
{ This is an important move. Black has enough pawns in supply so there is no need to hold on to them just for the sake of having more pawns. Currently, our priority is to prevent White from running his king to the queenside and attacking us. As we know, offense is the best defense, so Black strikes in the center before White can run. }
19. Nxe5
{ White cannot allow Black to play ...e4 and close the diagonal from which he intends to start the attack. Once ...e4 is played both white bishops become jobless. }
19... Qh3

20. Bb2 Qh6
{ The elegant final touch to secure a winning position. With his last move, Black made sure the white king is never getting a safe place to hide.  There is no room for repetition as the move:  21.Bc1  will be answered by  21...Qh1+  . White has no way to get his rook into the game. He can exchange queens, but then Black's three extra pawns on the kingside will have their say. The machine gives -3.5, confirming that Black has a great position. }

The most obvious move is a blunder, which is why this line is still sometimes tried by White.   9...cxd4  10.cxd4  Qa5+  looks like a natural way to punish White for playing 9. Bb2. Black forces White to move his king. As of today, this continuation has been played as often as 39 times. However, after the cool-headed  11.Ke2  Black runs out of ideas to attack White's king.

9... Bd7
{ A counter-intuitive move. Instead of attacking the pawn on d4 or getting the queen out, Black plays an odd-looking move developing his c8-bishop. The idea, however, is fairly straightforward. By playing 9... Bd7, Black is simply renewing the threat of ...cxd4 followed by ...Qa5+ when the idea of getting the d7-bishop to a4 could be perilous for White. Keep in mind that as long as Black's queen sits on d8 White cannot threaten f3. }
10. f3
{ Just like Caruana's 9. f3, this pawn move looks tempting here as White will be able to castle long once Black's queen gets to  h1  , but in this case too Black has a nice trick up his sleeve. There is no time for White to play slow anymore. Black was intending ...cxd4 followed by ...Qa5+ when ...Ba4 would be extremely annoying. For instance against  10.Bd3  this could be an option. }
10... Qh4+ 11. g3 Nxg3 12. hxg3 Qxh1 13. Qf2
{ White is trying to prove that the inclusion of Bb2 favors him as he gets to castle long quickly. }
13... Ba4
{ Nope! Not so fast. Black pours water on the long castling plan. There is also no way to trap the queen this time as both the h5- and h6-squares are always available. Black is an exchange up and White does not even have a safe king. White is just lost. }

The point is that after  16.g3  Black takes  16...Qxe4  , and he either wins the h1-rook or the b2-bishop along with the d1-rook. If White gives the h1-rook his h2-pawn will also fall. If he saves the h1-rook Black takes on b2 and d1. In either case, materially speaking Black will do great, and White's king will be stuck in the center. That is why the engine feels Black is clearly better. }
16. Ng3 Nxb2 17. Qb3 Nxd1 18. Kxd1 dxe4
{ With the king in the center White's position is not secure at all. The d4-pawn could fall once Black connects his rooks. Black has a rook and two pawns for bishop and knight, so from a purely material point of view he is also doing fine. }

Here this is not an option as the d4-knight will soon come under attack by our dark-squared bishop. }
18. Qf2 Qg6
{ White's king has nowhere to run. The only secure place would be  d2  , but after the move:  19.Kd2  Black can shift his focus to the d4-knight and play  19...Qb6  followed by  20.--  Bc5  attacking the d4-knight and the b2-pawn. Materially speaking Black is doing great too, as he has three pawns for the knight. White's multiple weaknesses and his exposed king seal the fate of the game. }

{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }
10. Bf4
{ White tries his best to keep the game under control. He protects the e5-pawn and develops a piece. }
10... Qh4
{ There is nothing wrong with the old classical  10...Ndc5  followed by taking on  d3  , which gives Black equality. The move 10... Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after 12.O-O-O in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. cxd5
{ Taking on d5 is bad in general as it activates Black's c8-bishop. That is the generic explanation, which is already good enough to understand why this move never became popular. Still, there is also a concrete reason why this move has never been played frequently at the top level. However, there is one particular idea that we should know about which was played by Yu Yangi against Levon Aronian in Stanger 2019. }
12... exd5 13. f3
{ The only way to make some sense out of 12. cxd5. This f3 is a very interesting move that gives Black a lot of options to choose from. Often it gets very tricky over the board when there are multiple ways to play, and all of them look equally decent. }
13... Nec5
{ Aronian took on c3 with his bishop and then moved his e4-knight to c5. His point was that if he first moves the knight, then he cannot break the structure later, so it is now or never. There is, however, a notable upside to our move 13... Nec5 that we will soon see, which is why I like keeping the bishop on b4 and moving the knight directly instead. }
14. Bf5
{ Otherwise we will take the bishop. Moving the bishop to e2 makes zero sense when we can either take on e5 or play the even stronger ...Ne6 attacking d4 and f4. If White takes on e6, our d5-pawn gets good protection and the f-file is opened up. }
14... Nxe5 { An elegant combination that wins White's central pawn. } 15. Bxe5
{ Forced. Taking on c8 would allow ...Nd3+/...Nxf3+ after which Black picks up the c8-bishop. }
15... Bxf5 16. Qxf5
{ 16.Nxf5  Black first takes  16...Bxc3+  and after  17.Bxc3  Qxf3  White has to give up material due to threats over the e-file to his king. }
16... Bxc3+
{ Black starts exchanging pieces before winning back the piece with the ...Nd3+ fork. }
17. bxc3 Qxf5 18. Nxf5 Nd3+ 19. Ke2 Nxe5
{ White will recoup the pawn on  d5  with the move  20.Ne7+  , but even then he remains with a weak pawn on  c3  and an exposed king that helps Black to develop his rooks with tempo. }

Theoretically speaking it is totally fine for Black.However, I still like the following move, a novelty I kept for a long time, but it has now been played once in a Titled Tuesday online blitz tournament. Earlier such things would have never occurred. If there was a surprising novelty available, people would keep it for an important tournament to be played over the board when the stakes are higher. Nowadays, due to the lockdown situation, no one knows when over-the-board tournaments will be back. Hence we get to see many interesting novelties being played in online tournaments. With 13...

White's extra knight will be sleeping on a1 while he will have an exposed king on d1. All Black would need to do is to develop his c8-bishop either on d7 or by playing ...b6 and ...Bb7. In any case, he remains clearly better, and it is not surprising that the computer says the position is close to -1. }

Now after  17.cxd5  , in the above-mentioned Titled Tuesday game Jeffrey Xiong vs. Chylewski Black played  17...exd4  which loses a piece after  18.Qxe4  .

Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after 12.O-O-O in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. h4
{ A tricky move that has decent popularity. Once again, Black has multiple ways to deal with it. White's threat is to play Be2. By playing h4 he makes sure Black's queen cannot go to h3, and more importantly if Black continues by playing ...Qg6 White has the annoying move h5. }
12... Nxe5
{ We play in the most principled manner. The e5-pawn is hanging so we take it.   It was also possible to play  12...f6  as played in a couple of recent ICCF games. I like 12... Nxe5 more because it is easy to understand and thus easy to remember. }
13. Be2 Qg6
{ In this position we are spoilt for choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with  13...Ng4  which is clearly the main move, and almost every single game has proceeded that way. After  13...Ng4  14.Bxg4  Qxg4  15.f3  Qh5  16.g4  Qg6  17.fxe4  e5  the position becomes very wild. Black gains back the piece and White tries to castle long and attack Black. Theoretically speaking it is totally fine for Black.However, I still like the following move, a novelty I kept for a long time, but it has now been played once in a Titled Tuesday online blitz tournament. Earlier such things would have never occurred. If there was a surprising novelty available, people would keep it for an important tournament to be played over the board when the stakes are higher. Nowadays, due to the lockdown situation, no one knows when over-the-board tournaments will be back. Hence we get to see many interesting novelties being played in online tournaments. With 13... Qg6 Black offers a full piece on  e5! }
14. Bxe5 f6
{ Attacking the e5-bishop and intending to play ...Nxc3 next.   White is unable to move the bishop. For instance, both moves:  15.Bc7  and  15.Bf4  will run into  15...Nxc3  16.bxc3  Qxc2  17.Nxc2  Bxc3+  and Black will pick up the a1-rook, after which Black has a rook and two pawns for bishop and knight. White's extra knight will be sleeping on a1 while he will have an exposed king on d1. All Black would need to do is to develop his c8-bishop either on d7 or by playing ...b6 and ...Bb7. In any case, he remains clearly better, and it is not surprising that the computer says the position is close to -1. }
15. h5
{ White chases the queen from g6 so that there won't be any ...Nxc3 tricks. }
15... Qf7 { Controlling the c7-square, forcing White to play Bf4. } 16. Bf4 e5
17. cxd5
{ 17.O-O-O  Black will first break White's queenside with  17...Bxc3  18.bxc3  and only then take  18...exf4  . Black is fine after  19.gxf4  Qc7  when White's f4- and c3-pawns both come under attack.   Now after  17.cxd5  , in the above-mentioned Titled Tuesday game Jeffrey Xiong vs. Chylewski Black played  17...exd4  which loses a piece after  18.Qxe4  . Instead of that blunder, Black has a far better option. }
17... Qxd5
{ The piece is not running away. Black centralizes his queen, utilizing the pin on the c3-knight. }
18. O-O-O Nxc3 19. bxc3 Ba3+ 20. Kb1 exd4
{ White is unable to take with the move:  21.Rxd4  as that leaves his other rook hanging. Black, meanwhile, threatens to play ...Bf5 and has ample counterplay. There is only one single trick that remains for White, which is very interesting. }
21. Qa4 { Creating the double threat of Bc4 and Qxa3. } 21... Bf5+ 22. Ka1 d3
{ A brilliant resource, the point of which is not clear at first sight. Black is not really threatening to take on e2 yet. Why did he play ...d3 then, giving up a full piece on a3? }
23. Qxa3 Qc6
{ The point! White is unable to save the bishop on e2, since it has absolutely no square to go to. The h1-rook hangs in almost every variation. Black gets great counterplay after regaining the piece. }

{ Taking advantage of the pin on the c3-knight, Black puts his knight on e4 with the idea of playing ...c5 next.

9... Nd7
{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }

12... g5
{ An incredibly bold move that changed the course of theory in this entire system. Black burns all bridges and goes for the e5-pawn. White has no other choice but to give up this pawn. From here on the variations become very forcing. The battle will focus on whether or not White can prove sufficient compensation for the pawn he is about to lose. }
13. Bxe4

13... gxf4 14. cxd5 Nxe5

15. dxe6
{ 15.Bg2  Black takes on g3 and plays Bd7 enjoying the bishop pair as well as his attacking potential. Note that despite having a broken structure on the kingside, it is Black who has more attacking prospects there due to the placement of the queens. White's queen is far away from the battlefield, while Black's queen dominates the side where both kings are. }
15... Bxe6

13. cxd5
{ White took 13. cxd5 in 135 out of 138 games played in this position as of today. The reason for this is straightforward: White is unwilling to give up the e5-pawn that easily, and by taking on d5 he attacks the e4-knight. Any other move would have simply given up the e5-pawn, which White is not ready to part with. Moving the f4-bishop would lose the e5-pawn, Taking on e4 with the knight right away doesn't help either as Black then takes the f4-bishop and White will eventually lose his central pawn. }
13... Bxc3
{ 13...gxf4  and  13...Nxc3  are good moves too. I personally like the move 13... Bxc3 as it minimizes White's options. Needless to say it also assures Black a comfortable position. Instead of saving the knight on e4 or taking the bishop on f4, Black first takes on c3 and attacks the d4-knight instead, practically forcing White's next move. }
14. bxc3
{ 14.Be3  This bizarre move was played once in a correspondence game. Apart from the widely popular 14. bxc3 this is the only other move for White that does not lose on the spot.

14... exd5
{ Once again going for the e5-pawn by keeping the attack on the f4-bishop. At this point White has two ways to continue. Either he sacs the e5-pawn by playing   15.Be3  or he tries to save the pawn with  15.e6  or  15.Bxe4  . The latter two end up leading to the same position. }

16... gxf4 17. exd7 Bxd7
{ As mentioned above, this position can be reached via two different move orders. White will win back the e4-pawn next and in a few games he has tried to prove some advantage, but there is no shred of an advantage to be found. In each game Black got a very comfortable position. Hikaru had this position four times as Black of which three were played in 2020. In total, he drew three games and won one, which shows that Black is doing fine. In correspondence games too Black has not lost a single game. }
18. Qxe4 fxg3
{ This position comes about almost by force after White plays 15. e6 or 15. Bd3. Now White has two options, and both have their pros and cons. We will have a look at both of them. }
19. hxg3
{ With this move White admits that he isn't really trying to fight for more than equality and is happy to make a draw. Black's king cannot get under attack and the knight on d4 is nicely tamed by the bishop on d7. Black will activate his rooks with tempo either by attacking the queen or attacking the c-pawn. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4
{ Just like 5. a3, this move is also in sync with White's previous move. This was the other plan of Team Anand which we wanted to use against Kramnik in the Bonn match back in 2008. That never happened, although Anand later used it against Kramnik in the 2013 Tal Memorial. I also used this World Championship preparation once against George Meier and won a nice game in Hungary in 2009 after the Bonn Match. Back then this move had more surprise value and was treated as a one-game idea. Over the years Black has found multiple ways to hold the balance, and nowadays there are many ways Black can force equality. }
5... d5
{ The most principled decision. Black strikes in the center immediately. } 6.
e5
{ White also fights with all his might for the center and grabs as much space as possible. Playing  6.cxd5  helps Black to get his c8-bishop in the game faster and after  6...exd5  7.e5  Ne4  8.Bd3  c5  we will transpose to the mainline given later in this chapter. }
6... Ne4
{ Taking advantage of the pin on the c3-knight, Black puts his knight on e4 with the idea of playing ...c5 next. White has more space while Black is better developed, so it is now a struggle between strategic advantage and dynamic play. Black must act quickly and should not allow White to consolidate his position. Thankfully Black has already castled and thus is ready for open combat. }
7. Bd3
{ More than a thousand games have been played already with this move. White tries to eliminate the knight on e4.   7.Nf3  c5  8.Bd3  transposes to the mainline.  7.a3  is also a serious try from White's side, which we have taken a look at already. }
7... c5
{ Once again Black opens up the position, taking advantage of White's uncastled king. }
8. Ne2
{ 8.Nf3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  transposes directly back to this variation.  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Nge2  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nd7  also transposes back to the sideline 10. cxd5. }
8... cxd4 9. Nxd4
{ Why did Black waste two moves with ...c5 and ...cxd4, allowing White's knight to come d4 all the way from g1? The point can be seen in the following couple of moves, which will make it all clear why the naive-looking ...c5/...cxd4 is so strong. }
9... Nd7
{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }
10. Bf4
{ White tries his best to keep the game under control. He protects the e5-pawn and develops a piece. }
10... Qh4
{ There is nothing wrong with the old classical  10...Ndc5  followed by taking on  d3  , which gives Black equality. The move 10... Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after 12.O-O-O in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. O-O
{ Taking advantage of the fact that Black is unable to take  12...Nxe5  due to the fork after  13.Be2  Ng4  14.Bxg4  Qxg4  15.f3  . This was considered to be fine for White until Black came up with 12... g5! }
12... g5
{ An incredibly bold move that changed the course of theory in this entire system. Black burns all bridges and goes for the e5-pawn. White has no other choice but to give up this pawn. From here on the variations become very forcing. The battle will focus on whether or not White can prove sufficient compensation for the pawn he is about to lose. }
13. cxd5
{ White took 13. cxd5 in 135 out of 138 games played in this position as of today. The reason for this is straightforward: White is unwilling to give up the e5-pawn that easily, and by taking on d5 he attacks the e4-knight. Any other move would have simply given up the e5-pawn, which White is not ready to part with. Moving the f4-bishop would lose the e5-pawn, Taking on e4 with the knight right away doesn't help either as Black then takes the f4-bishop and White will eventually lose his central pawn. }
13... Bxc3
{ 13...gxf4  and  13...Nxc3  are good moves too. I personally like the move 13... Bxc3 as it minimizes White's options. Needless to say it also assures Black a comfortable position. Instead of saving the knight on e4 or taking the bishop on f4, Black first takes on c3 and attacks the d4-knight instead, practically forcing White's next move. }
14. bxc3
{ 14.Be3  This bizarre move was played once in a correspondence game. Apart from the widely popular 14. bxc3 this is the only other move for White that does not lose on the spot. However, instead of going for the crazy  14...Nd2  which happened in the game, I suggest simply taking  14...exd5  , and after  15.bxc3  we immediately transpose to the mainline. }
14... exd5
{ Once again going for the e5-pawn by keeping the attack on the f4-bishop. At this point White has two ways to continue. Either he sacs the e5-pawn by playing   15.Be3  or he tries to save the pawn with  15.e6  or  15.Bxe4  . The latter two end up leading to the same position. }
15. Bxe4
{ This way White manages to save the pawn. After  15.e6  gxf4  16.exd7  Bxd7  17.Bxe4  dxe4  we transpose back to this line. }
15... dxe4 16. e6
{ Of course, if White wanted to sacrifice the e5-pawn he would have kept his light-squared bishop. Instead, his idea was to save the central pawn by playing  16.e6  . }
16... gxf4 17. exd7 Bxd7
{ As mentioned above, this position can be reached via two different move orders. White will win back the e4-pawn next and in a few games he has tried to prove some advantage, but there is no shred of an advantage to be found. In each game Black got a very comfortable position. Hikaru had this position four times as Black of which three were played in 2020. In total, he drew three games and won one, which shows that Black is doing fine. In correspondence games too Black has not lost a single game. }
18. Qxe4 fxg3
{ This position comes about almost by force after White plays 15. e6 or 15. Bd3. Now White has two options, and both have their pros and cons. We will have a look at both of them. }
19. fxg3
{ This move looks more logical to me, building up pressure on the f-file. But let us not forget after all that the position is open and Black has a bishop. If White's knight could jump to f5 and stay there, it would be horrendous for Black, but as long as the bishop is alive on d7 Black has nothing to worry about. }
19... b6
{ An ice cold response by Black. He saves the b7-pawn and now plans to play ...Rae8 next. White has a weakness on c3, while Black doesn't have any real weaknesses. 'But', one can argue, 'What about Black's king?' Well, there is simply not a single White piece that can get to Black's king. White's knight optically looks good on d4, but the d7-bishop very nicely contains it. A move like Qe7 can chase this bishop, but this doesn't bother Black as the bishop could restrict this knight on d4 even by going to h3 from where it will also attack the rook on f1.   Once White plays Nf5, which he must play at some point anyway, the position is liquidated completely after the exchange on f5. Hikaru had this particular position three times as Black. }
20. Qe7
{ Trying to force the d7-bishop to move so that he gets the f5-square for his knight. }
20... Bh3
{ The bishop does a nice job of attacking and protecting at the same time by controlling the f5-square and attacking the f1-rook. }
21. Rf4 Rae8
{ Now an exchange of queens is inevitable. Once that is done, the game changes instantly from a sharp middlegame to an endgame where White's weakness on the queenside becomes more visible while the vulnerability of both kings disappears magically. }
22. Qh4 Qxh4 23. Rxh4
{ Here instead of Hikaru's  23...Bc8  , which is enough for equality, I like the move 23... Bd7 even more. 0-1 Sarana, A @@StartBracket@@ 2654 @@EndBracket@@ -Nakamura, H @@StartBracket@@ 2736 @@EndBracket@@ chess.com INT 2020 }
23... Bd7
{ Once again the bishop restricts the d4-knight. Black's king is fully out of danger after the queen trade, and now Black can freely go for White's queenside pawn weaknesses by activating his rooks. ...Re5 followed by ...Rc8 looks like a solid plan for this purpose. }

{ Simplifying the position and agreeing that he has no advantage whatsoever. Black will chop the knight off, but before that, he gains an important tempo. }
20... Rae8 21. Qd5 Bxf5
{ It is time to eliminate this knight and make our king safe. } 22. Rxf5
{ This was first played at the very top level in Mamedyarov vs. Aronian in the 2013 Bilbao Grand Slam. Soon the game ended with a perpetual and this line lost its popularity from the white side. Recently Wesley tried this variation thrice as White against Hikaru in different online blitz/rapid events, but Hikaru never had any problems and comfortably drew his games almost instantly. }
22... Qe2
{ Aiming for the e3-square. The same could have been achieved with  22...Qh6  too. Aronian's choice was 22... Qh6, but later Hikaru always played 22... Qe2. Both moves will lead to the same position. White needs his a1-rook to come to play. Giving a check with  23.Rg5+  forces  23...Kh8  when Black's king to get to a better square.  24.Qd4+  is then answered with the solid  24...f6  .  By trying to attack Black's king White has also weakened his own king, and let us not forget about White's pawn structure on the queenside. Black also has a vulnerable structure on the kingside, but thanks to his king's placement this weakness is easy to defend - unlike the c3- and a4-pawns. }
23. Raf1 Qe3+ 24. R1f2 Qe1+
{ I am amazed to see that Wesley vs. Nakamura saw this position as many as three times! }
25. Kg2
{ The last game among these three games ended with a perpetual after  25.Rf1  Qe3+  . This shows that Wesley knew very well that this line ends in a draw. }
25... Qe4+ 26. Qxe4
{ 26.Kh3  Qxd5  27.Rxd5  Re7  happened once but didn't change the nature and evaluation of the position. }
26... Rxe4
{ White's pawn weaknesses on  a2  and  c3  are far more prominent than Black's f7- and h7-pawns due to the distance between the king and the weakness. Black's king is closer to his weak pawns and thus they are very well protected. Wesley saw nothing better than to repeat the position by going:  27.Rg5+  Kh8  28.Rgf5  Kg8  .

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4
{ Just like 5. a3, this move is also in sync with White's previous move. This was the other plan of Team Anand which we wanted to use against Kramnik in the Bonn match back in 2008. That never happened, although Anand later used it against Kramnik in the 2013 Tal Memorial. I also used this World Championship preparation once against George Meier and won a nice game in Hungary in 2009 after the Bonn Match. Back then this move had more surprise value and was treated as a one-game idea. Over the years Black has found multiple ways to hold the balance, and nowadays there are many ways Black can force equality. }
5... d5
{ The most principled decision. Black strikes in the center immediately. } 6.
e5
{ White also fights with all his might for the center and grabs as much space as possible. Playing  6.cxd5  helps Black to get his c8-bishop in the game faster and after  6...exd5  7.e5  Ne4  8.Bd3  c5  we will transpose to the mainline given later in this chapter. }
6... Ne4
{ Taking advantage of the pin on the c3-knight, Black puts his knight on e4 with the idea of playing ...c5 next. White has more space while Black is better developed, so it is now a struggle between strategic advantage and dynamic play. Black must act quickly and should not allow White to consolidate his position. Thankfully Black has already castled and thus is ready for open combat. }
7. Bd3
{ More than a thousand games have been played already with this move. White tries to eliminate the knight on e4.   7.Nf3  c5  8.Bd3  transposes to the mainline.  7.a3  is also a serious try from White's side, which we have taken a look at already. }
7... c5
{ Once again Black opens up the position, taking advantage of White's uncastled king. }
8. Ne2
{ 8.Nf3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  transposes directly back to this variation.  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Nge2  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nd7  also transposes back to the sideline 10. cxd5. }
8... cxd4 9. Nxd4
{ Why did Black waste two moves with ...c5 and ...cxd4, allowing White's knight to come d4 all the way from g1? The point can be seen in the following couple of moves, which will make it all clear why the naive-looking ...c5/...cxd4 is so strong. }
9... Nd7
{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }
10. Bf4
{ White tries his best to keep the game under control. He protects the e5-pawn and develops a piece. }
10... Qh4
{ There is nothing wrong with the old classical  10...Ndc5  followed by taking on  d3  , which gives Black equality. The move 10... Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after 12.O-O-O in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. O-O
{ Taking advantage of the fact that Black is unable to take  12...Nxe5  due to the fork after  13.Be2  Ng4  14.Bxg4  Qxg4  15.f3  . This was considered to be fine for White until Black came up with 12... g5! }
12... g5
{ An incredibly bold move that changed the course of theory in this entire system. Black burns all bridges and goes for the e5-pawn. White has no other choice but to give up this pawn. From here on the variations become very forcing. The battle will focus on whether or not White can prove sufficient compensation for the pawn he is about to lose. }
13. cxd5
{ White took 13. cxd5 in 135 out of 138 games played in this position as of today. The reason for this is straightforward: White is unwilling to give up the e5-pawn that easily, and by taking on d5 he attacks the e4-knight. Any other move would have simply given up the e5-pawn, which White is not ready to part with. Moving the f4-bishop would lose the e5-pawn, Taking on e4 with the knight right away doesn't help either as Black then takes the f4-bishop and White will eventually lose his central pawn. }
13... Bxc3
{ 13...gxf4  and  13...Nxc3  are good moves too. I personally like the move 13... Bxc3 as it minimizes White's options. Needless to say it also assures Black a comfortable position. Instead of saving the knight on e4 or taking the bishop on f4, Black first takes on c3 and attacks the d4-knight instead, practically forcing White's next move. }
14. bxc3
{ 14.Be3  This bizarre move was played once in a correspondence game. Apart from the widely popular 14. bxc3 this is the only other move for White that does not lose on the spot. However, instead of going for the crazy  14...Nd2  which happened in the game, I suggest simply taking  14...exd5  , and after  15.bxc3  we immediately transpose to the mainline. }
14... exd5
{ Once again going for the e5-pawn by keeping the attack on the f4-bishop. At this point White has two ways to continue. Either he sacs the e5-pawn by playing   15.Be3  or he tries to save the pawn with  15.e6  or  15.Bxe4  . The latter two end up leading to the same position. }
15. Be3
{ White sacrifices the central pawn but keeps the bishop pair and claims that he will get enough compensation for the given pawn. }
15... Nxe5
{ The main question is: does White have enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn? }
16. f3
{ There is no other choice. If White wants to fight for the initiative he must first get rid of the e4-knight. Regaining the pawn with  16.Bxe4  dxe4  17.Qxe4  is answered by  17...Re8  , and with ...Bh3 coming next White faces great difficulty stopping the attack on his king. }
16... Nc5
{ Black keeps the pawn and asks White to prove his compensation. Yes, the kingside has been weakened, and it would have been much better for Black if he had his g-pawn back on g7, but let us not forget that Black's queen is right at the center of the action while White's queen is far away. If White's queen were on h5, we might as well have resigned the game right away, but with our own queen sitting on h5, it is an entirely different story. Black's queen on h5 stops any kind of immediate attack on the kingside by defending g5 and h7 and attacking the f3-pawn. }
17. Bf5
{ White's biggest asset is his control over the weak f5-square, so it makes sense that he fights for it with all his might. }
17... Ne6
{ Some games continued with  17...f6  which is also pretty decent, supporting the g5-pawn and e5-knight. I like 17...Ne6 better as it helps in the fight for the f5-square. Being a pawn up, we plan to eliminate as many pieces as possible and target those pieces that can jump to f5-square. We also threaten to take on  f3  after exchanging on  d4  . }
18. Rae1 Nxd4
{ First, we eliminate the knight that had the potential to jump to f5. } 19.
Bxd4 Nc6
{ Black tries to exchange the other minor pieces and aims for an endgame with an extra pawn. }
20. Bf6
{ This might look scary, but once you spot that this bishop cannot even stay for one move on f6, it looks silly to play Bf6 in the first place. }
20... Qh6 { Getting rid of the bishop immediately. } 21. Bxc8 Qxf6 22. Bxb7
Rad8
{ Our king is not only safe but simply much better than White's king. We have more space on the kingside. It is time for White to start looking for equality by exchanging on c6. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4
{ Just like 5. a3, this move is also in sync with White's previous move. This was the other plan of Team Anand which we wanted to use against Kramnik in the Bonn match back in 2008. That never happened, although Anand later used it against Kramnik in the 2013 Tal Memorial. I also used this World Championship preparation once against George Meier and won a nice game in Hungary in 2009 after the Bonn Match. Back then this move had more surprise value and was treated as a one-game idea. Over the years Black has found multiple ways to hold the balance, and nowadays there are many ways Black can force equality. }
5... d5
{ The most principled decision. Black strikes in the center immediately. } 6.
e5
{ White also fights with all his might for the center and grabs as much space as possible. Playing  6.cxd5  helps Black to get his c8-bishop in the game faster and after  6...exd5  7.e5  Ne4  8.Bd3  c5  we will transpose to the mainline given later in this chapter. }
6... Ne4
{ Taking advantage of the pin on the c3-knight, Black puts his knight on e4 with the idea of playing ...c5 next. White has more space while Black is better developed, so it is now a struggle between strategic advantage and dynamic play. Black must act quickly and should not allow White to consolidate his position. Thankfully Black has already castled and thus is ready for open combat. }
7. Bd3
{ More than a thousand games have been played already with this move. White tries to eliminate the knight on e4.   7.Nf3  c5  8.Bd3  transposes to the mainline.  7.a3  is also a serious try from White's side, which we have taken a look at already. }
7... c5
{ Once again Black opens up the position, taking advantage of White's uncastled king. }
8. Ne2
{ 8.Nf3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  transposes directly back to this variation.  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Nge2  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nd7  also transposes back to the sideline 10. cxd5. }
8... cxd4 9. Nxd4
{ Why did Black waste two moves with ...c5 and ...cxd4, allowing White's knight to come d4 all the way from g1? The point can be seen in the following couple of moves, which will make it all clear why the naive-looking ...c5/...cxd4 is so strong. }
9... Nd7
{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }
10. Bf4
{ White tries his best to keep the game under control. He protects the e5-pawn and develops a piece. }
10... Qh4
{ There is nothing wrong with the old classical  10...Ndc5  followed by taking on  d3  , which gives Black equality. The move 10... Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after 12.O-O-O in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. O-O
{ Taking advantage of the fact that Black is unable to take  12...Nxe5  due to the fork after  13.Be2  Ng4  14.Bxg4  Qxg4  15.f3  . This was considered to be fine for White until Black came up with 12... g5! }
12... g5
{ An incredibly bold move that changed the course of theory in this entire system. Black burns all bridges and goes for the e5-pawn. White has no other choice but to give up this pawn. From here on the variations become very forcing. The battle will focus on whether or not White can prove sufficient compensation for the pawn he is about to lose. }
13. cxd5
{ White took 13. cxd5 in 135 out of 138 games played in this position as of today. The reason for this is straightforward: White is unwilling to give up the e5-pawn that easily, and by taking on d5 he attacks the e4-knight. Any other move would have simply given up the e5-pawn, which White is not ready to part with. Moving the f4-bishop would lose the e5-pawn, Taking on e4 with the knight right away doesn't help either as Black then takes the f4-bishop and White will eventually lose his central pawn. }
13... Bxc3
{ 13...gxf4  and  13...Nxc3  are good moves too. I personally like the move 13... Bxc3 as it minimizes White's options. Needless to say it also assures Black a comfortable position. Instead of saving the knight on e4 or taking the bishop on f4, Black first takes on c3 and attacks the d4-knight instead, practically forcing White's next move. }
14. bxc3
{ 14.Be3  This bizarre move was played once in a correspondence game. Apart from the widely popular 14. bxc3 this is the only other move for White that does not lose on the spot. However, instead of going for the crazy  14...Nd2  which happened in the game, I suggest simply taking  14...exd5  , and after  15.bxc3  we immediately transpose to the mainline. }
14... exd5
{ Once again going for the e5-pawn by keeping the attack on the f4-bishop. At this point White has two ways to continue. Either he sacs the e5-pawn by playing   15.Be3  or he tries to save the pawn with  15.e6  or  15.Bxe4  . The latter two end up leading to the same position. }
15. Be3
{ White sacrifices the central pawn but keeps the bishop pair and claims that he will get enough compensation for the given pawn. }
15... Nxe5
{ The main question is: does White have enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn? }
16. f3
{ There is no other choice. If White wants to fight for the initiative he must first get rid of the e4-knight. Regaining the pawn with  16.Bxe4  dxe4  17.Qxe4  is answered by  17...Re8  , and with ...Bh3 coming next White faces great difficulty stopping the attack on his king. }
16... Nc5
{ Black keeps the pawn and asks White to prove his compensation. Yes, the kingside has been weakened, and it would have been much better for Black if he had his g-pawn back on g7, but let us not forget that Black's queen is right at the center of the action while White's queen is far away. If White's queen were on h5, we might as well have resigned the game right away, but with our own queen sitting on h5, it is an entirely different story. Black's queen on h5 stops any kind of immediate attack on the kingside by defending g5 and h7 and attacking the f3-pawn. }
17. Bf5
{ White's biggest asset is his control over the weak f5-square, so it makes sense that he fights for it with all his might. }
17... Ne6
{ Some games continued with  17...f6  which is also pretty decent, supporting the g5-pawn and e5-knight. I like 17...Ne6 better as it helps in the fight for the f5-square. Being a pawn up, we plan to eliminate as many pieces as possible and target those pieces that can jump to f5-square. We also threaten to take on  f3  after exchanging on  d4  . }
18. g4
{ Preventing Black from taking on f3 and asking him where he wants to place his queen. }
18... Qh4
{ I like this move more than Ding Liren's choice of 18... Qh6, which he played against Wesley in the Skilling open in November 2020. There is nothing wrong with Ding's move, and it also gives Black a fine position, but I personally like ...Qh4 more as it prevents White from getting his rook to the e-file. }
19. Rad1
{ 19.Rae1?  doesn't work because of  19...Nxd4  followed by ...Nxf3+ when the e1-rook hangs. The point of putting the queen on h4 becomes clear in this variation.   Also, after  19.Bf2  the move  19...Nxd4  is a nice intermezzo when White must recapture with  20.Bxd4  to keep the f3-pawn alive. After  20...Nc6  Black once again succeeds in exchanging all dangerous minor pieces while keeping his extra pawn. }
19... Nc4 20. Bf2
{ Gains a tempo but only helps Black to get closer to White's king. } 20... Qh3
{ Now ...Nf4 is a threat, while White is unable to play  21.Bg3  due to  21...Ne3  . }
21. Rfe1 { Getting ready to play Bg3 in case of  21...Nf4  . } 21... Na3
{ This leads to a cute repetition of moves. White needs his queen to be on the second rank to be able to play Bg3 after ...Nf4.   Suppose he plays:  22.Qd3  @@StartBracket@@or 22. Qe2@@EndBracket@@  and after  22...Nf4  plays  23.Qf1  . That doesn't bother us as we are happy to play any endgame with an extra pawn. After 21... Na3 the game should end in a draw with:  22.Qd2  Nc4  23.Qc2  Na3  etc. }

{ 19.Rae1?  doesn't work because of  19...Nxd4  followed by ...Nxf3+ when the e1-rook hangs. The point of putting the queen on h4 becomes clear in this variation.   Also, after  19.Bf2  the move  19...Nxd4  is a nice intermezzo when White must recapture with  20.Bxd4  to keep the f3-pawn alive.   After  20...Nc6  Black once again succeeds in exchanging all dangerous minor pieces while keeping his extra pawn. }
19... Nc4 20. Rfe1 Nxe3
{ It's time to eliminate this piece so that the jump ...Nf4 becomes available. }
21. Rxe3 Qh6
{ This is a solid choice. Black first takes care of his queen by moving her majesty to the f6-square before jumping to f4 with his knight. }
22. Bxe6 Bxe6
{ Black has managed to stop all of White's attacking ideas while keeping the extra pawn. After the queen comes to f6 and rook to e8 Black's position looks very solid. It is not clear how White is going to get back his pawn. The engine still calls it 0.00, but that is mainly because it is hard to imagine how Black can convert this extra pawn into a tangible advantage due to White's strong knight on d4. Black will try to exchange rooks on the e-file to make his extra pawn more effective.   Since Black's extra pawn is not enough to give him an advantage and on the other White cannot regain his sacrificed pawn either, the position remains balanced. Twice in 2019-2020, in correspondence chess, the games ended in a draw, confirming the position's stability from both sides. ½-½ Guimera Manjon,A  @@StartBracket@@ 2302 @@EndBracket@@ -Marchisotti,M  @@StartBracket@@ 2347 @@EndBracket@@  ICCF 2020 }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4
{ Just like 5. a3, this move is also in sync with White's previous move. This was the other plan of Team Anand which we wanted to use against Kramnik in the Bonn match back in 2008. That never happened, although Anand later used it against Kramnik in the 2013 Tal Memorial. I also used this World Championship preparation once against George Meier and won a nice game in Hungary in 2009 after the Bonn Match. Back then this move had more surprise value and was treated as a one-game idea. Over the years Black has found multiple ways to hold the balance, and nowadays there are many ways Black can force equality. }
5... d5
{ The most principled decision. Black strikes in the center immediately. } 6.
e5
{ White also fights with all his might for the center and grabs as much space as possible. Playing  6.cxd5  helps Black to get his c8-bishop in the game faster and after  6...exd5  7.e5  Ne4  8.Bd3  c5  we will transpose to the mainline given later in this chapter. }
6... Ne4
{ Taking advantage of the pin on the c3-knight, Black puts his knight on e4 with the idea of playing ...c5 next. White has more space while Black is better developed, so it is now a struggle between strategic advantage and dynamic play. Black must act quickly and should not allow White to consolidate his position. Thankfully Black has already castled and thus is ready for open combat. }
7. Bd3
{ More than a thousand games have been played already with this move. White tries to eliminate the knight on e4.   7.Nf3  c5  8.Bd3  transposes to the mainline.  7.a3  is also a serious try from White's side, which we have taken a look at already. }
7... c5
{ Once again Black opens up the position, taking advantage of White's uncastled king. }
8. Ne2
{ 8.Nf3  cxd4  9.Nxd4  transposes directly back to this variation.  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Nge2  cxd4  10.Nxd4  Nd7  also transposes back to the sideline 10. cxd5. }
8... cxd4 9. Nxd4
{ Why did Black waste two moves with ...c5 and ...cxd4, allowing White's knight to come d4 all the way from g1? The point can be seen in the following couple of moves, which will make it all clear why the naive-looking ...c5/...cxd4 is so strong. }
9... Nd7
{ It was all for this move! By eliminating the d4-pawn Black has managed to weaken White's e5-pawn, which was looking very strong until now. White has to find a suitable way to maintain the e5-pawn. It is Black's turn to gain some important tempos. }
10. Bf4
{ White tries his best to keep the game under control. He protects the e5-pawn and develops a piece. }
10... Qh4
{ There is nothing wrong with the old classical  10...Ndc5  followed by taking on  d3  , which gives Black equality. The move 10... Qh4 became more popular after Black found a forcing way to kill all of White's active ideas and completely equalize the game.  This line with 10... Qh4 became such a forcing and direct route to equality that players simply didn't bother to go back to the old classical line of 10... Ndc5, which is also fine. I too recommend the modern 10... Qh4 as it is direct and White doesn't have any advantage there. Concretely the move 10... Qh4 attacks the f4-bishop. }
11. g3 { Otherwise the e5-pawn is lost. } 11... Qh5
{ 11...Qh3  was popular at some point, and I won a nice game against Meier after 12.O-O-O in a very complicated battle. Soon 11... Qh5 became more popular, preventing White from castling long for the moment. }
12. O-O
{ Taking advantage of the fact that Black is unable to take  12...Nxe5  due to the fork after  13.Be2  Ng4  14.Bxg4  Qxg4  15.f3  . This was considered to be fine for White until Black came up with 12... g5! }
12... g5
{ An incredibly bold move that changed the course of theory in this entire system. Black burns all bridges and goes for the e5-pawn. White has no other choice but to give up this pawn. From here on the variations become very forcing. The battle will focus on whether or not White can prove sufficient compensation for the pawn he is about to lose. }
13. cxd5
{ White took 13. cxd5 in 135 out of 138 games played in this position as of today. The reason for this is straightforward: White is unwilling to give up the e5-pawn that easily, and by taking on d5 he attacks the e4-knight. Any other move would have simply given up the e5-pawn, which White is not ready to part with. Moving the f4-bishop would lose the e5-pawn, Taking on e4 with the knight right away doesn't help either as Black then takes the f4-bishop and White will eventually lose his central pawn. }
13... Bxc3
{ 13...gxf4  and  13...Nxc3  are good moves too. I personally like the move 13... Bxc3 as it minimizes White's options. Needless to say it also assures Black a comfortable position. Instead of saving the knight on e4 or taking the bishop on f4, Black first takes on c3 and attacks the d4-knight instead, practically forcing White's next move. }
14. bxc3
{ 14.Be3  This bizarre move was played once in a correspondence game. Apart from the widely popular 14. bxc3 this is the only other move for White that does not lose on the spot. However, instead of going for the crazy  14...Nd2  which happened in the game, I suggest simply taking  14...exd5  , and after  15.bxc3  we immediately transpose to the mainline. }
14... exd5
{ Once again going for the e5-pawn by keeping the attack on the f4-bishop. At this point White has two ways to continue. Either he sacs the e5-pawn by playing   15.Be3  or he tries to save the pawn with  15.e6  or  15.Bxe4  . The latter two end up leading to the same position. }
15. Be3
{ White sacrifices the central pawn but keeps the bishop pair and claims that he will get enough compensation for the given pawn. }
15... Nxe5
{ The main question is: does White have enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn? }
16. f3
{ There is no other choice. If White wants to fight for the initiative he must first get rid of the e4-knight. Regaining the pawn with  16.Bxe4  dxe4  17.Qxe4  is answered by  17...Re8  , and with ...Bh3 coming next White faces great difficulty stopping the attack on his king. }
16... Nxd3
{ This way Black returns the pawn immediately and aims for simplifications. This is a valid alternative though I personally prefer to keep the extra pawn. }
17. Qxd3 Nd6 18. g4 { White wins back the g5-pawn this way. } 18... Qg6 19.
Qxg6+ hxg6 20. Bxg5 f6
{ By playing ...Bd7 next Black completes his development, after which he takes control over the c- and e-files by bringing in the rooks. This line is definitely playable, and Black has held this position in a comfortable way a number of times. Nevertheless, I think 16... Nc5 poses more of a challenge to White and asks him to prove that he has enough compensation for the given pawn. }

15. Qe3 Re8
{ All of Black's pieces are finely developed and very active. His rooks are ready to enter on the seventh rank. Playing  16.Ne5  does not help White as Black answers  16...Ne4  , threatening ...f6 and bringing back his own knight to d6 if needed. Black has excellent compensation for just one pawn. White should look for a way to bail out, but it's not clear how he can do this at the moment. }

Well, our d7- knight is way better than his c3-knight. After White plays b4 and Bb2 and Black plays ...b5 and ...Bb7, the b7-bishop is much more active than its counterpart thanks to the open diagonal, which White doesn't have as the knight on c3 blocks the diagonal of the b2-bishop. The extra tempo of Qc2 will also turn out to be problematic once Black plays ...Rc8. Considering these factors, it is clear Black is doing fine. }

{ This move makes no sense. In the Bd2 Nimzo White's queen is usually much better placed on d1, from where she often comes to f3 after White has moved the f3-knight to e5.

It would make more sense to give one of these two pieces a different purpose. }

White can bail out by going for the d7-pawn while Black takes on c4. It is to be noted that the doubled f-pawn is a blessing for Black. Not only does it mean there is no back rank threat, but it also restricts the f3-knight which cannot jump to e5 to put pressure on the f7-pawn.

8. a4
{ White finds a useful move, threatening Ba3 and keeping the bishop on  f1  to save a tempo in case Black takes ...dxc4. Unlike the moves  8.Bb2  or  8.Qc2  this move does not support the pawn on c3, and Black takes advantage of that immediately. }
8... Qa5

9... Nc6
{ I like this move more than Dominguez's  9...Ne4  . By playing ...Nc6 Black wants to get his knight to  a5  to increase the pressure on the c4-pawn. The job of the queen on  a5  is done once Black has forced White to play Bd2, which is not the ideal square for this bishop. }
10. Be2 Qc7 11. O-O Na5
{ Black forces White to play the move  12.cxd5  , after which he replies  12...exd5  and gets access to the c4- and e4-squares for his knights. White's bishop on d2 remains misplaced, which guarantees Black a decent position. }

8... Nc6
{ Anish did not repeat the move:  8...b6  move that he played against Yu Yangi. However, Black has similar ideas after both ...Nc6 and ...b6: he wants to put pressure on the c4-pawn with ...b6, ...Ba6, ...Na5, ...Rc8 etc. By choosing 8... Nc6 over 8... b6, Black avoids the line:  9.cxd5  exd5  10.Ne5  that occurred in the game Caruana - Dominguez, 2020 Clutch Rapid. }

{ Getting into business at the earliest opportunity. Black builds pressure against the c4-pawn and forces White to waste time defending that pawn.   With the bishop on  d3  ,  10.cxd5  is not a wise idea since Black can first play the intermediate  10...c4  before taking on d5. }
10. Ne5
{ The normal-looking move.   10.Nd2  looks passive, and after  10...Qc7  with the idea of ...Bd7 and ...Rac8 Black's play along the c-file becomes too strong. }

13. Be2 Nb3 14. Ra2 Qc7
{ Anticipating that White will be playing e4 in the future, Black keeps the c4-pawn well-protected. }

15... Ne8
{ The first step - bringing the knight to d6 from where it will stabilize the pawn on c4. }
16. e4 Nxc1

17. Rxc1 Nd6 18. exd5 Bb7
{ The final step. Black gets back the pawn with a lovely position to play for. The knight on e5 will be chased away with ...f6 soon. The bishop on d5 and knight on d6 occupy nice central squares and cannot be attacked. The pawn on c4 is not a weakness anymore, and it restricts White's bishop. }

{ White's plan on the queenside comes to a dead end. On the kingside, he can't do much with Black's pawn sitting on e4. Black will continue with ...Bf5/...Qd7/...Ne7 etc. and slowly regroup. The bishop on c1 is nicely buried. Strategically Black is doing great, and although the computer gives only a slight edge to Black, in a practical game I would find it very difficult to play White as there are no clear targets or plans. }

16. O-O Nd6
{ White will soon lose the f5-pawn. Black has many ideas like ...Nac4/...Qc4/...Rae8, slowly increasing the pressure. The nature of the compensation for the pawn is strategic, which means Black has multiple ways of continuing according to his tastes. I would prefer to collect the f5-pawn and play against White's weak c1-bishop. }

The main difference is that after 6... Nc6 Black sometimes goes without playing ...d6, as we will see in some variations. For now, Black wants to play  ...e5  and he waits to see how White is going to develop his pieces. Black is currently ahead in development, which means it makes sense to strike in the center. }
7. Ne2
{ This is a standard plan in many variations of the Rubinstein system. White procrastinates on his bishop's development and first gets his knight to g3. }
7... b6
{ This time White has shown his hand clearly by starting with Ne2. He wants to get the knight to g3 first, so we switch plans - instead of playing ...e5, we would like to attack the c4-pawn immediately. }

9. e4 Ne8
{ The c4-pawn is weak, and we will eventually win it - the pawn is not running anywhere. First and foremost, we have to take care of White's plan on the kingside. White was intending to play Bg5, pinning the knight on f6. That is the reason Black pulls back the knight to e8. He also has the option of playing ...Nd6 in the future to increase the pressure on the c4-pawn. }
10. Bd3 Na5 11. Qe2 c5
{ Black stays loyal to his plan, and once again, we see the advantage of not yet having played ...d6. Black is much faster than White, already creating play against the c4-pawn while White is not yet even thinking of attacking on the kingside. Currently Black is also planning to win the d4-pawn by using the ...Nb3 fork. }
12. Be3 Rc8 13. d5
{ 13.Rc1  is a blunder as after  13...Nd6  White is unable to play  14.e5  due to the intermediate  14...cxd4  , attacking the e3-bishop and c4-pawn. }
13... f5
{ The computer claims that the move  13...Qh4  is more accurate, but I think it does not matter and we can play in the exact same way we did in the variation with 12. d5. Let me further increase your confidence by mentioning that 13... f5 was the choice of Kramnik. :- @@EndBracket@@ }

{ Kramnik had great compensation for the pawn against Svidler in the Alekhine Memorial 2013. Here Svidler probably should have played a move like  18.Qc2  , which gives Black multiple ways to continue while having a balanced position. I would prefer to play  18...Nd6  , attacking the f5-pawn while maintaining a nice blockade on c4. The engines say Black has many other ways to get decent compensation like  18...Nb3  followed by  19.--  19...Nd4  ,  18...Nf6  and  19.--  19...Nxd5  , etc.   In the game, Svidler played  18.Rad1  and after  18...Qxd3  19.Rxd3  Nd6  Black had an excellent position as he gets the f5-pawn back while White remains with his bad bishop and multiple pawn weaknesses.

11. a4

6... Nc6
{ In terms of popularity, this is the fifth most played move in this position, with only about 35 games played. The idea is to play a quick ...e5. Rubinstein's above-mentioned game continued with  6...d6  , which is also the suggestion of GM Roiz in his famous Nimzo book.  The idea of  ...d6  is the same as 6... Nc6 - Black wants to play ...e5. The main difference is that after 6... Nc6 Black sometimes goes without playing ...d6, as we will see in some variations. For now, Black wants to play  ...e5  and he waits to see how White is going to develop his pieces. Black is currently ahead in development, which means it makes sense to strike in the center. }
7. Bd3
{ Typically in this line White wants to put his bishop on d3 and the knight on e2, after which he can roll his central pawns forward to gain maximum space. So naturally 7. Bd3 is the most popular move in the position. }
7... e5
{ As Black has planned, he strikes in the center. Given a chance he will also play ...e4 next and counter White's plan of gaining space in the center. }
8. Ne2
{ Once again the most popular move.   8.Qc2  stops the move ...e4 temporarily, but after  8...Qe7  or  8...Re8  the threat of ...e4 becomes even more deadly. By playing 8. Ne2 White challenges Black's strategical threat and wants him to show the strength of his plan. }
8... e4
{ We continue with our plan. Here White has two options, and both are similar in nature. }
9. Bc2 b6
{ Here we see the advantage of playing ...Nc6 instead of ...d6 on move 6. Black ignores ...d6 and instead directly starts to target the c4-pawn, which is the weakest link in White's position. ...Ba6 and ...Na5 cannot be prevented. }
10. Ng3 Ba6
{ There is no time to protect the e4-pawn as White is ready to play f3. Since White has not castled yet, Black takes advantage of that and aims for the c4-pawn with his bishop, stopping White from castling for a long time. }
11. f3
{ This is a cunning move. White will either get his pawn on e4 or, after ...exf3, activate his queen on f3. }
11... Bxc4
{ Black is keen on getting his bishop to c4 quickly in order to stop White's castling. }
12. fxe4 d6
{ This position already looks fine for Black from an opening point of view, since White's king is stuck in the center. I'm still going a bit deeper to understand in an actual game how someone might continue as White, and the following idea looks attractive. }
13. Kf2
{ It is understandable that White would like to get his king to a safe square, and this way of castling artificially comes to mind from a human point of view. }
13... Na5
{ Black ties White's queen to the protection of the b3-square by creating a positional threat of ...Bb3. }
14. Re1 Re8 15. Kg1 g6
{ I love this move. Once this has been played the knight on g3 becomes useless, and Black no longer has to worry about ideas like Nf5, Nh5, or e5. An interesting plan going forward could be to play ...Qe7 and ...h5 with the idea to dislodge the knight from g3 and increase the pressure on the e4-pawn. An idea like ...Nh7 followed by ...Ng5 also comes to mind, especially if White keeps his queen on f3. }

This is the primary reason we don't want to play the main move 6...c5 here, since after the moves: @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4.a3  Bxc3+  5.bxc3  we played  5...c5  only because we still had the flexibility to decide on which side to the castle.  On the other hand, White has lost the option to play f3 and e4 and we take full advantage of this, going for a variation that will avoid long theoretical lines, and create our own theory. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
6... Nc6
{ In terms of popularity, this is the fifth most played move in this position, with only about 35 games played. The idea is to play a quick ...e5. Rubinstein's above-mentioned game continued with  6...d6  , which is also the suggestion of GM Roiz in his famous Nimzo book.  The idea of  ...d6  is the same as 6... Nc6 - Black wants to play ...e5. The main difference is that after 6... Nc6 Black sometimes goes without playing ...d6, as we will see in some variations. For now, Black wants to play  ...e5  and he waits to see how White is going to develop his pieces. Black is currently ahead in development, which means it makes sense to strike in the center. }
7. Bd3
{ Typically in this line White wants to put his bishop on d3 and the knight on e2, after which he can roll his central pawns forward to gain maximum space. So naturally 7. Bd3 is the most popular move in the position. }
7... e5
{ As Black has planned, he strikes in the center. Given a chance he will also play ...e4 next and counter White's plan of gaining space in the center. }
8. Ne2
{ Once again the most popular move.   8.Qc2  stops the move ...e4 temporarily, but after  8...Qe7  or  8...Re8  the threat of ...e4 becomes even more deadly. By playing 8. Ne2 White challenges Black's strategical threat and wants him to show the strength of his plan. }
8... e4
{ We continue with our plan. Here White has two options, and both are similar in nature. }
9. Bc2 b6
{ Here we see the advantage of playing ...Nc6 instead of ...d6 on move 6. Black ignores ...d6 and instead directly starts to target the c4-pawn, which is the weakest link in White's position. ...Ba6 and ...Na5 cannot be prevented. }
10. O-O
{ Unable to stop Black's plan directly, White tries to carry out his own plan on the center and kingside. }
10... Ba6 11. f3 Qe7
{ The c4-pawn is not running anywhere. Black first takes care of his central pawn which is shutting in White's light-squared bishop. }
12. fxe4 Nxe4 13. Rf4
{ The only way to get rid of the knight on e4. White tries his best to activate his light-squared bishop. }
13... f5
{ For obvious reasons, Black is not going to remove the knight from e4, since it is killing White's bishops. Saving the c4-pawn is an impossible task for White, so Black doesn't need to rush to grab that pawn. }
14. Ng3 Nxg3 15. hxg3
{ Finally White has gotten rid of the e4-knight, but it comes with the price of ruining his own pawn structure. }
15... Bxc4 16. Bxf5 Na5
{ This move looks odd until we get its point. Black would naturally love to play ...d5, but the immediate:   16...d5  loses after  17.Qh5  when Black is unable to play  17...g6  as the c6-knight hangs after White takes twice on g6. Once we see this line the move  15...Na5  becomes obvious. Black wants to play ...d5 and also has the idea of sometimes playing ...Nb3. }
17. e4
{ White tries to activate his other bishop. Preventing ...Nb3   17.Bc2  with this move would have allowed  17...Rxf4  followed by ...d5, when Black has good control over the light squares and is doing fine. }
17... Nb3 18. Rb1 Nxc1
{ Black takes the bishop before it can become dangerous. All this time, the bishop was dead and Black did not bother, but once White played e3-e4 the bishop started waking up, so Black rightly eliminates it, showing another advantage of the move 16... Na5. }
19. Qxc1 g6
{ Now the f5-bishop has to move, and Black plays ...Bd3 next, when the e4-pawn hangs. Black is better already as he has managed to stop all White's attacks and has taken over the initiative along with some material. }

{ All of Black's pieces are nicely placed, and his bishops are more active than White's bishops. White is still yet to castle. Black has no weaknesses in the position and thus does not mind trading queens. He has a balanced position that is easy to play. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Ne2
{ The first four out of five games with this move were played by Rubinstein. According to MegaBase the very first game was Rubinstein against Saemisch in 1925. The line is, however, known as the Reshevsky Variation. The American GM Samuel Reshevsky first played this move in the famous AVRO tournament in 1938 when he was paired against Botvinnik, and he eventually played it about 20 different times in tournament games.White wants to play a3 next to kick the b4-bishop away and then move the knight to f4 or g3. Sometimes he can also keep the knight on e2 and play g3 and Bg2 instead. }
5... c6
{ This is a very modern line compared to all other black moves. The first game with this move that I can see in MegaBase took place in 1992, but it became popular only after 2010. I first stumbled onto this line when the game between Rapport and Wei Yi took place in the World Junior Championship in Athens 2012. I picked up the variation soon afterward and played a few games with it - successfully.The move 5... c6 may look odd but the idea is crystal clear. White's main plan, or rather the only plan, is to chase the bishop from b4 by playing a3 next. There cannot be any other upside of playing Ne2. Meanwhile Black wants to retain his bishop on the best possible diagonal, which is the b8-h2 diagonal. He would like to play ...d5 and keep the bishop on d6.   One of the main lines continues with @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5...d5  6.a3  Bd6  7.c5  , when Black's bishop must leave this nice diagonal.  By playing 5...c6, Black wants to play ...d5 and yet be able to keep the bishop on the b8-h2 diagonal. He has created a square for his bishop on c7 so that when a3 is played, it can move to a5 and then eventually land on c7. }
6. a3
{ Sooner or later White will play this move, and irrespective of what White plays, it will eventually transpose back to this line. }
6... Ba5 7. b4
{ The main move. White wants to move the bishop before taking measures on the kingside development.   7.Qc2  d5  8.Ng3  transposes to 7.Ng3.   7.Bd2  is rarely played and it does not have any independent value, since it will transpose to 7. Ng3 either after  7...d5  8.Ng3  or after  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Ng3  Re8  10.Bd3  Nbd7  11.O-O  . }
7... Bc7 8. e4
{ Once again the most principled reaction. White grabs the center and tries to prove that he gets full domination over it. The only problem is his development and king's placement. White is far behind in development, and he is still three moves away from castling.   8.Bb2  d5  9.Ng3  transposes to the 8. Ng3 variation.  8.g3  we have seen via the move order 7. g3.   After the moves  8.c5  d6  9.cxd6  Bxd6  there is no good way to stop Black from playing ...e5, and  10.f4  creates further weaknesses. Black can play  10...a5  when White is behind in development while the game opens up. }
8... d5
{ Beyond a doubt, Black would be more than happy to blast open the center with White's king still on e1. I also find the triangle from g8 to a8 aesthetically pleasing, which has absolutely zero relevance to the evaluation of the position but I still felt like mentioning it. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
9. e5
{ Of course White declines the offer to open up the center. This is also the most popular choice for White. Including  9.cxd5  exd5  would only help Black bring the c8-bishop into play and thus has never been a popular move for White. }
9... Nfd7
{ Here Black has two moves  9...Ne8  or the text move 9... Nfd7. Both involve a future ...f6 break. I recommend playing the knight to d7, keeping a potential threat of sacrificing the knight on e5, which we will see multiple times in this variation. Given a chance, Black can also just take on c4 and then protect the pawn with ...Nb6. }
10. Nf4
{ White stops Black from playing ...f6 by keeping the e6-pawn under attack. }
10... a5
{ Unexpectedly the attack comes from a completely different corner. Black strikes on the queenside to break open the center! The point is that by attacking the b4-pawn Black is laying the groundwork for a future ...c5. For instance, a move like 11. b5 is met by a timely ...c5 break. }
11. Rb1
{ 11.b5  dxc4  12.Bxc4  c5  White won't be able to save the e5-pawn. Interestingly, to get to this-e5 pawn, Black had to play ...c5 to attack the d4-pawn. To play ...c5, he first had to get to the b4-pawn; hence he played ...a5. So, in short, the move 10...a5 was in a way aimed against the e5-pawn. :- @@EndBracket@@ }
11... axb4 12. axb4 c5
{ A spectacular move! Despite controlling the c5-square with two pawns, White could not prevent the move ...c5. Black shows great imagination and comes up with a nice combination. From a purely logical perspective, the move also makes sense: White is totally under-developed compared to Black, so it is high time to open up the center. That is the philosophy of this move, but what actually happens if White takes the pawn? We will take a look at that next. }
13. bxc5
{ White does not want to give the e5-pawn and wants Black to show his idea. }
13... Ba5
{ Another deep point of playing 10...a5 is revealed. Black switches his bishop back to the diagonal which it previously occupied on move three! By attacking and pinning the c3-knight Black forces White to waste another move to defend this piece. For the last few moves, White was kept busy protecting his pawns and pieces and he had no time to develop the light-squared bishop, which he wanted to do after 10. Nf4.Now after  14.Bd2  White removes the pin and it looks like White has consolidated his position and simply remains a pawn up. However, this is far from reality and Black has a nice tactic. I suggest you pause the MoveTrainer and try to find Black's tactic after 14. Bd2. }
14. Bb2 Nxc5
{ Utilizing the pin on the c3-knight, Black takes on  c5  as the move  15.dxc5  is met with  15...d4  when Black gets back the piece while White is left with a bad structure. White's c5-pawn would be lost soon. }
15. cxd5 Ne4 16. Qb3
{ The following move, in a way, reminds me of the game Averbakh vs. Spassky from the USSR championship in 1956. }
16... Nc6
{ The importance of development cannot be highlighted in a better way. Black wants to take on d4 either with the knight or with the queen if White accepts the knight sacrifice on c6. Since move 10 White was planning to develop his f1-bishop and castle, but he never got the chance to do so. }
17. Rd1
{ 17.dxc6  Qxd4  there is no way to prevent the devastating check on f2 while defending the c3-knight at the same time. The computers give -6 in favor of Black here.   17.Bd3  does not help either since after  17...exd5  the pawn on d4 is still hanging, and White is unable to castle. The move 17. Rd1 in a way makes sense as White protects his vital pawn on d4. }
17... Nb4
{ Black plays in a Tal-like manner. The threat of ...Na2 is very aesthetically pleasing. The journey of this knight from c6 to a2 is spectacular. Moves like  18.Be2  instantly loses to  18...Na2  , when White cannot save the c3-knight and take on a2 with the queen. This is not an option as Black has  19.Qxa2  Bxc3+  followed by ...Rxa2.   18.dxe6  fxe6  only adds to White's nightmare as the f8-rook comes into play and the f2-pawn is likely to fall. The engine says Black is clearly winning, and White's best bet would be to unpin his knight by playing   18.Ke2!  Once that move is played, we can stop our analysis by looking at the poor king which supports the evaluation of -1 in favor of Black. }

{ We have seen the same 6th and 7th moves with 5. Nf3 instead of 5. Bd3. Both Nf3 and Bd3 have their pros and cons. By playing 5.

For instance, in the current position, if Black goes  7...c5  , then White would play  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Ne2  , an option that he has only because he didn't commit to Nf3.

14. Bxe4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4 Qa5+ 16. Nd2 Bf5
{ The point of including ...cxd4 on move 12 is highlighted here. Because of this move Black can play ...Bf5, as the bishop is supported by the queen on a5. Subsequently, this bishop will land on d3 and stop White from castling permanently. Black is almost winning as White's king remains stuck in the middle of the board. }

His bishop on b2 is passive and the c4-bishop is also vulnerable. Black can jump with his knight to e4 to increase the pressure on the c3-pawn.

8... c5 9. Ne2 Qc7 10. Ba2
{ It is quite standard to put the bishop on  a2  to keep some control over the c4- and d5-squares. Eventually White would like to open up the position with a central break, and the bishop is ideally placed to facilitate that. GM Rakhmanov and GM Tregubov have played this line frequently. Magnus has tried this move twice in rapid games against Aronian and Hikaru. The other popular move is to retreat the bishop to  d3  , putting it on the other diagonal. A move like:  10.Qd3  makes no sense because Black can respond with  10...Rd8  when the queen on d3 comes under an annoying x-ray. }
10... b6
{ When White keeps the bishop on a2, there is little sense in playing ...e5 as this opens up the a2-g8 diagonal for the bishop. So instead, Black takes control over the diagonal which White's bishop left behind. Black is aiming to play ...Ba6 next. }
11. O-O

12... Rd8
{ A crucial idea for Black. White's main plan is to go c4 and d5, creating kingside attacking chances with the help of his bishops. This is something Black must prevent. The rook belongs to  d8  for this purpose. We could also achieve the same by starting with:  12...Nc6  , but this allows White the extra option of  13.c4  which we avoid by delaying ...Nc6. In the position after  12...Rd8  , after  13.c4  cxd4  the c4-pawn is hanging.  12...Nc6  13.Rc1  Na5  14.c4  Rfd8?!  15.d5!  happened in Vishnu Prasanna vs. Nigel Short from the Isle of Man Open Tournament 2018. This is a classic example of how White should play this line and what Black should avoid. }
13. Re1
{ Unpinning the knight to bring it to g3 for a possible future jump to f5 once White gets the d5 break in. The rook on e1 with the knight on g3 also gives White the chance to play e4 and establish good control over the center.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3
{ We have seen the same 6th and 7th moves with 5. Nf3 instead of 5. Bd3. Both Nf3 and Bd3 have their pros and cons. By playing 5. Nf3, White is keen on keeping the bishop on f1 to save a tempo in case Black takes ...dxc4. Hence after 5. Nf3 we refrained from taking on c4 and opted for 7... c5 instead. Here White kept his g1-knight uncommitted, which means it can be developed to e2 instead of f3.  For instance, in the current position, if Black goes  7...c5  , then White would play  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Ne2  , an option that he has only because he didn't commit to Nf3. However, White has already played Bd3 this time, which means he will directly lose a tempo if we take on c4. }
7... dxc4 8. Bxc4
{ Black has gained a tempo for free, which White did not mind giving as he wants to prove that his bishop pair is more important than the loss of a tempo. As we will see, however, this bishop on c1 has a hard time getting into play. }
8... c5 9. Ne2 Qc7 10. Ba2
{ It is quite standard to put the bishop on  a2  to keep some control over the c4- and d5-squares. Eventually White would like to open up the position with a central break, and the bishop is ideally placed to facilitate that. GM Rakhmanov and GM Tregubov have played this line frequently. Magnus has tried this move twice in rapid games against Aronian and Hikaru. The other popular move is to retreat the bishop to  d3  , putting it on the other diagonal. A move like:  10.Qd3  makes no sense because Black can respond with  10...Rd8  when the queen on d3 comes under an annoying x-ray. }
10... b6
{ When White keeps the bishop on a2, there is little sense in playing ...e5 as this opens up the a2-g8 diagonal for the bishop. So instead, Black takes control over the diagonal which White's bishop left behind. Black is aiming to play ...Ba6 next. }
11. O-O
{ White typically wants to open up the position by pushing his central pawns. If the position is opened up the bishops on b2 and a2 would become deadly. }
11... Ba6 12. Bb2
{ Following the plan of pushing the pawns with c4 and targeting the f6-knight.   12.Re1  Nc6  13.Ng3  Rfd8  14.Bb2  would transpose to the mainline. }
12... Rd8
{ A crucial idea for Black. White's main plan is to go c4 and d5, creating kingside attacking chances with the help of his bishops. This is something Black must prevent. The rook belongs to  d8  for this purpose. We could also achieve the same by starting with:  12...Nc6  , but this allows White the extra option of  13.c4  which we avoid by delaying ...Nc6. In the position after  12...Rd8  , after  13.c4  cxd4  the c4-pawn is hanging.  12...Nc6  13.Rc1  Na5  14.c4  Rfd8?!  15.d5!  happened in Vishnu Prasanna vs. Nigel Short from the Isle of Man Open Tournament 2018. This is a classic example of how White should play this line and what Black should avoid. }
13. Rc1
{ This move is connected with the c4 advance. White would like to activate his dark-squared bishop first. }
13... Nc6 14. c4
{ This move sets a nice subtle trap, which is easy to miss. Both Mamedyarov and Aronian fell for it in rapid games. }
14... cxd4 15. exd4
{ Mamedyarov and Aronian both played the move:  15...Ng4  here, which looks nice at first sight. However, after:  16.Ng3  Qf4  White has the nice move  17.h3  when Black's main idea of  17...Nxf2  does not work after  18.Rxf2  Qxg3  19.d5  and White's attack on the kingside becomes irresistible with his monster bishops and a rook occupying the half-open f-file. }
15... b5
{ A well-established line since 2017. If we go chronologically this idea was first mentioned in GM Roiz's nice book on the Nimzo Indian Defense in January 2017. Then it was played by Gharamian in May the same year. Later some correspondence games also followed, showing the solidity of this line. This is a very standard thematic break by Black that we also see in the classical defense of the Caro-Kann. By attacking the pawn on c4, Black makes sure that his knight will get a solid outpost on d5. }
16. d5
{ The best move in the position and also exclusively played. Both:  16.c5  and  16.cxb5  would have given Black complete control over the d5-square. By playing d5 White attacks the knight on f6. Since the other knight on c6 is not under attack due to the pin on the d-file, Black has enough time to counter White's threats. }
16... bxc4
{ This is the only move and a strong one. Black utilizes the pin on the d-file. He now has the intermediate move ...Rxd5 in case White takes on f6. }
17. Bxc4 Bxc4 18. Rxc4 exd5
{ Four correspondence games and the game by Gharamian mentioned above reached this position. Every single game ended in a draw, which is not at all surprising. White has just enough compensation for the pawn to make a draw here. Black will play ...Qd6 once White moves the rook from c4. With his queen on d6, everything seems well protected, and Black still keeps his extra passed pawn. White's strong bishop on b2 gives him just about enough compensation to maintain the balance. }

10. Qc2
{ This is a funny way to protect the bishop. White defends the bishop in the same indirect manner by which Black attacks it. While this might have some aesthetic appeal, it simply ties down White's queen to do a worse job, and Black can exchange his c8-bishop for White's good one. }

{ Nils Grandelius had this position when he was much younger, with a rating of 2371. Instead of his move  13...cxd4  Black has a subtle regrouping, which would have given him a stable and slight advantage. }
13... Nb8
{ By refraining from the exchange on d4 Black makes sure the bishop on c1 remains passive. White's logical way of improving his bishop would be to play  14.e4  which he cannot play as Black would take  14...cxd4  15.cxd4  Nxe4!  16.Qxe4  and finally  16...Qc3+  wins the rook on  a1  . }
14. O-O Nc6 15. e4 h6
{ A crucial move. Black takes away the vital g5-square from both of White's minor pieces. There will be no white kingside attack while Black will continue with ...Rfd8 and ...Rac8, putting pressure on White's central pawns. The plan of ...Na5 aiming for the c4- and b3-squares is also annoying for White. Sometimes Black can trade queens via the c-file as in the endgame Black's outside pawn majority will become prominent.  White would love to roll his central pawns forward, but after  16.e5  Nd5  17.c4  Nde7  he is unable to push his d-pawn as the e5-pawn would hang. Black will play ...Rfd8 next, so a further pawn push is not happening anymore. The engines give a 0.00 evaluation, but the position remains dynamic with all three results possible. I like Black as he does not have any weaknesses in the position. }

{ The same queen which prevented the light-squared bishop exchange on a6 now becomes the reason for the upcoming trade. White's bishop is unable to retreat along the f1-a6 diagonal as his own queen is blocking him. Going forward to b5 is the only way to avoid the trade, but that allows ...a6 and ...b5 after which White's bishop would have to go to d1 to avoid the trade since going to c2 would be answered by ...Be4.Once the light-squared bishops are off, White remains with his bad bishop on c1 and a broken pawn structure. His control over the center gives him enough to maintain the balance, though. }

10. Ba2
{ GM Gulko, GM Levitt, GM Milov, and GM Korobov have played this move frequently in recent times. White keeps the bishop on e2 to facilitate a future d5 pawn break and he makes sure the light-squared bishops won't be traded easily. }
10... b5
{ This move was first seen in 2012, but it only became a respected try after Peter Leko used it in 2019 to beat Korobov in a blitz game. It was also mentioned in the Roiz book back in 2017.   I have known Peter and have worked with him on several occasions, so I can safely say that even in a blitz game Peter would be extremely well-prepared and know what to do - especially when it comes to his pet line, the Nimzo-Indian defense. Since ...Ba6 is not an effective idea anymore, it is understandable that Black wants to put his bishop on b7. He could do this by playing ...b6 or ...b5. The reason for choosing ...b5 is simple: Black keeps the b6-square open for his knight, which will come there via d7. On b6 the knight has the option of jumping to c4/a4/d5 depending on White's setup. }
11. O-O Bb7 12. Qe2
{ This is the most challenging move. In the game Korobov - Leko White played:  12.Re1  Nbd7  13.Bb2  and after  13...Nb6  Peter achieved a dream position. White is unable to push any of his central pawns, and the threat of ...Na4 is extremely annoying for White. The bishop on b2 remains a big pawn. }
12... Rc8
{ White can only take the b5-pawn once Black moves his knight from b8. Currently, taking the pawn loses as  13.Qxb5  Ba6  wins the exchange. }
13. Bb1
{ 13.Rd1  has been played once, but after  13...Ne4  Black takes complete control when White cannot push any of his pawns and make his dark-squared bishop's life a bit healthier. }
13... Ne4
{ The simplest way. It is also possible to sacrifice the b5-pawn with  13...Nc6  , but that would give White unnecessary extra options. Here we stop White from improving his dark-squared bishop. }
14. Bxe4
{ Not the best move, but the one we should definitely know about. It is better to play  14.Bb2  and after  14...Nd7  the situation remains the same: White's dark-squared bishop remains passive and Black has nice control over the center and a fine position to play for. However, we need to know why White cannot take the pawn on  b5  for free. }
14... Bxe4 15. Qxb5 Nd7
{ The nature of compensation is long-term and strategic. Black need not rush with things as White's bishop on c1 will be out of the game for a long time. He can play ...Rab8 with tempo, and Black's knight will soon come to b6 from where it has multiple good squares to jump to. White's c3-pawn remains weak, and the bishop on c1 has trouble finding a good square for itself. Another important aspect is that the only open file will come in Black's possession as the e4-bishop controls the b1-square. Black has more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

{ I like this simple approach. Black prevents White from playing Ne5 followed by f4. Currently White is not ready for Ne5 as after  8.Ne5  c5  9.O-O  Nc6  there is no good way to protect the d4-pawn and White won't be able to maintain his knight on e5. }
8. O-O Bd6
{ Black stops Ne5. One can argue that Black has lost a tempo by playing ...Bb4 and then ...Bd6, which is true. But to achieve this White had to make two major concessions. First of all, he played cxd5 and ended the fight for the center, opening up our light-squared bishop. Secondly, White's dark-squared bishop remains stuck on c1 instead of being developed to f4 or g5. White lacks a clear plan as Black has also managed to stop the Ne5/f4 idea. }
9. h3 c6
{ I like this move more than  9...b6  which happened in the game Postny - Holm, Fagernes 2020. By playing 9... c6 Black plans to put his knight on e4, which is unavoidable. White can prevent this for a move with Qc2, but after ...Qe7, the knight will eventually land on e4. }
10. Qc2 Qe7 11. Nd2
{ Once Black gets ...Ne4 in White should start thinking about how to equalize before it is too late. }
11... Na6
{ Black threatens ...Nb4. If White replies  12.a3  , then Black will bring his knight to e6 via c7. From e6, the knight will control the d4-square and can sometimes move to g5 to attack the kingside. If White now takes on a6, Black does get a doubled pawn but White's best piece will be gone. He will be left with a dead bishop on c1, while Black will have a huge potential kingside attack with the help of his bishop pair. Black is doing absolutely fine in this position, and White should think about how to get get a decent middlegame. }

10. g4
{ Showing his cards too early. White makes clear that he wants to get his queen to h4 via e1 and attack the h7-pawn. Black will now block that route. }
10... Nc6
{ Simple and effective. There is no longer a good way to get the queen to h-file. Black prevents Qe1 by using the pin on the e-file. Now  11.Qe1  is impossible as Black will take twice on d4. }
11. Kh1 g6
{ I like this move. The attack on the kingside is stopped even before it started! Black is ready to play ...Nh5 as soon as White plays g5. The only way for White to prevent ...Nh5 is to play Ng3, but this is not possible as it leaves the d4-pawn hanging. Black will also pull back his bishop to f8 at the right moment to create a foolproof shield on the kingside. White's advanced pawns have become useless, and the weakness on e3 remains. Black stands better. }

11... h6
{ So far, this move has never been played. Why should Black play 11... h6 when Bg5 was not possible anyway? The point is that Black wants to play ...Ne7 quickly to take control over the key d5-square. Once ...Ne7 is played, White could then respond Bg5. Hence we play ...h6 first. }

16. Qd3 Ng6
{ An important positional move. Black prevents White from exchanging dark-squared bishops with Bf4. Now every single piece of White is jobless. Both of his bishops lack good squares and targets, and the e2-knight also has no good squares. Black intends to play ...Kh7, ...Qf6, ...Rad8, and ...Bc6 and create play in the center and on the kingside. He is clearly better. }

11... h6
{ Our play remains consistent in almost every variation. The move Bg5 is prevented and next, we want to play ...Ne7 to gain more control over the d5-square. The moment we play ...Ne7 White's reply of Bg5 would be annoying, so first, we prevent Bg5 permanently and we play ...Ne7 next. }
12. Ne4
{ Trying to disturb Black's plan.   12.Ba2  would transpose to the 11. Ba2 variation.  12.Rd1  does not make sense as Black will anyways play  12...Ne7  and stop the advance d4-d5.   If White goes  12.Ng3  we can even delay ...Ne7 and play the stronger  12...b6  welcoming  13.Nge4  as we can reply  13...Bb7  .

14. Bd3 f5

15. Qf3 Ng6
{ This is an important move to play immediately, stopping Bf4. Black will now play his bishop to c6 via d7. He can either sacrifice the b7-pawn or play ...Qc7 and only then ...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6. Also interesting is to play ...Nh4 and force White's queen from f3 to facilitate the ...Bd7/...Bc6 plan. White's knight on e2 is poorly placed, and Black has a balanced position. }

18... Ne4
{ Now White is forced to take on e4 to defend against the threat of ...Nxc3 followed by ...Ne2+. This means Black will get a strong passed pawn on e4 which compensates for White's bishop pair advantage. Black's knight is ideally placed on d4 and cannot be removed easily. For instance:   19.Be3  is answered by  19...Nc2  .   White is most likely to take  19.Nxe4  dxe4  and then play  20.Rfd1  , and after  20...gxh6  we will reach a drawish endgame. }

There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  .

After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Qc2
{ This position can arise from the 4. Qc2 Nimzo if White mixes up his variations. :- @@EndBracket@@  We will see in every other line in this chapter that the queen does not belong on c2, and it is just vulnerable on that square as Black's a8-rook will soon come to c8 targeting the queen on c2. }

It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Qb3
{ White attacks the b4-bishop, and if the bishop moves White is ready to play d5. This makes Black's next move practically forced. }
10... Bxc3 11. bxc3 Nc6
{ Black instantly takes advantage of the poor placement of White's queen. ...Na5 is coming with tempo, so White has to lose time moving his queen around. }
12. Bd3 Bb7
{ Once again, the idea of ...Na5 is annoying for White. This will force White's queen to go back to d1 to protect the f3-knight. }
13. Qb1
{ Not willing to go back to d1 and reluctant to put her majesty on c2 due to the idea of ...Rc8 followed by ...Nb4, White finds a safe square for his queen on b1. The major drawback of this is the suffocated rook on a1. }
13... Rc8 14. Bd2
{ A sad necessity. The need for this move is highlighted if we consider what happens after White plays  14.Bg5  . White must keep the c3-pawn protected to avoid the double threat in case Black plays ...Na5. }
14... Qd5
{ A nice multipurpose move. Black plans to take control over the light squares by playing ...Na5 and ...Nc4. At the same time, he increases the pressure on the g2-pawn. White can chase the queen by playing c4, but then she goes to a nice square on h5, from where she creates a potential kingside attack plan. Once White plays c4, the pawn on d4 becomes weak, and Black can follow up with ...Rfd8. The position remains balanced as White's strategic weaknesses are compensated by his bishop pair. This position occurred in a 2020 Correspondence game that ended in a draw. }

Kramnik came up with an interesting idea to avoid this long variation by playing 11... h6 instead of 11... Nbd7. We too want to avoid unnecessary theory, but at the same time, we will skip the 10...

10... h6

11. a3 Bxc3

12. bxc3 Bb7 13. Bd3
{ Seeing that without c4 the d5 break is impossible, White quickly regroups his pieces to play c4 and get in a quick d5. }

{ White starts making concessions.   14.Bb2  would have  14...Nh5  followed by ...Nf4. For now, he keeps control over the f4-square. }
14... Rc8 15. Rab1 Qd6
{ Whtie keeps the advantage of the bishop pair, but in return, Black has a better pawn structure and his pieces are better placed. The bishop on d2 is pretty useless. Soon Black will play ...Na5 and gain control over the c4-square. The bishop on b7 keeps a potential threat of ...Bxf3 in the position and stops White from playing c4. The position remains dynamically balanced. The computer gives the typical 0.00 evaluation. }

In other words, there are multiple reasons why engines think Black is winning. }
13... Qd7 14. Qxd7 Nbxd7
{ White has a rook and two pawns for bishop and knight after he takes on f7. Materially White is doing fine, and there is no attack on White's king now that the queens are exchanged. Yet engines prefer Black clearly here. The explanation again comes back to the piece activity. The bishop on b7 has no counterpart. Black would like to play ...Rd8 and ...Nf8, putting pressure on the isolated d-pawn. White's rooks don't have any entry squares, and his pieces lack targets and coordination. That is why Black is clearly better. }

Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }

8... cxd4 9. exd4

First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }

Seeing that:  18.Bxf6  did not lead anywhere, a correspondence game in 2019 instead continued  18.Bxc8  Qxc8  19.Rxc3  Qe6  when Black had a very comfortable position. Typically his b7-bishop had no match, and in the game Black made a comfortable draw. }
18... Nd5
{ Not taking the f6-bishop or saving the  c3  bishop either! Black plays this completely unexpected move which solves all his problems. The main point of the tactic is that White cannot capture  19.bxc3  due to  19...Nf4  when White is forced to take  20.Bxf7+  , and after  20...Qxf7  the bishop on f6 is lost while the threats to g2 and e2 remain. }

21. Qc2 Qxc2 22. Rxc2 Bb4 { Finally, it is time to save the bishop. } 23. Rxc8+
Bxc8
{ This is a classic example of a blockade. The knight on d5 dominates White's rook by controlling all the entry squares on the seventh rank. The pawn on d4 cannot move an inch while the bishop on e5 sits idle. Black will quickly play ...Kf7, ...h5 and ...g6, dominating the light squares. The computer calls says Black is better although the game will most likely end in a draw. }

Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4

After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }

11... h6
{ This fits in with our special repertoire of the Karpov system. If White goes with the move:   12.Bh4  , then we transpose to the mainline covered from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 10.Bg5 h6 #3 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 10.Bg5 h6 #7 which starts with the move:   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10@@EndFEN@@  10.Bg5  h6  11.Bh4  Bb7  12.Ne5  .  So the only independent move we need to check is 12. Bxf6. }
12. Bxf6 Qxf6
{ Black plans to play ...Qg5 next, even if White goes Qg4 as Black is typically happy to exchange more pieces and get to an endgame. Every piece exchange further increases the weakness of the isolated d4-pawn. }
13. f4 { White prevents ...Qg5 and threatens to play f5. } 13... Nc6
{ I like this move more than  13...Rd8  , which is very solid and was played in a 2020 Correspondence game. That move is good enough to get a solid position, but already Black is looking for more and hence I personally prefer the more dynamic 13... Nc6. }
14. Nd7
{ The only drawback of 13... Nc6 is allowing this fork which Black volunteered. }
14... Qxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Nxd4 16. Nxf8 Kxf8
{ The knight on d4 and both of Black's bishops are super active. Black has threats like ...Nc2 followed by ...Ne3 along with ...Bc5+. The king will come to e7 and White's rooks won't have any entry squares on the 7th rank. I like this variation better than 13...Rd8 since here I feel it is Black who keeps more winning chances. }

{ A nice move, protecting the f7-pawn and attacking the e6-bishop. White is unable to move the bishop as the knight on e5 remains hanging.

As the famous saying goes: 'It is not important which pieces are getting exchanged, but which pieces are left on the board'. Black strategically removes the light-squared bishop and forces White to take on c8, which gives him an additional tempo to bring his rook to c8. Now the domination on the light squares will be complete. }

{ Two correspondence games reached this position and both ended in a draw. In a practical game, I would never take White since he has a dead bishop on b2 and Black has all the activity and all the light squares under his control. Black can play ...b5 to get total control over the c4-square and play ...h5-h4-h3 to create a kingside attack. This gives him more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O

8... cxd4 9. exd4

After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }

10... Bxc3 11. bxc3 Qc7
{ It is because of this particular move that this line never became really popular. Black attacks the c4-bishop while the c3-pawn remains weak. }
12. Nd2
{ With this move White admits that he has no advantage and is looking for a bailout. Now the only square available for the c1-bishop is to go to b2 from where it has no play unless White manages to play c4 and d5, which Black has no intentions of allowing. }
12... Bb7 13. Bb2
{ There are once again plenty of ways for Black to maintain the balance. I will suggest a simple strategic plan that guarantees a fine position for Black. }
13... Qc6 14. f3 Ba6
{ Exchanging the light-squared bishops and taking control over the light squares. The only important question is if White can play c4 quickly by taking on a6. }
15. Bxa6 Nxa6
{ Black achieves a fine strategic position with control over the light squares. The b2-bishop remains passive, and it is of utmost importance that if White plays  16.c4  to activate this bishop, Black has the thematic  16...b5  break, after which once again the d4-pawn becomes weak and Black gets a fine outpost on d5. }

13... Nc6

In the game Dominguez played  12...Ba6  and after  13.Bg5  Bxd3  14.Qxd3  Nbd7  he had a solid position, which is enough for equality. It is understandable that facing 12. Bd3 against a prepared opponent, Dominguez didn't want to enter the theoretical battle and continued logically. From a theoretical point of view, taking on  c3  is fine, while from a practical point of view, there is nothing wrong with playing the way Dominguez played. Readers can choose either move based on their tastes. }

15... Qd5
{ It is not ideal to block an isolated pawn with the queen, but this is just a general principle. In this particular situation Black is one pawn up and he is trying to save his queen. Soon the queen will move from d5, and a different piece can block the d4-pawn. }
16. Rc7 h6 17. Bh4 Ne8
{ The rook must go back and Black will slowly consolidate his position by playing ...Bb7 followed by ...Ndf6/...Nd6 etc. White remains a pawn down, and he must show his compensation, which is not clearly visible currently. I like Black's position. }

10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }

12... Bxc3
{ Once and for all, Black takes care of the d5 break and leaves White with a backward c-pawn that can be targeted in the future. }
13. bxc3 Bd7 14. Qc2 Nc6
{ Black will now put pressure on the c-file by playing ...Rac8 and ...Na5. White does not have a good target, as typically happens in the Karpov system. Although the computer calls it equal, I would definitely prefer to be Black because he has nothing to be worried about and can improve his position by attacking White's weak pawns. }

After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. d5
{ While analyzing and playing the Karpov system, we should make sure that we are ready for this move in every single position. }
12... Bxc3
{ Among many other solutions this is the simplest. Black eliminates one of the main defender of the d5-pawn. }
13. bxc3 Bxd5
{ White now gets back the pawn at the cost of an unpleasant endgame. } 14. Bxf6
Qxf6 15. Bxd5 exd5 16. Qxd5 Na6

There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White.

All I need to know here is that  13...Kxf7  works, but it requires some memory work while 13... Rxf7 also works equally well without having to remember a bunch of lines. More importantly, I don't need to take my king for a stroll from g8 to f5 and then back to g8 again which is one of the computer lines after 13... Kxf7. }
14. Bxe6 Qf8
{ White will have a rook and two pawns against bishop and knight from a material point of view. However, the b7-bishop has no counterpart, and it can put huge pressure on the g2-pawn. The engines think that if White plays any normal-looking waiting move, then after  15...Kh8  Black already takes over due to his potential kingside attack. Thus White must continue energetically to keep Black tied down to the f7-rook. }
15. Qb3 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Re8
{ Black wants to get rid of White's light-squared bishop and then play ...Nh5 and ...Nf4. White has extra pawns but these pawns are too weak, and once again there is no match for the b7 bishop. }
17. Bc4 Rc8
{ Once again, Black wants to take the light-squared bishop off. One correspondence game and two tournament games reached this position, and in all games, White was happy with repeating the position by playing  18.Be6  . In the correspondence game and a game by Alekseev, Black rejected the peace offer and played  18...Rc6  instead of repeating with  18...Re8  . This shows that Black is looking for more while White is happy with a draw. Whether to play  18...Rc6  or  18...Re8  is a personal choice. The computers say that both options are equally good. :- @@EndBracket@@ }

Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Ne5
{ A common idea for White. He is pretending to stop Black from playing ...Nbd7. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black simply ignores White's main idea and bites the bullet. He doesn't mind breaking his own kingside pawn structure, which might occur if White takes on d7 and f6. }
13. Nxd7
{ It feels logical to play this move to shatter Black's kingside, but this is a poor decision. Breaking the structure like this will only help Black. He will get the bishop pair, and via the half-open g-file, he can build pressure on the g2-pawn. }
13... Qxd7 14. Bxf6 gxf6
{ White now has two weaknesses to think about. Along with the isolated pawn on d4, now the g2-pawn could also become a soft target for Black. It is time for White to bail out with a draw by perpetual. }
15. d5
{ 15.Qg4+  Kh7  Black's king is in no danger at all, since he can always reply ...f5 when White gives a check on the b1-h7 diagonal. White, on the other hand, might come under serious attack after Black plays ...Rg8. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. Nf3
{ This is the mainline of the Rubinstein system. White develops his pieces most logically. There is an enormous amount of games and analyses available in this variation. Interestingly, in all the World Championship matches that I was working for Anand as a second  @@StartBracket@@Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand@@EndBracket@@, we prepared this line for both colors.While preparing this line as White, our major block was the Karpov System. It's one of the most solid systems, and we could never break this line as White. Curious readers might ask in the match against Gelfand in game 11 why Anand played the weird-looking 8... Bd7 instead of playing 8... cxd4 9. exd4 b6, which is known as the Karpov system.   The reasoning is simple. It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1.

13. Qb3

13... Nxe5
{ This thematic tactic works here too. Black is planning to play ...Qd4 next. }
14. dxe5 Qd4
{ Attacking both the h4-bishop and the pawn on e5. This is a typical combination in this line and one of the primary reasons why Black should include ...h6 and Bh4. in the Karpov system. }
15. exf6 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Qe4
{ A subtle intermezzo. Before taking on h4 Black threatens mate in one to provoke a weakening of White's kingside. }
17. f3 Qxh4 18. fxg7 Rfd8
{ Black will regain the pawn on  g7  at his own convenience. White's pawn structure remains weak. Black is currently threatening to play  ...Rd2  . After:  19.Rfd1  both  19...Qf4  and  19...Qg5  looks very strong. White's queen and bishop are out of play and his pieces lack coordination, unlike Black's army. }

{ This is the mainline of the Rubinstein system. White develops his pieces most logically. There is an enormous amount of games and analyses available in this variation. Interestingly, in all the World Championship matches that I was working for Anand as a second  @@StartBracket@@Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand@@EndBracket@@, we prepared this line for both colors.While preparing this line as White, our major block was the Karpov System. It's one of the most solid systems, and we could never break this line as White. Curious readers might ask in the match against Gelfand in game 11 why Anand played the weird-looking 8... Bd7 instead of playing 8... cxd4 9. exd4 b6, which is known as the Karpov system.   The reasoning is simple. It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Rc1
{ White makes a normal developing move and keeps the d5/Ne5 plans on the agenda. Black must now decide where to put his b8-knight. }
12... Nc6
{ Unless White plays Qe2 we would like to develop the knight to  c6  so that we tie the queen on  d1  to the protection of the d4-pawn. This is because after an early Qe2 if Black continues ...Nc6 White is ready to play Rad1 followed by d5. It is important that White is unable to play  13.d5  here as Black can reply  13...Na5  with a tempo and then take the d5-pawn. }
13. Bd3
{ Another typical plan for White. This way White's bishop is placed on a better diagonal and White is ready to play Bb1 followed by Qc2 or Qd3.   13.Re1  Rc8  14.Bd3  Be7  15.Bb1  transposes back to 13. Bd3. }
13... Be7
{ Black now wants to play ...Nh5 and exchange the dark-squared bishops. This is Black's main plan - we want to exchange as many pieces as possible to highlight White's pawn weakness on d4. }
14. Bb1 Rc8
{ White is not yet able to put his queen on c2 or d3 because Black can reply ...Nb4 with tempo. Therefore Black calmly develops his rook and waits for White to show his plan. We can play ...Nh5 at any point later. First, we wait to see what White has in mind. }
15. a3 Nh5
{ Now that White had to waste one move to prevent ...Nb4, Black plays ...Nh5. }
16. Qd3 g6
{ Taking care of the mate threat. Already Black is better as White's so-called attack has come to a dead end. Black's strategic advantage only increases by exchanging dark-squared bishops.   Now White either has to play  17.Bg3  and give the bishop for the h5-knight and allow Black to play  17...Bf6  or he can take  17.Bxe7  and after  17...Nxe7  Black gets complete control over the d5-square. Meanwhile, his b7-bishop becomes super strong while his counterpart is sleeping on b1. Black has a small but clear advantage. }

16. Qc2
{ 16.Bg3  Nxg3  17.hxg3  Bf6  gives Black a fine position with the bishop pair. White can play  18.d5  and after  18...Bxc3  the position fizzles out to a draw, which is already a good result for White. That is how White should have continued, but no doubt 16. Qc2 looks tempting as White is threatening to give mate on  h7  and plans to take on  e6  once Black plays  ...g6  .  Meanwhile:  16.Bxe7  Nxe7  only benefits Black because the b7-bishop is opened up while Black's knights are perfectly placed on e7 and h5, ready to jump to the f4, d5 and f5-squares. }
16... g6 17. Rxe6
{ This brings back a sweet memory for me. While working on this line with Peter Leko, we came up with the concept of ...Nc6 and ...Be7, and this position arose during our analysis. The engines spotted a beautiful trap. White cannot take on e6, even though it looks so tempting. A few months later Peter was playing in Wijk aan Zee and got this exact position on the board against Ivan Sokolov. Sokolov took on e6, which is a blunder, but already White was clearly worse. If this move does not work White does not have any attack, and the bishop on b1 is buried. }
17... Nf4
{ A brilliant tactic. Black completely ignores White's last move and brings the knight into play. The knight on f4 attacks the e6-rook and protects the g6-pawn, while at the same time keeping an eye on the g2-pawn. Meanwhile, the h4-bishop is hanging too. }
18. Rxe7
{ 18.Bxe7  Nxe7  there is no way to prevent ...Bxf3 as  19.Re3  is met by  19...Nf5  . The computer gives around -3 for Black. }
18... Nxe7 19. Qd2 g5
{ The point! It is possible that Ivan missed the following subtle trick during the game.

{ This is the mainline of the Rubinstein system. White develops his pieces most logically. There is an enormous amount of games and analyses available in this variation. Interestingly, in all the World Championship matches that I was working for Anand as a second  @@StartBracket@@Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand@@EndBracket@@, we prepared this line for both colors.While preparing this line as White, our major block was the Karpov System. It's one of the most solid systems, and we could never break this line as White. Curious readers might ask in the match against Gelfand in game 11 why Anand played the weird-looking 8... Bd7 instead of playing 8... cxd4 9. exd4 b6, which is known as the Karpov system.   The reasoning is simple. It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Rc1
{ White makes a normal developing move and keeps the d5/Ne5 plans on the agenda. Black must now decide where to put his b8-knight. }
12... Nc6
{ Unless White plays Qe2 we would like to develop the knight to  c6  so that we tie the queen on  d1  to the protection of the d4-pawn. This is because after an early Qe2 if Black continues ...Nc6 White is ready to play Rad1 followed by d5. It is important that White is unable to play  13.d5  here as Black can reply  13...Na5  with a tempo and then take the d5-pawn. }
13. a3 Be7
{ Black is happy to play ...Be7 followed by ...Nh5 anyway, so White's a3 does not bother him at all. }

6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Re1 Nc6
{ Just like in the 12. Rc1 variation, here we again opt for 12... Nc6, tying the white queen to the protection of the d4-pawn. }
13. a3
{ Both:  13.Rc1  and  13.Bd3  Be7  14.Rc1  will transpose back to the 12. Rc1 lines from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 10.Bg5 h6 #8 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 10.Bg5 h6 #13. }
13... Be7
{ I like this move more than Roiz's recommendation of:  13...Bxc3  , which is also playable. I would prefer to not have to ask myself when I should take on c3 and when the bishop should come back to e7. In this chapter we play ...Be7 almost exclusively in every other line, so I don't see a particular need to make an exception here. }
14. Qd3
{ We now have the same position as in my game against Wang Hao, as mentioned in the notes in the 12. Rc1 variation. It is important to understand that ...Nh5 works only with the rook on c1 and not with the rook on e1. Now the safest is to first include ...Rc8 and only then go ...Nh5. That way, there is no chance we will mix things up. }
14... Rc8
{ The crucial difference after:  14...Nh5  15.Bg3  Nxg3  15.hxg3  Bf6  16.d5!  is already mentioned in the notes to the 12. Rc1 variation. By playing 14... Rc8 Black prepares ...Nh5 and avoids lines where White plays an immediate d5. }
15. Rad1
{ White gets ready to play d5 and now the game becomes very concrete. We will witness White fighting with all his might to encash his minute lead in development in order to compensate for his strategic weakness. }
15... Nh5
{ We have seen this theme multiple times. Here White is ideally prepared to strike in the center. He has placed all his pieces on the right squares via a very subtle move order and now he will strike in the center. However, even this does not bother Black, and will escape unscathed from the fight. }
16. d5
{ This move was never played in a tournament game and was tried only in correspondence games. The reasoning for this is simple. It is not easy to work out over the board what kind of compensation White gets by sacrificing a pawn. }
16... Bxh4 17. dxc6 Bxc6 18. Ba6
{ I feel this move is not easy to understand and evaluate over the board. White attacks the rook on c8 and vacates the c4-square for his queen from where she can attack the h4-bishop while the d1-rook attacks the queen on d8. This way White forces Black to take on d3. }
18... Qxd3 19. Rxd3 { The double attack continues on a6 and h4. } 19... Bxf3
{ Eliminating one attacker and forcing White to take on c8. } 20. Bxc8 Bxg2
{ A fine tactical skirmish! Black uses the ...Nf4 fork to win a second pawn on g2. This position was reached in four different correspondence games, and all of them ended in a draw. }
21. Ba6 Bc6

15. exf6 Qxh4 16. fxg7 Rfd8
{ There is no rush to take on g7. Black will eventually regain the pawn. Currently, he is threatening to play ...Qg5, putting pressure on g2. Any endgame would be preferable for Black now that he has the bishop pair with an open game. The bishop on b7 is very powerful, and the other bishop on b4 is currently giving a strategical threat of taking on c3 and breaking White's queenside pawn structure. For obvious reasons the engines prefer Black, who is playing only for two results. }

{ This is the mainline of the Rubinstein system. White develops his pieces most logically. There is an enormous amount of games and analyses available in this variation. Interestingly, in all the World Championship matches that I was working for Anand as a second  @@StartBracket@@Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand@@EndBracket@@, we prepared this line for both colors.While preparing this line as White, our major block was the Karpov System. It's one of the most solid systems, and we could never break this line as White. Curious readers might ask in the match against Gelfand in game 11 why Anand played the weird-looking 8... Bd7 instead of playing 8... cxd4 9. exd4 b6, which is known as the Karpov system.   The reasoning is simple. It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Qe2
{ The main move in the Karpov System. This is the most popular move in the position without ...h6 and Bh4 included. White quickly wants to put his rook on d1 and keeps the option open to play either d5 or Ne5.It should be noted that Black can already no longer get to this position from the traditional move order. The game Mamedyarov - Hou Yifan, World Cup 2015 is the classic example.   After: @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10@@EndFEN@@  10...Bb7  11.Qe2  Hou Yifan played  11...h6  hoping to transpose to our current position after  12.Bh4  , but Mamedyarov came up with the brutal piece sac  12.d5!!  .  This is a game that one should know to understand what Black should avoid in the Karpov System. I encourage the readers to have a look at this game to get a better sense of the dangers that lurk in this harmless-looking variation. This game also shows why the move order of 10... h6 11. Bh4 Bb7 is so important. This way we completely avoid Mamedyarov's piece sacrifice. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black normally plays ...Nc6 to force White's queen to remain on  d1  , protecting the pawn on  d4  . Here White has already played  Qe2  , which means  12...Nc6  doesn't make any sense since as White is ready to continue with  13.Rad1  . Here Black instead develops the knight to d7, giving extra protection to the f6-knight, thus releasing the queen on d8 from her burden. }
13. Ne5
{ A standard move in the Karpov Nimzo system. Here again we will see the benefit of the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. Please pay attention to this particular tactic that will follow up. It is one of the main points of including ...h6 and Bh4. }
13... Nxe5
{ This idea would not have been possible with the bishop on g5 as becomes clear on the next move. }
14. dxe5 Qd4
{ The brilliant point of pushing the bishop to h4. Black gets this spectacular move to unpin the queen by attacking the bishop on h4. }
15. Bg3
{ After this sad retreat Black has multiple ways to get a comfortable position. I will suggest the simplest one. }
15... Bxc3 16. exf6 Bxb2 17. fxg7 Rfd8
{ Black will soon regain the g7-pawn after which he is a pawn up. However, first he would like to trade queens by playing ...Qe4. Black is close to winning since there is no visible compensation for White for the pawn that he will lose on g7. }

{ White's pawn structure is worse than Black's as the pawn on c3 can easily be attacked while the same cannot be said for the pawn on h6. The bishop on b7 is much more effective than its counterpart on c4. Black will soon play ...Qg7 or ...Qg5 to provoke a weakness on the kingside. ...Rac8 and ...Rfd8 will come soon. Black's king is very safe with the queen occupying a lovely square on f6. He can also think about ...Kh8 and ...Rg8 to create an attack on the kingside. I would prefer to play Black here any day. }

10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level.

By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades?

Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Qe2
{ The main move in the Karpov System. This is the most popular move in the position without ...h6 and Bh4 included. White quickly wants to put his rook on d1 and keeps the option open to play either d5 or Ne5.It should be noted that Black can already no longer get to this position from the traditional move order. The game Mamedyarov - Hou Yifan, World Cup 2015 is the classic example.

This is a game that one should know to understand what Black should avoid in the Karpov System. I encourage the readers to have a look at this game to get a better sense of the dangers that lurk in this harmless-looking variation. This game also shows why the move order of 10... h6 11. Bh4 Bb7 is so important. This way we completely avoid Mamedyarov's piece sacrifice. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black normally plays ...Nc6 to force White's queen to remain on  d1  , protecting the pawn on  d4  . Here White has already played  Qe2  , which means  12...Nc6  doesn't make any sense since as White is ready to continue with  13.Rad1  . Here Black instead develops the knight to d7, giving extra protection to the f6-knight, thus releasing the queen on d8 from her burden. }
13. d5
{ Another critical move in the Karpov Nimzo that Black should reckon with on every possible move. As we discussed at the start of this chapter, in this variation Black is doing great strategically, while White's strength is in his dynamic play. So time is an important factor. If White can play d5 quickly while Black does not have an antidote, White might be better. This is not the case if Black plays his moves logically, and in this particular case, he is well prepared to meet the d4-d5 sacrifice. }
13... Bxc3 { Eliminating the knight on c3 so that he can take on d5 next. } 14.
dxe6
{ Nothing else makes sense. White obviously did not play d5 to give away the pawn for free. }
14... Bxf3
{ Not in every opening do you see the move ...Bxc3 directly followed by ...Bxf3, and both bishops staying alive at least for one move. :- @@EndBracket@@ Black gives White a tough choice. He either has to sacrifice the b2-pawn by taking  15.Qxf3  or he has to accept a permanent weakening of his pawn structure by playing  15.gxf3  . Once again, the timing here is critical. }
15. gxf3
{ 15.Qxf3  Bxb2  16.exd7  Qxd7  gives Black a full pawn. Thanks to his bishop pair White has enough compensation to hold the balance, but he cannot hope for any advantage. In fact, he should be happy to get a draw already. }
15... fxe6
{ Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn as White has a completely ruined kingside. Black will create counterplay on this kingside. We will see how the game can proceed here. }
16. Bxe6+ Kh8 17. bxc3 Nc5
{ Materially speaking, White is almost winning as he has the bishop pair and an extra pawn. In reality, things are completely different. White's atrocious pawn structure does not look appealing from any possible angle.   Black will soon unpin the f6- knight and opt for a quick ...Nh5 followed by ...Nf4. The threat of 18... Re8 could be fatal, so White must do something immediately. White's bishops do not have any targets, while Black's knights will soon start jumping. The computers evaluate it as 0.00, but in a practical game I think Black has the better chances. }

Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Qe2
{ The main move in the Karpov System. This is the most popular move in the position without ...h6 and Bh4 included. White quickly wants to put his rook on d1 and keeps the option open to play either d5 or Ne5.It should be noted that Black can already no longer get to this position from the traditional move order. The game Mamedyarov - Hou Yifan, World Cup 2015 is the classic example.

This is a game that one should know to understand what Black should avoid in the Karpov System.

12... Nbd7
{ Black normally plays ...Nc6 to force White's queen to remain on  d1  , protecting the pawn on  d4  . Here White has already played  Qe2  , which means  12...Nc6  doesn't make any sense since as White is ready to continue with  13.Rad1  . Here Black instead develops the knight to d7, giving extra protection to the f6-knight, thus releasing the queen on d8 from her burden. }
13. d5
{ Another critical move in the Karpov Nimzo that Black should reckon with on every possible move. As we discussed at the start of this chapter, in this variation Black is doing great strategically, while White's strength is in his dynamic play. So time is an important factor. If White can play d5 quickly while Black does not have an antidote, White might be better. This is not the case if Black plays his moves logically, and in this particular case, he is well prepared to meet the d4-d5 sacrifice. }
13... Bxc3 { Eliminating the knight on c3 so that he can take on d5 next. } 14.
dxe6
{ Nothing else makes sense. White obviously did not play d5 to give away the pawn for free. }
14... Bxf3

He either has to sacrifice the b2-pawn by taking  15.Qxf3  or he has to accept a permanent weakening of his pawn structure by playing  15.gxf3  . Once again, the timing here is critical. }
15. gxf3
{ 15.Qxf3  Bxb2  16.exd7  Qxd7  gives Black a full pawn. Thanks to his bishop pair White has enough compensation to hold the balance, but he cannot hope for any advantage. In fact, he should be happy to get a draw already. }

After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament.

After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference.

15. Rxc3
{ The threat of Ne5 is renewed, and once White gets that move in he is doing fine. But it is still one move away! }
15... Bd5
{ At just the right moment Black forces the exchange of some more pieces. In general the more pieces Black can change, the more White's weakness on  d4  becomes prominent. Currently  16.Ne5  makes no sense as Black takes  16...Bxc4  when White cannot maintain the knight on  e5  . }
16. Bd3 Rxc3 17. bxc3 Qa8
{ The final touch. Black's queen has found a fantastic square on a8 from where she does a lot of things. She puts pressure on the long a8-h1 diagonal, She creates the positional threat of playing ...Be4 and exchanging light-squared bishops to make the c4-square a weakness, she allows Black to play ...Rc8 next, and last but not least she unpinned the knight on f6. White has the bishop pair but he also has a less than optimal pawn structure, and the bishop on h4 is not so useful. Thus the position remains balanced. }

White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }

By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades?

Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020.

14... Bxc3

15. bxc3 Qc7
{ Black could take:  15...Bxf3  and shatter White's pawn structure, but this is much stronger. Black is planning to move his queen to f4 before taking on f3. Right now the c4-bishop is hanging. }

{ Finally Black ruins White's kingside structure as well. } 18. Qxf3 Qxf3 19.

{ Black is not afraid of:  21.c5  anymore as he can reply  21...Nc6  with the idea of meeting  22.Bd6  with  22...Ne8  . Irrespective of White's c5, Black would anyways play  21...Nc6  with the idea to play ...Na5, putting pressure on the c4-pawn. The computer calls this position equal. I think the position is dynamically balanced, and White is not playing without risk. His pawn structure is weak, and in case of an inaccuracy Black is likely to take over. }

It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. Nf3
{ This is the mainline of the Rubinstein system. White develops his pieces most logically. There is an enormous amount of games and analyses available in this variation. Interestingly, in all the World Championship matches that I was working for Anand as a second  @@StartBracket@@Kramnik, Topalov, and Gelfand@@EndBracket@@, we prepared this line for both colors.While preparing this line as White, our major block was the Karpov System. It's one of the most solid systems, and we could never break this line as White. Curious readers might ask in the match against Gelfand in game 11 why Anand played the weird-looking 8... Bd7 instead of playing 8... cxd4 9. exd4 b6, which is known as the Karpov system.   The reasoning is simple. It was the last white game for Gelfand in the classical time control of the match, so for psychological reasons he probably did not want to take a huge risk, and since Anand had already played the Karpov system in game 9, we wanted to give Boris a big surprise in the penultimate game, expecting him to quickly bail out which is indeed what eventually happened. }
6... dxc4
{ First of all, we intend to reach the Karpov system with a different move order, avoiding a few extra options for White. Compared to the main move 6... c5, which is the traditional way of reaching the Karpov system, the move 6... dxc4 is played much less often. There are about 12000 games with 6... c5 and less than 1000 games with 6... dxc4. I personally like this modern move order, which bypasses a couple of variations for White. Anand himself played this way in the Online Olympiad in 2020.   Let us understand which line we are avoiding with this special move order. If we play the traditional  6...c5  , then instead of  7.O-O  White has the extra option of  7.cxd5  exd5  8.dxc5  . Black is fine there but there is no need to allow this line, and we can avoid it completely by taking on c4 first. }
7. Bxc4 c5
{ We have bypassed the cxd5 lines and don't have to give White any extra possibilities. }
8. O-O
{ Castling is the most logical move.   8.a3  Bxc3  9.bxc3  is covered in the 6. a3 chapter., from variation 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #1 to 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 d5 6 a3 9.Nf3 #4. }
8... cxd4 9. exd4
{ This is almost exclusively played.   9.Nxd4  Bd7  is already slightly better for Black due to the bad bishop on c1 and the other bishop aimlessly stationed on the c4-square. }
9... b6
{ Finally, after some camouflage, we have reached the Karpov system. This is considered to be the most solid line for Black against the Rubinstein variation, although we are going to see a lot of fireworks and dynamism soon. :-@@EndBracket@@ The variation is named after Karpov since he popularized it heavily starting in the 1970s. After losing to Portisch on 30th November 1972 in San Antonio, one week later, he picked up this system on 8th December 1972 against Keres in the same tournament. The reasoning becomes obvious when we see the first few moves of the Portisch-Karpov game which went   @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nbd7  9.Qe2  cxd4  10.exd4  b6  11.d5!  My interpretation is that in order to avoid this d5 idea, Karpov came up with a different move order that first clarifies the center with ...cxd4 and then takes control over the d5-square immediately with ...b6 and ...Bb7.Historically, I find it very interesting that it was not Karpov who started playing this line first, but at the top level, it was Portisch himself who was exclusively playing the move 9... b6 Black. After losing to Portisch in 1972, Karpov then picked up this variation and stayed loyal to it throughout his entire career. His last game with this variation was in 2012 when he won a lovely game against Edouard.That is enough of the historical background of the line. Let us get to the essence of this line now. First and foremost we need to understand the nature of the position. Strategically speaking Black is doing great. He has no weaknesses and White has an isolated d-pawn, which can become a potential weakness.   As typically happens in games where one side has an isolated pawn, the player with an isolated pawn has greater piece activity. White currently has more active pieces than Black, and dynamically he is doing great. The main fight here is time vs. strategy, and in this case, time is something that Black would like to buy. If he can complete development peacefully without allowing some immediate threats, then he would be doing fine. Thus, our next few moves are of the utmost importance. }
10. Bg5
{ The main move for an obvious reason. White pins the f6-knight and threatens to play d5.   10.Qd3  Bb7  11.Bg5  h6  12.Bh4  transposes back to 10. Bg5 lines. }
10... h6
{ It is not easy to find something new in such a classical system, but I am happy to find an interesting direction that is still fresh at the GM level. About 2500 games have continued with  10...Bb7  and just about 20 games with 10... h6. By including ...h6 and Bh4, we can avoid multiple theoretical variations.One might wonder: if the solution is so simple, then how come this move order has been unpopular for several decades? Typically in the Karpov system, the b8-knight used to be developed to  d7  . Only recently have the lines with ...Nc6 become trendy, especially in lines where White plays Re1/Rc1. The inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4 is often not that great with the knight on  d7  , but, with the knight on  c6  , it does make a lot of difference. Going forward, we will understand the importance of including ...h6 and Bh4 in detail. }
11. Bh4 Bb7
{ Normally this position would be reached without the inclusion of ...h6 and Bh4. White has multiple plans. Most of his plans are connected either with achieving the d5 break or playing Ne5 to gain more central control. White can also position his rooks in various ways. The most common is to put them on e1 and c1 or to play Qe2 after which the rooks are put on e1 and d1. Sometimes White even tries Rd1 and Rc1. In each possible configuration, we should know if we are ready to face the d5 and Ne5 ideas.So let's get started checking the variations. There are a few typical combinations that help Black to stop these ideas, and we will get acquainted with them now.By the way, this position was reached in a game played by Karjakin in an online blitz tournament in September 2020. Karjakin was Black, and he started with the Caro-Kann and eventually ended up in this position. :-@@EndBracket@@  White played the Panov Attack against the Caro-Kann and chose a sideline, which ended up transposing to the Karpov Nimzo! }
12. Qe2
{ The main move in the Karpov System. This is the most popular move in the position without ...h6 and Bh4 included. White quickly wants to put his rook on d1 and keeps the option open to play either d5 or Ne5.It should be noted that Black can already no longer get to this position from the traditional move order. The game Mamedyarov - Hou Yifan, World Cup 2015 is the classic example.   After: @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10@@EndFEN@@  10...Bb7  11.Qe2  Hou Yifan played  11...h6  hoping to transpose to our current position after  12.Bh4  , but Mamedyarov came up with the brutal piece sac  12.d5!!  .  This is a game that one should know to understand what Black should avoid in the Karpov System. I encourage the readers to have a look at this game to get a better sense of the dangers that lurk in this harmless-looking variation. This game also shows why the move order of 10... h6 11. Bh4 Bb7 is so important. This way we completely avoid Mamedyarov's piece sacrifice. }
12... Nbd7
{ Black normally plays ...Nc6 to force White's queen to remain on  d1  , protecting the pawn on  d4  . Here White has already played  Qe2  , which means  12...Nc6  doesn't make any sense since as White is ready to continue with  13.Rad1  . Here Black instead develops the knight to d7, giving extra protection to the f6-knight, thus releasing the queen on d8 from her burden. }
13. Rac1
{ A natural developing move which transposes to one of the main lines in the Karpov system which usually starts with the traditional 10... b6 move. With our subtle move order 10... h6 we will bypass a lot of theory-heavy lines, but not all. Also, there are lines that we don't really want to avoid. :-@@EndBracket@@   13.Rfd1  Bxc3  14.bxc3  Rc8  15.Rac1  transposes back to the 13. Rac1 variation. }
13... Rc8 { Keeping an eye on c4 and threatening to take on f3. } 14. Bd3 Be7
{ One of the most common plans in the Karpov system. Apart from taking on c3 with the bishop, this idea is also trendy. Especially in recent times, this particular plan has become widely popular in many other variations of this system because of its simplicity.   White's main trump is his piece activity so Black aims to exchange pieces. By playing ...Be7, he intends to play ...Nh5 next, forcing White to exchange his dark-squared bishop and getting the lovely f4-square for his knight. In a way, Black is breaking the so-called principle of exchanging a good bishop for a bad bishop, but it is also a common idea in isolated pawn positions that the more pieces get exchanged, the weaker the isolated pawn becomes. }
15. Ba6
{ Funnily enough, while Black is trying to exchange dark-squared bishops, White wants to exchange the light-squared ones. White's last move has a concrete reason. Normally any piece trade should benefit Black, but here White is trying to claim that after the exchange, the White queen can land on a6 and put pressure on Black's queenside pawns. }
15... Bxa6 16. Qxa6 Qc7
{ A nice little trick. Black takes advantage of White's back rank. His main point is that:  17.Nd5  can be answered with  17...Qxc1  . }
17. Bg3
{ This move looks dangerous from a distance as White attacks the queen on c7, which has no other square from where she can protect the a7-pawn. However, Black has a nice intermezzo that solves this issue. }
17... Nb8
{ By chasing away White's queen, Black makes sure the nice b7-square will become available for his own queen. }
18. Qd3 Qb7
{ Black has managed to solve all the threats that White posed and came out of the opening unscratched. White still has his isolated pawn and has not achieved any breakthrough. The computer calls the position even but slightly tilted towards Black's favor. }

{ This is the most commonly played move in this position.   7.e3  This move is harmless and less ambitious than other moves. It has been played a few times as well. The computers immediately give Black an advantage by playing any normal developing moves, which is understandable as White has no justification for locking in his own bishop on c1. Black can keep developing by normal means with ...Re8, ...c6, ...Nbd7, etc., while White will continue to struggle - how is he going to develop and find a good square for his bishop on c1? }
7... c6 8. O-O Re8 9. Bf4
{ Aimed against ...Bd6, White is hoping to exchange the dark-squared bishops.   9.a3  Bd6  White does not get his knight to e5, and if he goes  10.b4  Black can play  10...Nbd7  followed by ...Nb6 to gain control over the c4-square.   9.Ne5  is too early as after  9... Nbd7 the knight will have to move again anyway. }
9... Nbd7 10. Qc2
{ 10.a3  Bxc3  11.bxc3  Ne4  Black gets nice outposts for his knights while White is left with some weak pawns. ...Nb6 followed by ...Nc4 will come quickly then. }
10... a5
{ A simple prophylactics move which takes care of White's long-term plan of creating a minority attack on the queenside. Black directly prevents a3 followed by b4.   11.a3  he can play  11...Bf8  and White can't follow up with his usual queenside expansion. The bishop on g2 looks useless unless White can break Black's pawn chain. Playing e4 would leave White with an isolated pawn, however. White can nevertheless prepare a3 and b4, but there will be an exchange on b4 and Black gets a quick ...Nb6 followed by ...Nc4. Without its support on a3, the b4-pawn remains a target for the bishop on f8. }

After almost any White move Black should play ...Rad8 followed by ...Rd7 and ...Rfd8. White should think about how he is going to protect the c5- and c3-pawns. Black has no problems. }

{ I wanted to go a bit deeper here to show a typical defensive idea for Black. You will not necessarily get this position, but it is good to know this particular idea which might come in handy in similar positions. }
16... Qe8
{ A very cunning move. It was not completely necessary to go this deep for a rare line that you will likely never see over the board. Both sides' moves leading up to this position are not the engine's top choices. However, I really wanted to show this particular idea, which I feel is an important theme in such setups.With this silent move, Black threatens to play ...g6 next when White cannot take on h6 as ...Nf5 would trap his queen. But what about 17. Bxh6? Doesn't that look super scary? }
17. Bxh6 f5

6. Bxh6 gxh6
{ It is not about the pawn anymore. Black is now clearly better just because of his initiative and bishop pair. This is like playing the best version of a hybrid of French and Caro-Kann, where every single thing is in Black's favor. White has lost the dark-squared bishop and opened up the g-file for both sides, which means he cannot castle there.   White's main problem is how to defend the d4- and b2-pawns once Black plays ...Nc6 and ...Qb6. The c8-bishop could come to g4, eliminating White's knight once White plays Nf3. Soon the d4-pawn might be lost. If White takes on c5, then the c5-pawn and the e5-pawn might both fall. Once the position opens up further, the f8-bishop will come into play and won't have anyone to challenge him. }

3... c5
{ This move order fits in perfectly with our Trompowsky repertoire and thus is very easy to remember. When White takes Bxf6, we take gxf6, and we could get this position either from the Trompowsky or the Veresov. Either way, we are happy to get this position. }
4. e3

4... Nc6 { Our moves are typically the same in almost all the lines. } 5. dxc5
{ Going as per the plan of his previous move 4.e3. Now that Black cannot play ...d4 anymore, White takes the pawn. This doesn't bother us in the slightest. We will get control over the center and eventually recover the pawn.   5.Bxf6  gxf6  is covered via a different move order, from Veresov 4.Bxf6 5.e3 #1 to Veresov 4.Bxf6 5.e3 #17. }
5... e6
{ When to play ...e6 and when to play ...e5? This is fairly simple. Ideally, we want to play ...e5. However, if and when the d5-pawn is under attack or can be attacked, we opt for ...e6. }
6. Nf3 Bxc5
{ Black has the center, this time without even breaking his pawn structure. I don't see a single problem with Black's position. }
7. Bd3 h6 8. Bh4 a6

9. Qe2
{ White also plays it smart. He says: first, you castle and then I will castle on the same side. Meanwhile, White keeps the options open on both sides. }
9... Bd7

10. O-O-O { Let's see what happens if White brings his king to the queenside. }
10... Be7
{ This time we delay our castling to discourage White from going g4-g5. We want to play ...Rc8 next. White's kingside attack with g4-g5 doesn't make sense here as we have not castled yet. So, the only thing that we should check is if White can break in the center with e4. }
11. e4 d4
{ We will play ...e5 next to seal the center. White's knight doesn't have a good square to jump to from c3. The machine calls it close to -2 :- @@EndBracket@@ . I wouldn't be too sure about the exact evaluation, but my understanding tells me that Black is better. }

We have maximum control there, and thus the king remains very safe there. The next two moves are automatic for us: get both the rooks on half-open files.   Let's count the stocks: our center is way better than White's. We control more squares. Our rooks are definitely much better place on the half-open files than their counterparts. The bishops have no match as the knight on c3 is not doing anything, and the light-squared bishop doesn't have a target.

{ Like in the Trompowsky, in this line, White also sometimes takes on f6 to break Black's pawn structure. However, our response remains the same in all these lines. We are always taking with the g-pawn, gaining more control over the half-open g-file while also bringing our pawn towards the center. Basically, we play similarly as we did in the Trompowsky chapter. This way, it is also easier to remember the lines and takes less energy to prepare.   Note that after:  4.dxc5  d4  5.Bxf6  gxf6  , we transpose to 4.Bxf6 lines. }
4... gxf6
{ This is our rule of thumb in all such lines. We recapture with the g-pawn. This opens up the g-file and gets our pawn closer to the center. }
5. e3 Nc6 6. g3
{ White has tried this move in a few games, aiming for the d5-pawn. To me, it makes little sense. The d5-pawn can be easily defended by playing ...e6, which will also shut out White's bishop on g2. White would then need the c4-break, which the knight on c3 is blocking. In the meantime, g3 gives Black a nice target. }
6... cxd4

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4
{ An ancient line that was revived by Jobava recently. It was played in the 1930s by Alekhine. Somehow nowadays most players call it the Jobava system. At some point, Jobava was employing this variation heavily, and it became very trendy. It is a line that one should be well prepared for as it can get extremely tricky super fast. }
3... c5
{ I really like it when I don't have to change the move order for every other system. This way, it is so much easier to remember our setups and saves us a lot of energy. Just like the Trompowsky or Veresov, we are playing in the same manner: Nf6-d5-c5. Charging at the center at the first opportunity. }
4. e4
{ In the Veresov we also saw a similar move. This time it is a bishop on f4 instead of g5. We use the same logic that we used in the other line. }
4... Nxe4
{ Let me repeat quote on quote what I said in the same position with the bishop on g5, as the same logic applies here as well. 'If we take ...dxe4 instead of ...Nxe4, our knight will be busy protecting the e4-pawn while his knight will be attacking it. Hence we want to remove the knights for now'. }
5. Bb5+
{ This has been played only once, but it doesn't change Black's play much. }
5... Nc6 6. Nxe4 dxe4 7. Ne2 e6
{ The engines are getting excited with  7...g5  , which is very much possible and indeed interesting. However, when a simple move gives me easy play in a line that has occurred only once so far, I don't see any point in using the brain space to remember another bunch of lines. }
8. O-O Bd7
{ Getting out of the pin and threatening to take on d4. Let's keep in mind that we are one pawn up. }
9. d5
{ The best bet for White, trying to become as active as possible before Black castles. }
9... Nb4 { A very nice move, which immediately forces some exchanges. } 10. Bc4
{ White tries to make it as complex as possible.  10.Bxd7+  Qxd7  would not only exchange pieces but also would have helped Black to develop the Queen which will stop dxe6 ideas due to ...Qxe6. }
10... exd5 11. Bxd5 Nxd5 12. Qxd5 Bc6 13. Qe5+
{ Otherwise Black is better thanks to his extra pawn and bishop pair. White's only advantage is that Black's king is in the center. Thus he must act immediately. }
13... Qe7 14. Qc3
{ This way White still tries to keep some compensation for the pawn as Black is not able to castle quickly. However, it is just a matter of time when Black will solve this issue. After all, he is a pawn up and has the bishop pair advantage. }
14... Qe6 { Black keeps the option of castling on both sides open for now. }
15. Rad1 f6
{ Now Be7-O-O will happen and White must find a path to equality. We managed to keep the extra pawn and at best White can recover that but still we will keep the two bishops. }

On the other hand, our bishop on c8 is not so bad. It can come to b7 or d7 depending on where White castles. From b7, it will give support to playing ...Ne4 if needed, and from d7, it helps to prepare a queenside attack. }

For now, he protects his c6-knight. Next, he wants to play ...e6 and ...Qb6 to put pressure on the d4-pawn and queenside. Meanwhile, as we have seen in this line consistently, White's c3-knight is misplaced and doing absolutely nothing. White's 7. Ne5 looks strong at first sight, but it has one disadvantage: it weakens the d4-pawn. Black is going to strike there with ...Qb6. }
8. Nxd7
{ White takes the bishop, but this is a bishop we are happy to be parted with. We still keep the other good bishop. }
8... Qxd7 9. g3 e6 10. Bg2 Bd6
{ The reason for exchanging our so-called good bishop against White's bad bishop is simple. We cannot move the f4-bishop easily, which controls the b8-square. We don't have a single weakness in our position. White's bishop on g2 is looking at Gibraltar's rock on d5 while his knight is wondering why it was brought to c3.   The computer calls the position equal but tilted towards Black's favor, which is not at all surprising. Next we can play ...O-O, ...Rc8 and start pushing pawns on the queenside. Once White tries to regroup the knight from c3 and plays c2-c3 to consolidate, we can launch a minority attack with b5-b4. Thanks to the exchange of dark-squared bishops we will get our rooks on b8 and c8, which will give maximum trouble to White on the queenside. }

{ A fantastic move. While White was hoping to reduce the strength of ...Bc6 through exchanging queens, Black removes his queen tactically. His queen gets to a very active square, protecting the bishop on c5 and also keeping ...Ba4 ideas in mind.   Most importantly, White cannot take on  d7  since it will trap his queen after  18.Qxd7  Rd8  , making this move really pretty. With  18...Ba4  coming next all Black's pieces are super active.

{ This line came into fashion in the 1922 London tournament and since then has been known as The London System. For a long time, it had a stamp of being boring and a way to avoid theory.

The threat of ...Ne4 will also become very annoying once ...Rfc8 has been played. White would love to play Nbd2, but the b1-knight will be needed to protect the c3 pawn. Basically, White's position is completely stuck and Black has excellent compensation for the pawn. Most importantly, his moves and plans are simple. }

9. O-O
{ This is the most popular move in this position for White. It was played by both Magnus and Wesley. I don't think this is particularly dangerous for Black, and most likely, both Magnus and Wesley were surprised by the less common move 8...g6 and played the most natural move in reply. Now that 8...g6 is gaining popularity and players will be better prepared, I think soon the mainline in practice will be  9.e4  which I have made our mainline in this chapter. }

If White exchanges rooks with  22.Rxa8  Rxa8  and plays  23.Ra1  ,  then we take  23...Rxa1  24.Nxa1  ,  and play  24...Ba4  ,  killing the knight on a1. }

9. e4
{ This is going to be the main line soon, as it is clearly the most challenging move. }
9... dxe4
{ This move requires very concrete analysis. Every single correspondence game that reached this position continued with  9...a6  .  That is also doable, but it gets very messy with lots of lines. The move we are playing is also complicated but very straightforward and forcing, making it easier to understand, and from a human perspective, it is easier to play. }

20... Bc8
{ Trying to chase the rook away and also getting away from the pin on the d-file. }
21. Rc7
{ Once again, forced. Both  21.cxd6  Bxd6  and  21.c6  Be6  would be dead lost for White as Black would remain one piece up with White having no attack in return. By Playing 21.Rc7 White renews the threat of cxd6. }
21... d5
{ Black does not wish to allow white to get a passed pawn on the d-file. } 22.
c4 { White keeps insisting on getting a passed pawn on the d-file. } 22... d4
{ Finally, Black succeeds on not giving White any passed pawns on the d-file. }
23. Rxd4 Be6 24. c6
{ White is still trying to keep the game complicated. At this point  24.Rxa7  was possible as Black is unable to take back due to the mate threat on d8. The game would have ended with repetition by  24...Rc8  25.Rc7  Rb8  26.Rb7  Rc8  29.Rc7  .  In the current position, if White goes  24.g4  with the idea to play g5, Black can always stop it by going  24...g5  himself when White will have to accept the same repetition mentioned above. By playing  24.c6  White attempts a cunning threat of Rcd7-Rd8# }
24... Bg7
{ Eliminating the main culprit who is restricting Black completely. Let's not forget Black is a whole piece up, so White is also running a lot of risks here. One single mistake, and the game will be gone. }
25. Re7+ Kf8 26. Rxa7 Re8
{ If Black wants to keep things complicated, he can also try  26...Rc8  when the game can continue with  27.Be7  Ke8  28.Rdd7  g5  . White keeps compensation as Black still cannot untangle completely. Engines keep calling it 0.00, but I think any three results could be possible as the game remains very sharp. }
27. Be7+
{ Once again, White finds the only move to stay in the game. Any other move, Black would have exchanged the dark-squared bishop and won the game. }
27... Rxe7 28. Rd8+ Re8 29. Rxe8+ Kxe8 30. Ra8+ Ke7 31. Rxg8 Be5
{ The final correct move. Black's kingside pawns are completely protected. Although on paper, White has three extra pawns, which might seem overwhelming, in reality, most of them will fall. White cannot allow Kd6 when most likely all his pawns will fall. On the other hand, once he plays c5, the  a2  pawn hangs. After that, likely, Black will also get the remaining pawns on the queenside. It is wise to play  32.c5  Bxa2  ,  and the game is likely to repeat soon once Black plays Bd5-Rc8-Be6-Ra8-Bd5-Rc8. }

{ Spotting it will be easier than convincing me to actually play it. :-P The only black piece that was developed is brought back home. White has at least two immediate checking moves in his hand. We are still two moves away from castling. So what is it that makes this move so strong and what makes it the only move?White was threatening both Qxc6+ and Qf6 in one go. With the brilliant 14... Qd8 Black defends against both threats. f6 is protected, and   15.Qxc6+  can be answered with  15...Bd7  since the d8-queen protects the a8-rook.   Meanwhile  15.Rfe1+  doesn't scare us as it only helps us to develop the f8-bishop. }

{ Attempting to remove the strong knight from  d5  . In the case of  15.Ba1  Qxc2  -+ the d5-knight will take care of everything. White doesn't have a single point of entry. }
15... f6
{ There is no time to save the knight. Instead, we try to trap White's bishop. }
16. Rfd1
{ 16.cxd5  Qxd5  =+  Black's king will be totally safe on f7 and the bishop on h8 is in trouble. }

Bf5
{ 18...cxd5  19.c6  Bf5  20.Rb7  Rc8  is also good enough, but I personally like  18...Bf5  more. }
19. Rb7 O-O-O
{ Getting the king to the side where White has his pawn majority. This will help Black to stop the pawns. At the same time, the rook is also activated. }
20. Rxa7 Kb8 { Taking care of the threat of ...Ra8+. } 21. Ra6 cxd5 22. Rd4
{ Once again testing Black to find the best move by going for a direct attack. }
22... Kc7 { Just in time.  23.Rb4  is now met by  23...d4  . } 23. a4
{ The following move is the final test for Black. It is a bit counter-intuitive move to make. }
23... h5
{ Just when White is pushing all his pawns on the queenside supported by his two rooks, Black decides to make a positional move on kingside? Not exactly! Basically, Black wants to take the h8-bishop and he needs to play ...Bh6 for that. White's 22. Rd4 was aimed against ...Bh6. With 23... h5 Black stops White's idea of playing Rh4 after ...Bh6. Black is ready to play ...Bh6 and then take the h8-bishop. }
24. Rb4 d4 25. Rbb6 d3 { The pawn reaches d2. } 26. Ra7+ Kc8 27. Ra8+
{ This is a necessity. White trades off our rook to make the d3-pawn less dangerous. }
27... Kc7 28. Rxd8 Kxd8 29. Kf1 Bh6 { We are getting the pawn to d2. } 30. Ke1
d2+ 31. Kd1 Kc7
{ Finally, Black will play ...Bd7 when White will be forced to sacrifice his rook to d2. I am aware that I went very deep in this variation, but that is mainly because I expect this line to get popular soon, which means white players will be extremely well-prepared. Thus, I just wanted to show that Black has nothing to worry about even if White plays the best of engine moves. We are always playing for three results and White is running a significant risk of losing. }

{ It is always good to see when a top player plays the line that has been recommended in the course. This particular game was played just a week before, on the third of February 2021. Wesley played the same line mentioned in the course and something that I also played against Fedoseev in the World Cup. In the game, Vidit came up with a novelty that I did not cover in the course. I considered the move to be harmless and hence did not include it. The game itself does not change my opinion on this, and I think what Welsey did is a logical and straightforward way to refute White's plan. Let us have a look at this game. }

{ Bringing more support to the knight on e5 and planning to take on c5 at the right moment to open up the diagonal for the bishop. }
13... Ne4
{ There are many options at this point, and they all depend on your personal preference; Black can continue the game with moves like  13...Bd6  or  13...g6  to maintain the tension in the game. Nevertheless Wesley's move is the most straightforward route to get a comfortable position. Black continues to target c3, and sooner or later, White will have to take the knight on e4. }

{ Part of White's plan. He wants to open up the diagonal for the bishop on c3. }
14... Bxc6 15. Bxe4 dxe4 16. dxc5
{ This is the position Vidit was targeting. It is quite safe for White, yet there is no hint of advantage in the position. Black gets a comfortable game with a pair of bishops and zero weaknesses. }
16... Qxd1
{ The most human move. There was another interesting possibility for Black that leads to a complex game:  16...Bb5!?  17.cxb6!  The best option, White sacrifices a piece for three pawns.  17...Qxd1  18.Rfxd1  Bxe2  19.Rd7!  19...Bf6  20.bxa7  Bb5=  A strange position has occurred where the engines say that it's all 0.00 due to some perpetual attack on White's rook by Black's bishop. In general, it feels like White has just about enough compensation for holding the balance here due to three pawns for a piece imbalance as well as Black not being able to take back on a7. }
17. Rfxd1 Bxc5 18. Nd4 Ba4
{ There is absolutely no need to take on d4 and aim for a position with opposite color bishops that would most likely end in a draw. Nevertheless, White gets a slight edge as his bishop becomes better than his counterpart. }
19. Re1
{ After  19.Rd2  Rfd8  the pin on c1 becomes annoying.   19.b3  Bd7  allows Black to play Ba3 next. White can play:  20.Bb2  , but after  20...Be7  Black is doing great. Note that this knight on d4 is nicely restricted by the bishop on d7. }
19... Bd7
{ After forcing White to compromise his rook's position, Black comes back with the bishop on d7 and restricts the knight on d4. }
20. h3 { It is quite challenging to suggest a good plan for White here. } 20...
f6
{ The pawn on f6 strategically blocks the bishop on c3. Wesley keeps making simple and effective moves that restrict White's play. }
21. Rcd1 Kf7 22. Nb3 Ba4
{ The bishop holds a firm grip on the knight, keeping it constantly restricted. }
23. Rd2 Bxb3 24. axb3 Rfd8

25. Rxd8
{ 25.Red1  Rxd2  26.Rxd2  Ke6=+  Black's extra space on the kingside will be his main asset here. White's bishop is still aimlessly looking at the f6 pawn. }

{ Surprisingly, White's bishop on c3 is much worse than Black's bishop on c5 here as it has no decent square to go to. }
27. Kf1 f5 28. Ke2 g5
{ This was probably too early. Black could have played in a less committal manner by starting with  28...g6  . }
29. Ra4

Ke6 30. g4 Rc8 31. b4

{ 37...h4  Black can get an outside passed pawn and fix White's king on the kingside. This does not bother White as he does not need his king on the queenside to stop the entry of the Black king.  38.Kh2  Kd5  39.Kg2= }
38. Kh2 Kf6 39. Kg2

The race for the hefty first prize of 50000 USD started with plenty of 2700s participating in an event where the last seeded player was also above 2400. I found myself in the sole lead before going to the penultimate round. The penultimate round was extremely crucial, I was paired against Wang Hao, and with the Black pieces. Wang Hao has a broad repertoire, and it was impossible to guess what he might opt for. Since I was also physically sick during the tournament, my preparation choice became easier.

Still, the game was under control with  25...f5  26.Rd5  Qxb2  when the position remains balanced.

Karpov resigned here. As mentioned in the course, after this game, Karpov changed his move orders in this opening and started playing the line with early b6, this line is now known as the Karpov system. It is still a mystery to me why do they call it the Karpov system. I understand that Karpov stayed loyal to this line and continued to play this system for a long time. However, Portisch was playing this line with early b6 long before Karpov and precisely after Portich defeated Karpov as White, then Karpov picked up Portisch's pet line. Honestly, I have no idea about this particular bit, so if anyone is aware of this, please keep me updated too. }

Let us see one game to know what we are trying to avoid.  11...h6?  The main move here is 11...Bxc3, which has an extensive body of theory connected to it. It is typically solid, but there is no need to go there, as we have already seen in the course. We can cut down a lot of lines by starting with 10...h6. However, we must know why we can't do the same after one move. What is wrong with 11.... h6 instead of 10...h6?  12.d5!!  In the course, it was briefly mentioned that we cannot revert the move-order due to this brilliant move and must start with 10...h6.

Only then will we have utmost clarity in the line we play. Let us see what is the problem in Black's position here.  12...Bxc3   12...hxg5  13.dxe6  White sacrificed a whole piece. Black's major problem is that his king became weak while his queenside pieces are not yet ready to join the battle.  13...Bxf3  Otherwise Nxg5 was coming  14.exf7+!

However, it looked a lot worse during the game without engines. I was under the impression White has a clear advantage, but I could not see a concrete way for White to cash it. The machines seem to disagree with the evaluation and think Black was only slightly worse in the game. In any case, a win was unexpected. The final round against Vallejo was also a tense game that ended in a draw, and I became the clear champion of this tournament.

This was the only way to hold the position  33...Qe4!?   33...Rb5  34.Qc3  Rb3  35.Qd4  h6=  Both kings are equally weak and that keeps the position balanced.  34.Nxd5  Qxd5!  35.Kf1=  In the game, White got a similar position with the Black queen on e4 and White queen on c5. That allowed a nice fork to win the game. Here Black gets a perpetual in numerous ways but not more than that. }
33... Rxc5 34. Qxc5 Qe4
{ A hugely important victory. Magnus resigned here due to the following line:   35.Kf1  Qh1+  36.Ke2  Bf3+  37.Kd2  Ne4+  and with this fork, Black picks up the queen on c5 and remains one full piece up. A very classy game by Anand with a cute finish. }

{ The famous Curacao Candidates were played between 8 players to fight for first place and challenge Botvinnik for the world championship title. Only 105 games were played since Tal had to withdraw due to illness after round 21. He could not play the last seven rounds. Eventually, Petrosian won the event and went on to beat Botvinnik in the match. This was Fischer's second attempt in the candidates, and he was already pretty strong. However, it would take him another 10 years to get the title. Fischer played a lot of great games in Nimzo Indian. This one is directly related to our repertoire. }

This position came in the famous Curacao Candidates between ½-½ Filip, M-Fischer,R Curacao 1962'. Let us now see how Fischer continued the game. }
11. O-O Rac8 12. Rac1 Nce4
{ Fischer's love for the bishops is exemplary. Whenever there is a chance, Fischer would preserve the bishops. In this position,   12...Rfd8  would have sufficed for easy equality after  13.a3  Bxc3  14.Bxc3  d5  , breaking open the center and freeing up the position. Fischer preferred not to exchange the bishop and keep the position flexible. White has the bishop pair, but Black's pieces are more harmoniously placed, while White's bishop on c3 will be harassed by the knight after ...Ne4. }
13. Nxe4 Nxe4 14. Bxb4 Qxb4
{ The position remains harmless for both sides and is likely to fizzle out in a quick draw. It is amazing to see how Fischer created chances from this simple-looking position. }
15. Bd3

15... d5
{ This is an interesting decision. It was possible to play the simple:   15...Nf6  with the idea of d5, which would be equal. Also,  15...f5  was an option. Fischer goes for the most direct and challenging line, showing his love for the bishops and not bothering about the move  16.Bxe4  which the computer screams. }
16. Qb1
{ Filip did not want to venture into an unbalanced position that would occur after 16.Bxe4 and instead plays the safer move.   16.Bxe4!?  dxe4  17.Nd4  This is the computer's suggestion, claiming that Black's bishop on b7 is not ideal. However, Black gets enough practical play due to his majority on the kingside.  17...e5!  18.Nf5  g6!  It is important to respond immediately with the kingside advance before White can consolidate.  19.a3  19...Qc5  20.Ng3  f5⇆  The position remains sharp and complex. Black has potential kingside attacking plans while White clearly has superiority on the queenside. }

Qd2 h6
{ Fischer and his bishops :- @@EndBracket@@  He won't give them up unless there is a concrete reasoning for it. All this time, it was only a threat. When he actually got a chance to change the position's nature, Fischer concludes that having the bishop on board would give him more chances. }
22. Qe2 Ng4
{ Provoking some weaknesses by threatening h2.   22...Bxf3  This is the computer's suggestion.  23.Qxf3  Qe5  24.Qe2  Rc8⇆  With a very comfortable position when the White bishop does not have a target, and Black's pieces are ideally placed. This would likely end in a draw. Understandably, Fischer was not keen on going down that path. }

Rd8 is not an option due to Bh7 when Black loses the rook.  26...Nxd3  27.Rxd3  Qh1+  28.Ke2  Qc1  29.Rd2=  White saves all the pawns. The game would now end in some a perpetual soon.

Black will soon get his knight to d4 by playing e5. If White plays:  41.b4  , then after  41...Bc6  42.Ra6  Nd4  , the b-pawn, is permanently blocked, and Black will soon play e5 and bring his king into the game. }
39. a4 Nb4 40. Rc7 Kg7 41. Rc8
{ I am not sure at what point the game was adjourned, but I am almost sure it was not before Fischer's next move. If he had time to analyze this, he would surely have found the strongest move in the position. }
41... Nd3
{ I think Fischer might have missed White's reply here. After this move, White can create a passer  on the a-file instead of a passer on the b-file, which makes all the difference in the position. It would be far more difficult to control the a-pawn than the b-pawn.   41...Bb3!  42.Rb8  Bxa4  43.Rxb6  Nc2∓  Black will play e5-Nd4 and completely control White's pawn. This gives Black a huge winning chance, thanks to his pawn majority on the kingside. }

White is unable to go Nfe2/Nd3 as Nc4 traps the bishop on a5.  21.Nh3  Ng4  Forces g3 and soon after Qf6-Qc6, it would be impossible to defend the position. }

{ This is an interesting decision. I would have never played this move and preferred something like  21...Kd7  instead, which forces the exchange of bishops and Black gets a fine position.

If there are two options and in one option we reach a position where 10 different moves lead to draw, and in the second option we reach a position where 10 only moves make a draw, for the computer both lines are 0.00, and he won't be able to tell us which is better. Although the current position does not fall into this category, giving up the bishop is also an equally good move and depends on the players' playing style. Obviously, LC0 did not grow up seeing Fischer's game and is not particularly fond of bishops or any other piece for that matter :P }

{ Here in the course, it was mentioned that Black must not allow White to get a quick c4-d5. So it is important to start with 13...Rfd8, which is aimed against c4-d5 plans. We will now see two games at this junction. One continued with Rd8, stopping c4-d5, and the other game allowed White to get his plan. It is important to check both of them to clarify why we are stopping c4-d5 plans. }

{ This game was played in the 2019 Correspondence game, and it is an important part of our repertoire in Trompowsky. The primary reason for choosing this game as a model game is not just because it is a great game, but more importantly, the way Black volunteered for an unconventional structure created a strong impression on me when I first saw this game. Chess has grown and changed as a game drastically over the years. More concrete approaches are being seen in recent times rather than just the traditional way of thinking. This game illustrates nicely when to break traditional thinking principles and look at the position without any bias or prejudice. }

{ White still tries to keep it strategic and makes sure Black can't improve his horrendous pawn structure.

{ An absolutely brilliant decision. Once again showing the concrete nature of thinking while breaking all traditional concepts and positional principles. Clearly, Black's dark-squared bishop was his asset, and he could quickly reroute it to e5, increasing the pressure on the b2-pawn. However, since White was forced to move the rook from d2 to protect the b2-pawn, now suddenly his rooks lack coordination.

Currently  19.Ne3  Nd5  would give Black an easier position to play, which is what happened in the game. In the case of  19.Rxa7  Black has the nice intermediate move  19...Bc5  using the fact that the d4-pawn is pinned on the d1-rook, and only when White's a7-rook returns to the first rank does Black play ...Bd6. White's bishop on c1 still needs to find some direction, and the knight on g2 does not look attractive either. Black has no problems.' }

Black's knight is nicely placed on d5 as compared to White's knight on g2. Black's rooks look more active, ready to give pressure on the f2 pawn. Although the computer evaluates this position as equal, I think in a practical game, Black keeps better chances. }

{ Our mainline of this system ended here with the following notes: 'Seeing that there is no weak link that White can attack, Hikaru slowly starts grabbing the initiative on the queenside. I already prefer Black, although the computer calls it even. I think it is much easier to play Black. White's bishop is hopeless in this position. In the game, Sam played 16. e4, after which his light-squared bishop was dead, and Hikaru went on to grab space on the queenside with ...a4. He then brought his king to the center and slowly converted his advantage into a win. One can safely say that if anyone should be worried, it is White'. }
16. e4
{ This is a surprising decision by Sam. Strategically it feels wrong to put the pawn on a White square and potentially hampering the light-squared bishop. It would have been wiser to play a noncommittal move like Kf2. Black could continue in the same manner as described in the notes of the previous move. }
16... a4
{ This is another committal decision, albeit more interesting. Black fixes his pawn structure on the queenside and locks the pawn on a light square. Moreover, this has a significant point; now the knight on c5 becomes secured. }
17. Kf2 Ke7
{ The king on e7 is nicely placed, taking away the d6-square and also safely surrounded by pawns. }
18. Be2
{ Another small inaccuracy. It was time to reroute White's knight to a better square on b4 via d3 since Black has already played a4; White won't mind getting into a bishop and pawn endgame. }
18... Rac8
{ Black either does not bother stopping this plan of Nd3-Nb4 or maybe he simply missed it. It was clearly better to play Ba6 at this point, stopping Nd3 ideas. }

24... Ra8 25. g4

I worked with Radek for about 10 years when we both helped Anand for his world championship matches. Radek has great work ethics and is extremely well prepared in the opening, apart from being a fantastic player. During this lockdown, players are not sure when the tournament circuit will resume, and for a change, we got to see some phenomenal novelties in online blitz and rapid. This game is not an exception either. Radek played a move that was not played at GM-level games before. It was once tried in Correspondence chess, and this is what I suggested in the course. I was a bit surprised by such a strong idea getting used in a Title Tuesday online blitz tournament, but these times are strange, and no one wants to hold on to novelties when there is no surety when OTB tournaments would resume. }

{ 17.g3!  The simplest way to stop ...Nf4/Nh4 ideas. White would now like to play Bg4 and exchange his bad bishop. Black still keeps a tiny edge, but there is nothing direct happening. There is no way to stop White from playing Bg4. I tried the following plan, which we often see in Najdorf from White's perspective.  17...Nh8  This idea is often used in the English Attack of the Najdorf opening.

Here is the weblink for a ready reference. @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1674386@@LinkEnd@@ Interestingly, while preparing the Najdorf, this was also an idea we considered together, and being a full-time Najdorf player, Radek would also consider a move like Nh8 seriously, trying to reroute the knight to  g5  . Unfortunately, unlike the aforementioned game, here it is not that effective, and rather Black should have continued with some standard move like 17...h6 or 17...Bd7  18.Bg4!  Getting rid of the bad bishop.  18...Nf7  19.Rf1!  This is excellent prophylaxis against  Ng5  . Black wants to build an attack on the kingside by getting his knight closer to the king.

{ This was a crucial game played in the quarterfinal of the 2019 World Cup that Yu Yangi dramatically won in an armageddon game. The match was intense, and we saw many interesting theoretical battles. One of the theoretical discussions the players had was in the Nimzo Indian Defense. This game was the muse and inspiration from which I got the brilliant queen sacrifice idea in this solid line of the Nimzo Indian. In the course, Nikita's line in this game is given as an alternative line, and instead, the romantic queen sacrifice is offered as the mainline. However, there is nothing wrong with the way Nikita played, so I chose this game to be a model game as well in my course. }

Black has taken control over the b-file, and on the d-file, the White rook won't have any entry since Black will play Ke7. If White changes rooks, then Black gets his king to c5 and pawn to e5. White's kingside pawn structure is not ideal for the bishop pawn endgame, and Black's piece activity is more than enough to compensate his queenside doubled pawns. }

When one prepares an opening really deep, he/she should keep track of everything. Banter blitz at this high level is not an exception. My good friend Sam Shankland made a lovely course on Semi-Slav for Chessable. Sam and I have worked a lot together and have visited each other several times. I have very fond memories of him coming to my city Kolkata and me going to San Francisco. I was naturally well aware of Sam's course and knew the lines that he is suggesting. Our course repertoire did not match in most cases, but on some sidelines of  1.d4  , we crossed paths. Although our direction was mostly different as he mainly aimed for a Slav setup, and I was going for Nimzo-Semi Tarrasch. However, in the London system, we have reached a similar conclusion in one particular variation. I was very happy with Sam's suggestion in this variation and recommended the same in my course. I just went a bit deeper and also added/analyzed the games played after Sam's course was published. One such game is what we are going to see now :- }

{ 17.Nd2  Black has many options here but I like the simple and logical...  17...Re8+!  Taking away the castling option from White.  18.Kf1  There was no good way to block as the threat of Nd4 would be devastating.  18...Be6  Bringing the other rook to d8.  19.a3  Trying to chase the bishop away. Black has a simple developing move that completely ignores White's threat.  19...Rad8=+  White is unable to take on b4 due to the Nb4 fork. His king on f1 got stuck, and all Black's pieces are developed with full coordination. }
17... Bf8
{ This is natural but not the strongest. Romain found the best defense in the position, which would not have been possible if Black retreated the bishop on a5 instead of f8. In both cases, black threatens Nb4 but with the bishop on a5, some of White's defensive resources are stopped.   17...Ba5!  18.Qb1  18.a3  Nd4  does not help when the knight can also jump to b3, attacking the rook on c1.   17...Ba5!  18.Qb1  18...Qd4∓  An unusual move to spot. Somehow Black was trying to get his knight to d4, but this time, the queen does the job nicely. If White moves the bishop from d3, that would allow Black to play Qd2+, and the main difference with the game is that here White cannot play Rd1 as Black can take twice on c3. }

20... Nh5
{ Romain might have underestimated the strength of this move. Black eliminates White's best defensive piece. }
21. Ne4
{ This is not the best move, but White's task was rather hard.   21.Nf5  Bxf5  22.Bxf5  Nxg3+!  Simplest. Getting rid of the important defensive piece.  23.fxg3  Rad8  24.Nd5  Rxd5!  Material does not play that big role when the king is so exposed.  25.cxd5  Nd4∓  Not only White's king is exposed, but the knight on d4 is performing miracles. Now the threat of Ne2 with multiple forks is difficult to deal with. Black gets huge compensation here as White's rooks remain disconnected, and his king is exposed. }

A few moves back, Black eliminated one bishop that was defending White's king. This time Black eliminates the last bishop that was giving support to White's king.  26.Nxe2  26.Rxe2 Bxc4 wins back the exchange with a good interest rate.  26...Nxg4  27.Nf4  Bxc4+  White is unable to recapture due to the mate threat on f2.

Black does not save the rook and offers a bishop as well.  26.Nxd2  26...Bxe2+  27.Kxe2  Nxg4+!  28.Kf3  While analyzing this game, I did not immediately understand why engines said this is a mate by force. Then the following beautiful mating combination was revealed.  28...h5!  Black threatens both Qf2 and Qf6. But What about 29.Ne4 that stops both of them?  29.Ne4  29...Qxf2+!!  An absolute delight to look at this line. Black gave a whole rook a few moves back. Now he gives a full queen.  30.Nxf2  Re3+  31.Kf4  Bh6+  32.Kf5  Re5  Rarely such pretty lines can occur from a game. This was an absolutely brilliant play by Black. The key moves that could have been missed from a distance would be 25...Bxc4 28...h5 and 29...Qxf2. }
25. Bxg4
{ This is a positional blunder. White cannot afford to lose the bishop that was protecting his king. Both  25.f3  and  25.Nf3  would suffice to get away with a worse position. After  25.Bg4  White is just lost. }

Bd3 lost its popularity. The theory has not changed much since then in this line and white players do not seem to be attracted to such positions and it is obvious why. White is a pawn up, but he has to be very careful. His bishop on b2 is passive and the c4-bishop is also vulnerable. Black can jump with his knight to e4 to increase the pressure on the c3-pawn.

{ Attacking the bishop on c4, but more importantly, vacating the e5 square for the knight. }
19. Bd3
{ Hard to suggest any other move. Ne5 was coming in any case with the additional threats of Bd3/Bg4 etc. }

[Result "*"]

{ TCEC games are a completely different level, with players having a rating of 3400+ and in some cases like this game 3800+. Professional players keep a tab on these games to fish for new ideas and see the trend. We will now look at a game played between Stockfish NNUE with a 3801 rating against AllieStein, who has a modest 3781 rating : }
1. Nc3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bf4 c5 4. e3 cxd4 5. exd4 a6 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Ne5 Bd7 8.
Ne2
{ This move wasn't mentioned in the course. Even though it was played by one of the strongest engines, it did not feel particularly challenging, as we will see in this game. Black makes natural moves and gets a good position. White regroups the worst placed piece in this position. The knight on c3 was not doing much anyway. }
8... e6 9. c3 Nxe5
{ Before White can bring another support for the e5 knight, Black takes on e5. }
10. Bxe5
{ 10.dxe5  Ne4  11.Nd4   White cannot chase Black's knight for long. After  11.f3  Nc5  , the knight is well placed, and playing  12.b4  Na4  would only weaken White's position from every side of the board.  11...g5   Here Black had a solid choice of playing  11...Qb6  or any other standard developing move, keeping the position balanced. I also like this dynamic move where Black snatches White's central pawn.  12.Be3  Qc7   There is no way to save the pawn now.  13.Nf3  g4  14.Nd2  h5  would only worsen the position.  13.Bd3  Qxe5  14.O-O  14...Rg8⇆  Black has a good center, and he is a pawn up. White does have compensation as Black is still yet to castle. Although, not necessarily Black must castle. His king, for now, is pretty safe on the center. According to engines, it is an equal position. I would say it is very sharp with all three results possible. }
10... Qb6
{ This aims to remove the bishop from e5 by playing Bd6 next. On paper, the dark squared-bishop is bad for White, and stronger for Black. However, this bishop on e5 is more vital in reality as it takes control of important diagonals. It was also possible to play traditionally and exchange the light squared-bishop first by going Bb5. }
11. Qb3
{ White is not on time to protect the b2 pawn and be ready to meet Bd6 with Nf3/Nd3. Thus he decides to change queens and stop Black from playing Bd6. }
11... Qc6
{ Black threatens to play Bd6 once again. Note that White cannot take on b7 after 12. -- Bd6 13. Bxd6 Qxd6 14. Qxb7 as White's queen gets stuck after Rb8, and the b2-pawn also falls. }
12. Nc1
{ 12.Ng1!?  A similar idea as in the game but keeping the d3 square for the bishop.  12...Ne4  13.Bd3  f6  The bishop finally gets removed.  14.Bf4  O-O-O  ⇆  White is a bit under-developed, and Black is ready to push his pawns and gain more space. }
12... Ne4 13. Nd3
{ 13.f3  would have been met with  13...f6  when White had to go back with the bishop. }
13... f6 14. Bf4 h5
{ Black's center is excellent, and his king remains flexible on the center or the queenside. Black now starts to gain space in the kingside and plans to play g5-h4. Black would love to play  14...Bd6  15.Bxd6  Qxd6  but here White can play  16.f3  and the knight must leave the nice  e4  square. }
15. Be3
{ 15.f3  Nd6  16.Nc5  Bc8  It looks like Black's pieces are going backward, but soon things will reverse. White has weakened the position by playing f3 and the knight on c5 is not stable either.  17.O-O-O  Nf5⇆  Now the knight comes under attack and does not have a good retreat. Black gets a comfortable position.   15.h4  This move stops g5 but now Black can get back to his original idea....  15...Bd6  16.Bxd6  Qxd6⇆  The difference of including h5-h4 becomes clear now. White cannot play f3 anymore. }
15... h4 { Black keeps taking more space on the kingside. } 16. Be2 g5
{ The knight on d3 and the bishop e3 got restricted. The position remains dynamic. Black needs to find a safe place for his king. }
17. O-O-O O-O-O
{ Once White castled long, Black is also ok with castling long. Now both kings are safe. }
18. Kb1 Qc7 { The queen is heading for the a5 square to get Ba4 ideas in. } 19.
f3 Nd6 { Both knights are now ideally placed. } 20. f4
{ White rightly opens up the position and doesn't allow Black to keep more space.  20.Nc5  was met by  20...Nf5  attacking the bishop on  e3  . }
20... Nc4 21. Bc1 gxf4 22. Nxf4
{ Surprisingly in this normal-looking position if White played  22.Bxf4  then he is immediately lost after  22...Qa5  as there is no way to stop the  Ba4  threat! }
22... Bd6 23. Rdf1
{ Stockfish comes up with a nice regrouping. The queen was not ideally placed on b3, constantly watching out for Qa5-Ba4 threats. Now it heads back to d1. }
23... Rdg8 24. Qd1 Kb8
{ Black also remains solid. He improves his king's position and gets it to the safest square possible. }
25. Rf2 Ka8 26. Re1 f5
{ There was no way White would allow Black to play e5. The d5 pawn would be hanging all the time. Playing f5 is a committal decision, but it has a point. By playing f5, Black has mainly weakened the e5 square, but that is under excellent control with Black's pieces. }
27. Ka1 Qc8
{ Now for the next 20 moves or so, typical computer chess happens where both sides are making moves without much progress. This stage of the game does not have any particular relevance with human chess. }
28. Bf3 Bc7 29. Rfe2 Re8 30. Rg1 Rh7 31. g3 hxg3 32. hxg3 Rg7 33. Nh5 Rf7 34.
Nf4 Rg7 35. Reg2 { Stockfish wants to keep the game going. } 35... Bd6 36. Nh5
Rf7 37. Nf4 Rg7 38. Nh5 Rf7 39. Be2
{ I used to think such tricks were done only in human chess to gain 30sec extra. It seems engines are also keen on repeating twice for some reason ;- @@EndBracket@@ }
39... Qd8 40. b3 Nb6 41. Nf4 Rfe7 42. Bf3 Rg8 43. Bd2 Qc7 44. Kb1 Ka7
{ It would be literally impossible for me trying to explain these moves : @@EndBracket@@ }
45. Rh1 Bb5 46. Qc2 Rc8 47. Rh6 Qd7 48. Rg1 a5
{ Out of nowhere the game pattern changes and Black charges on the queenside. }
49. a4 Ba6 50. Nd3 Qc7 51. Nf4 Bxf4
{ This time Black does not want to repeat. Funny computer world : @@EndBracket@@ }
52. gxf4
{ The point was obviously that White was unable to take on f4 with the bishop as the c3 pawn was hanging. }
52... Qd6 53. Bd1 Rc6 54. Qc1 Nc8
{ I would have considered playing Bd3-Be4 but let us not try to criticise someone who is more than 1100 rating points higher than me : @@EndBracket@@ }
55. Rg8 Rec7 56. Rhh8 b5
{ That is why he has more than 1100 rating points higher than me ;- @@EndBracket@@ }
57. axb5 Bxb5
{ Black is creating some chances on the queenside. The knight on c8 blocks White's rooks nicely. }
58. Rd8 Qe7 59. Rde8 Qg7 60. Bc2 { Now White does not want to draw again :-D }
60... a4 61. Rhg8
{ White eventually took on a4 after chasing the queen a few times. } 61... Qd7
62. Rd8 Qe7 63. Rge8 Qg7 64. bxa4 Ba6
{ The knight on c8 is safe, which blocks White's rooks. The white king is now exposed, and Black's rooks are more dangerous than White's rooks here. }
65. Qe1 Rd6 66. Bc1 Rb6+ 67. Bb2 Qg2 68. Rg8 Qh2 69. Rh8
{ Finally, for some weird reason, the game ends in a draw here. I don't know how this is possible, actually. Until now, they avoided repetition, and suddenly, in a complicated position, the game abruptly ends in a draw. The position remains super-sharp after  69...Qxf4  I was under the impression that it only occurs in a human game wherein, in an unclear position, one player offers a draw, and others accept it. }

{ Correspondence and computer games are now an integral part of modern opening preparation. Most correspondence players are running the strongest of engines in a particular position for a more extended period of time than regular over-the-board players who keep jumping from one position to another. In many cases, I found an ICCF player is way better prepared than strong Grandmasters, simply because in any given position an ICCF player will run the engine for a longer time and go deeper in their analysis. Professional players will always keep checking correspondence and engine games, especially when it comes to their repertoire. I am no exception in this area, and I make sure that I keep track of all these games. The game that we will see now is an example taken from a recent ICCF game. }

Make sure not to push the e7-pawn which is controlling the important d6-square.' With this, my notes ended in the course. We will now see how the game proceeded from here. }
15. Be2
{ Stopping  Bh5  and planning for a future h4-h5. Direct  15.h4  would have been met with  15...Bh5   15.Nb5+  Direct attack on the king does not work for White here.  15...Kc6  16.Nd4+  Kxc5!  17.Nb3+  Kb6-+  It is not a perpetual and White is pawn down for nothing here. }
15... Nd7 16. h4 h5 17. Nb5+ Kc8
{ Black rightly plays for a win here. White still must play accurately to get a draw here.   17...Kc6  would suffice for a draw as White has nothing better than giving a check back on d4.  18.Nd4+  Kxc5  This move gives White enough compensation. It was better to repeat with Kc7 at this point.  19.Nb3+  19...Kc6  20.Bb5+!  20...Kxb5  21.Rxd7  21...Kb6  22.Rhd1=∞  White's pieces are very active here that gives him full compensation for the pawn. }

Kc7
{ Black threatens e5. Direct  19...e5  would have allowed White to play the intermediate  20.c6! }

20... Nf6 21. Rg5 Rae8
{ Again getting ready to play e5 and this time White cannot really stop it. }
22. Kb2 e5 23. Nb3 Re6
{ Black finds a creative way to target White's f2 pawn. He wants to get Nd7-Rf6 now. Despite being a pawn up and having a better structure, Black is somehow unable to make significant progress as his bishop is stuck on g6, and the kingside pawns are not moving. }
24. Na5 Nd7 25. Nc4
{ Black's pieces are stuck defending his pawns. He is unable to make enough progress to win the game. White managed to find the balance in the position. }
25... Nxc5 26. Nxe5 b6
{ 26...Na4  27.Kb3  would only repeat the position after Black plays  27...Nc5 }
27. Rdg1 Rd8 28. Kc1
{ Stopping Rd2   28.Bxh5  It was also possible to take the pawn and the game would still be equal.  28...Bxh5  29.Rxh5  Rd5  30.Rgg5!  e3  Black finds a square on e4 to attack the rook on g5.  31.fxe3  Ne4  32.c4  32...Ra5  There was no other square available. Black must keep an eye on e5 and Rc5 wasn't working due Nd3 attacking the rook on c5.  33.Nxf7  Nxg5  34.hxg5=∞  White has knight and three pawns for a rook, which is more than enough but his pawn structure is completely broken and disconnected. The game is likely to end in a draw. }

If White goes  16.Nxd7  Kxd7  17.Bb5+  , then we have  17...Ke6  . Eventually, our bishop will come to  c5  taking care of the  b6  pawn and keeping an eye on e3'. We will now see how the 2019 Correspondence game continued from here. }
16. Nxd7
{ The best decision. White cannot take on b6 as that opens up the rook on a8. With a hanging pawn on a2, White would not want to awaken the rook on a8.   16.c6  This would be a great option if White can maintain the pawn on c6 and give pressure. In this situation, that is not the case.  16...Bf5  Comes with a tempo.  17.Bd3   The radical exchange sac with  17.Bb5  does not work as after  17...Bxb1  18.c7+  Ke7  19.Rxb1  Rc8  White loses the  c7  pawn and remains an exchange down.  17...Bxd3  18.Kxd3  Rc8∓  There is no way to save the pawn on c6 as the knight gets chased away from e5 soon. Black is clearly better here. }
16... Kxd7 17. Bb5+
{ Once again taking on b6 would only help Black to attack the pawn on a2 with his rook on a8. }
17... Ke6 18. e4
{ White tries to open up the game with the Black king in the center, which is logical. After  18.c6  Bc5  , the Black king finds a lovely spot on  d6  , and it would be impossible for White to maintain the pawn on  c6  as the bishop will get chased away with a6-b5 in the future. }
18... Bxc5 19. exd5+ Kxd5 20. Kc2
{ Trying to give some checks and catch the king in the center. If White gets one more move, he would play Rhe1 and the mate threat of Rbd1 would be difficult to deal with. }

We will just finish development and attack. }

{ A counter-intuitive brilliant move. The most natural response would have been to take the knight with  12...Nxg4  and after  13.Qxg4  g6  Black is doing fine.  I would still recommend this move, which is much stronger and has a hidden threat. We have already seen a similar position with an extra a3 in the game Bluebaum vs. Vidit. By playing 12...Ne8 Black wants to play f5 next, trapping the knight on g4.  The same could have been achieved by playing  12...Nd7  , but unfortunately, that turns out to be a blunder. A famous game Wei Yi vs. Karjakin from Jerusalem GP 2019, is a classic example of that where White found the refutation over the board. It is a very long combination, and I urge all the readers to sharpen their tactical skills by trying to figure out the details after  12...Nd7  13.Nh6  line. Once you are done with the exercise, then later, you can look at this fantastic game mentioned above.  To sum it up, by playing 12...Ne8, we keep the same threat of f5 but avoid the Nh6 combination that does not work for White with a Black knight on e8 instead of d7. }

{ What on earth is Black thinking? White is trying to smash Black with a very quick O-O and f4 and here Black is bringing back his pieces as if he is preparing for the next game. Reality is far from this seemingly shallow and obvious explanation. This weird-looking move has a deep positional strategic idea. Let us try to understand it step by step. White has only one sensible break on the center/kingside, and that is f4. Once f4 happens, Black will take on f4, and White's bishop will come to f4, putting pressure on the d6 pawn and threatening to pin the f6 knight with Bg5 at some point. Now with Ng8 Black solved many of these problems permanently. He realized that the f6 knight was his main issue! This knight should be ready to come to e5 once the exchange happens on f4. Then why Black didn't play Nfd7? Well, it is important not to allow White to play Nf5. With the knight on g8, Black keeps the c8 bishop open, which controls Nf5. Also, ideally, Black's knight would be great on g6 from where not only is it ready to jump to e5, but more importantly, it attacks the f4 bishop. If white doesn't play f4 now, then, in any case, Black will get his knight to e7, and he is ready to meet f4 for the rest of the game, which is, by the way, Whtie's only plan to fight for initiative in the center/kingside. Meanwhile, Black is a pawn up, and now the ball is in White's court. }
12. O-O
{ White is now fully ready to break f4, and we are reaching the climax point. It will be of utmost importance to see whose strategy works here. Black is a pawn up and hopes to create a nice blockade in the center, while White wants to crush through the center, claiming that he has a lead in development. }
12... Ne7
{ Perfectly timed! Just when White is planning to launch a massive attack on the center with f4, Black is right on time to stop everything. I believe that this idea of Ng8-Ne7-Ng6 is too pretty and strong. I have been waiting to play this myself for quite a long time. It was only played in Correspondence games back in 2017-18. However, very recently, in October 2020, my friend and colleague and another member of Team Anand, Radoslav Wojtaszek  @@StartBracket@@more commonly known as Radek@@EndBracket@@, played this in one of the 'Titled-Tuesday' matches! Due to this special lockdown situation, we see many strong novelties being used in online chess. Players are aware that if they don't use it, someone else will use it. Anyway, I just wanted to point out that when a strong player and theoretician like Radek plays this, that gives the stamp of this move's solidity. Let us keep digging a bit more to get absolute clarity and understand the intricacy of the position. We march forward as per our plan. The knight is heading for the g6 square. }

15. Rd1 Qe7
{ Black gets rid of the pin, and finally, the c6 pawn is lost. Black is well developed, and his pieces are nicely coordinated. This compensates for White's double bishop advantage. Also, the fact that White is still yet to develop the f1-bishop and take care of his king adds up in favor of Black. The position remains balanced with all three results possible. }

{ The best possible way to give material. White finally takes care of his kingside and gets his bishop out. Hoping to get the bishop on b7, eventually forking the black rooks.   15.Rxf7  Taking the third pawn for the moment and planning to sac the exchange with Rxf6 in case of Nd8.  15...Nxd4!  White has to find a shelter for his king now. Rc1-Kd2-Nb3 is one of the among many threats that Black has.  16.f3  Making a square for his king. This now runs into a problem from a completely unexpected direction.  16...Nh7-+  Suddenly the f7 rook comes into trouble yet once again. White can sac the exchange somehow, but that doesn't stop Black from penetrating in the 7th rank with Rc2 in the future. White is almost lost here. }

{ There is no way to stop the threat of Nd5. White loses the c7 pawn. } 16. e3
{ Seeing that he cannot stop Nd5 by normal means, white decides to finish his development on the kingside, which was due for a long time. He also has a devilish idea to save the c7 pawn. He is planning to go for Bd8 as soon as the f6 knight moves. }
16... Nd5
{ We are not scared of the Bd8 move for a particular reason that we will see soon. For now, we just force White to fulfill his wish of playing Bd8 and cementing the c7 pawn. }
17. Bd8
{ With huge effort and creative imaginative effort, it looks like White finally saved the pawn. This is far from the truth. We will now see what devilish counter-trick Black had in mind.  Let's see if you can figure out Black's best move by yourself. }
17... Nb8
{ A fantastic Karpovian retreat with an extra touch of the Magical Tal! Black threatens Na6 and Nc6 on one go. Once White loses the c7 pawn, the d8 bishop also falls, and the pin on the c-file thanks to the hanging rook on c1 will start to pull the advantage in favor of Black.     The trick is that White is unable to take  18.cxb8  due to  18...Qxb8  when the c1 rook finally hangs! Using the same theme of the hanging rook on  c1  black also stopped White from playing  18.b5  , which is met by  18...Rfxd8  18.cxd8=Q  Qxd8  , and once again, the unfortunate  c1  rook hangs. Meanwhile, there is nothing to be done about the c7 pawn. }
18. Rd1
{ White now goes for the pin on the d-file threatening e4, using the momentum when Black cannot take on c7 with the rook. }
18... Na6
{ With White's king still in the center, by all means, we are ready to sacrifice material. We welcome White to take our d5 knight by playing e4 next. }

20. Bh4 Rfe8
{ Taking advantage of the pin on the e-file, Black develops his last piece into the game. It is move 20, and White still has done nothing about his kingside. For now, Black just stops the exd5 threat due to discovered-check and picking up the c4 queen. }
21. Qb3
{ Getting away from the discover-check. Playing  21.Bg3  only helps Black when he can unpin himself with  21...Qe7  and then move his knight away. Going for  21.Be2  doesn't help either as Black would then first opt for  21...Ba6  , then exchange on e2 and again takes advantage of the pin on the e-file to unpin himself. Once he unpins the d5 knight, this same knight will be ready to jump to nice squares like c3 and f4, creating lots of trouble for White. }
21... Qf4
{ Time to sac the material and go for an attack. The King in the center will do justice for Black. Right now White is forced to take the piece as  22.Bd3  is well tackled by  22...Qg4  23.O-O  Nf4  . }
22. exd5 exd5+ 23. Be2 Ba6
{ Thanks to the knight on c7, White is unable to play b5. This means he is going to lose heavy material. O-O is answered with Bxe2 picking up one of the rooks. Computer evaluation of -6 in favor of Black is totally justified here. }

{ When I saw this move for the first time, I did not believe it at first glance. Then when I started to think deeply, I realized the point. Look at White's king! The main guy who was defending it was this c1 rook. Black now eliminates it. White remains a queen up, but that very extra queen is miles away from the king. The rook on h1 and the bishop on f1 are of no help either. It is all about piece placement and domination. Black's rooks are going to enter via c-file, and White cannot stop it. The strongest of machines calls it 0.00, but it is a tight rope to walk on for White here. Those who don't want to get so romantic over the board can always play the prosaic 16...e5, which also gives Black fine play. }
17. Rxc6 Rxc6
{ For now, just giving a small threat of mate in one with Rc1 : @@EndBracket@@  The f8 rook is ready for backup that might be needed on the c-file. }
18. e3
{ Already not an easy move to allow Rc1+ and getting his king up to e2. This is by far the best option White can have.   18.Bf4?!  A natural move like this, which controls the c1 square, is already a mistake. The same goes for 18.Kd1, which would transpose after 18... Rfc8 19.Bf4.  18...Rfc8  Once again, threatening to play Rc1 and give mate.  19.Kd1  No other choice. Playing 19.Qa4 was not an option since after the exchange on c1, when White will play Qd1, then Black would take the queen and finally win the h1 rook with Nf2 fork.  19...Nxf2+  20.Ke1   20.Kd2  This leads to a forced mate.  20...Rc2+  21.Ke3  Nd1+  22.Kd3  Nxb2+  First eliminate the important b2-pawn which was controlling the c3 square.  23.Ke3  Nd1+  24.Kd3  R8c3+  White is missing the b2 pawn. That is why it was important to remove it first.  25.Kd4  Rc4+  26.Kd3  Nc5  Ne4  21.Kd1  Now, if Black wants, he can make a draw by repeating with Nf2. But engine thinks already he is winning by playing  21...g5!!  Once f4 bishop is gone, there will be nothing left to stop the mate on c1.  22.Be3  R6c7  Being a queen down, Black starts playing slow chess!! White is in some sort of a zugzwang. The king and e3 bishop are, in a way, stuck trying to stop Rc1 ideas. The h1 rook and f1 bishop are also stuck. Moves like Nd4 can be met by Ndf6 once again slowly approaching towards the e3 bishop with Nd5/Ng4. All that remains is to check if White's extra queen can be of some use.  23.Qa4  Bd5-+  A super cool move. Now planning to go for Ndc5 and Bb3. Once again, all of White's pieces are completely immovable. Despite being a queen up even materialistic engine thinks this is -3 for Black. Clearly, piece activity makes all the difference, and just by having them under-developed doesn't matter here. }
18... Rc1+ 19. Ke2 Ndc5
{ Black is threatening to play Ba6 next. This literally forces White to move his knight from f3 to make the f3 square available for his king. }
20. Nd4
{ The only move.  20.Ne5  would allow  20...Rc2+  when the White king is unable to come to f3 due to that deadly discover-check, and if he goes back to d1, then Black just takes on b2 with the rook. The white queen remains shut on a7, and the king on d1 is faced with a mating attack. }
20... Rc8
{ What I love about this queen sacrifice is that Black is in no rush at all! Let us try to understand how come Black has all the time in the world to make such cool moves. White's kingside is frozen bigtime. He would love to remove the knight from e4, but the only option is to play f3, which takes away the square of his king and thus will be met by Ba6+ immediately winning the game. Knight on d4 is fixed as it must control Rc2+ ideas. Any other pawn moves don't make sense.   Playing  21.b4  is good conceptually, but it allows mate in 7 after  21...Nc3  21.Kd2  Nb3  , etc.   What is Black threatening? Black wants to play Rb1 next. Then why didn't he play that previous move? Answering this question will help us to understand why we played 20...Rc8! So let's have a look at the following variation:  20...Rb1  21.Qxb6  Nc3+  22.Kd2  Rd1+  23.Kxc3  Na4  24.Kc2  Nxb6  25.Kxd1  wins for White. Now it is all crystal clear. To stop this, 24.Kc2 the move 20.Rc8 is needed : @@EndBracket@@ }
21. Qxb6 Rb1 { Once again going for Nc3 threats. } 22. Qb4
{ Apparently, the only move. I understand I am going deep here but in general, it is fun to analyze such positions just to enhance one's general understanding of the game. This was the only way by which White could stop the Nc3 threat. }
22... f5
{ Seeing that White is completely stuck, Black gives a deadly mate threat.   He now wants to play  23...Ba6  24.Kf3  Rxf1!!  25.Rxf1  Ng5+  26.Kf4  Nd3#  I encourage the readers to analyze such positions independently and never memorize the details. Rather try to understand the logic behind it to always figure things out over the board. According to best engines, this position is still 0.00, but White should really figure out every tiny detail to avoid getting lost. }
23. Be5
{ 23.h4  Ba6+  By the way, as per the engine, everything draws here. Black could also make moves like Kh7, and there is nothing White can do about it. I am showing one line just for the sake of completion.  24.Kf3  Bxf1  25.Rxf1  Rxf1=∞  Already Black picked up two rooks for the Queen. Nd3 and Nxg3-Kg3-Ne4 are coming. Black has huge compensation for the queen here.   23.a4  Ba6+  24.Nb5  Rd8∓  Nd3 is a serious threat, and once again, none of White's pieces are moving. Already Black is clearly better, and White should find a way to give his queen. It is amazing how quickly White's position fell apart despite being a queen up. }
23... Nd3 24. Qxb7
{ 24.Kxd3?  Leads to a forced cute mate : @@EndBracket@@  24...Ba6+  25.Nb5  Bxb5+  26.Qxb5  Rd1+  27.Ke2  Rd2+  With mate in one to follow. }
24... Re1+
{ 25.Kxd3  Rd1  26.Ke2  Rd2  is mate so the next move for White is forced. }
25. Kf3 Nxe5+ 26. Kf4 Ng6+ 27. Kf3

12... Re8
{ This is an important prophylactic move. White was planning to play Nf3 next, and Black decides to take care of that.   Now,  13.Nf3  can be answered with a cute tactical fork combination starting with  13...d3  14.Bxd3  e4  winning a piece. This is the reason we need our rook on e8 to have enough support on the e4 square. A brilliant way to stop Nf3. }
13. Rd1
{ Being unable to play Nf3, White now made an innocent-looking move with a subtle idea in mind.   In the previous move, he could not play  13.b4  due to a5 ideas. He now moves his rook from the a-file hoping to play b4 at the right moment. }
13... a5
{ We are in no rush. Nf3 still does not work, so why not stop White from playing b4 also? We are also ready to sacrifice our d4 pawn for the sake of further rapid development. }
14. Nf3
{ This was tried by Nepo against Karjakin once, but to be honest, I did not understand why Karjakin did not accept the piece sacrifice. We will see that in the lines given in the course. White has to develop his knight, and there was no other reasonable way to do it, so he takes his chance by sacrificing a whole piece. }
14... d3
{ The game Nepo vs. Karjakin went with  14...Nc6  , which is a solid option for Black. Karjaking had a stable position throughout, and the game ended in a draw. He eventually took the piece using the same tactics after white played  15.O-O  . I think it is better to take the piece right away. }

Lc0 thinks Black is slightly better, while Stockfish thinks Black is just winning here. My human evaluation would be White is struggling, and there is no direct way to attack Black's king. Black's vital resource is to play Ra6, which will either eliminate White's active rook from d6 or allow Balck's a6 rook to protect the vulnerable h6 pawn by playing f5. }

After  14.Bh4  Nce4  suddenly White is missing  15.Qf4  due to  15...g5  , which wins a piece. This leaves two important moves to check. The simple  14.Bxf6  and the wild  14.h4  . }
14. Bxf6
{ 14.h4  Trying to spice things up. Keeping the pin intact and skillfully saving the g5 bishop by actually offering to sacrifice it! Of course, taking the bishop would mean opening up the h-file, leading to a disaster for Black.  14...Nfe4!  Once h4 is played, this move becomes powerful.

So we take the far more dangerous e5 knight instead.  17.exd4  Black is currently two pawns down, and his pieces are forked. What was Black thinking before getting here? The answer lies in Black's next two moves.  17...Nb3+!  18.Kc2   18.Kb1  was directly answered with  18...Bf5+  19.Ka2  Re3  when the d8 bishop hangs, and Black also threatens to take the d1 rook with Bc2.

White is now more or less forced to take on c5 when Black gets back the piece and the pawn by going Qxf4 followed by Rxe5. Black keeps the initiative here, thanks to the exposed king on c1. }

{ Those who want to keep the game going can play  22...Be6  , which still keeps the position complicated. Although the computer evaluation still says 0.00, practically it is not at all trivial, and the position remains super complex. 22...Rd3 forces an immediate draw using the Nb3-Na1 perpetual. However, the same idea does not work with  22...Re3  due to the brilliant  23.b4!!  when White takes over. }

That is not surprising. White's pawn structure speaks for itself. Black will pick up the c6 pawn, and White's queenside majority doesn't look scary due to his horrible structure. }
23... Nb3+ 24. Kc2 Na1+
{ Remember the knight journey starting from 20... Nd7? It finally landed on a1 giving one of the most aesthetically pleasing perpetual checks that I have seen in the opening. This was the very line that, in a way, discouraged all the team members of Anand from playing this line as White. We didn't see that many upsides. The only thing Black needs to know is the move 15...Qa5! After that, the game becomes pretty much one-sided. }

{ The complex way of dealing with the position. Seeing that normal moves would get him into trouble, White goes all in by sacrificing his knight in order to get a free and open position. }
11... hxg5 12. Bxg5
{ It indeed looks beautiful for White. The knight is in a deadly pin, and White is ready to castle long. Suddenly all Black's pieces are lacking coordination to defend the position. Unfortunately for White, all of this is just a glitch in the matrix, Black does not have to defend the position. We had a counter-trick in mind when we allowed this sacrifice. }

15. cxd5 N6xc5

White cannot take on e6 and allow Black to develop his bishop to e6, after which stopping Nb3 ideas would be impossible. He now tries to find the best way to keep the position closed to finish his development peacefully. }

{ White did save his pawn and next up he wants to play e4 to tie the knight on c3. This still needs one more move, and now it is Black to move. Our move is clear and simple now. }
19... Nd5
{ Black gets his knight back in time from c3. Now Bd7-Rc8 will come quickly. White has to waste on more tempo with his e7 bishop. Black is going to stop White from playing e4-e5 by himself playing e5 at the right moment. The d6 pawn will become lose and soon be gone. White bishop lacks a good square. White's major problem is once again his lack of development on the kingside. By the time he finishes that, Black gets enough play on the queenside and center. }

16. Bc2
{ 16.Be2  Nxg4  17.fxg4  Qg6  Black has three pawns and a rook for White's Bishop and knight. So, materially speaking, he is doing great.  18.Nf3  f6∓  A nice move that restricts the knight on f6. White's king remains weak, and Black will soon finish his development. The main problem with White's king is that it doesn't really have a safe place. If White could get a quick Bd3, that would be nice, but that is not feasible. Also, White must keep in mind that Black can as well take on g4 at any moment. The computer calls it -2.6. I don't know how exactly this evaluation works but from a human perspective, and I can say that Black is close to winning here, if not winning already. }
16... Nxg4 17. fxg4 Qxg4
{ Unlike the variation in 16.Bc2 this time, we have four pawns plus rook for bishop and knight instead of three pawns and rook. Here we should be a bit careful since White has managed to open every single file for himself on the kingside. Unless we are careful with the next few moves, we might run into a massive attack on the kingside. }
18. Nf3
{ Sooner or later, this move is needed for White to castle long. He could also start with Bb2 or Be3. In each case, our response is similar. }
18... e5
{ This is an important move. Black has enough pawns in supply, so there is no need to hold on to it just for the sake of having more pawns. Currently, the priority is White should not be able to run the queenside safely and attack us. As we know, offense is the best defense. Black strikes in the center before White can run away. }
19. Nxe5
{ White cannot allow Black to play e4 and close the diagonal from which he intends to start the attack. Once e4 is played, both bishops become jobless. }
19... Qh3
{ A nice square for the queen. Threatens Qc3 and also, at times, Qh1 to disturb White's king. }
20. Bb2 Qh6
{ The elegant final touch to secure a winning position. With this last move, Black made sure the White king is never finding a safe place to hide. There is no room for escape as Bc1 will be answered by Qh1. White has no way to get rook into the game. He can exchange queens, but then these three extra pawns on the queenside will have their say in the game. The machine gives -3.5 to confirm that Black has a great position here. }

Bf5/Nf5/Nd5 everything is coming, and there is no hint of attack. Hence the engine calls it -4. This line was crucial to figure out while playing 11...Re8, which forced White to play f4, and after which, we were obliged to play 12...Ne7. It was all depending on if this attack was working or not. Hence I would like to keep this as the mainline of this variation. }

The point is after  16.g3  Black takes on e4  Qxe4  , and either he gets the h1 rook or the b2 bishop along with the d1 rook. If White gives the h1 rook, then his h2 pawn will also fall.

Well, there is simply not a single piece that can get to Black's king. White's knight optically looks good on d4, but the d7 bishop very nicely controls it. Moves like Qe7 can chase this bishop, but this doesn't bother Black as the bishop could restrict this knight on d4 even by going to h3 from where it will also attack the rook on f1. Once White plays Nf5, which he must play at some point anyway, the position liquidates completely after the exchange on f5. Hikaru had this particular position thrice as Black. }

19. Qxc1 g6

Playing  17.Bd3  does not help either since after  17...exd5  , the pawn on d4 still hangs, and White is unable to castle. The move  17.Rd1  , in a way, makes sense as White protects its vital pawn on d4. }

Moves like  18.Be2  instantly loses to  18...Na2  , when White cannot save the c3 knight and take on a2 with the queen, is not an option as Black has Bxc3 followed by taking the queen on a2.   Taking  18.dxe6  fxe6  only adds to White's nightmare as the f8 rook comes into play and the f2 pawn is likely to fall. Engine says Black is clearly winning, and White's best bet would be to unpin himself by playing  18.Ke2  here! Once that move is played, we can stop our analyses by looking at the poor king and supporting evaluation of -1 in favor of Black. }

White would love to roll his central pawns but now, after  16.e5  Nd5  17.c4  Nde7  , he is unable to push his d-pawn as the e5 pawn hangs.

{ It was first seen in 2012, but only when in 2019 Leko played it against Korobov in a blitz game and won the line got its due respect. It was also mentioned in the Roiz book back in 2015. I have known Peter and worked with him on several occasions, so I can safely say that even in a blitz game, Peter would be extremely well prepared and know what to do in his lines, especially when it comes to his pet line, Nimzo Indian defense. Since the Ba6 ideas are not effective anymore, it is understandable that Black would keep his bishop on b7. He could do this by playing b6 or b5. The reason for choosing b5 is simple. Black keeps the b6 square open for his knight, which will come via d7. From b6, it keeps the option of jumping to c4/a4/d5 depending on White's setup. }
11. O-O Bb7 12. Qe2

In the game Korobov - Leko, White played  12.Re1  Nbd7  13.Bb2  and after  13...Nb6  Peter got the dream position when White is unable to push any of his central pawns, and the threats of Na4 becomes extremely annoying for White.

A better move would have been to play  14.Bb2  and after  14...Nd7  , the situation remains the same when White's dark square bishop remains passive, and Black gets a nice control in the center with a good position to play for. However, we need to know why White cannot take the pawn on b5 for free. }
14... Bxe4 15. Qxb5 Nd7
{ The nature of compensation is long-lasting and strategic. Black does not need to rush with things as White's bishop on a1 will be out of the game for a long time. Rab8 will come with a tempo, and Black's knight will soon come to b6 from where it gets various choices on where to jump in the enemy camp. White's c3 pawn remains weak, and the bishop on c1 would have trouble finding a good square for himself. Another important aspect is the only open file will be in black's possession as Black's bishop controls the b1 square. Black has more than enough compensation here. }

{ Usually, such moves are considered to be creating a weakness, but looking at the knight on e2 justifies this move. It would take ages for a White knight to gain access to the e5 square. }
16. Qd3 Ng6
{ An important positional move. Black stops White from exchanging the dark-squared bishop with Bf4. Now every single piece of White is jobless. Both bishops lack good square and targets, and the e2 knight has no good square. Black intends to play Kh7-Qf6-Rad8-Bc6 and create a play in the center and kingside. He is now clearly better. }

{ The queen remains very active on f4, and sooner or later, White will have to get rid of this queen by trading it. Black will go Rac8 and Na5, increasing the pressure on both of the central pawns. With no central pawn breaks happening and both bishops defending the pawns, White's double bishop advantage evaporates totally, and Black gets a fine and balanced position. }

{ Black's plan remains the same. This time Nf4 could even come with an extra tempo. This was my choice against Wang Hao. It only works with the White rook on c1 and not on e1. IF the readers do not wish to keep this extra information in mind, then I suggest playing 14...Rc8, which is fine in both cases. After playing Rc8, Black can play Nh5 in the next move getting a similar position like in the mainline. The only difference comes when White plays d5. With the rook on c8, this option is eliminated as Black gets one extra layer of protection on c6 and can also meet d5 with Na5, attacking the c4 bishop. }

White has the bishop pair, but he also doesn't have such a great pawn structure like Black, and the bishop on h4 is not so useful. Thus the position remains balanced. }
