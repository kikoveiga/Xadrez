1. d4
{ Welcome to my repertoire against 1.d4! My goal with this course was to provide a long lasting, first rate opening repertoire based on arguably the best defense to 1.d4. The Semi-Slav has been played by every single World Champion in the modern era, and has been a mainstay in elite chess perennially. I have employed it myself many times throughout my own career, and I have played many of the lines that I recommend throughout the course. I have not knowingly left anything out. With opening theory becoming more and more advanced every day, it is more critical than ever to be well-prepared and get out of the opening with an okay position. Players of all levels find themselves walking a fine line where they have to balance between choosing objectively good and sound openings and choosing openings that are easy to remember, understand, and don't have a ton of forced variations to memorize. In a perfect world, Black could choose an opening that required nearly no memorization, quickly got him a decent position, and offered counterchances very early in the game. Unfortunately, such things don't exist, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a con artist. But I think I have found a sweet spot with my proposed repertoire. I chose an absolute first rate opening, and I managed to do so in a way that keeps long variations to a minimum. Are there some ? Yes, this is unavoidable. But there are a lot fewer than one might expect for such a heavily studied and combative repertoire.   My general philosophy when choosing which lines to recommend was that if I believed there was an easy solution to White's chosen line, I gave it. Particularly against the non-critical lines, I prioritized ease over ambition, contenting myself with comfortable equality and chances to play for more with a few simple moves that don't require much memorization to a huge amount of theory to try to show a small advantage with Black, when a misstep could lead to disaster. But if I did not believe an easy solution equalized, I always chose the more complicated one that I believed was objectively best. This is especially true in the critical lines, where White is making a serious attempt to fight for an opening advantage. In addition, I made sure to address every piece of chess literature I could find recommending 1. d4 on the first move for White. Opening books and online databases/courses have come a long way in the last decade, and across many different websites, platforms, and publishers. Unsurprisingly, as a result, a lot of players from club level to grandmaster are using these resources and playing the recommended lines in their own games. As such, I considered it a top priority to make sure my course was well equipped to meet each and every recommendation I could find. Some proved more challenging to meet than others, and unsurprisingly the more recent ones and the ones recommending mainlines tended to be the most difficult, but I'm still very satisfied with what I came up with. I made sure to call each one out by name and author at every point where I left their analysis by proposing a move they did not have covered, so you should know exactly how to play against anyone following a repertoire or book published before 2020.   Finally, I made sure to explain the key ideas of my proposed lines as well as I could. There's no point in getting a good position out of the opening if you have no clue how to play the resulting middlegame, as your position will soon deteriorate with every decision you make. In every game you play, at some point, one of your opponents will play a move I have not covered. It may be at the end of a line after I have already concluded my analysis with an evaluation, or earlier on when they play an inferior move to one I have mentioned, or the least desirable case would be if they find a strong novelty that I had not anticipated  (I seriously doubt this will happen against non-grandmasters, but you never know)  . In all of these cases, it will be important for you to react well, and part of reacting well is knowing what plans you should employ and when. As such, I made sure to add a lot of text to explain the resulting middlegames as well as I could. Without further ado, let's get started ! The best way to learn any opening is to make sure you are ready against the sidelines first, and I made sure to cover just about anything I could think of White trying on the second through fourth moves before reaching the mainlines.   Best of luck ! }

{ Probably this move makes more problems for White than Black. Romantic but poor }
7... h6
{ I like this combative option the best. Black gets a lot of counterplay and has surprisingly few variations to memorize. He has prevented g4-g5 from kicking his Knight away and is ready to play e6-e5 next to blow open the center and punish White for rendering his Kingside unsuitable for castling. }
8. Rg1
{ Definitely the most direct move, but not a great one. White wants g5 and to smash through with Nxf7. What could be more natural ? }
8... e5
{ This is absolutely necessary. Black needs counterplay in the center before White kills him on the Kingside. }
9. cxd5
{ White must accept the challenge. If Black is allowed to close the center again with e5-e4, any hope of an attack will be over and all that will be left in the White position is weaknesses. }
9... cxd5 10. Nb5 Bb8 11. g5
{ White has to play energetically to maintain the balance. If Black is allowed to play e5-e4 unmolested, he will be much better. }
11... hxg5 12. Nxg5 e4
{ Black shuts down the White Queen's access to the Kingside, and is one move away from being much better with a7-a6, expelling the b5-Knight and maintaining a fantastic position. White has to be very direct. }
13. Bd2 { White is planning Rc1 and Nc7, but it is not a major problem. } 13...

Bxc7 16. Qxc7 Qxc7 17. Rxc7 Rc8 18. Rxb7 Rc2
{ White's position is very fragile and on the brink of collapse, since either b2 or h2 will fall next. All of Black's pieces are poised to join the action. }

{ This move might look unambitious compared to the mainlines, but in fact I actually think it is a dangerous idea. White obviously wishes to put the Bishop on b2, where it will help prevent the freeing e6-e5 advance, while retaining the option to capture back on c4 with the pawn. Play takes a completely different character from the mainlines because d5xc4 is no longer a sensible capture. White will take back with b3xc4, strengthening his central grip and not losing time to a subsequent b7-b5. Still, the move has its drawbacks. Since White is not immediately trying to take control of the whole center, Black has more time to develop his pieces normally. }
7... O-O
{ Now White has to be very careful about how to develop his pieces because he is not yet castled and e6-e5 could be on the way. }
8. Be2
{ This is an attempt to lessen the punch of e5, but concedes having to put the Bishop on e2 instead of d3 von Fishellini,Rufus: 'This is White's only serious attempt after 7. b3 because it prevents the generally desirable e6-e5 break. Still, it is not as active a square as d3 and Black has some time to get his pieces out before White can threaten e3-e4.' }
8... b6 9. Bb2 Bb7 10. O-O Qe7
{ This seems like the easiest solution. Black puts his Queen on a nice centralized square and prevents e3-e4 from being comfortably achieved due to the availability of the f7-f5 tactic. A good rule of thumb for Black is to use his Rooks to follow White's. If White plays Rfd1 and Rac1, Black should play Rfd8 and Rac8. Similarly, if White goes for Rad1 and Rfe1  (which I believe is his best plan)  , Black should play Rad8 and Rfe8. }

11. Rad1 Rad8 { As mentioned, Black should follow White's Rooks. } 12. Rfe1
Rfe8
{ This is the most critical position of the variation, and White has a few things he can try. e3-e4 now makes much more sense than before because the Rook is placed better on e1, or White can try to transfer his Bishop to g2. In general, whenever White plays g2-g3, Black can often respond with Bd6-b4. The point is that he doesn't normally want to trade the Bishop for the Knight, but if White weakens the long diagonal and the light squares around his King, then swapping Bxc3 and getting c6-c5 through becomes much more dangerous. }
13. Bf1
{ I believe this is White's most dangerous attempt. e6-e5 is romantic, but in the modern era, seems not to hold up very well. Black is best advised to instead accept hanging pawns. }
13... c5
{ Normally I am very hesitant to accept hanging pawns, but under the circumstances, I think it is the best choice. White is ready to expand with e3-e4 soon, and Black gets a fantastic version of the hanging pawns position, for 2 reasons. First, all the minor pieces are still on the board, and second, White's Rooks are now misplaced. They would much prefer to be on d1 and c1! So, In order to 'force' Black into the hanging pawns position, White needed to put his Rooks on d1 and e1 to threaten e4, but now that he got the hanging pawns, they are not coordinating well.   13...e5?!  14.dxe5!  A prudent move that gives White a small edge.   14.cxd5  This move, which the computers initially recommend, is met with a beautiful refutation:  14...e4!  15.dxc6  Otherwise Black takes back cxd5 with a fantastic position.  exf3  16.cxb7  Bxh2!  17.Kxh2  Qd6  18.Kh3  And now a move from outer space...  Re5!!  19.dxe5  The threat of Re5-h5 is decisive, and the Rook is immune.  19...Qe6  20.Kh2  Qxe5  21.g3  Qh5  22.Kg1  Ng4  White is mated. But he can avoid such a fate if he knows to take on e5 instead of d5.  14...Nxe5  15.Nxe5  Bxe5  16.cxd5  cxd5  17.Nb5+=  I reached this position in a blitz game against Ding Liren in the Speed Chess Championship. I held a draw, but the position is a little uncomfortable thanks to the isolated d-pawn and passive b7-Bishop. }
14. cxd5 exd5 15. dxc5 bxc5
{ The evaluation of this position is critical for the line, as it is one of White's most challenging tries. I think Black is okay and can hope to launch a Kingside attack while always checking to see if the d5-d4 break will work, but future tests will be needed to see if this is correct or not. Stockfish does share my point of view and evaluates the position as equal. }

{ I think this is White's best try, but certainly not enough for an edge. }
9... Nxe5 10. O-O-O Qe7
{ This is the main move, and for good reason. Black steps off of the d-file to create the threat of d5xc4, which previously was not possible due to the hanging Knight on e5. White is all but forced to go pawn grabbing, but it doesn't lead him anywhere. }

{ The Queen stands better on f6 than on e7, and I want to make this move at a moment when White cannot ignore it. If Black had started with Be6, then after Rd4, Qf6 would not threaten anything. But if White tries Rd4 here, the Bishop will come to f5 instead. }
16. Kb1 Be6 17. Rd4 Rfd8 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. Bd3 g6
{ White's King is a bit insecure and he is too far behind on development and uncoordinated to make use of the pawn up. Black will soon follow up with a5-a4 to further loosen White's Kingside, and he has sufficient counterplay. }

{ I consider this one of the biggest tests of the entire Semi-Slav. White immediately aims to take control of the center, and keeps his Rook on f1 in the hope of possibly finding a more ambitious setup by bringing his other Rook to d1, leaving the Rook on f1 to support the central majority from e1 or f1 and sending f2-f4 through. Nice as all this sounds, it comes at a cost, as White's position becomes a little loose. }

12... Nxe5 13. Nh4
{ This is a very dangerous move as well, with a similar point to Nf3-d4. White gets out of the way of the f2-f4 thrust and prepares to play Nh4-f5.

{ I consider this one of the biggest tests of the entire Semi-Slav. White immediately aims to take control of the center, and keeps his Rook on f1 in the hope of possibly finding a more ambitious setup by bringing his other Rook to d1, leaving the Rook on f1 to support the central majority from e1 or f1 and sending f2-f4 through. Nice as all this sounds, it comes at a cost, as White's position becomes a little loose. }
11... e5 { Of course. } 12. dxe5
{ The most principled and only serious move. White wants to lure the Knight to e5, then move his own Knight to d4 or h4 en route to f5 and hope to follow up with f2-f4 and e4-e5. A very ambitious plan, but one I think Black is well prepared to meet. }

{ White's play makes a lot of sense. He wants to challenge the g4 Knight either with h2-h3 or Be2xg4 followed by Qc2-e2, play Rad1, and dominate the d6 square. Black is under some pressure and needs to be precise to equalize, but I think my proposed novelty does just that. }

dxc4 9. Bxc4 b5 10. Bd3
{ Despite the position looking very similar to that after Bc4-e2, the position is remarkably different. It is similar in that Black wants the same c6-c5 break while White should look for e3-e4, but once e3-e4 happens and Black responds with e6-e5, White's plan changes. He will generally take twice on e5 and play h3 to overprotect the g4 square, and then follow up with Bc1-e3 and eventually f2-f4. This is helped a lot by the Bishop on d3, which supports the potentially vulnerable e4-pawn after the inevitable Rf8-e8. By contrast, the previously most dangerous plans of taking dxe5 and then aiming to follow up with Nf3-d4 or Nf3-h4 are now totally senseless due to the hanging Bishop on d3. In addition, White can often play Nf3-g5 with a gain of tempo due to the hanging pawn on h7 in order to get to e4 quickly to try to stop the c6-c5 break. This would not work with the Bishop on e2 as h7 would not be hanging. As such, despite the very minor change to the position, play takes on a very different flavor. }
10... Bb7
{ Black plays in the same manner as he does against Bc4-e2, at least for now. However, here he does not have a choice since Nc3-e4 was a serious threat. }
11. a3
{ This is the main move by far, and can also come from an Open Meran move order with 6. Bd3 instead of 6. Qc2. White would like to play b2-b4 if given the opportunity, and in the meantime, he has prevented Black from playing b5-b4 himelf. One of the biggest appeals is that Black is unable to play my intended Qd8-b8, which I do against 11. a3 in the 10. Be2 line, because h7 will be hanging at the end. }
11... Rc8
{ I like the most direct move best, as I am worried about White's aforementioned plan to play e3-e4, h2-h3, take everything on e5 and put the Bishop on e3. By making a very direct move, Black's play is extremely obvious and he wants c6-c5 sooner rather than later. In fact, he can play it next move even with the b5-pawn hanging thanks to tactical energy on the c-file. White's only serious attempt at an advantage is to enter the chaos with Ng5. }
12. b4
{ This move attempts to prevent the c6-c5 break and is consistent with a2-a3, but Black is fine. }
12... a5
{ This move has been the favorite of most top players as of late, and for good reason. Black equalizes on the spot. }
13. Rb1
{ This is White's most natural move by far. He brings out a new piece that was not doing much and has it perform a vital defensive role, holding the all-important b4-pawn so that Black will not be able to play c6-c5. But, now that the Rook has been dragged to b1, now and only now Black can go for Kasimdhzanov's c6-c5 break. }
13... c5
{ This is an improved version for Black because Nxc3 will win a tempo } 14.
bxc5 Bxf3 15. cxd6 Nd5 16. gxf3 Nxc3

17. Bxh7+ Kh8 18. Bd3 Qg5+ 19. Kh1 Qh5 20. Be2 Nxe2 21. Qxe2 Rc2
{ White has to acquiesce to the perpetual sooner or later. For instance, if he tries to avoid it with Qd1, Black can execute it after ganging up on the Bishop. }
22. Qd1 Rfc8 23. e4
{ If White got Bc1-e3  (or f4)  in, Black might have some problems to solve. But here, he forces a perpetual immediately with Rxc1. }

Bd6
{ My recommendation is to play a standard Meran setup with the Bishop on d6. White's most challenging option is probably to transpose to the mainlines of the anti-Meran by playing Qc2 and a3, but he does have some extraneous tries that do need to be addressed. }
9. Bd2
{ This could be interesting. Probably the trickiest of White's alternatives to a3. White is planning to play Nc3-e4 with a gain of tempo, and then get b2-b4 in before Black can play c6-c5. In addition, the Bishop on d2 will prevent the our typical lever for counterplay with a7-a5. Still, if Black plays accurately, he should be fine. }
9... Bb7 10. Rc1 O-O 11. O-O Rc8
{ Black plans b5-b4 followed by c6-c5, and White is hard pressed to stop it. It is very important that he make this one last preparatory move before executing his plan. }
12. a3
{ White's best attempt is to provoke Black into playing a7-a5 and only then going e3-e4. Anything else would allow b5-b4 followed by a quick c6-c5. }
12... a5

13. e4 e5 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. Qe2
{ This position is a little dangerous for Black strategically because it is hard to activate the b7-Bishop. The Delayed Meran plan of Bb7-c8 is a non-starter with the Rook on c8, and the pawn having already been provoked to a5 thanks to White's good decision to play a2-a3 means that it is very hard to get c6-c5 through thanks to the hanging b5-pawn. Still, Black gets good counterplay if he knows the right maneuvre. }
16... Re8 17. Rfd1 Qd6
{ I think this is the easiest way for Black. He first provokes g3 to weaken the Kingside and then the Queen will sit perfectly on e6, influencing both sides of the board }
18. g3 Qe6
{ The point. e6 is the best square for the Queen, where it influences both the Kingside and the Queenside, eyeing both b3 and h3. Black should follow up with a quick h5-h4 to further loosen White's Kingside pawn cover, and he is certainly not worse in this double edged position. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5
{ Classically speaking, I believe this is White's most ambitious move. Black has played both e7-e6 and c7-c6, which disturbs the development of both his light-squared Bishop and the b8-Knight. The reason the line is strategically sound is that the threat of d5xc4 is very real, which encourages White to either play e2-e3 to box in his own Queen's Bishop  (as we see in the Meran)  or take on d5, which lets the c8-Bishop run free. By playing Bc1-g5, White is trying to call Black's bluff about taking on c4, and then develop with e2-e3 next, with perfect coordination. Historically, Black has mostly looked into the very sharp lines following d5xc4, either directly  (the Botvinnik Variation)  or after a preliminary h7-h6  (the Moscow Variation)  . But the third option, 5... Nbd7, has largely been frowned upon since it allows White to develop his c1-Bishop outside the pawn chain without losing the c4-pawn. However, I feel this is unjust, as we will soon see. }
5... Nbd7 6. cxd5
{ Taking on d5 now is a much more serious attempt to fight for an edge than it was on the previous move because now Black's Knight stands on d7. As such, he will not be able to get his Bishop to f5 before White gets his own Bishop to d3. As mentioned, if Black can take over the f5-b1 diagonal in the Carlsbad structures, he is nearly always fine, but in this position, he will be unable to do so, and has to look for another plan connected with grabbing the Bishop pair. The move is implicitly mentioned as the main recommendation in Larry Kaufman's 2012 repertoire with the implication that it will soon transpose to the standard Queen's Gambit Declined, but as we will see, this will not be the case, so anyone who follows that repertoire will not find it useful against what I am recommending. }
6... exd5
{ This transposes directly to a Carlsbad QGD where White has already committed the Knight to f3 }
7. e3
{ This is the only move White ever tries. His development scheme is simple- Bf1-d3, Qd1-c2, and O-O. If Black plays normally, he will likely end up slightly worse. But I want to change the character of the game completely. }
7... h6 { Black chases the Bishop. } 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Nh5
{ It is very important to note that chasing the Bishop in this manner only works because White has already taken on d5. Black has a clear plan for all of his pieces- take on g3, Bf8-g7, Nd7-b6, and most importantly, Bc8-e6. That last part is of the utmost importance. If the pawns on c4 and e6 were still present, Black would not be able to develop his Queen's Bishop. }
10. Bd3 Nxg3 11. hxg3 Bg7
{ A good rule of thumb for Black here is to castle whichever direction White castles in. Opposite side castling leads to more dynamic positions where the presence of weaknesses  (such as the slightly overextended h6+g5 pawn chain)  can really become a big deal, while same-side castling positions tend to be calmer and favor more long term assets, such as the Bishop pair. }
12. Qc2
{ In practice, almost all human games have continued with White choosing to castle Queenside. This is unsurprising, as castling short could walk into a quick h5-h4, but I actually believe going Kingside is the more challenging option that puts Black under the most pressure. White's best plan to break down Black's position is b4-b5, which obviously will be much harder to pull off if the King is sitting on c1. In addition, the open h-file might look nice, but it is entirely useless because as mentioned, Black will also castle long if White does, and the Bishop on g7 defending the pawn on h6 defending the pawn on g5 means the h-file will stay closed forever. }
12... Nb6 13. O-O-O Be6
{ As mentioned, Black castles the same side as White. Stockfish initially is excited about White's prospects, but quickly calms down. }
14. Kb1 Qe7 15. Na4 O-O-O 16. Rc1 Kb8
{ The last important move. Black is ready to tuck his Bishop away on c8 to keep his King totally secure, and will slowly but surely aim to open the Kingside with h5-h4. The machines call the position a tiny bit better for White, but I don't buy it at all. The Bishop pair may someday count, Black has a clear plan of action, and no major weaknesses. His results in human play have been excellent. }

8... Ne4
{ Black's last two moves, Qa5 and Bb4, clearly have been at least partially aimed at landing the Knight on e4. Since Rc1 does not control the square any further, it's not surprising Black can give this a try. White has to take the Knight one way or another, and then both a2 and g5 will hang. }

By starting with 10... f6, now if White plays 11. Bf4, we can change the plan and play 11... e5 instead. If White goes back to h4, as we see here, this idea works well as the Bishop ends up sidelined. }

The Knight really belongs on c3 in these structures because it prevents Black from giving him hanging pawns with d5xc4 followed by c6-c5 since White would then have the d5-advance available.

6. Qxc4 b5 7. Qd3 { Almost every game has gone this way. } 7... a6

8... c5 { Anyway ! } 9. Bxf6 gxf6
{ Black aims for active counterplay, truly in the style of the Semi-slav. He will play Bb7, Nbd7, Qc7, and castle long, putting a lot of pressure on White's center and making good use of the Bishop pair while keeping his King away from any weakness on the Kingside. }

{ This move does make some sense in that it saves the c4-pawn without having to lose time with the Queen or block the f1-Bishop with e2-e3, but it is not at all challenging. This is especially clear when we consider that in the repertoire, White can play the same position with the moves 5. Bg5 Nbd7 included, which is heavily in his favor. We will reach a Carlsbad Queen's Gambit structure where Black will play Bc8-f5 before White can get his Bishop to d3. Black is nearly always fine when he can do that. }

{ If White wants to avoid the mainlines after 5. e3 or 5. Bg5, this is his best option. In a classical sense, 5. g3 is an extremely ambitious move. White aims to transpose to a closed Catalan where Black has already played a sub-optimal c7-c6 move, and would stand slightly better if Black proceeds along with normal moves. But one of the biggest assets of the Semi-Slav is that the pawn on c6 supports a b7-b5 thrust, thus making it difficult for White to recapture the pawn on c4. This position is no exception. }
5... dxc4 { The most principled move. } 6. Bg2
{ Black's main move in this position is b7-b5, aiming to quickly develop with Bc8-b7 and hang onto the extra pawn. But I quite like the less common Nbd7. It has a lot of the same ideas, but it does not run into Nf3-e5. }
6... Nbd7 7. a4
{ This is the move that attempts to punish Black's move order. Had Black gone with b7-b5 first, this would not be possible anymore. But, as previously mentioned, that would allow White to play Nf3-e5. The point of a4 is clear- much like in the classical Slav, White wants to prevent b7-b5, eventually take the c4 pawn, and then claim an advantage with a big center. But also much like the classical Slav, Black can make use of the lost time and the weakened b4-square. }
7... Bb4 8. O-O O-O 9. Qc2 a5
{ Black overprotects the b4 square. The only way White can win the pawn back on c4 is to play the sad looking move Nc3-a2, which Black can always comfortably meet with Bb4-d6 and then e6-e5. He is clearly fine. }
10. Na2 Bd6 11. Qxc4 e5 12. Rd1 Qe7
{ Black has good counterplay in the center and will be able to play Re8, exd4, and Nc5. The Knight will be permanently secure due to the inclusion of a2-a4 and a7-a5 making b2-b4 impossible, and the Knight on a2 is not very intimidating. }

6... Nbd7 7. O-O
{ White's most ambitious course of action is to proceed with his development and not bother about the c4-pawn, but this allows Black to get b7-b5 in without allowing Nf3-e5. }
7... b5
{ Black plays with maximum ambition. He has prevented Nf3-e5 and got b7-b5 in. If the game proceeds normally, he will complete his development and be a clean pawn up in a matter of just a few moves. White absolutely must look for counterplay immediately. }
8. e4
{ This one is critical. Otherwise White is basically just a pawn down after Bb7 and completing development. Note that it is a better version for White than if he had played e2-e4 before castling because Black has not won a tempo with Bf8-b4. Still, I like Black's position. }
8... Bb7
{ Black has other moves, but I like this simple one the best. He has prevented d4-d5, and is ready to complete development with Bf8-e7 and O-O. White has to make a mess with e4-e5 right now, or else he will lose without much of a fight with a clean pawn down. }

16... Qe7
{ Black questions the stability of the g5-Knight and forces a concession of some kind before playing Kd8-c7. By getting the Queen off of e8, in some cases he can play Ra8-e8, overprotecting the e6 pawn and preparing to castle by hand. }
17. f4 Kc7 18. Bh3 Re8
{ Not the only good move, but the simplest one. Black is ready to tuck his King away on b8 in the event of Nxe6+ and his pieces coordinate extremely well. c6-c5 is on the way and White's position could fall apart very fast as his King will be vulnerable along the a8-h1 and a7-g1 diagonals. }

For a long time, this line was almost exclusively chosen by those who were begging for draws with White, perhaps even prearranging the game, and on the whole, was the favorite of emotionally weak people for whom the fear of losing was stronger than the ambitious drive of trying to win. Undoubtedly such cowards still exist, but recently, the Exchange Slav has found a revival among ambitious players who are actually fighting for an opening advantage and not insulting Caissa by trying to gain a couple rating points when they force a draw with White. Among others, Alexey Dreev has been a big proponent of this strategy, and has even written an interesting opening book based on playing the Exchange Slav with White and fighting for an edge. Regardless of which category of opponent you are facing, I think the same psychology from Black's point of view has to be followed. Black should first look to equalize, and not fear a boring position. Against those with poor nerves or people who want draws with White to gain rating, they will very likely end up in a very boring, very equal position that still has a lot of pieces on the board. Then, they will have to contend with the pressure that they were trying to avoid by choosing such a lame line in the first place, and will likely start making mistakes. Conversely, players who are actually trying to fight in the Exchange Slav will likely mix things up early and take some risks on their own accord without you having to do anything special. }
3... cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6
{ When following my repertoire, Black can be forced into this position if White wants it because he can start with 3. Nc3 and only play 4. cxd5 once Black has committed to Nf6, so the extra option of delaying Nf6 is irrelevant as White can avoid it. Luckily, Black is fine. }
5. Bf4 Nc6
{ Black should play Nf6, then Nc6, then a6 against more or less anything White tries. This way, he will be able to develop with Bf5 or Bg4 next without worrying about a check on b5 following Qb3 Na5, and he also maintains the option of developing the Bishop to g4 rather than the symmetrical f5 square. }

Black's plan if White does nothing is to castle and double on the c-file, which would leave him with a great position. White can  (and probably should)  try to abuse the weakened c5 square, but I think Black is still okay. }

{ Black has other moves that easily equalize as well, but I like this one for its simplicity. Black prepares for Bf8-b4 to immediately try to punish White for prematurely putting his Knight on c3. White really should play Nb5 here, pressuring the c7-pawn and fixing the misplaced Knight to some degree, but 4. e3 is almost as common. }
4. e3
{ This is the second most common move and recommended in Williams' course, but it is also extremely cooperative and White is already worse. }

5. Bd3 { Following along with Williams' proposed repertoire. } 5... c5

6. dxc5 { A sad necessity. } 6... Nbd7
{ The c5-pawn isn't going anywhere, and Black remains flexible. If White develops his Knight to f3, it will be worth it to shatter the Queenside pawn structure, but if he develops the Knight to e2, then Black can take with the Bishop on c5 to make sure he gets e6-e5 in. }
7. Ne2 a6
{ Black gains a critical tempo by threatening e5-e4 winning a piece. White has to burn a move on Bf4-g3, and this is not ideal for him because the Bishop can become exposed to Nh5. }
8. Bg3 { A sad necessity. } 8... Nh5
{ The c5 pawn is there to stay, but Black can grab the Bishop pair and get away with it. White now has to try to break in the center to avoid just being worse for nothing, but it doesn't work well for him. }

{ If Black is allowed to complete his development with Qb6, Nf6, and O-O  (or potentially even a Queenside castle)  , he will be much better thanks to his Bishop pair on an open board, particularly the dark squared one standing unopposed. White's best try is to protect both the f2 and b2 pawns by transferring the Knight to d3, but this is slow and not ideal either. }
12. Nf4 Qb6 13. Nd3 Bd4 14. Qd2
{ And Williams ends his line here, claiming equal chances. Although equality is not something we are unhappy with playing Black, I disagree with his assessment- I think White will have a difficult position very quickly if Black remembers the next two moves. }
14... Nf6 15. O-O-O e5

{ This is Sedlak's preferred move order in his 2016 book on the London with White. His point is that White wants to play Nb1-d2 next and to be ready to meet Qd8-b6 with Qd1-b3 in a way where Black cannot harass the Queen further with Bf5 once she is forced to c2. But, as far as I can tell, he only considers Qb6 immediately or after Nf6 here first, but not the move I believe is best. }
4... Bf5 { Black takes control of the c2-square. } 5. Qb3 Qd7 6. Nf3 e6
{ And here we see a key point of delaying developing the g8-Knight. Ne5 is no problem because the g8 Knight can come to c6, while if it stood on f6 already, this would be an issue. }
7. Bb5 f6
{ Why not ? Black takes e5 under control and will follow up with c5-c4 next, then Nge7 and a7-a6 to win the Bishop pair and start Queenside expansion with b7-b5. }

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4
{ Most London System practitioners choose this on the second move, since sometimes White wants to be doing things before developing the g1-Knight. In my opinion, Black actually should be following the same logic and delay the development of the g8-Knight all the same, and often he can meet Ng1-f3 with Ng8-f6. }
2... c5
{ This is probably the best move order for Black. He avoids any b4 business and can defend his stuff with e6 before going Nf6. In general, he should always remember- meet Bf4 with c5, at that moment, since it is also best on the third move after 2. Nf3 Nf6 have been included. }

White more or less has to take on d5 now since anything else will allow Black to execute his plan.   5...Nf6?!  6.e5  I don't trust this for Black.   5...d4?  6.Nb5±  Black is not ready for this yet, and should instead prepare the idea with Ne7 first. Massive problems on c7. Black is forced to play the extremely ugly Na6, and will soon lose his d4 pawn after Nf3. }
6. Bd3 Ng6 7. Bg3 d4 8. Nce2 Nc6
{ White is not in such horrible shape here compared to the other Knight moves, but I still think Black has the more comfortable game. He can continue with some combination of e6-e5, 0-0, Bc8-e6 etc and he has a bigger share of the center. White's position is unpleasant and lacks a plan, thanks in no small part to the bad Bishop on g3 and general lack of development and central control. }

The main reason to avoid Nf6 in the mainlines is that White can cause direct problems on the Queenside with a quick Qd1-b3, but that is contingent on White delaying developing his own King's Knight as well. So, once the g1-Knight moves, the g8-Knight follows. This is true on the second move, and tends to be the case throughout. }

Undoubtedly such cowards still exist, but recently, the Exchange Slav has found a revival among ambitious players who are actually fighting for an opening advantage and not insulting Caissa by trying to gain a couple rating points when they force a draw with White. Among others, Alexey Dreev has been a big proponent of this strategy, and has even written an interesting opening book based on playing the Exchange Slav with White and fighting for an edge. Regardless of which category of opponent you are facing, I think the same psychology from Black's point of view has to be followed. Black should first look to equalize, and not fear a boring position. Against those with poor nerves or people who want draws with White to gain rating, they will very likely end up in a very boring, very equal position that still has a lot of pieces on the board.

Against those with poor nerves or people who want draws with White to gain rating, they will very likely end up in a very boring, very equal position that still has a lot of pieces on the board. Then, they will have to contend with the pressure that they were trying to avoid by choosing such a lame line in the first place, and will likely start making mistakes. Conversely, players who are actually trying to fight in the Exchange Slav will likely mix things up early and take some risks on their own accord without you having to do anything special. }

Undoubtedly such cowards still exist, but recently, the Exchange Slav has found a revival among ambitious players who are actually fighting for an opening advantage and not insulting Caissa by trying to gain a couple rating points when they force a draw with White.

3... cxd5 4. Bg5

4... f6
{ Much like I recommend against 2. Bg5, I think Black can harass the bishop and fight for the e5 break. White should retreat the bishop to d2, as it can become exposed on f4 or h4. }
5. Bh4 Nh6
{ Black plays exactly the same as he would against the 2. Bg5 line. He is already a bit better with ...Nf5 on the way, and it's not clear what White should do about the h4-bishop. }

Among others, Alexey Dreev has been a big proponent of this strategy, and has even written an interesting opening book based on playing the Exchange Slav with White and fighting for an edge. Regardless of which category of opponent you are facing, I think the same psychology from Black's point of view has to be followed. Black should first look to equalize, and not fear a boring position. Against those with poor nerves or people who want draws with White to gain rating, they will very likely end up in a very boring, very equal position that still has a lot of pieces on the board. Then, they will have to contend with the pressure that they were trying to avoid by choosing such a lame line in the first place, and will likely start making mistakes. Conversely, players who are actually trying to fight in the Exchange Slav will likely mix things up early and take some risks on their own accord without you having to do anything special. }
3... cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6
{ When following my repertoire, Black can be forced into this position if White wants it because he can start with 3. Nc3 and only play 4. cxd5 once Black has committed to Nf6, so the extra option of delaying Nf6 is irrelevant as White can avoid it. Luckily, Black is fine. }
5. f3
{ This move escaped my attention at first, but it has a surprising number of games played, albeit not recent ones. White's play is very direct and he clearly wants to play e2-e4 next. Black should be careful not to get run over in the center, but with a couple good moves White's play is easily neutralized and I think Black is even for choice due to the weakened White Kingside. }
5... Qb6

{ Both b5 and e4 are hanging, and White does not have time to take the Knight. }
10. Qd3 a6 11. Ba4 Qa5
{ White cannot maintain the pin on the c6 Knight, so he does not win a piece after all, and he is falling dangerously behind on development. Black is much better. }

{ 10...Nd7  This was Magnus's choice in his game with So. It's not a bad move but I do think White ends up a little better, and I am hesitant to fall so far behind in development.  Black exchanges the dark-squared Bishops, which will help him break with e6-e5 further down the road once he has played Bf5-g4. A good rule of thumb for Black's f8-Bishop is that he will usually want to do the opposite of what White did with the f1-Bishop. If White exchanges on d3, you should go Bf8-e7, while if White plays Bf1-e2, usually you go for Bf8-d6. This tries to keep just a little imbalance in a very dry position. }
11. Bxd6 Qxd6
{ The position is still very dry, but at least one set of Bishops chose to do different things.

For a long time, this line was almost exclusively chosen by those who were begging for draws with White, perhaps even prearranging the game, and on the whole, was the favorite of emotionally weak people for whom the fear of losing was stronger than the ambitious drive of trying to win. Undoubtedly such cowards still exist, but recently, the Exchange Slav has found a revival among ambitious players who are actually fighting for an opening advantage and not insulting Caissa by trying to gain a couple rating points when they force a draw with White. Among others, Alexey Dreev has been a big proponent of this strategy, and has even written an interesting opening book based on playing the Exchange Slav with White and fighting for an edge. Regardless of which category of opponent you are facing, I think the same psychology from Black's point of view has to be followed. Black should first look to equalize, and not fear a boring position. Against those with poor nerves or people who want draws with White to gain rating, they will very likely end up in a very boring, very equal position that still has a lot of pieces on the board. Then, they will have to contend with the pressure that they were trying to avoid by choosing such a lame line in the first place, and will likely start making mistakes.

This way, he will be able to develop with Bf5 or Bg4 next without worrying about a check on b5 following Qb3 Na5, and he also maintains the option of developing the Bishop to g4 rather than the symmetrical f5 square. }

{ The dreaded exchange Slav. For a long time, this line was almost exclusively chosen by those who were begging for draws with White, perhaps even prearranging the game, and on the whole, was the favorite of emotionally weak people for whom the fear of losing was stronger than the ambitious drive of trying to win. Undoubtedly such cowards still exist, but recently, the Exchange Slav has found a revival among ambitious players who are actually fighting for an opening advantage and not insulting Caissa by trying to gain a couple rating points when they force a draw with White. Among others, Alexey Dreev has been a big proponent of this strategy, and has even written an interesting opening book based on playing the Exchange Slav with White and fighting for an edge. Regardless of which category of opponent you are facing, I think the same psychology from Black's point of view has to be followed. Black should first look to equalize, and not fear a boring position. Against those with poor nerves or people who want draws with White to gain rating, they will very likely end up in a very boring, very equal position that still has a lot of pieces on the board. Then, they will have to contend with the pressure that they were trying to avoid by choosing such a lame line in the first place, and will likely start making mistakes. Conversely, players who are actually trying to fight in the Exchange Slav will likely mix things up early and take some risks on their own accord without you having to do anything special. }
3... cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6
{ When following my repertoire, Black can be forced into this position if White wants it because he can start with 3. Nc3 and only play 4. cxd5 once Black has committed to Nf6, so the extra option of delaying Nf6 is irrelevant as White can avoid it. Luckily, Black is fine. }
5. Bf4 Nc6
{ Black should play Nf6, then Nc6, then a6 against more or less anything White tries. This way, he will be able to develop with Bf5 or Bg4 next without worrying about a check on b5 following Qb3 Na5, and he also maintains the option of developing the Bishop to g4 rather than the symmetrical f5 square. }
6. e3 a6 7. Bd3
{ Historically this has been White's most common choice, but it's inoffensive as Black gets his Bishop to the excellent g4 square. }
7... Bg4 8. Qb3 Na5
{ As always, Black is fine after Qb3 Na5 thanks to the inclusion of a7-a6. } *

11... Bxd3 12. Qxd3 e6
{ Black is on the more comfortable side of equality. White should probably castle long  (where else can the King hide ?)  but with an open c-file, this is not the safest proposal either. }
13. O-O-O Be7
{ As we will frequently see in the exchange Slav with a6, more often than not, Black should give his f8-Bishop the opposite treatment that White gives his f1-Bishop. Unsurprisingly, as a result here I think Be7 is better than Bd6. }
14. Kb1 Nd7
{ Black will follow up with Nd7-b6, Qd7, and O-O-O. He is certainly fine and can look for play on the Queenside in the future. Plus, White has to worry a bit about the h4-pawn hanging at any given moment. His King might end up looking a little tender on b8 due to the Bishop on f4, but it's hardly a real concern and just an illusion. White has one Bishop on f4 in semi-attacking position that can be neutralized with Be7-d6 on a moment's notice if needed. None of his other pieces are remotely close to pressuring the Black King should he castle long. }

White's best plan is b4-b5, but this clears the much superior c6 square for the b8-Knight. If you first play a6, Be7, and O-O, White will have to choose between playing b5 and allowing your Knight access to c6, or giving up on the plan completely since after Nbd7, once the Rook on a8 is protected, the b5 advance won't work anymore. }

If White ever plays h2-h4 to stop the assault, then Black can change gears and castle short, pointing out that with the Bishop on d6, White will not be able to execute his normal plan of f2-f3 followed by e3-e4 thanks to the weakness on g3.

As a result, White will be able to play the typical stonewall regrouping with O-O and Ne1-d3, and then perhaps Nf3-e5. Once this happens he will expel the active Knight on e4 by means of f2-f3, and I think White has every chance to fight for an advantage. The whole point of Black's play is to launch a Kingside attack, and this is very dependent on White being unable to plant a Knight on e5, which I believe he will manage to do here. }

{ This move is very popular at all levels, thanks in no small part to the efforts of Boris Avrukh, who recommended it in his original Grandmaster Repertoire book back in 2008, and doubled down on recommending it again when he released a revised second version in 2016. In general, I consider his 1. d4 repertoire books to be the gold standard of club level preparation, and it is the most challenging 1. d4 repertoire for Black players to face. I've even played this line a few times myself, essentially just copying the books. Luckily though, I was able to find a chapter where I could find a move order on that he did not consider seriously enough. This is a very conceptual line where move orders are extremely important. So, while there are no super long variations, it is critical to remember exactly when to play each move. }
5... Ne4
{ This is a very important idea, and a very important move order to execute it in. Black prepares to play a sort of stonewall, and often plays Bb4+ to provoke White into playing Nbd2. Avrukh analyzes this idea well, but only does so with a 5... Bb4+ move order, which is relevantly different, as we will see. In addition, it does set a couple nice traps. }
6. Nbd2
{ This move would be the most consistent one with Avrukh's plan   and in my opinion, more challenging than the more common  6.Bd3  hoping Black will play Bf8-b4 and transpose to his analysis. But the whole point of Bf8-b4 was to provoke White's Knight to d2, which he just went to voluntarily ! So it turns out to be unnecessary, and by going to d6 with the Bishop in one move, Black gains a nice tempo. }
6... Nd7 7. Bb2 f5 8. Be2 Bd6 9. O-O O-O
{ Avrukh covers this position with the Bishop on b4, at which point he recommends a2-a3 and meeting Bb4-d6 with b3-b4. But since we went to d6 in one move, Black is up a tempo. He can either use it to meet a2-a3 with a7-a5, slowing down the Queenside advance, or just proceed along with Kingside hostilities. }
10. Ne5

Given that White cannot get Nf3-e5 in, Black will be able to castle and start throwing Kingside pawns, with a dangerous attack in the style of the stonewall.   9...O-O ?  10.a3!  Bd6  11.Ne5!

Normally Black has to spend a lot of time and effort in the Carlsbad QGD to trade light squared Bishops, sometimes with Nd7-f8-e6-g7 to prepare Bc8-f5, or Bc8-g4-h5-g6. In this case, he got it much faster, earning access to the e4 square and trading off his worst piece. }

{ This is the move that attempts to punish Black's move order. Had Black gone with b7-b5 first, this would not be possible anymore.

The point of a4 is clear- much like in the classical Slav, White wants to prevent b7-b5, eventually take the c4 pawn, and then claim an advantage with a big center. But also much like the classical Slav, Black can make use of the lost time and the weakened b4-square. }

8... Bb7
{ Black has other moves, but I like this simple one the best. He has prevented d4-d5, and is ready to complete development with Bf8-e7 and O-O. White has to make a mess with e4-e5 right now, or else he will lose without much of a fight with a clean pawn down. }

17. h4 { This is the most human move } 17... Kc7 18. a4 Kb6
{ The position is very unclear. Stockfish insists on equality, but I prefer the Black side. His King has found safety on the Queenside, his Queenside pawn mass will easily win any endgame, and while neither the Black pieces nor the White Rooks look too great at the moment, I think the pieces have more potential. At the very least, I would think the position is easier to play for the second player. }

White obviously wishes to put the Bishop on b2, where it will help prevent the freeing e6-e5 advance, while retaining the option to capture back on c4 with the pawn. Play takes a completely different character from the mainlines because d5xc4 is no longer a sensible capture. White will take back with b3xc4, strengthening his central grip and not losing time to a subsequent b7-b5. Still, the move has its drawbacks. Since White is not immediately trying to take control of the whole center, Black has more time to develop his pieces normally. }

9. Bb2 Bb7 10. O-O Qe7
{ This seems like the easiest solution. Black puts his Queen on a nice centralized square and prevents e3-e4 from being comfortably achieved due to the availability of the f7-f5 tactic. A good rule of thumb for Black is to use his Rooks to follow White's. If White plays Rfd1 and Rac1, Black should play Rfd8 and Rac8. Similarly, if White goes for Rad1 and Rfe1  (which I believe is his best plan)  , Black should play Rad8 and Rfe8. }

A good rule of thumb for Black is to use his Rooks to follow White's. If White plays Rfd1 and Rac1, Black should play Rfd8 and Rac8. Similarly, if White goes for Rad1 and Rfe1  (which I believe is his best plan)  , Black should play Rad8 and Rfe8. }
11. Rfd1 Rfd8 12. Rac1 Rac8
{ Black has no issues and can look forward to playing a long maneuvering game, ideal for outplaying an opponent with the Black pieces. His next course of action should probably be Nd7-f8-g6, and at some point he may consider advancing c6-c5. Meanwhile, White doesn't have much of a plan to do anything since e3-e4 only makes sense with the Rooks on d1 and e1. }

13... c5
{ Normally I am very hesitant to accept hanging pawns, but under the circumstances, I think it is the best choice. White is ready to expand with e3-e4 soon, and Black gets a fantastic version of the hanging pawns position, for 2 reasons. First, all the minor pieces are still on the board, and second, Whites Rooks are now misplaced. They would much prefer to be on d1 and c1! So, In order to 'force' Black into the hanging pawns position, White needed to put his Rooks on d1 and e1 to threaten e4, but now that he got the hanging pawns, they are not coordinating well.   13...e5?!  14.dxe5!  A prudent move that gives White a small edge.   14.cxd5  This move, which the computers initially recommend, is met with a beautiful refutation:  14...e4!  15.dxc6  Otherwise Black takes back cxd5 with a fantastic position.  exf3  16.cxb7  Bxh2!  17.Kxh2  Qd6  18.Kh3  And now a move from outer space...  Re5!!  19.dxe5  The threat of Re5-h5 is decisive, and the Rook is immune.  19...Qe6  20.Kh2  Qxe5  21.g3  Qh5  22.Kg1  Ng4  White is mated. But he can avoid such a fate if he knows to take on e5 instead of d5.  14...Nxe5  15.Nxe5  Bxe5  16.cxd5  cxd5  17.Nb5+=  I reached this position in a blitz game against Ding Liren in the Speed Chess Championship. I held a draw, but the position is a little uncomfortable thanks to the isolated d-pawn and passive b7-Bishop. }
14. cxd5 exd5 15. dxc5 bxc5
{ The evaluation of this position is critical for the line, as it is one of White's most challenging tries. I think Black is okay and can hope to launch a Kingside attack while always checking to see if the d5-d4 break will work, but future tests will be needed to see if this is correct or not. Stockfish does share my point of view and evaluates the position as equal. }

{ Black is fine. He can look to take on d4 next, forcing White to recapture with the pawn due to the weakness on h2, and then Nd7-f6 and the typical regrouping Ra8-d8 and Bb7-c8, or instead of taking on d4, he can play Nd7-f6 to threaten the e4-Bishop. He is certainly not worse and has multiple plans to choose from in the future. }

With no major threats and only some pawns for the piece, I think there is no reason to fear for the King's safety with such dangerous attacking pieces as the c1-Bishop and a1-Rook. }

{ Despite the position looking very similar to that after Bc4-e2, the position is remarkably different. It is similar in that Black wants the same c6-c5 break while White should look for e3-e4, but once e3-e4 happens and Black responds with e6-e5, White's plan changes. He will generally take twice on e5 and play h3 to overprotect the g4 square, and then follow up with Bc1-e3 and eventually f2-f4. This is helped a lot by the Bishop on d3, which supports the potentially vulnerable e4-pawn after the inevitable Rf8-e8. By contrast, the previously most dangerous plans of taking dxe5 and then aiming to follow up with Nf3-d4 or Nf3-h4 are now totally senseless due to the hanging Bishop on d3. In addition, White can often play Nf3-g5 with a gain of tempo due to the hanging pawn on h7 in order to get to e4 quickly to try to stop the c6-c5 break. This would not work with the Bishop on e2 as h7 would not be hanging. As such, despite the very minor change to the position, play takes on a very different flavor. }

But it's much less nerve wracking to play with an open king when you have a machine helping you! Despite the computer's enthusiasm, I don't think this is a very likely line to be seen, as anyone who digs this deep into obscure machine theory is likely to be a strong enough player to know when not to trust them.

{ A position like this one is pretty typical for the line. White is a pawn up, but the loosened position around his king will always be a problem. Black has a very easy plan of Rfe8 and e5 to follow, opening up White's king. And White... well, he has an extra pawn on c3 that clearly poses no danger in the near future, and he will have to spend the next 20 moves defending with no counterplay, just hoping to keep his king alive and that eventually enough pieces will trade that the pawn on c3 will have some utility, as here it is doing precisely nothing. While the engines give a small plus for White, in all of the engine vs. engine games White almost never wins. This suggests the edge is not much objectively, and for a person it feels much easier for Black to play. I find it unsurprising that this line hasn't been picked up in human play. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5
{ Classically speaking, I believe this is White's most ambitious move. Black has played both e7-e6 and c7-c6, which disturbs the development of both his light-squared Bishop and the b8-Knight. The reason the line is strategically sound is that the threat of d5xc4 is very real, which encourages White to either play e2-e3 to box in his own Queen's Bishop  (as we see in the Meran)  or take on d5, which lets the c8-Bishop run free. By playing Bc1-g5, White is trying to call Black's bluff about taking on c4, and then develop with e2-e3 next, with perfect coordination. Historically, Black has mostly looked into the very sharp lines following d5xc4, either directly  (the Botvinnik Variation)  or after a preliminary h7-h6  (the Moscow Variation)  . But the third option, 5... Nbd7, has largely been frowned upon since it allows White to develop his c1-Bishop outside the pawn chain without losing the c4-pawn. However, I feel this is unjust, as we will soon see. }
5... Nbd7 6. cxd5
{ Taking on d5 now is a much more serious attempt to fight for an edge than it was on the previous move because now Black's Knight stands on d7. As such, he will not be able to get his Bishop to f5 before White gets his own Bishop to d3. As mentioned, if Black can take over the f5-b1 diagonal in the Carlsbad structures, he is nearly always fine, but in this position, he will be unable to do so, and has to look for another plan connected with grabbing the Bishop pair. The move is implicitly mentioned as the main recommendation in Larry Kaufman's 2012 repertoire with the implication that it will soon transpose to the standard Queen's Gambit Declined, but as we will see, this will not be the case, so anyone who follows that repertoire will not find it useful against what I am recommending. }
6... exd5
{ This transposes directly to a Carlsbad QGD where White has already committed the Knight to f3 }
7. e3
{ This is the only move White ever tries. His development scheme is simple- Bf1-d3, Qd1-c2, and O-O. If Black plays normally, he will likely end up slightly worse. But I want to change the character of the game completely. }
7... h6 { Black chases the Bishop. } 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Nh5
{ It is very important to note that chasing the Bishop in this manner only works because White has already taken on d5. Black has a clear plan for all of his pieces- take on g3, Bf8-g7, Nd7-b6, and most importantly, Bc8-e6. That last part is of the utmost importance. If the pawns on c4 and e6 were still present, Black would not be able to develop his Queen's Bishop. }
10. Bd3 Nxg3 11. hxg3 Bg7
{ A good rule of thumb for Black here is to castle whichever direction White castles in. Opposite side castling leads to more dynamic positions where the presence of weaknesses  (such as the slightly overextended h6+g5 pawn chain)  can really become a big deal, while same-side castling positions tend to be calmer and favor more long term assets, such as the Bishop pair. }
12. O-O
{ I actually think the best try is to castle short. Black now should also castle short because if he leaves the King in the center, the e3-e4 break could really hurt. }
12... Nb6

The reason the line is strategically sound is that the threat of d5xc4 is very real, which encourages White to either play e2-e3 to box in his own Queen's Bishop  (as we see in the Meran)  or take on d5, which lets the c8-Bishop run free. By playing Bc1-g5, White is trying to call Black's bluff about taking on c4, and then develop with e2-e3 next, with perfect coordination. Historically, Black has mostly looked into the very sharp lines following d5xc4, either directly  (the Botvinnik Variation)  or after a preliminary h7-g6  (the Moscow Variation)  . But the third option, 5... Nbd7, has largely been frowned upon since it allows White to develop his c1-Bishop outside the pawn chain without losing the c4-pawn.

As mentioned, if Black can take over the f5-b1 diagonal in the Carlsbad structures, he is nearly always fine, but in this position, he will be unable to do so, and has to look for another plan connected with grabbing the Bishop pair.

{ In practice, almost all human games have continued with White choosing to castle Queenside. This is unsurprising, as castling short could walk into a quick h5-h4, but I actually believe going Kingside is the more challenging option that puts Black under the most pressure. White's best plan to break down Black's position is b4-b5, which obviously will be much harder to pull off if the King is sitting on c1. In addition, the open h-file might look nice, but it is entirely useless because as mentioned, Black will also castle long if White does, and the Bishop on g7 defending the pawn on h6 defending the pawn on g5 means the h-file will stay closed forever. }

The machines call the position a tiny bit better for White, but I don't buy it at all. The Bishop pair may someday count, Black has a clear plan of action, and no major weaknesses. His results in human play have been excellent. }

{ White can grab the only open file now since the d8 square is under his control, but his fractured queenside pawn structure still leaves weaknesses to attack and plenty of room for counterplay. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3
{ Of course the most principled move for White is to complete his development in a harmonious fashion without capturing on d5. If given a move or two to go Bf1-d3 and O-O, he should be slightly but steadily better, and can claim the advantage based on Black's e6 and c6 restricting his light squared Bishop without him having taken his chance to grab the c4-pawn and enter the Moscow or the Botvinnik. But, Black has a strong move which provokes an immediate confrontation. }
6... Qa5
{ A very important move. Black immediately threatens Nf6-e4, and White cannot deal with this threat while still maintaining a position that resembles a standard Queen's Gambit. }
7. cxd5 { This is the most common and most challenging try. } 7... Nxd5
{ Black changes the pawn structure and is ganging up on the c3-Knight. } 8. Rc1
{ This trendy new move is the more modern treatment of the line, as well as the recommendation of Kamil Plichta in his 1. d4 repertoire series here on Chessable. Undoubtedly it is a serious move, but I think it can be easily met by the same plan I am proposing against 8. Qd2. }
8... Nxc3 9. bxc3 Ba3
{ Again, Black eschews the pawn. He looks worse since he has less space, but this does not tell the whole story. His next moves will be b7-b6 and Bc8-a6, first trading off a set of pieces  (notably, his bad Bishop)  , and then he will break down the space advantage with c6-c5 or e7-e5 later. }
10. Rc2 b6
{ Black should do this now to guarantee the exchange of Bishops. If he castles first White will have the time to get c4 in }
11. Be2
{ Following Carlsen-Mamedyarov. I think we would rather be taking this Bishop back with the Queen on e2 because we want a Rook on d1 prepared to potentially take along the d-file. }
11... Ba6 12. O-O Bxe2 13. Qxe2 O-O 14. Rd1
{ This is White's other attempt to prevent c6-c5, by making sure d4-d5 is available in response. }
14... Rfe8
{ Multi-purpose move. Black frees the f8 square for the Bishop, potentially supports the e5 break, and anticipates the opening of the e-file if c5 d5 comes. }
15. e4
{ Most challenging. White's idea is to play e5 and then c4, and if Black plays c5, then after d5 the a3 Bishop is shut out. }
15... Bf8
{ Black can follow up with either c5 or e5 next  (probably c5)  , with a fine position. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3
{ Of course the most principled move for White is to complete his development in a harmonious fashion without capturing on d5. If given a move or two to go Bf1-d3 and O-O, he should be slightly but steadily better, and can claim the advantage based on Black's e6 and c6 restricting his light squared Bishop without him having taken his chance to grab the c4-pawn and enter the Moscow or the Botvinnik. But, Black has a strong move which provokes an immediate confrontation. }
6... Qa5
{ A very important move. Black immediately threatens Nf6-e4, and White cannot deal with this threat while still maintaining a position that resembles a standard Queen's Gambit. }
7. cxd5 { This is the most common and most challenging try. } 7... Nxd5
{ Black changes the pawn structure and is ganging up on the c3-Knight. } 8. Qd2
{ This has historically been the main move, and a very decent one, but I think Black is fine with similar play to 8. Rc1. Lars Schandorff recommends this in his 2012 repertoire series with Quality Chess, but does not consider my preferred 9th move. As such, followers of his repertoire will be on their own more or less immediately. }
8... Bb4 9. Rc1
{ At this moment, White is ready for a2-a3 next, when Black will probably have to go Bb4xc3 and take on a3, aiming to grab a pawn and hold on for dear life. I do not like playing this way and I think Black should pre-empt White's plan. }
9... Nxc3
{ Much like I want against 8. Rc1, I think Black should alter the pawn structure again here. White got the move Qd1-d2 for free, but I am not at all convinced that the Queen is better on d2 than d1. For example, in many of the mainlines, Black goes Bc8-a6, White puts his own Bishop on either d3 or e2, and then takes back with the Queen. In either case, White's Queen ends up on the same square, regardless of whether she starts on d1 or d2. }
10. bxc3 Ba3 11. Rb1
{ This is the main appeal of having the Queen on d2 instead of d1- the Rook can come to b1 without having to fear the loss of the c3-pawn. But how useful is it ? Black's whole plan was b7-b6 anyway, which now conveniently blunts the Rook. }
11... b6
{ It is very important that Black goes b6 and Ba6 before he castles. This way, White will not have time to get c3-c4 in. }
12. Be2 Ba6 13. O-O Bxe2
{ Black needs to take right away before White can avoid the Bishop exchange with c3-c4. }
14. Qxe2 O-O
{ Black's position is very solid. He has an extremely straightforward plan of Rfe8, Ba3-f8, and then either e7-e5 or c6-c5 to break down White's central control. I think he is completely fine. }
15. Bf4
{ This was Stockfish's choice at a high depth. It makes sense, getting the Bishop off of the hanging square and preventing the e6-e5 break. Still with some human play I was easily able to disarm it. Black does not get greedy and take on c3, he just proceeds along with the prescribed plan. }
15... Rfe8 16. c4 Bf8 17. Qc2 c5
{ Now and only now. With the Bishop tucked safely away on f8, Black has good counterplay in the center. }
18. d5
{ I think the only way White can try to challenge Black is to avoid the hanging pawns, but with the Bishop on f8, this advance is nothing to worry about. }
18... exd5 19. cxd5 Nf6
{ A typical idea. Black's Bishop on f8 is a massive improvement over its placement on e3. Not only does it secure the Kingside against a direct assault, it also puts pressure on the d6 square, which White will likely have to push his d-pawn to since he cannot get e3-e4 in. }

{ Black develops another piece with a gain of tempo, pressuring the c3-Knight. He has not necessarily given up on the idea of taking on c4 to force White to give up with Bishop pair, but wants to develop his pieces first. }
8. Rc1
{ White's main move by far is Qd1-c2, but I think this is a stronger choice. Black's plan generally consists of d5xc4 and then getting c5 through, and the Rook on c1 is a much better prophylactic piece than the Queen would be. }
8... Ne4
{ Black's last two moves, Qa5 and Bb4, clearly have been at least partially aimed at landing the Knight on e4. Since Rc1 does not control the square any further, it's not surprising Black can give this a try. White has to take the Knight one way or another, and then both a2 and g5 will hang. }

This is exactly the kind of position that shows why White was premature in pushing e4-e5. Had his pawn been on e4, or even off the board entirely, he would have an incredibly straightforward attack with something like Nf3-e5 with f2-f4, Qe2-h5, etc on the way. Black would be crushed. But this pawn on e5 ruins White's chainces. }

My original and main recommendation is   5...Nbd7  here, reaching the Cambridge Springs and denying White the kind of wild position he is likely seeking when he chooses to place his bishop on g5. But this is not always the most satisfying way to play, and it's nice to have an additional option to enter the chaos. }

{ The knight on d3 is fantastic, and Black's pieces are all very active. Stockfish claims every move is a draw and I'm sure that's what should come unless someone does something really dumb, but I'd probably feel a bit more comfortable on the Black side of this position. His next move will probably be Rd5-f5 to harass the bishop on f4 and scoop up the f6-pawn, and he can always look for checks on b6 to take on b4 or centralize the queen on d4. }

{ When I first wrote the Semi-Slav course, I had no idea how successful it would become. As a way of expressing my gratitude, I've decided to include an update on the Botvinnik variation.   My original and main recommendation is   5...Nbd7  here, reaching the Cambridge Springs and denying White the kind of wild position he is likely seeking when he chooses to place his bishop on g5. But this is not always the most satisfying way to play, and it's nice to have an additional option to enter the chaos. }
5... dxc4
{ Black grabs the c4-pawn, and is ready to hang onto it with b7-b5 next, thanks to advancing c7-c6 on the previous move. If White does not do something really direct, he will just remain a pawn down, so he is forced to enter the chaos.   5...Nbd7  would just transpose to Cambridge Springs. }
6. e4
{ This is the most critical move by far.   6.g3  b5  transposes to a bad version of the 5. g3 lines for White. Bc1-g5 is totally out of place and Black already looks better to me. }
6... b5
{ Now, White really should go for e4-e5, forcing a huge mess. If Black is allowed to break the pin and complete development, he should remain a pawn up. }
7. e5
{ This is surely the most critical move.   7.Be2  Be7  Black's position plays itself. He should easily complete his development and preserve his extra pawn. }
7... h6 8. Bh4
{ 8.Bxf6!?  I would be very surprised to see anyone play this  8...gxf6  Black looks better to me. He is still a pawn up, can easily fianchetto both bishops, and I don't see any real hope for counterplay. }
8... g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5 10. Bxg5
{ This is Black's major juncture in the Botvinnik, with Nb8-d7 being the main move, but Bf8-e7 being reasonable as well. I chose the latter the last time I faced 5.Bg5 and won a nice game against Melkumyan, but I'm not totally convinced by those positions and ultimately decided to stick with the mainline. }
10... Nbd7 { Now, the next several moves nearly always follow the same path. }
11. exf6

13. d5 Qb6 14. Bg2 O-O-O 15. O-O b4 16. dxe6
{ This rare move is actually quite dangerous if Black is unprepared, but otherwise it should not be a big deal. }
16... Bxg2 17. e7 Bxf1 18. Nd5 Qb7 19. Kxf1 Re8
{ White is an entire rook down, and if he takes on e7, he opens the e-file. The machine claims he is done for. The game could continue   20.exf8=Q  Nxf8!  The rooks are good where they are and the knight reroutes to a better home.  21.Ne7+  Kb8  White should be careful not to allow a check on h1, but after  22.Kg1  Ne6!  The twin threats of Ne6xf4 and Rh8xh2 are decisive. }
