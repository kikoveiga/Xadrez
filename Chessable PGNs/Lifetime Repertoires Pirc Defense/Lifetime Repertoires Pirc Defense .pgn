{ Hello and Welcome to Lifetime Repertoires: The Pirc Defence!  This course provides a complete repertoire for Black, based on the Pirc Defence @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  d6  2.d4  Nf6  3.Nc3  g6  We include White's possible deviations on move 2 and 3, making it a comprehensive Repertoire against @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4   Let's talk about the nature and history of the Pirc Defence for a moment.  The Pirc Defence is not a 'Classical' Opening. What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  While most of the mentioned values are present in the Pirc, one crucial point is neglected: controlling the centre with pawns. Black is happily allowing White to occupy the centre with the perfect pawn duo e4 & d4, which quickly can be supplemented with an additional pawn on f4 if White wishes to do so. Giving the opponent that much leeway in the centre was frowned upon and even believed to be a foolish endeavour for a long time.  In the 1920s, when openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Gr√ºnfeld already had acquired some credibility, answering @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  with  1...d6  or  1...g6  was considered a mistake. In his classic book about the New York Tournament 1924, Alekhine called ... g6 a joke opening and attached a question mark to the move. At the time, these ...d6/...g6 Defences to e4 were usually called Old Indian.  About two decades later, after the Second World War, this setup was adopted by two players. The first one was GM Vasja Pirc, a multiple champion of Yugoslavia, the second one was Anatoli Ufimzew, a strong Soviet master. Ufimzew never was allowed to play outside of the Soviet Union - he surely would have earned the GM title otherwise. These two players, completely independent from one another, analyzed and played the opening frequently. Nowadays, the name 'Pirc Defence' is commonly accepted for the subject of our course, the sequence @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  d6  2.d4  Nf6  3.Nc3  g6  . In the past, the name 'Pirc-Ufimtsev Defence' or even just 'Ufimzev Defence' was also frequently used. We decided to use 'Pirc Defence', as this name is by far the commonly accepted one.  Pirc and Ufimtsev introduced and refined the opening, which quickly gained momentum in the 1950s and 1960s. Legendary players and World Champions like Smyslov, Botvinnik, and Bobby Fischer played the Pirc, in Fischer's case even in the World Championship Match against Spassky. In modern times, the Pirc has attracted ambitious players like Svidler, Mamedyarov, and Morozevich. Many strong players use it as an occasional weapon to fight for a win, including World Champion Magnus Carlsen.  So, what are some key concepts of the Pirc?  - Black does not immediately place a pawn in the centre but prefers to attack White's pawn centre later. Black has many ways to do that, for example, with ...e7-e5 or ...c7-c5. Black might even wait with such a strike even longer and first expand on the queenside with ...b5. Black has many options and possible pawn structures to choose from.  - Black's play may provoke White to be overly aggressive, which can lead to overextension. White's space advantage can backfire, in particular, if White has advanced pawns around their King  - The struggle between White's centre and Black trying to fight it can often lead to very concrete, tactical play. Black needs to play actively. Otherwise, White's space might be a decisive factor. We have selected lines that go for sharp counterplay and pose problems for our opponent. Passive play is a recipe for disaster in the Pirc.  - The Pirc is less explored compared to more frequently played main lines. It is possible to find new ideas early on, which is more difficult in mainstream openings.  - On the non-professional level, White often has no preparation against the Pirc. White players usually focus on the most popular moves 1...e5, 1...c5, 1...c6 and 1...e6 but neglect other openings. Against the Pirc, White has no widely known 'spoilsport' option. There is no 'Exchange Variation' or a System like the Alapin in the Sicilian, making the Pirc an excellent practical weapon to play for a win. The drawing percentage in the Pirc is low.  - Move orders can be tricky to master for both sides. We have selected lines that share common ideas, like an early ...a6 and ...Nc6. This reduces the danger of accidentally entering a line that you have not prepared.  Before we talk about the contents of the repertoire, we'd like to discuss the concept of a Lifetime Repertoire for a moment. When Christof wrote the introduction for Lifetime Repertoires: 1.c4/1.Nf3 he compiled a list of five criteria that served as a guideline. We want to base our criteria on these points but need to modify them slightly, given that we are talking about a repertoire for the black pieces in a sharp and ambitious opening.  Here are the criteria for the Pirc Defence.  1. It must be fundamentally sound.  2. Should be based on well-tested lines and profound new ideas.  3. Allows some flexibility and modifiability for the future.  4. Usable for a wide range of playing levels.  5. Sets complex practical problems to unbalance the game and fight for a win with Black. This means there is risk involved, and 'unclear' positions must be embraced and not avoided.  The last point in this list already indicates that we don't play the Pirc to simplify the game and draw. Often we choose ambitious moves that pour more oil into the fire, aiming to unbalance the game. Whenever possible, we selected lines that lead to complications and exciting positions.  This also means that not every line will end in a 0.00 evaluation or an advantage for Black. It is acceptable if White has a slight edge in computer evaluations, as long as it is difficult for White to play and Black has chances.  Now, let's have a look at the essential variations to get you started with the Pirc! }

{  } 1. e4 d6
{ This is the starting move of the Pirc Defence. We open the c8-h3 diagonal for our light-squared Bishop, but this is not the primary purpose of that move.   By playing  1...d6  we stop White from pushing e4-e5 for the time being. We plan to develop our Kingside by fianchettoing the dark-squared Bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7. The Knight usually jumps to f6, and we are ready to castle Kingside quickly. }
2. d4
{ White occupies the centre with the perfect pawn duo on e4 and d4, a very natural move. }
2... Nf6
{ The Knight immediately attacks the e4-pawn.

After  2...Nf6  White's overwhelming main move is  3.Nc3  , but in the Quickstarter we'll also have a look at  3.Bd3  and  3.f3 }
3. Nc3 g6
{ After  3...g6  we have reached the starting position of the Pirc Defence. }
4. f4
{ This is the starting move of the Austrian Attack. White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later. The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.   The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent.   With  4.f4  , White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away. The game's direction is not as apparent against after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular branch is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This branch is examined in three chapters.  B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A above, White may also play @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  which hints at a possible Queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.  C.

D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the Intro chapter to the Austrianhere.  One crucial point: at various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn and play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise. In slower lines, like the Classical Variation @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Be2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.g3  Black can get away with knowing only some concrete lines and ideas. If you try to fight the Austrian Attack with vague ideas, you might just get destroyed. The upside is: if you know what to do, you'll be fine.  In the Quickstarter, we'll focus on the most important lines that you'll encounter in your games or that demand a precise response that you should know. }
4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  White may deviate from these main lines on move 5 with ideas like  5.Bd3  or  5.a3  , but these options are not so relevant in the context of this Quickstarter Guide. They have their points but are not immediately threatening to blow you out of the water, as the general concept of ...Nc6 and ...e5 is the same as in the main lines after  5.Nf3  .  We'll have a look at  5.e5  , though. This move requires a precise response, otherwise Black is in trouble. }
5. e5
{ Early e4-e5 advances are common in the Pirc. Objectively speaking, we don't need to be afraid of White's rather premature attack.   White has only developed a single piece so far and his King is still in the centre. White's attack might easily backfire, but it requires precise play by Black. }
5... Nfd7
{ We like this move the most. Note that after  5...dxe5  6.dxe5!?  is an interesting move for White. After the Queen trade White gets the easier game and chances for slight advantage.   The Knight retreat to d7 is far more aggressive, planning to tear down White's centre with ...c5 quickly. White's most common move after  5...Nfd7!  is  6.Nf3  but we'll also briefly check the rare move  6.Bc4  which leads to interesting complications.  White also has  6.e6  but after  6...fxe6  7.Nf3  c5  we transpose to @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppnppbp/3p2p1/4P3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Nf3  c5  7.e6  fxe6 }
6. Nf3
{ This looks natural and is played almost exclusively in this position. } 6...
c5
{ We crack White's centre immediately. Every tempo counts, therefore we don't wait with this principled move. After  6...O-O  we would transpose to the line @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.e5  Nfd7  which is not part of our repertoire. We prefer  6...dxe5!  in this line, as we will examinehere in the dedicated chapter.   Now White has some options. The most popular move is  7.exd6  , but you'll certainly meet some others, in particular in faster time control games. }
7. exd6 { This has been played most of the time here by White. } 7... O-O
{ We think it's the best continuation to bring our King to a safer position. This is confirmed by the results, with Black scoring above 50% in Megabase 2021. }
8. Be3
{ The usual response by White. He supports the d4-pawn and prepares to castle long. Instead,  8.dxe7+?  is too greedy. Black has excellent play for the pawn, for example after  8...Qxe7+  9.Qe2  Qxe2+  10.Nxe2  Re8  . The lead in development is one thing, but the weaknesses caused by f4 amplify White's problems. }
8... exd6
{ We have regained the pawn and our Bishop enjoys an excellent diagonal. } 9.
Qd2 { White hurries to bring his King to a safer place. } 9... Nc6
{ We increase the pressure on d4. } 10. O-O-O Qa5
{ The last few moves were logical. Now White has a wide choice of how to develop further. We think Black is fine in any case, usually organizing with ...Nf6 and ...Bf5 next. }
11. a3
{ White avoids a possible ...Nb4 move and gets rid of the potential threat of us to take the a2-pawn with our Queen once the c3-Knight moves.  White has also tried the move  11.Kb1  which is answered in the same way as  11.a3  . Our setup with ...Nf6 and ...Bf5 works well in both cases. }
11... Nf6
{ We free the way of our light-squared Bishop. At the same time, our f6-Knight takes an eye on the light central squares e4 and d5.   We also threaten to jump to g4 in some cases. }
12. h3 { White takes control over g4. } 12... Bf5
{ Completing the development and the setup mentioned earlier. We like Black's position and like to point out an interesting idea worth knowing after White's next move. }
13. Bd3 b5
{ That's the point! This pawn-push initiates fun complications. After  14.Nxb5  Nb4!  15.Nxd6  Bxd3  16.cxd3  Nfd5!  Black has excellent play and a dangerous initiative. }

4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  White may deviate from these main lines on move 5 with ideas like  5.Bd3  or  5.a3  , but these options are not so relevant in the context of this Quickstarter Guide. They have their points but are not immediately threatening to blow you out of the water, as the general concept of ...Nc6 and ...e5 is the same as in the main lines after  5.Nf3  .  We'll have a look at  5.e5  , though. This move requires a precise response, otherwise Black is in trouble. }
5. Nf3
{ White speeds up the Kingside development, which is the main move by a mile. }
5... O-O 6. Be3
{ In this line, we deal with an important deviation from the mainline  6.Bd3  . White plays  6.Be3  which develops the dark-squared Bishop first. The move has got several advantages:  1 White strengthens his control over the d4 square.  2 White is just two moves away from castling Queenside  3 White makes it more difficult for Black to push ...c5.  But there must be some disadvantage, as otherwise, the whole world would prefer to play Be3 right? On the downside, there is:  1 White's e4-square is not supported by Bd3. In some variations, we might try to exploit this weakness.  2 White is not able to castle Kingside on the next move. Black's King is already in safety, whereas White's King does not feel comfortable in the centre of the board.  3 The e3-Bishop is quite vulnerable at the moment. It's unprotected, and we can attack it by playing ...Ng4 under the right circumstances.  Let's think about our strategic options. Aiming for the ...e5-break is quite difficult. The immediate  6...e5  leads to an advantage for White after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.fxe5  Ng4  10.Bg5  .   Preparing the e5-push with  6...Nc6  is also not that attractive. Our c6-Knight attacks e5 and d4, but both squares are firmly under White's control. He might try to punish us immediately by playing  7.e5  . In the resulting position, we lack the ...c5-break because our Knight on c6 is blocking the c-pawn.  OK, let's forget about playing e7-e5 for the time being. We have another option! }
6... b6
{ We go for the ...c5-pawn push, instead of the ...e5-break. The immediate  6...c5  fails, so we need to invest a tempo in preparing the move.  Furthermore, we can put more pressure on e4, a pawn that is quite vulnerable at the moment, by playing ...Bb7 next. After  6...b6  we will frequently meet a particular pawn formation. Often White will play e4-e5 while we push c7-c5. This formation is called 'Diamond formation' due to all pawns between the a-file and e-file being on dark squares.  It indeed looks like a crystal or even a diamond. Creative names like that are fun and even help to visualize and memorize ideas. }
7. Qd2 { White prepares Queenside castling. } 7... Bb7
{ We develop our Bishop and attack e4 a second time. It is a very natural move that looks fine to us, but  7...c5  is an alternative that has been tested, as well. }
8. e5
{ The main move. White's e4-pawn is under fire, and he pushes it forward. }
8... Ng4
{ We could play  8...dxe5  but keeping the tension and playing ...c5 first looks more attractive. We aim for the so-called 'Diamond formation', as discussed earlier in this variation. }
9. O-O-O { Likely the best way for White to try to fight for an advantage. }
9... c5
{ Again we reach the 'Diamond formation'. This time we are even prepared to sacrifice a pawn for active piece play. }
10. dxc5
{ Played almost exclusively by White in this position. Grabbing the pawn is the most principled decision, for sure.  In the dedicated chapterhere, we also analyze  10.d5  in some detail. It leads to fun complications, but the line is too rare to be included in the Quickstarter. }
10... bxc5 11. Bxc5 { White grabs the pawn. } 11... Qa5
{ We regard this as the best move in the position. The alternatives are  11...Qc7  or  11...Nd7  , but we like to focus on our Queenside counterplay and want to involve the Queen quickly. }
12. Ba3 dxe5 13. Nd5
{ White wants to simplify the position and offers a Queen's trade. A fun trick to keep in mind is  13.h3  Bh6!  which is very annoying for White. }
13... Qxd2+
{ It does not make a difference if you take on d5 with the Queen. It's just a transposition of moves. On d2, we can shout 'check!' ...at least in online play, there is no arbiter to punish us for it! }
14. Rxd2 Bxd5 15. Rxd5 { The last moves were more or less forced. } 15... Ne3
{ We keep White busy, forking White's Rook and the f1-Bishop. } 16. Rd2
{ This position has been on the board several times, even at the highest level. Two top GMs, Kasimdzhanov and Svidler, drew their game in a FIDE World Championship event when Black played  16...Nc6  . }
16... Bh6
{ We recommend playing  16...Bh6  . The vis-a-vis of the h6-Bishop and White's pieces on d2 on c1 are quite annoying for White.  Although we are heading to an endgame, the game is still quite complicated and rich. We just give a sample line to show an important idea. After  17.Bxe7  Nxf1!  18.Bxf8  Bxf4  19.Rxf1  Kxf8  White has no advantage.  It is still quite interesting to play, though. The non-symmetrical majorities are always spicing the game up, even deep into the endgame. }

4. f4
{ This is the starting move of the Austrian Attack. White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later. The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.   The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent.   With  4.f4  , White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away. The game's direction is not as apparent against after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A.

{ We reach the diamond structure, which we outlined earlier. White's centre is under severe pressure now. }
9. h3 Nh6
{ White has played aggressively, but the advanced pawn centre is already under heavy fire.   One general problem is the Bishop on g1. It is difficult for White to move it back to e3, as we would jump with our Knight to f5 and kick the Bishop again. }
10. d5
{ White wants to keep his centre and gain even more space.  After  10.dxc5?  we can play  10...bxc5!  as  11.Qd5  Qb6  is fine for Black. White can't play  12.Qxa8?  due to  12...Bb7  trapping the Queen. }

{ By playing ...b6 on the previous move we prepared this central strike. Note that  7...c5  is better than  7...Bb7?!  because we know that we need ...c5 to attack White's centre while it is not yet clear if b7 is the right spot for the Bishop.  After  7...c5  White needs to decide about their d-pawn: advance it or not? If they play  8.h3  or another slowish move, we can take the d4-pawn and reach a comfortable version of a Sicilian Defence. Our Bishops are both fianchettoed and put pressure on the centre, making a much better impression than White's counterparts.  More often than not, White prefers to advance the d-pawn. }
8. d5
{ White closes the centre, entering a Benoni structure. The Benoni is usually regarded as favourable for White, but this particular version scores terribly for the first player. Even a strong former World Championship candidate such as Shirov lost a rapid game, despite being a 200 rating point favourite.   So, what's the reason for White's practical problems? Well, the Benoni structure, in general, might be nice for White, but White's piece placement is not ideal.   The Bishop on e3 has no useful role and might be a liability soon. It can be hit with ...Ng4 under the right circumstances and is clumsily placed on the e-file after ...e6 when this file might open soon. The quick ...e6-break also makes it impossible for White to manage e4-e5, which is the most dangerous plan for White in the Benoni.   Objectively speaking, the position is probably balanced and offers both players chances, but our task is a bit easier to handle. }
8... a6
{ We suggest playing this first, threatening to gain space on the Queenside by playing ...b5. White's reply is automatic, as there is no way ...b5 should be allowed. }

{ Very important! This break should be played quickly, giving Black counterplay. To take or not to take, that is the question for White now... }
10. O-O
{ White can also take on e6 when  10.dxe6  fxe6!  is best. Taking with the Bishop is less reliable, as f4-f5 is a constant worry. }
10... exd5 11. exd5
{ White has maintained the pawn on d5 and keeps an advantage in space. However, White's position has some drawbacks.   A key point is the move f4, which weakens multiple squares @@StartBracket@@e3 and e4@@EndBracket@@ and the King's position. It also severely limits the Bishop on e3, which currently looks misplaced. Therefore, White should try to play a quick f4-f5, which opens up the Bishop and starts a possible Kingside attack.   White also has some standard ideas, typical of a Benoni, like placing a Knight on c4. This is not so easy to accomplish, though. }
11... Bb7
{ We suggest a setup including ...Bb7 and ...Nbd7. The order does not matter, so  11...Nbd7  is a good alternative. }
12. Bc4
{ Instead,  12.f5  looks more testing to us, but we'd like to point out Black's instructive idea after this alternative approach by White. If White opts for  12.f5  , we suggest a setup with ...Nbd7 and  ...Qc7  for Black. }

3. Nc3 g6
{ After  3...g6  we have reached the starting position of the Pirc Defence. }
4. f4
{ This is the starting move of the Austrian Attack. White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later. The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.   The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent.   With  4.f4  , White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away. The game's direction is not as apparent against after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular branch is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This branch is examined in three chapters.  B.

D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the Intro chapter to the Austrianhere.  One crucial point: at various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn and play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise.

4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  White may deviate from these main lines on move 5 with ideas like  5.Bd3  or  5.a3  , but these options are not so relevant in the context of this Quickstarter Guide. They have their points but are not immediately threatening to blow you out of the water, as the general concept of ...Nc6 and ...e5 is the same as in the main lines after  5.Nf3  .  We'll have a look at  5.e5  , though. This move requires a precise response, otherwise Black is in trouble. }
5. Nf3
{ White speeds up the Kingside development, which is the main move by a mile. }
5... O-O 6. e5
{ The pawn push e4-e5 is quite aggressive and scores rather well for White. The game is often concrete, and White does not need to bother with the many alternatives Black has in the mainline after  6.Bd3  .  We need to be careful and learn some details by heart. First decision: to take or not to take on e5? }
6... dxe5
{ We recommend taking the pawn in the centre. In comparison, after the main move @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Bd3  Nc6  White also has the option to play  7.e5  , which we capture as well.  However, if White plays e5 one move earlier, the situation is different. After @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.e5  we recommend  5...Nfd7!  which is stronger than taking.  So, as a rule of thumb: you take on e5 AFTER you have castled, while against the early e4-e5 you play ...Nfd7. The reasoning is quite logical: with ...O-O being played, White has the dangerous h4-h5 attack available after the Knight retreat.  While a line like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.e5  Nfd7  7.h4  is not fatal, we feel that Black has a much easier job in practical play if you take on e5. This is, in particular, true in faster time control games, when the initiative is vital. You might struggle to remember a defensive detail, fall behind on the clock, and get in trouble.   Therefore we recommend playing  6...dxe5  , after which White chooses between the two pawn recaptures. The resulting play is completely different, as  7.dxe5  leads to a Queen trade, while  7.fxe5  is a much more aggressive choice, aiming for an attack along the f-file.   In the  7.fxe5  line, you need to know some concrete ideas against White's aggression, while  7.dxe5  is less dependent on knowledge. White's slow approach should not be underestimated, but in the end, we are not unduly worried about this line. }
7. fxe5
{ This can be regarded as the main move. Taking with the f-pawn keeps the Queens on the board and opens up the f-file for the Rook.   All nice and good, but Black is well developed, and we will soon attack White's centre with ...c5. First of all, our Knight has a good spot to jump to. }
7... Nd5
{ Our Knight occupies a strong position in the centre now. It is no surprise that White's most popular move is  8.Bc4  now, directly attacking our best piece. One important general point to address: From a strategic/long-term point of view, our position is fine and maybe even preferable.  With ...c5 on the agenda, White's advanced centre will be under heavy fire. Is Black better then? No, because there is a catch: the King's Knight often is the best defender of the King, but this piece is now on d5 and will often take on c3, like after  8.Bc4  Nxc3  .  We lack this important defender and White's e5-pawn and open f-file easily help to drum up an attack on our King.  Imagine a setup with Bc4, O-O and Qe1-h4: this is very scary, to say the least! The conclusion is: we need to treat White's approach with some respect, otherwise we might get hurt badly.   As mentioned,  8.Bc4  is White's main move now, but we examine some alternatives in the dedicated chapter. }
8. Bc4
{ You can expect this move to be played most of the time in this situation. White develops a piece with tempo and places the Bishop on a natural diagonal, looking at f7 and our King! }
8... Nxc3
{ Clearly the most principled move. We lose no time with retreating and instead weaken White's structure. }
9. bxc3 c5
{ We need to fight against White's impressive pawn mass in the centre. White will attack our Kingside soon, and we need to start our counterplay immediately. }
10. O-O
{ This is the most natural move for White. After the Knight jump  10.Ng5  we should play  10...h6!  immediately to force a decision of the Knight. This is much better than  10...Nc6?  when  11.O-O  attacks our f7-pawn and we'd need to play the undesirable move  11...e6  . }
10... Bg4
{ One of the most important moments in this line! After the natural-looking  10...Nc6  White might play  11.Ng5!?  to avoid the pin. In comparison to @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/4P3/2BP4/2P2N2/P1P3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9@@EndFEN@@  9...c5  10.Ng5  there is additional pressure on f7 due to the f1-Rook.

So what to do? Well, we have a multi-purpose move. We can develop a piece and indirectly increase the pressure against the central square d4 by pinning one of the White defenders. Our next move will be ...Nc6 in most cases, but the order of the two moves is of paramount importance!   After  10...Bg4!  we examine some possible moves for White in the dedicated chapter. In the Quickstarter, we take a look at White's most popular move  11.Be3  . }
11. Be3
{ This move looks natural and is played most often in this position. We get a good position with natural moves, though.  An idea worth knowing is that after White's alternative  11.h3  Bxf3  12.Qxf3  we should play  12...Nc6  when it's no problem to allow  13.Bxf7+  Kh8  , as our pressure on d4 is strong enough to win back the pawn. Often White's Bishop on f7 is rather misplaced in this scenario. }
11... Nc6
{ No rocket science: develop and put pressure on d4. The main nuance was to play 10... Bg4 first, and only now ...Nc6.   We think that White now runs the risk of getting into trouble. The pawn structure is clearly an issue, and there is no dangerous attack in sight. }
12. h3 Bxf3 13. Rxf3
{ The main move. White keeps his Queen on d1 to protect the d4-pawn. } 13...
Qa5
{ We complete development and already prefer Black slightly. White's centre is vulnerable and his King is not safe with all the dark-squared weaknesses around him @@StartBracket@@f2, g3 and h2@@EndBracket@@. We can continue with developing Rad8 and put pressure along the d-file on White's pawn weakness d4.   It should be mentioned that  13...Rc8  is a fine alternative of about equal strength. }
14. Bf2
{ Or  14.Qf1  Qxc3  15.Rd1  Na5!  which gives Black a much better position. }
14... Rad8
{ We have nice pressure on White's centre, especially the d4-pawn. Furthermore, we don't have any weaknesses. Instead, White's pawn structure is shattered and a long term worry for our opponent. }

7... Qxd1+
{ First of all, we exchange Queens. White has to make some concession now: either move the King or take with Knight, which allows ...Nd5. }
8. Kxd1
{ White gives up his right to castle. After  8.Nxd1  , we are happy to occupy the central post d5 with our Knight. Taking with the King is played more often than taking with the Knight according to our database.  White's idea is to lure us into the following variation:  8.Kxd1  Rd8  9.Ke1  Nd5  10.Nxd5  Rxd5  11.Bc4  when we would need to move our Rook again, and White would have a massive lead in development.  This is one of the lines that we need to avoid. }
8... Nh5
{ The move looks strange at first glance. Isn't a Knight on the rim dim? Furthermore, it looks like the Knight is lacking space. There are no squares it can jump to at the moment, but this is not easy to exploit. One key element is that h3 and g4 do not work for White, as our Knight could jump to g3 in this case.     Furthermore, the Bishop on c1 is tied to the defence of the f4-pawn for the time being. Having made a case why  8...Nh5!  is not as strange as it looks, we'd like to point out again that  8...Rd8+  9.Ke1  Nd5  10.Nxd5  Rxd5  11.Bc4  is more comfortable for White and should be avoided. Once you rule out this option, you quickly conclude that @@StartFEN@@rnb2rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/4P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BK1B1R b - - 0 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Nh5  makes a lot of sense, as  8...Nfd7?  fails to  9.Nd5  .

Our play is rather similar in all cases. We develop with ...Nc6, ...Bg4 and go for ...f6 soon, if possible. }
9. Ke1
{ Possibly the main move. White avoids a Rook vis-a-vis on the d-file and aims to find a rather safe square on f2 for his King. }
9... Bg4
{ Black has also played  9...Nc6  with some success, but we suggest threatening ...Bxf3 immediately.  White has several moves to avoid the destruction of his pawn chain. It's not necessary to check all lines, as Black's play is quite similar in all cases. We have ...Nc6, ...f6 and sometimes ...Bh6 to develop and put pressure on White's pawns. }
10. Nd4

11. Nb3 Nc6
{ That's the all-important point! We don't need to waste time covering the c-pawn and rather focus on increasing our development. }
12. Nxc5
{ White is greedy but is clearly playing with fire. It's more advisable for White to play  12.Kf2  when  12...Bh6  13.g3  b6  leads to a position with equal chances.  We still have ...f6 on our agenda, attacking the advanced pawn. }
12... Nb4
{ Let's attack! We are threatening 13... Nxc2+ and force White's reply. } 13.
Bd3 f6
{ We are not in a hurry to take on d3, but rather want to pick up the Bishop pair at leisure. First, we open up the position, enjoying great compensation for the pawn.   White's position is loose and the King feels insecure. Also, take note that the Bishop-pair alone will often be worth a pawn and White has no good way to preserve it. }

Stockfish suggests as the best line for White:  14.Qe2  Qa5+  15.c3  Qxd5  16.O-O  Qxc6  - this way, White avoided getting mated in the centre but is just a pawn down and completely busted. }

The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.   The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent.   With  4.f4  , White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away. The game's direction is not as apparent against after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular branch is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This branch is examined in three chapters.  B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A above, White may also play @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  which hints at a possible Queenside castling.

One crucial point: at various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn and play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.

4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  White may deviate from these main lines on move 5 with ideas like  5.Bd3  or  5.a3  , but these options are not so relevant in the context of this Quickstarter Guide. They have their points but are not immediately threatening to blow you out of the water, as the general concept of ...Nc6 and ...e5 is the same as in the main lines after  5.Nf3  .  We'll have a look at  5.e5  , though. This move requires a precise response, otherwise Black is in trouble. }
5. Nf3
{ White speeds up the Kingside development, which is the main move by a mile. }
5... O-O 6. Bd3
{ After  6.Bd3  Black has two main continuations. The first one is  6...Na6  , when Black often follows up with ... c5 next. Afterwards, a Benoni structure might arise if White pushes his d-pawn to d5.  This line scores reasonably well for Black, but we decided against this line for practical reasons. White obtains a dangerous attack on our King in many lines, and we rather want to avoid this.   The second good choice for Black is  6...Nc6  , putting pressure on d4 and preparing ...e5 if possible. After  6...Nc6  White's main moves are  7.e5  and  7.O-O  , but we'll have a look at  7.Be3  and  7.d5  too. }
6... Nc6
{ We develop our Queenside Knight to its most natural square in the opening. On c6, the Knight takes a look at the dark central squares d4 and e5. In some cases, it can also jump to b4, attacking White's light-squared Bishop. }
7. O-O
{ This natural move is one of two mainlines for White. White wants to bring the King into a safer position before committing to more concrete action.  White's main alternative is the move  7.e5  which we examine in the Quickstarter, too. }
7... e5
{ Black has two good moves at this point. The alternative to our suggestion is  7...Bg4  because we might get rid of the f3-Knight, one of White's defenders of the dark central squares.  The drawback of  7...Bg4  is the reply  8.e5!  when White reaches a slightly improved version of @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/3PPP2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e5  .   This is no problem, as the immediate action  7...e5  in the centre is possible and good. We quickly provoke a crisis in the centre and force White to decide between various possible pawn formations. White's main answers are the captures  8.fxe5  and  8.dxe5 }
8. fxe5 { White opens up the f-file for the Rook. } 8... dxe5 9. d5
{ White grabs space in the centre. It is the only testing move. After  9.dxe5  Nxe5!  10.Nxe5  Qd4+  11.Kh1  Qxe5  12.Bf4  Qc5  Black is in good shape. }
9... Ne7
{ Here Black has the fine alternative  9...Nd4  . It was tough to decide between the two Knight moves, but we decided to go for  9...Ne7  . The reason is that it leads to more lively play than  9...Nd4  .  A drawback of  9...Nd4  is the main reply  10.Nxe5  when Black has to regain the pawn with  10...Nxe4  or  10...Nxd5  . These lines are fine but lead to simplifications and are less combative.   For sure, you may add  9...Nd4  to your repertoire if you like to have a solid alternative, but we'd like to make a case for  9...Ne7  in this course.  Our idea is to attack White's centre with ...c6 on the next move, pretty much regardless of White's choice. White now usually opts for  10.Nxe5  ,  10.Bg5  or  10.Qe1 }
10. Qe1
{ Rarely played by White, but the move is Stockfish's first choice. White goes for some kind of a caveman-style attack @@StartBracket@@Qh4, Bh6, Ng5, Bxg7, Rxf6 and Qxh7 checkmate@@EndBracket@@, which is not be underestimated.   In any case, our play is based on ...c6, so let's not waste any time. }
10... c6
{ The thematic break which removes the d5-pawn. This has upsides and downsides: we get the e7-Knight back into play, but White gains access to the d5-square. }
11. dxc6
{ White needs to give up his centre pawn. He can't support it adequately, as  11.Bc4  would be answered by  11...b5  and  12.--  b4  hitting the defenders of the d5-pawn. }
11... Nxc6
{ This position is still rather unexplored. In the Quickstarter we'll have a look at the most aggressive move  12.Qh4 }
12. Qh4
{ After this move, White's pinning idea Bg5 can get very problematic, as we lack the response ...h6.   For comparison: after  12.Bg5  we just play  12...h6  and White's move was rather pointless. White doesn't want to play  13.Bh4  @@StartBracket@@Qe1-h4 was intended@@EndBracket@@, and  13.Be3  doesn't convince, either.   Now, after  12.Qh4  , we need to stop the pin! }
12... Nh5
{ We don't mind the Queen trade. Black's position is solid and has no obvious weakness. }
13. Bg5
{ This looks much more likely to happen than the trade, as White's aggressive intentions have been rather obvious. }
13... Qb6+ { A useful tempo move with a check. } 14. Kh1 Be6
{ We don't want to neglect our development.  14...Qxb2?  would be too greedy because White could strengthen his attack by  15.Nd5  . We need to control the d5-square. }
15. Nd5 Bxd5 16. exd5 Nb4
{ We are already rather deep, on move 16. But we need to continue a bit because the next move is critical. }
17. Be7
{ White is threatening to win the Knight and attacks the Rook. The best response is not exactly obvious. }
17... Nxd3 18. Bxf8 Bf6
{ A key move! We will win back the exchange due to our option to play 19... Nf2+ next. The game remains complicated, with about equal chances. }

8. fxe5
{ This move is more aggressive than  8.dxe5  . White keeps two centre pawns and opens up the f-file, which he might use for an attack. The Bishop on c1 gains more scope, as well.  For Black, the correct answer to  8.fxe5  is the most important point to remember in this part of the Austrian Attack! }
8... Nh5
{ This is probably the most important moment in the whole 7.e5 variation. White's recapture  8.fxe5  is the most popular and the one you will face regularly. It is important to understand the difference between these two lines:  A. @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.e5  dxe5  7.fxe5  Nd5!

We badly lack counterplay against d4, and the Knight on c6 is misplaced.   After the less intuitive  8...Nh5  , White needs to take care of his d4-pawn now. They can either protect it directly, by playing  9.Be3  or indirectly with his Queen by retreating the d3-Bishop to e2.  In most cases, however, this is just a transposition of moves and both lead to the same position at the end. In any case, our setup includes ...Bg4 to complete development and a quick ...f7-f6 to attack White's centre. This will also give the Knight on h5 a more useful role. }
9. Be3
{ The alternative  9.Be2  would most likely lead to the main variation after  9...Bg4  10.Be3  as the pressure on d4 leaves White little choice. }
9... Bg4 10. Be2 f6
{ The move ...f6! is a key idea to remember. We attack White's centre and force a concession. White is not able to keep his pawn on e5 anymore, and will most likely capture on f6. }
11. exf6
{ This is played most of the time. All recaptures lead to a playable position, but we recommend taking with the e-pawn. This is the soundest option in terms of pawn structure and looks fully satisfactory for Black.   Instead of  11.exf6  White also has  11.e6?!  , but this is dubious due to  11...f5!  when the pawn on  e6  is doomed in the long run. }
11... exf6
{ We like this move the most. Now White needs to decide on either Kingside or Queenside castling. it's no surprise that  12.O-O  or  12.Qd2  are most popular here, as White's need to get the King out of the middle is rather obvious.  That being said, we will also analyse  12.d5  . This is a rare move, but it is suggested by Stockfish and might as well be the best move for White. }
12. O-O
{ White decides to castle Kingside, which is played most often. In the dedicated chapter, we also examine the alternatives  12.d5  and  12.Qd2 }
12... Re8
{ Black could play  12...f5  13.Qd2  Qd6  leading to an unclear position.   We recommend playing  12...Re8  , though. We think this move is more precise, as it allows the strong idea ...Nc6-e7-f5 }
13. Qd2 Ne7
{ We have reached an interesting position. Black has nice piece play and chances to exploit the dark-squared weaknesses in White's camp.   The ...Nf5-idea may even be followed up by ...Bh6, if possible. }
14. Bc4+ Kh8
{ We like Black's position, because it already seems a bit easier for us to play.  For example after the natural move  15.h3?!  Nf5!  White can't play  16.Bf2  to keep his Bishop. We would play  16...Bxf3  followed by ...Bh6 and a great position.   The highest level game that reached this position was played between S. Karjakin and G. Jones in Bilbao 2014. The later World Championship challenger went for  15.Nh4  but this can't bother Black much. Gawain Jones was fine after  15...Nc6  16.Bf2  Ne5!?  but Black has some fine alternatives in  15...f5  or even  15...g5!?  , which looks a bit loose, admittedly.  We don't see any problems for Black in this line, and even the most respected expert on the Austrian Attack, Sergey Karjakin, didn't find a way forward. }

3. Nc3 g6
{ After  3...g6  we have reached the starting position of the Pirc Defence. }
4. f4
{ This is the starting move of the Austrian Attack. White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later. The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.   The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent.   With  4.f4  , White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away. The game's direction is not as apparent against after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular branch is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This branch is examined in three chapters.  B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A above, White may also play @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  which hints at a possible Queenside castling.

D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the Intro chapter to the Austrianhere.  One crucial point: at various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn and play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise. In slower lines, like the Classical Variation @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Be2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.g3  Black can get away with knowing only some concrete lines and ideas.

In the Quickstarter, we'll focus on the most important lines that you'll encounter in your games or that demand a precise response that you should know. }
4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  White may deviate from these main lines on move 5 with ideas like  5.Bd3  or  5.a3  , but these options are not so relevant in the context of this Quickstarter Guide. They have their points but are not immediately threatening to blow you out of the water, as the general concept of ...Nc6 and ...e5 is the same as in the main lines after  5.Nf3  .  We'll have a look at  5.e5  , though. This move requires a precise response, otherwise Black is in trouble. }
5. Nf3
{ White speeds up the Kingside development, which is the main move by a mile. }
5... O-O 6. Bd3
{ After  6.Bd3  Black has two main continuations. The first one is  6...Na6  , when Black often follows up with ... c5 next. Afterwards, a Benoni structure might arise if White pushes his d-pawn to d5.  This line scores reasonably well for Black, but we decided against this line for practical reasons. White obtains a dangerous attack on our King in many lines, and we rather want to avoid this.   The second good choice for Black is  6...Nc6  , putting pressure on d4 and preparing ...e5 if possible. After  6...Nc6  White's main moves are  7.e5  and  7.O-O  , but we'll have a look at  7.Be3  and  7.d5  too. }
6... Nc6
{ We develop our Queenside Knight to its most natural square in the opening. On c6, the Knight takes a look at the dark central squares d4 and e5. In some cases, it can also jump to b4, attacking White's light-squared Bishop. }
7. e5
{ Pushing his e-pawn is White's most aggressive move in the position and the most popular. White is scoring quite well with it, but this is largely due to Black making a key mistake early on. We recommend taking on e5 similarly to the line @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.e5  when  6...dxe5  is our move, too.

8. dxe5
{ This move is more of a positional approach in comparison to taking with the f-pawn. It's played less often and scores slightly worse than the main alternative  8.fxe5  , but it's a solid choice for White. }
8... Nd5
{ We use the opportunity to occupy a nice central square with our Knight. It is important to not confuse matters with  8.fxe5  , when  8...Nh5!  is essential.   After  8.fxe5  Nd5?  is a rather substantial mistake, as explained in the notes to  8...Nh5!   Here d5 is a great square for our piece. From d5, we not only attack the c3-Knight and f4, but also take control of e3, a square that White would like to use for the Bishop.  Another idea to keep in mind is the Knight-jump to b4. This way, we could try to get rid of White's d3-Bishop. }
9. Bd2
{ Looks most natural. In the case of ...Nxc3, White can take back with his Bishop and avoid destroying the pawn structure.  White main alternative is  9.Nxd5  Qxd5  10.Qe2  , when  10...Bg4  11.Be4  Qa5+  12.Bd2  Qb6  13.O-O-O  Nd4  is the main continuation. Black has equal chances in this line, which is discussed in more detail in the dedicated chapter. }
9... Bg4
{ This looks best and gives Black equal chances according to our analysis. Black has two main alternatives. The move  9...Ndb4  does not work that well after  10.Be4  but  9...Nb6  looks quite reasonable. We don't want to discuss alternatives too much, as we think that @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n3p1/3nP3/5P2/2NB1N2/PPPB2PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 9@@EndFEN@@  9...Bg4  is a very logical choice. We get the final minor piece out and keep the Knight on the strong d5-post. }
10. Be4
{ A good move for White. It attacks the Knight and lends additional support to the Knight on f3. }
10... e6 { We keep the Knight on d5. } 11. h3
{ This looks like the best try for White. After  11.O-O  you have the comfortable choice between the solid  11...Nd4  for trades or the less solid ideas  11...g5!?  or  11...f6  , amongst others.   Instead of the slow  11.O-O  , White's  11.h3  forces matters. }
11... Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Nd4
{ We need to generate direct play to get compensation for the loss of the Bishop-pair. Our compensation is the strong Knight-pair in the middle of the board. }
13. Qf2 c5
{ We need to keep our strong outpost, of course. It is crucial to understand that with ...Bg4 and the trade on f3 we have undermined White's control of e5. This strategy needs to be followed up with ...f6! almost regardless of White's 14h move.

{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined inchapter 7 andchapter 8. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance. White often plays moves that support this plan, like Re1, Bf4, and h3 @@StartBracket@@ h3 takes away a possible ...Ng4 in reply to e4-e5 @@EndBracket@@.

This makes it difficult to organize the coverage. However, we can clearly distinguish two scenarios.  Black is aiming for the advance ...e5 after we will play ...Nc6 next. White can try to stop this advance or allow it. We have decided to cover the Classical Variation in two chapters according to those two scenarios. The first chapter covers all lines that stop ...e5, while the second chapter covers lines that involve ...e5.  It is important to get a feel for the position types. Therefore they are grouped in the two chapters by 'type of position', not by concrete moves. In the Quickstarter, we examine some typical lines for both scenarios. }
7. a4

{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined inchapter 7 andchapter 8. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance. White often plays moves that support this plan, like Re1, Bf4, and h3 @@StartBracket@@ h3 takes away a possible ...Ng4 in reply to e4-e5 @@EndBracket@@.

This makes it difficult to organize the coverage. However, we can clearly distinguish two scenarios.  Black is aiming for the advance ...e5 after we will play ...Nc6 next. White can try to stop this advance or allow it. We have decided to cover the Classical Variation in two chapters according to those two scenarios. The first chapter covers all lines that stop ...e5, while the second chapter covers lines that involve ...e5.  It is important to get a feel for the position types. Therefore they are grouped in the two chapters by 'type of position', not by concrete moves. In the Quickstarter, we examine some typical lines for both scenarios. }
7. a4
{ The move  7.a4  is the most popular reply to 6...a6. In many chess openings, White almost automatically answers ...a6 with a4, hindering Black from gaining space on the Queenside with ...b5.

8. h3
{ White plays a useful prophylactic move. It stops a possible ...Bg4 and ...Ng4 moves and prepares Be3 that way. }

{ Alright, that was the plan. Now White needs to decide about the central tension. A closer look reveals that White only has two serious options: trade with  9.dxe5  or play for the advance  9.d5  .  After White has played the two good but slow moves a4 and h3, keeping the central tension does not work well.  9.Be3  is possible but not challenging for Black at all. }
9. d5
{ Advancing the pawn is White's most ambitious way to play. It gains space and pushes our Knight back to e7. }
9... Ne7
{ We have reached a structure similar to the mainline of the King's Indian Defence. We need to have a look at this line to compare: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  . In both positions, White has a space advantage on the Queenside, based on the d5-pawn. This suggests that White should play on this side of the board.  The crucial difference between our Pirc line and the King's Indian is White's c-pawn. White needs to advance pawns on the Queenside to open files, and the c-pawn is the most important one. It is the pawn that should attack Black's pawn chain with c4-c5, opening files. A sample line in the King's Indian is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  9.b4  Ne8  10.c5  which shows this idea put into motion very quickly.  In our Pirc line, the pawn is on c2, making a similar scenario much more difficult to achieve for White. The Knight on c3 needs to move first, which costs some time.  Black's game is rather easy, in comparison. We'll play ...Ne8 and ...f5, starting our play on the Kingside, basically no matter what White does on the next moves.  We'll have a look at some possible moves to discuss more ideas. }

{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square. In some cases, White may also have played the move Be3 earlier and only later closed the centre.

{ Here  12...f4  is possible, but more or less an 'All-In!'-move, to use a poker term. After  13.Bf2  g5  White needs to find the right plan  14.a5!  followed by Na4 and c4-c5, when it's a matter of who crashes through first.  Computers love White, but it is not clear at all in a game between human players. Engines tend to overestimate the static features, so don't be too scared to enter such a position.   In this particular situation, we still recommend the move  12...Nf6  ., The plan ...Nh5-f4 looks strong and less committal. You can also consider  12...Kh8  , intending ...Ng8 and ...Bh6, for a more strategic approach. }

{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined inchapter 7 andchapter 8. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance. White often plays moves that support this plan, like Re1, Bf4, and h3 @@StartBracket@@ h3 takes away a possible ...Ng4 in reply to e4-e5 @@EndBracket@@.

This makes it difficult to organize the coverage. However, we can clearly distinguish two scenarios.  Black is aiming for the advance ...e5 after we will play ...Nc6 next. White can try to stop this advance or allow it. We have decided to cover the Classical Variation in two chapters according to those two scenarios. The first chapter covers all lines that stop ...e5, while the second chapter covers lines that involve ...e5.  It is important to get a feel for the position types. Therefore they are grouped in the two chapters by 'type of position', not by concrete moves. In the Quickstarter, we examine some typical lines for both scenarios. }
7. a4
{ The move  7.a4  is the most popular reply to 6...a6. In many chess openings, White almost automatically answers ...a6 with a4, hindering Black from gaining space on the Queenside with ...b5.

8. h3
{ White plays a useful prophylactic move. It stops a possible ...Bg4 and ...Ng4 moves and prepares Be3 that way. }
8... e5
{ Alright, that was the plan. Now White needs to decide about the central tension. A closer look reveals that White only has two serious options: trade with  9.dxe5  or play for the advance  9.d5  .  After White has played the two good but slow moves a4 and h3, keeping the central tension does not work well.  9.Be3  is possible but not challenging for Black at all. }
9. dxe5
{ One way to deal with ...e5 is the exchange on e5, which can happen in various versions. The version here, after @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  is the one that happens most frequently. White has not committed any of the minor pieces yet, so we need to reckon with various combinations of Be3, Bg5 and Bc4. White might also play Qc1 at some point, with Rd1 to follow. What are both sides playing for?  The central pawn structure is symmetrical and the four Knights are placed well. The main difference is White's Bishop on e2 versus our Bishop on g7. White claims that their Bishop is easily activated with Bc4 which helps fight for control over the d5-square. On the other hand, our Bishop on g7 is staring at the e5-pawn, which looks like a more passive setup.  White's argument is not wrong, but our Bishop is not that badly placed. White is playing for the square d5, we play for d4... and our Bishop often helps to support a Knight jump to d4 as we will see in some variations.  What about our light-squared Bishop? We'd like to place it on e6, where is controls d5. White has played h3 so there is no other good option like ...Bg4. Speaking of h3, the move ...h6 is desirable for Black, too. The moves Bg5 or Ng5 in reply to ...Be6 are annoying and should be stopped. Finally, the square e7 is a good spot for the Queen, connecting the Rooks and allowing a Rook to d8.  To summarize: our target setup is ...Be6, ...h6, ...Qe7, then probably a Rook to d8. Of course, White is moving in the meantime, and we need to adjust. Still, keep this setup in mind.  White has several possible continuations now, and all the permutations of Be3/Bg5/Bc4 can be irritating at first. However, all the variations follow the same storyline: we try to achieve the target setup, while White tries to prevent it and gain control of d5.  Before we look at some moves, we'd like to mention that Black scores very well in the dxe5 positions, even though White should not be worse. One reason might be that White is often not prepared for the ...a6 & ...Nc6 lines and seeks a simple solution. If you have never studied it, closing the centre with d4-d5 is not an easy decision. It leads to positions that are much more in the spirit of the Classical King's Indian, quite a long way from what a 1.e4-player usually gets on the board.  We have seen that keeping the tension is unchallengeable, which leaves the dxe5 option. So frequently, White plays it as a 'cop out' with a somewhat weak mindset. We think this is the main reason for White's bad score, not the actual positions' quality.  There are players on the White side that play these positions to press small advantages and grind us down. But don't think that White is after simplifications and a draw after the exchange; looks can be deceiving. However, there will be players @@StartBracket@@see White's lousy score@@EndBracket@@ who view the trade on e5 as a way to avoid complications and simplify the game as much as possible. Against these players, it is crucial not to accept a draw readily but to continue playing and accumulating small advantages.  A good strategy can be to offer trades that are favourable for us. If White is too keen on exchanging all pieces, these offers can be tempting. Even sterile positions often can be won by pure persistence - play on until they break down. }
9... dxe5 10. Bc4
{ White also frequently plays  10.Bg5  or  10.Be3  . We check White's alternatives in the dedicated chapterhere.  However, the main point in each case is to find or remember the best move order to reach the mentioned setup of ...Be6, ...h6 and ...Qe7.

{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined inchapter 7 andchapter 8. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

White can try to stop this advance or allow it. We have decided to cover the Classical Variation in two chapters according to those two scenarios. The first chapter covers all lines that stop ...e5, while the second chapter covers lines that involve ...e5.  It is important to get a feel for the position types.

This line has been played twice by Magnus Carlsen, Levon Aronian, Ian Nepomniachtchi and David Navara, with good results.  Let's talk about White's next move because it will influence the course of the game significantly.

The key ideas are  9.h3  b5  , when Black plays ...Bb7 and ...c6 next, while @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/npp1ppbp/p2p1np1/3P4/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 9@@EndFEN@@  9.Bg5  h6  10.Be3  allows the funky  10...Nb5!  , putting the Knight to good use. }

9... e5
{ We suggest going for the closed central formation. In the second chapter on the Classical about the ...e5 lines, we discuss these structures, but in lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.d5  Ne7  our Knight is on e7.   At first glance, having the Knight on a7 instead looks ridiculous, but the situation is not as clear-cut as you might think. We'll discuss the merits of the Knight in a moment, but before we'd like to point out that Black has a reasonable alternative with  9...e6  , which has been tested in games by Levon Aronian and David Navara.  Keeping the long diagonal open with  9...e6  is the more solid choice, but we think that  9...e5  leads to fascinating fights and is a good practical weapon. The resulting positions are quite similar to a Classical King's Indian, and White might be unfamiliar with these pawn structures.  A key idea for White is a pawn advance on the Queenside, often involving c4-c5, aiming to open the c-file. This is not so easy to achieve, as the c3-Knight is blocking the pawn. Black's plan is a lot easier to implement: move the f6-Knight and play ...f5 to start advancing on the Kingside.   Let's discuss some concrete moves now. The position is unexplored; we only found one game in which White played the less critical  10.dxe6  when  10...Bxe6  and ...Nc6 next gives Black an easy game. Our pieces are actively placed and we can play against the e4-pawn.   White should try to make headway in the closed structure and avoid the en-passant capture. We'll examine  10.b4  as the starting move of the analysis, as White can hardly do without this move on the Queenside. }

On a7, it does not connect at all to a dark-squared blockade. Playing ...a5 would make much more sense if the Knight would be on d7 or even b8.   After moves other than  10.b4  or  10.a5  we won't play ...a5, but rather continue in the same way as we do after the pawn moves.

{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined inchapter 7 andchapter 8. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

White can try to stop this advance or allow it. We have decided to cover the Classical Variation in two chapters according to those two scenarios. The first chapter covers all lines that stop ...e5, while the second chapter covers lines that involve ...e5.  It is important to get a feel for the position types. Therefore they are grouped in the two chapters by 'type of position', not by concrete moves. In the Quickstarter, we examine some typical lines for both scenarios. }

4. Be3
{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square while still keeping many options open. The main virtue of  4.Be3  is its flexibility, which poses a challenge to Black.  White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6 and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill. This move looks like an automatic choice. We indeed continue like that in most cases, for example, after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  or  4.Nf3  .  However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. h3
{ White answers our small pawn move on the Queenside with a small pawn move on the Kingside, claiming that it is worth a tempo to cover the g4-square. This approach looks slow, but it carries a serious punch, as we will see in this chapter.  Before we get to the move-by-move coverage, we need to mention that the line  5.h3  is not very popular for White, but this might change, as it was covered in two important publications on Chessable. In 2018 it was first covered by one of the authors of this course, Christof Sielecki, in 'Keep It Simple: 1.e4'. Two years later, Wesley So recommended it in his 'Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4'.  Alright, back to the current position. Black's next is fairly natural. We complete the Kingside fianchetto. }

Furthermore, after a later ...Nc6, the e7-square is a good square for the Queen's Knight. We cover the crucial squares d5 and f5, making pawn advances by White more difficult. After the Knight is on e7, we finally play ...b7-b5 or ...b7-b6 to complete our formation.   White, with a large space advantage, should be able to preserve some advantage, but Black is not without counter chances, as the following sample lines demonstrate. We need to emphasize that  6...e6!?  is pretty much new ground, so there is no established theory that your opponent might know or have prepared. We think that  7.Nf3  is White's most likely move, but we'll check some more moves to show some key concepts. }
7. Nf3
{ After  7.e5  , we now have  7...Nd5  . After  8.Nxd5  exd5  we plan ...c5 next, attacking White's centre. }
7... Nc6
{ The Knight is headed towards e7. We can't play the immediate  7...b5?  as  8.e5!  Nd5  9.Nxd5  exd5  is good for White.  This is best compared to @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/1pp2pbp/p2ppnp1/8/3PPP2/2N1B2P/PPP3P1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e5  Nd5  8.Nxd5  exd5  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/1pp2pbp/p2ppnp1/8/3PPP2/2N1B2P/PPP3P1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7...Nc6  8.e5  Nd5  9.Nxd5  exd5  .  In the two other cases, Black quickly gains counterplay against the centre with ...c5 and/or ...f6. In comparison, ...b5 does not help at all in this regard, and it has no positive points. Black does not want a Bishop on b7... there's a pawn on d5 after the capture. }
8. Bd3
{ Probably most natural. White covers e4 and prepares to castle Kingside. }
8... Ne7
{ The combination of the pawn on e6 and the Knights on e7 and f6 stop White's centre from easily moving forward.  White can push e4-e5, but this gives us a nice spot for the Knight on d5. The next step is to fianchetto the Queen's Bishop. }
9. O-O b5
{ Our general plan is to continue with ...Bb7, ...O-O and ultimately ...Rc8 and ...c5.   White has many possible setups now, so we'll check one to illustrate matters. }
10. Qd2 Bb7 { Now we are threatening ...b4, winning the e4-pawn. } 11. a3

{ We prepare ...c5, attacking White's centre. } 13. f5
{ White will not 'prepare forever', so let's have a look at this strike. }
13... exf5 14. exf5 c5
{ We have completed the counterplay concept with ...c5, attacking White's centre. Engines give White an advantage in these positions, but the situation is very complicated.   In practical terms, the game is entirely unclear. One common phenomenon is that the engine evaluation usually starts relatively high for White @@StartBracket@@let's say +0.7 or +0.8@@EndBracket@@, but goes down as the engine calculates deeper.   This is less relevant for the practical value of the position, but it is good to know that the initial engine assessment is usually too optimistic for White. }

However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill. This move looks like an automatic choice.

However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }

After  5...Bg7  White's most natural move is  6.Nf3  , but  6.Be2  is possible, too. White covers g4 with the Bishop and delays the Knight development.

5. Qd2
{ The setup with Qd2 and f3 is a popular choice for White. The basic idea is to aim for Queenside castling and attack on the kingside or in the centre.  The pawn move f3 covers the e-pawn and prepares g4, a move that you'll face frequently. One reason for the popularity of White's system is the similarity to some Sicilian variations that White might know or have in their repertoire.  Famous examples are the 'English Attack' against the Najdorf @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  a6  6.Be3  e6  7.f3  Be7  8.Qd2  or the Rauzer setup against the Dragon @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  d6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  g6  6.Be3  Bg7  7.f3  O-O  8.Qd2  .

6. f3
{ The main move by a mile. White supports the centre with the f-pawn and prepares a later g4 attack at the same time.  Quite frequently, this position arises via other move orders, like @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5@@EndFEN@@  5.f3  b5  6.Qd2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f3  a6  5.Be3  b5  6.Qd2 }
6... Nbd7
{ This is the most flexible move and better than the Bishop moves. Well, if we'd play ...Bg7, White's answer Bh6, is annoying. If we'd take White's Bishop, we lose a tempo compared to lines where we kept the Bishop on f8. We'd capture in two moves @@StartBracket@@Bf8-g7xh6@@EndBracket@@ instead of one @@StartBracket@@Bf8xh6@@EndBracket@@.  What about our other Bishop, the light-squared one? On b7, the light-squared Bishop would bang its head against a wall of White pawns: g2, f3 and e4. By playing ...Nbd7 first, we prepare to attack White's centre with either ...e5 or ...c5.   An additional idea is the Knight transfer to b6. From b6, it has access to c4. The move  6...Nbd7  also anticipates White's g4-g5 push. We'd like to have the option to play ...Nf6-d7 in response to g5. White now usually continues  7.O-O-O  or  7.g4  if he has Kingside play in mind, but  7.a4  is also met quite frequently.

7. O-O-O
{ If White does not play  7.g4  , this is most likely the way he will continue the game. }
7... Nb6
{ We already discussed earlier that we rather want to avoid Bishop moves for the moment.   The move ...Nb6 is useful to connect it to the c4-square and frees the d7-square for his fellow on f6. White has tried many moves here and we'll analyze some of them to get a better picture.   The most likely moves to face are  8.h4  our mainline, and  8.g4  . These moves lead to quite different positions, so there is no 'general strategy' at this point. }
8. h4
{ If you play the Pirc regularly, you will be getting used to this move. It's played often, in various lines, and is not very subtle. In most cases, we should stop the pawn immediately. }
8... h5
{ 'You shall not pass!' After ...h5 it's not easy for White to open files on the kingside without sacrificing a pawn. They would need to play g4 at some point, but we control the square g4 with h5, Nf6, and Bc8. Playing for g4 is not White's only plan, though.   Let's discuss some general points about both side's ideas. The position is closed at the moment, in the sense that all pawns are still on the board. It is not a 'closed centre', though, when all the action is happening on the wings sometimes.  Let's take an example: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  5.d5  e5  4.Nc3  d6  5.e4  - In this Benoni structure the centre is closed and can't be easily opened. There won't be any open d-file any time soon.  In our position in the Pirc, the position is closed in the sense that there is no contact yet between the two armies, but hostilities might happen at any time. White could prepare g4, but also pawn pushes like f3-f4-f5 or e4-e5. On the other hand, Black might attack White's centre with ...e5, ...c5 or push forward on the Queenside. You notice all the ideas are based on pawn breaks and structure changes.  For Black, the key to these positions is to place the pieces well and prepare for the opponent's advances. At the same time, you need to make sure to make progress with your own play. Our play needs to be prophylactic in the best possible sense: watch out for your opponent's ideas, but do so with constructive moves that are not purely defensive.  So, how should Black's setup look like to meet these requirements? Black has a set of useful moves that fit well and form a harmonious setup. You mostly need to consider the order of the moves. Here's a guideline: - If White plays Nh3, take it with our Bishop. Our Bishop has a hard time finding a proper role, and White's Knight can improve to g5. This is more important than the Bishop-pair at the moment. White will often play  9.Nh3  right away or in the near future.  We think this move/idea is White's best shot. - The pawn move ...c6 is essential. We cover the square d5, which is very important to be equipped for e4-e5 by White. After e4-e5, we gain the d5-square for the Knights, and we need the maximum stability on this square. - After ...c6, we can play ...Qc7, which is a versatile addition to our setup.  The Queen supports ...e5 or ...c5 and makes e4-e5 more challenging to play. - After the moves h4 and ...h5 are on the board, White's Bh6-idea is impossible, and ...Bg7 becomes an option. - The move ...e6 can help strengthen the control of d5 @@StartBracket@@...c6 was a first step@@EndBracket@@ and make White's e4-e5-e6 push impossible. -  Finally, there is ...Rb8, which can be prepare ...Nc4 or ...Na4, when the b-file might open later. This list of moves is ordered roughly by 'urgency', so you'd usually start with ...c6, ...Qc7, ...Bg7, only then consider ...Rb8 or more direct action. We need those moves first to get stability, then see what to do next.  What you don't want to do: castle too soon! It is only a good idea once you have a clearer picture of the pawn structure and central action. You might want to castle if the centre opens up and you need to involve the h8-Rook quickly.  If the centre is open, an attack based on g4 is also less likely to work, making the King safer on the Kingside. So castling has to be carefully considered; it is never a 'routine move', but needs to be a conscious decision, based on the specific situation.  White is playing moves, too... and this requires adjustments, of course. We'll examine some lines now and discuss White's ideas in the process. }
9. Nh3
{ We think this is the most likely move to happen and the most challenging at the same time. If you consider the position before @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/pn1p1np1/1p6/3PP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 3 8@@EndFEN@@  8.h4  White had problems developing the Kingside Knight.

White may also delay Nh3 and start with a different move, but go for Nh3 later.

9... Bxh3 { According to plan. } 10. Rxh3 c6
{ We suggest starting with this move, followed by ...Qc7 and ...Bg7 next.  Now White's pawn push e4-e5 does not trouble us. We think that  11.Bd3  strengthens the e4-e5 push idea and is the most challenging move. }
11. Bd3 { White prepares e5-e6, which looks like White's best plan. } 11... Qc7
{ A good place for the Queen. In some of the following lines we'll see that it is slightly more precise to move the Queen first and delay ...Bg7. }
12. Kb1
{ A good prophylactic move, preparing e4-e5. The immediate  12.e5  dxe5  13.dxe5  Nfd5  14.Nxd5  Nxd5  is premature, but now a more serious idea. }

15. f4 { White needs to cover the pawn. } 15... Rd8
{ Using the Rook on the open file suggests itself. Note that  15...e6?  is bad due to  16.Ne4  . Now White has to choose whether they want to trade on d5 or try to use the Knight on e4. }
16. Nxd5 Nxd5 17. Bc5
{ A tempting move. After something like  17.Rhh1  we'd have the option to play  17...c5  or play  17...e6  , being ready to answer  18.Bc5  with  18...Bf8 }
17... e6 18. Bd6 Qa7
{ We'd love to suggest  18...Rxd6  , but it doesn't work properly. After  19.exd6  Qxd6  White has the precise move  20.c4!  when we can't play  20...Nxf4?  due to  21.Rf3!  Black would need to play  20...bxc4  when the resulting position is not giving enough play for the exchange.   White always has Rb3 to stop b-file play. We have a much better alternative, though, in  18...Qa7  . The simple idea is to play ...Bf8 next to get rid of the intruder on d6. Black is fine, enjoying the great Knight on d5. }

However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6

If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. Qd2
{ The setup with Qd2 and f3 is a popular choice for White. The basic idea is to aim for Queenside castling and attack on the kingside or in the centre.  The pawn move f3 covers the e-pawn and prepares g4, a move that you'll face frequently.

{ This is the most flexible move and better than the Bishop moves. Well, if we'd play ...Bg7, White's answer Bh6, is annoying.

An additional idea is the Knight transfer to b6. From b6, it has access to c4. The move  6...Nbd7  also anticipates White's g4-g5 push. We'd like to have the option to play ...Nf6-d7 in response to g5. White now usually continues  7.O-O-O  or  7.g4  if he has Kingside play in mind, but  7.a4  is also met quite frequently.

7. O-O-O
{ If White does not play  7.g4  , this is most likely the way he will continue the game. }
7... Nb6
{ We already discussed earlier that we rather want to avoid Bishop moves for the moment.   The move ...Nb6 is useful to connect it to the c4-square and frees the d7-square for his fellow on f6. White has tried many moves here and we'll analyze some of them to get a better picture.   The most likely moves to face are  8.h4  our mainline, and  8.g4  . These moves lead to quite different positions, so there is no 'general strategy' at this point. }
8. g4
{ The move g4 is very popular for White in this type of position. White gains space and prepares h4-h5 or g4-g5. After the best reply, Black gets a good game without any trouble. }
8... h5
{ This is a strong defensive move. We immediately force White to decide about the fate of the g-pawn.  In both cases,  9.gxh5  or  9.g5  White has a hard time opening the Kingside position. With h5! we at least slow down White's play considerably. }
9. g5
{ White grabs space on the Kingside but closes this part of the board. Any attack will likely involve the push of the f-pawn now. }
9... Nfd7 10. f4 { Using the f-pawn is the only way forward for White. } 10...
b4
{ The b-pawn advance not only gains space on 'our' side of the board but also pushes away the defender of the e4-pawn. After White played f4, the e4-pawn becomes a target.  We'll check both Knight moves now, mostly because  11.Nce2  requires a non-standard reply. }
11. Nb1
{ White needs to react to our threat to take the c3-Knight and retreats. We also looked at the alternative  11.Nce2 }
11... Bb7
{ We develop a piece in combination with a threat. That's often welcome. } 12.
d5
{ White needs to play this to limit the damage. After  12.Bd3?!  c5  the Bishop turns out to be misplaced. }
12... c5 { We don't want to allow White to put his Bishop on d4. } 13. dxc6
{ We need to check this move. It's greedy, but certainly the critical test. Stockfish prefers  13.c4!?  which is not an obvious choice.  It assesses the game as about equal, which is probably correct. Black certainly has no problems, as we can push the a-pawn or try ...Bg7 &... Na4 to provoke b3. }
13... Bxc6 14. Qxb4
{ A greedy move, but the pawn on b4 was annoying for White. We are not worried about the material loss, as the b-file gets opened Moves like ...Bg7, ...Rb8 and Knight jumps to a4 are attractive attacking ideas.   If White avoids  14.Qxb4  , we'll have a straightforward plan: just develop with ...Bg7 and ...Nc5. The pressure on e4 and the White King's position gives Black the advantage already. }
14... Rb8
{ It's not easy to choose a move here. The position is very sharp, which usually means that there are not many possible moves. Here this is not the case, as Black has good alternatives in  14...Bg7  or  14...Na4  . They all lead to wild complications that are exciting to play. }
15. Qc3
{ White removes the Queen from the b-file and attacks both our Rook and Bishop. Well, we have some material to take, too. }
15... Bxe4 16. Qxh8 Nd5
{ The h1-Rook is doomed anyway. Inserting this tempo move is important. If you play  16...Bxh1?  White manages to play  17.Nc3   After  16...Nd5!  White has various Bishop moves, but we don't need to analyze it deeper. We can take on h1 next, with an interesting and sharp position. }

{ After  3...g6  we have reached the starting position of the Pirc Defence. }
4. Be3
{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square while still keeping many options open. The main virtue of  4.Be3  is its flexibility, which poses a challenge to Black.  White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6 and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill. This move looks like an automatic choice. We indeed continue like that in most cases, for example, after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  or  4.Nf3  .  However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. Nf3
{ A natural move, developing the Kingside first. White remains flexible and does not yet commit to a certain strategy. Castling Queenside or Kingside are still possible, for example. }
5... Bg7
{ After  5...Bg7  White has the choice between two main strategies. The first one is to continue with  6.Qd2  , go for Queenside castling and attack with moves like Bh6 and h4. It's no surprise that these lines are very sharp and exciting to study.  White's alternative is a more strategic approach, involving moves like a4 and h3, similar to many positions in the Classical Variation.  In the Classical, a sequence like @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Be2  O-O  6.O-O  a6  7.h3  Nc6  8.a4  is played with the same mindset: control the centre and restrain counterplay.

6. Qd2
{ White is after a quick Queenside castling and possibly Bh6 to trade our Bishop. The following lines are very sharp and exciting, so fasten your seatbelts. Instead of  6.Qd2  , White also has the more strategic approach  6.h3  O-O  7.a4  when we play our usual setup with  7...Nc6  , which is similar to the Classical Variation and might even transpose into this line.   There are some interesting differences that we analyze in the dedicated chapter, but if you know the general ideas of the Classical, you are going to be fine for the moment. For the purpose of the Quickstarter, we focus on the sharper attempts starting with  6.Qd2 }
6... O-O
{ We also checked the move  6...b5  here. It is a good alternative, but we think  6...O-O  is a better choice. The main reason is to be consistent with the similar line @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Bf4  a6  5.Nf3  Bg7  6.Qd2  when  6...b5  is less precise due to a quick e5.  The different Bishop placement plays a role in these lines. In the Bf4 sequence, we recommend  6...O-O  , when  7.Bh6  leads to the positions that we will examine here. In the Bf4-version you need to castle on move six, and here we advise you to do the same - this way, it's a common approach in similar lines.   We need to examine some alternatives for White:  7.Bh6  ,  7.Bd3  , and  7.O-O-O  are the moves to check. It's rare but possible for White to play  7.h3  or  7.a4  and return to the realms of lines examined via 6.h3. }
7. Bh6
{ White goes for the Bishop exchange, a typical attacking device. Our Bishop is a crucial defender of the King, so trading it makes a lot of sense.   An additional idea for White is not to take on g7 but to keep the Bishop on h6 and play h4-h5. The Bishop on h6 stops Black's ...h5-reply against h4, which is a commonly seen idea in our repertoire.   Sounds great for White, but there is a downside. This type of play is time-consuming, and our counterplay arrives in time.   Instead of  7.Bh6  , White also has tried  7.O-O-O  , when  7...b5  8.Bd3  c5!  is a new idea that leads to sharp play and good chances for Black. }
7... b5 { We finally launch our counterplay with the b-pawn. } 8. Bxg7
{ White exchanges the dark-squared Bishops right away. This makes out King position somewhat safer, as a one attacking option can be h4-h5, which is more dangerous if White keeps the tension with the Bishops still being on the board.   After the trade on g7 White's h-pawn push could be stopped by ...h5. }
8... Kxg7 9. Bd3
{ White needs to take care of the e4-pawn given our ...b4-idea.  9.Bd3  is a natural way to defend the important pawn.  Instead  9.e5  dxe5  10.dxe5  Qxd2+  leads nowhere, as the advanced e-pawn is more of a liability for White than an asset. }
9... Nc6
{ We develop our Queenside Knight and take more control of the dark squares in the centre of the board. It is somewhat uncommon to place the Knight in front of the c-pawn, but it works well here.   In addition, a setup with ...Bb7 and ...Nbd7 is not possible here, as both  9...Nbd7?  and  9...Bb7?  are refuted by  10.e5  . We are just too slow to complete this setup.   After our choice  9...Nc6  , the only critical test is  10.e5  . A slow move can't trouble Black; we'd have time to play ...e5 with a good game. }
10. e5
{ This is the acid test of our concept. If we'd manage to play ...e5, there is no reason at all why White would have any claim to an advantage. You could even argue that White's pieces are slightly misplaced, as the Bishop on d3.   The move  10.e5  is critical, as it seeks to activate White's pieces with tempo. The play is very concrete and tactical now. }
10... dxe5
{ We need to take on e5 first, so after  10...dxe5  11.dxe5  Ng4  , the pawn is hanging.   After  10...Ng4?  11.Be4  we have no good move. }
11. dxe5 Ng4
{ White's pawn on e5 is under fire. They need to play precisely now to pose any problems. }
12. O-O-O
{ White's best try and the most popular move. After we have traded on e5, the move  12.Be4?  is just awful for White after  12...Qxd2+  13.Kxd2  Bb7  shows. White's King is stuck in the centre, and  e5  is weak.   White also has  12.Qf4?!  , which falls into the trap  12...Ncxe5!  13.Nxe5  Qd6!  which is already a bit better for Black. }
12... Ngxe5
{ We suggest taking this hanging pawn. As the saying goes: 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating', right?  Well, this move is a novelty, as all games so far featured  12...b4  . We examined this move closely, but prefer our choice. Black's idea behind  12...b4  is to kick White's Knight to a less optimal square and only then take on e5.  The critical line runs  12...b4  13.Rhe1!  Rb8  14.Na4  Qd5  15.b3  Ncxe5  16.Nxe5  Nxe5  17.Bf1  Qxd2+  18.Rxd2  . This is a very deep line, but it is quite forced and has been reached in multiple games. Black is a pawn up, but White has excellent compensation. We think this line is promising for White - Black has a tough defensive job.  That was a long detour, but it is good to know why we deviate from existing theory. Now, what happens after the capture on e5? The next few moves are more or less forced when we reach an important parting of the ways on move 17 }
13. Nxe5 { The most natural and only dangerous move. } 13... Nxe5 14. Qe2
{ Again, the most testing, forcing us to take on d3. Instead  14.Qe3  Ng4  or @@StartFEN@@r1bq1r2/2p1ppkp/p5p1/1p2n3/8/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 14@@EndFEN@@  14.Qf4  Qd6  are harmless. }

4. Bg5
{ This is one of White's more aggressive setups. Similar to  4.Be3  White aims for rapid Queenside development.  Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses. There is no 'one size fits all' approach or a 'setup' to go for. Each line leads to different position types and needs a specific answer.   We will examine  4.Bg5  in two chapters. The present one covers all options for White after  4...Bg7  except the most popular move,  5.Qd2  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter. }

5. f4

By playing f4 White signals the intention to play e5 soon, an idea that we always need to have on the radar.   This idea might be more potent than usual because the Bishop on g5 often allows tactical ideas based on the vis-a-vis with our Queen. The Bishop on g5 might be an annoyance for us, but it is also a liability for White. We might play...h6 in the right moment when Bh4 leaves the Bishop unprotected on h4.   This point sounds less relevant at first, but hang on. An additional fact: the square e3 is weak in White's camp, which often invites ...Ng4 to hit this square. And last but not least, the setup Bg5 & f4 weakens White's control over d4 and c5. We might either push ...c5 or ...e5 to take advantage of the comparably weak d4-pawn, based on concrete tactics.

Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses.

After Qd2, we should stop the threat Bh6.  With  5...h6  , we gain a tempo at the cost of weakening our Kingside position.

6. Bf4
{ A good alternative to White's mainline. White keeps pressure on the h6-pawn and stops Kingside castling. }
6... a6
{ Some Black players play  6...g5  in this situation, but we like the more flexible move  6...a6  , which is similar to other choices in our repertoire.  We avoid Kingside weaknesses and prepare our Queenside counterplay as quickly as possible. The move has the added benefit of surprise value.

Shaw recommends to 'castle and develop actively, possibly throwing in e4-e5 if suitable' in cases where Black avoids  6...g5  .   We'll see that Black is well prepared to meet these ideas. The moves to check are  7.e5?!  ,  7.f3  , and the most testing in our view,  7.Nf3 }

It is terrible, however, to play  7...b5?  . After  8.Bd3  White is threatening e4-e5 with fatal consequences. }
8. Be3

This concept is also seen in the Italian game after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bc4  , which is why we decided to call the line 'Italian Pirc'.

He calls it the 'Short Attack', but we have only found one game played by Nigel Short in this variation, and this happened to be a simultaneous event.  Well, back to the actual merits of the move. Playing the Bishop to the 'Italian square' looks like a reasonable choice, but what are the drawbacks? There are two, one tactical and one strategic.  The tactical one is related to the idea ...Nxe4, followed by d6-d5. A typical line to illustrate this idea is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.O-O  Nxe4!  7.Nxe4  d5  , which gives us good play.

After ...O-O, the capture on f7 can be answered with ...Rxf7!, keeping our King safe.   The slight strategic drawback of the move  4.Bc4  is that in some lines, Black manages to generate play on the dark squares, as the pinning move ...Bg4 gains strength.

4... Bg7

White has many other moves, like  5.Be3  ,  5.Bg5  ,  5.Nge2  or  5.f3  .  They are not particularly threatening, but we'll check some of these ideas. }
5. Qe2
{ If White avoids the classical setup with Nf3, the move  5.Qe2  is likely the choice. White's idea is to push his e-pawn to e5 and possibly to e6. }
5... Nc6
{ We have many alternatives, such as castling or playing ...c6. However, 5... Nc6 is an interesting move. It points at a drawback of the early 5. Qe2: the pawn on d4 is weak and now needs some protection. }
6. e5
{ Wait, what? Shouldn't White be worried about d4? Still, this aggressive pawn push is the move you will most likely face in this position. White doesn't care about d4 and instead attacks our Knight.   After the less aggressive move  6.Nf3  Black is fine with  6...Bg4  and ...e5 next, fighting for the dark central squares. }
6... Ng4
{ We suggest  6...Ng4  , instead of picking up the gauntlet with  6...Nxd4  . We think that  6...Ng4  is a good move, and we suggest a new idea for Black in the main continuation. More on that later, once we check the details.  The second point is that we are sceptical about Black's chances after  6...Nxd4  , which forces the following sequence  7.exf6  Nxe2  8.fxg7  Rg8  9.Ngxe2  Rxg7  10.Bh6  Rg8  11.O-O-O  . A fascinating line that features a unique material balance, but we felt that it is easier to play with White. Black's main reply is  11...Be6  , when  12.Bxe6  fxe6  13,  h4  was the line that we disliked.   White still keeps the option to play f3 and place a Knight on the secure square e4. These lines are unconventional, and you might have a different opinion on Black's prospects If you like these positions - it is forced after  6...Nxd4  to move 13 - you can go for  6...Nxd4  .   We decided to avoid  6...Nxd4  , also for a psychological reason. White invited this line and likely feels at home if we accept the challenge. On the other hand, our move  6...Ng4  leads to entirely different positions.  As a nice bonus, White now frequently falls into a trap - let's look at the mistake  7.e6?  and White's only good move,  7.Bb5 }
7. Bb5
{ The only good move for White. The pawn centre is under heavy pressure, and playing  7.Bb5  and taking on c6 next is the only way to keep it stable.  We think that an aggressive player on the White side won't be happy with this scenario. The arising positions are objectively equal, but White's attacking chances are diminished without the active Bishop.   Instead  7.e6?  is a mistake, as  7...Nxd4!  8.Qxg4  Nxc2+  is winning for Black. }
7... O-O 8. Bxc6
{ No choice for White. The pawn on d4 was hanging, and e5 was attacked multiple times. }
8... bxc6
{ Now White has to start with  9.h3  . The natural move  9.Nf3  is a mistake. }
9. h3 Nh6 10. Nf3
{ White has successfully navigated all the pitfalls and now reached this position. We suggest a new move for Black now. }
10... Qd7
{ Yes, this looks very odd at first, but there is a method to the madness. The concept is best explained by looking at the move  10...f6  . This move is very logical, as the e5-pawn hampers Black's position. If we manage to play ...f6 and White needs to take on f6 or d6, we have accomplished a lot.  Removing the e5-pawn and, on a perfect day, the d4-pawn is the dream scenario for our Bishops. So, why not  10...f6  , then? There are two issues with the move.  The first, less problematic one, is  11.exf6  exf6  12.Qc4+  , which wins a pawn for White. Black has some compensation, so this wouldn't be a show stopper   The real issue is @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/p1p1p1bp/2pp1ppn/4P3/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11@@EndFEN@@  11.e6!?  , which is tough to play for Black. The h6-Knight is stranded, and it is not clear how to organize the forces.   Instead of  10...f6  , the move  10...Nf5  came into consideration. But White replies  11.Bf4  and retains the option to castle Queenside.   By now, you probably have guessed the intention of  10...Qd7!?  . We want to play ...f6 or ...Nf5 at the right moment, without the worries, just described.   The Queen looks odd on d7, but hang on: it has an active prospect that is not so obvious at the moment. Our move is a novelty, so what replies to check? We think  10.O-O  and  10.Bf4  makes the most sense, so we'll examine these moves. }
11. O-O

12. Re1

13... Bb7
{ Our Bishop on b7 is a great piece, ruling on the long diagonal.   We have excellent play for the pawn and good chances to grab the initiative. The Queen coming to c6 will already set up the threat ...Nd4 - not easy for White to handle.   To conclude the analysis: we think that 6... Ng4 is a good practical choice for Black.

4. g3
{ This move introduces the Fianchetto Variation. By playing  4.g3  , White signals that he is not going for a furious attack on our King. White instead wants to build up a solid position and control the game. It's a good variation for the type of White player who likes a positional game with relatively low risk.  White's most common way to develop is Bg2, Nge2, O-O, h3, Be3 and Qd2. In many cases, White wants to gain space on the Kingside after castling by playing f4, g4, and possibly f4-f5 or g4-g5 later on.  The Bishop on g2 will protect the important e4-pawn and discourages an advance of our b-pawn due to a possible e4-e5 push. Therefore we don't play for a Queenside expansion but prefer to play in the centre.  Our approach is playing a quick ...e5, followed by ...exd4.

On the other hand,  5...h5  is less dependent on concrete memorization and more of a strategic nature. The drawback of  5...h5  is that we lose some time and also weaken our Kingside position. White might play g2-g4 later on, to open lines at the Kingside, but this is not easy to accomplish. A more common scenario is reached when White uses the g5-square for his pieces. It's hard to get rid of them because ...h6 is out of the picture, and ...f6 is rarely an option.  Let's check some concrete lines now. A common theme is that we are not castling quickly, but rather seek counterplay through ...Nc6 and/or ...a6 as we do in many other lines in this repertoire.  A notable exception is a quick O-O by White, when we don't mind placing our King on the Kingside, too. }

We suggest playing  3...e5  , immediately claiming central space. This move is commonly regarded as Black's best answer to 3.Bd3, as  3...g6  should be avoided as described above.  After  3...e5  , White needs to decide about the d-pawn: trading on e5, advancing to d5 or covering it are the options.  We'll examine all of them, but here's a quick overview. The trade is harmless and immediately gives Black equal chances. More interesting is  4.d5  , which leads to a closed centre formation in King's Indian style. This pawn structure frequently arises in our repertoire, for example, in the Classical Variation. White has more space, but we are well set to gain counterplay by preparing ...f5, which leads to a tense game.  More often than not, White prefers to cover the d4-pawn. After  4.Nf3  or  4.Ne2  we suggest to take on d4 and play with ...g6, again leading to a structure that we have seen in other parts of the repertoire.   However, the move that you will encounter most of the time is  4.c3  . White wants to keep his pawn duo d4 & e4, which looks very logical.

We suggest playing  3...e5  , immediately claiming central space. This move is commonly regarded as Black's best answer to 3.Bd3, as  3...g6  should be avoided as described above.  After  3...e5  , White needs to decide about the d-pawn: trading on e5, advancing to d5 or covering it are the options.  We'll examine all of them, but here's a quick overview. The trade is harmless and immediately gives Black equal chances. More interesting is  4.d5  , which leads to a closed centre formation in King's Indian style. This pawn structure frequently arises in our repertoire, for example, in the Classical Variation. White has more space, but we are well set to gain counterplay by preparing ...f5, which leads to a tense game.  More often than not, White prefers to cover the d4-pawn. After  4.Nf3  or  4.Ne2  we suggest to take on d4 and play with ...g6, again leading to a structure that we have seen in other parts of the repertoire.   However, the move that you will encounter most of the time is  4.c3  . White wants to keep his pawn duo d4 & e4, which looks very logical. Against this move, we suggest a less explored and exciting move,  4...Nbd7  . It does not look too exciting at first glance, but after White's natural reply  5.Nf3  , we play  5...d5!  and start fun complications right away.

We saw some specific drawbacks about every line, while  3...g6  looked like it leads to the most interesting positions.   Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.   B.  3...c5  is often recommended when  4.d5  leads to a good Benoni-style play. But we didn't like  4.dxc5  in some lines that closely resemble a Sicilian Defence and looked tricky to play.   C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.  We think that  3...g6  is Black's best move if you look for a fight and want to play exciting Chess. The following lines will be full of dynamic ideas and tactics, so get ready for some fun complications! }
3... g6
{ We recommend playing  3...g6  and allow White to switch to the King's Indian S√§misch with  4.c4  .  This is not White's only option, though.

However, White's main alternative to  4.c4  is the flexible move  4.Be3  which we need to answer precisely. }
4. c4
{ White immediately reveals that transposing to a King's Indian S√§misch is welcome.  White also has  4.Be3  which is a clever choice, still keeping some flexibility. White develops the Bishop to a good square but does not yet commit to a Queenside formation. White may still play the pawn to c4, but placing the Knight in front of the c-pawn is possible, too.  This would steer the game into the chapter on 4.Be3 when a quick f3 is a common continuation. We need to play a move that fits into both scenarios. It needs to be useful if White plays with c4, but also if they transpose to a regular Pirc line. We answer with  4...a6!  which fits the bill. After  5.Qd2  we suggest  5...Nbd7  to still be flexible. White is running out of flexible moves then and will likely play  6.c4  or  6.Nc3  to transpose to the 4.Be3 complex or a main line of the S√§misch. }

Here White never needs to play d4-d5, and Black has no way to pressure d4. Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next. These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too.   As mentioned before, White may also develop with  6.Bg5  when we play  6...a6  and aim for the line  7.Qd2  c5  8.d5  b5!  , giving Black good play in the spirit of the Benko Gambit.

8. Bd3
{ White has Nge2 in mind, but does not want to block the f1-Bishop and play it to d3 first.   The setup with Bd3 and Nge2 makes a very harmonious impression but does not change our counterplay concept much. We'll play for the Queenside expansion with ...c6 and ...b5. }
8... c6
{ We don't like  8...c5  here, because White can continue to keep the tension in the centre with  9.Nge2  and never will advance the d-pawn.  9.d5?  b5!  would be great for Black, but we don't have enough pressure on the d4-pawn to force this advance.

Now White needs to decide if they want to allow ...b5 or not. }
9. Nge2
{ White focuses on the development and avoids a possible weakening of the Queenside. After  9.a4  we'd play  9...e5  , when  10.d5  cxd5  11.cxd5  Nh5!  gives Black interesting play with ...f5 on the agenda. This is explored more in the main course. }

The basic idea of  10...e5  is to open up the centre and neutralize the space advantage. After the centre opens, our Bishop on g7 will be a strong piece that often even gives Black hope for an advantage. }
11. Rad1
{ White keeps the tension. After  11.d5  bxc4  12.Bxc4  Nb6  our counterplay against White's centre works perfectly. White has no good way to keep control of d5, for example, after  13.Bb3  cxd5  14.Nxd5  Nfxd5  15.exd5  a5  Black is in good shape. The threat ...a4 is annoying for White, and ...Ba6 is an attractive option. }

12. b3
{ White gives c4 some additional support. This move is less innocent than it looks at first sight. }
12... exd4
{ We have to take now! A move like  12...Re8?  is answered by  13.d5!  when White is ready to answer  13...bxc4  with  14.bxc4  which maintains the pawn on d5.

13. Nxd4 Re8
{ A natural move to involve our Rook. Now there are many possibilities for both sides; the position is not very forcing.  We'll have a look at one idea worth knowing. After  14.Rfe1  Black can keep the tension with  14...Qa5  or  14...Ne5  , but  14...b4!?  is an interesting option, when  15.Na4  c5  might look strange at first, as Black has the backward pawn on d6.  This is not a problem, though. After  16.Ne2  Nh5  17.Bc2  Bf8  the pawn is always protected. We get e5 as a good post for our Knight. We claim that the Bishop on c2 is not better than ours on f8.

This variation usually starts with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.f3  and leads to a tense struggle, featuring many dynamic possibilities.

Before we discuss details, we'd like to point out that Black has some alternatives to  3...g6  , but we decided against recommending them. We saw some specific drawbacks about every line, while  3...g6  looked like it leads to the most interesting positions.   Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.   B.  3...c5  is often recommended when  4.d5  leads to a good Benoni-style play. But we didn't like  4.dxc5  in some lines that closely resemble a Sicilian Defence and looked tricky to play.   C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.  We think that  3...g6  is Black's best move if you look for a fight and want to play exciting Chess. The following lines will be full of dynamic ideas and tactics, so get ready for some fun complications! }
3... g6
{ We recommend playing  3...g6  and allow White to switch to the King's Indian S√§misch with  4.c4  .  This is not White's only option, though. It is also possible to play  4.Nc3  when we directly transpose to @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  d6  2.d4  Nf6  3.Nc3  g6  4.f3  .   However, White's main alternative to  4.c4  is the flexible move  4.Be3  which we need to answer precisely. }
4. c4
{ White immediately reveals that transposing to a King's Indian S√§misch is welcome.  White also has  4.Be3  which is a clever choice, still keeping some flexibility. White develops the Bishop to a good square but does not yet commit to a Queenside formation. White may still play the pawn to c4, but placing the Knight in front of the c-pawn is possible, too.  This would steer the game into the chapter on 4.Be3 when a quick f3 is a common continuation. We need to play a move that fits into both scenarios. It needs to be useful if White plays with c4, but also if they transpose to a regular Pirc line. We answer with  4...a6!  which fits the bill. After  5.Qd2  we suggest  5...Nbd7  to still be flexible. White is running out of flexible moves then and will likely play  6.c4  or  6.Nc3  to transpose to the 4.Be3 complex or a main line of the S√§misch. }
4... Bg7 5. Nc3 O-O
{ Don't worry if you 'accidentally' play  5...a6  here. We will play ...a6 on move six 'against everything', so it will just be a transposition after a sequence like @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5...a6  6.Be3  O-O  .   Now, after  5...O-O  we arrive at a crossroads when White decides their placement of the c1-Bishop. The main continuation is  6.Be3  but developing the Bishop to g5 is possible too.  White may also play  6.Nge2  first, and only after Black's reply decide on the Bishop placement when  6.Nge2  a6  7.Be3  transposes to @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Bg5  a6  7.Nge2  .

Now, what's the difference between  6.Be3  and  6.Bg5?  There are two main points. First of all, the Bishop on g5 might pin Black's Knight after a later ...e7-e5 pawn move. This is best demonstrated with the line  6...e5??  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Nd5  and White wins. Well, we don't play with a quick ...e5 anyway, so no big deal.  As we have seen, the Bishop is more active on g5 in this regard, but there is a drawback. White neglects the control of d4 and c5, which does not apply to  6.Be3  . This fact is very relevant for our repertoire suggestion. If White plays Bg5, it is easy for Black to play ...c5 and, if necessary, apply more pressure on d4 with ...Nc6.   Let's check: the mainline of  6.Bg5  in our repertoire is  6.Bg5  a6  7.Qd2  c5  8.d5  b5!  which is very attractive for Black to play. We adopt the concept of the Benko Gambit @@StartBracket@@ @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  3.d5  b5  @@EndBracket@@ to obtain an initiative on the Queenside.

Now, after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  7...Nbd7  8.Nge2  a setup based on  8...c5  is an entirely different story compared to the Bg5-scenario. Here White never needs to play d4-d5, and Black has no way to pressure d4. Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next. These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too.   As mentioned before, White may also develop with  6.Bg5  when we play  6...a6  and aim for the line  7.Qd2  c5  8.d5  b5!  , giving Black good play in the spirit of the Benko Gambit. This is discussed in more detail in the main course. }
6... a6
{ Our signature move in the 3.f3-line. We prepare counterplay on the Queenside with ...b5, in many cases supported by ...c6.   It is important to note that White can use the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  when  4...a6  is our recommended answer.

The charm of the ...a6-concept is its universal usability against White's possible move order tricks. After  6...a6  White's most popular move is  7.Qd2  but you also meet  7.Nge2  frequently. Both moves will often lead to the same positions, as  7.Qd2  Nbd7  8.Nge2  and @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Nge2  Nbd7  8.Qd2  are very natural sequences.

7... b5
{ This fantastic resource is one of the lines that makes the early ...a6 an attractive choice. White's Knight move to e2 has a drawback: it lessens control over b5, which allows this dynamic option!   It turns out we don't even need to spend a tempo on ...c6 to prepare the b-pawn advance. So, why does this move work? We'll check the details shortly, but the basic idea is  8.cxb5  axb5  9.Nxb5  c6  10.Nbc3  Nbd7  followed by ...e5 and ...d5, blasting open the centre. White is behind in development, and the King is far away from castling, so this is enough for a pawn.   Alright, let's investigate some details now. Does White have to take on b5? Well, they almost always play this move, but we'll also check the move  8.Qd2  intending Bh6 next. }
8. cxb5
{ By far White's main move. Modern engines immediately show that Black has enough compensation, but this is far from obvious for a human player on the White side.   If you have never seen the idea, it might look like Black is playing recklessly. }
8... axb5 9. Nxb5 c6
{ The first step of Black's concept. We want to play ...c6, ...Nbd7, ...e5, and ...d5, which detonates the centre while White is not fully developed. A great feature of this concept is that it pretty much works against everything that White may try.   White has tried to untangle the Kingside in various ways, and the described standard idea works like a charm. Let's have a look at the ideas in action. }
10. Nbc3 Nbd7
{ The plan is ...Nbd7, ...e5 and ...d5, as usual in this line.   We'll now examine  11.Qd2  as the main move. The position after  11.Qd2  very often arises via the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Qd2  Nbd7  8.Nge2  b5!  9.cxb5  axb5  10.Nxb5  c6  11.Nbc3  which makes it the most important one to check. }
11. Qd2
{ White can also try to play without this move and move the e2-Knight to prepare a quick Be2 and O-O. We'll play in the usual fashion, going for ...e5 and ...d5 to open the game.   Here's a sample line:  11.Nc1  e5  12.Be2  d5  13.Nb3  exd4  14.Nxd4  Qb6  , when again we have good chances to use White's lack of coordination. We threaten ...c5 and ... Qxb2 in the final position of the sample line.   White can also try  11.Ng3  but our concept would be the same against this move. }
11... e5
{ We found 36 games in Mega Database 2021 that reached this position; White's score is terrible with nine wins and 21 losses! White has tried eight@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ different moves now, but we don't need to examine them all in detail.  We'll check White's most frequently played move  12.dxe5  which sees White struggling for equality, and the engine's recommendation  12.Rd1  which looks like a reasonable defence for White. }
12. dxe5
{ This move is played most of the time, but we can hardly talk about 'a popular move'.  In most cases, White was likely unprepared and needed to find a solution over the board.  12.dxe5  looks natural, but in analysis, you quickly see that White is struggling after the capture on e5. }
12... Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ Instead  13.Ng3  h5!  also gives Black nice play for the pawn. The threat h5-h4-h3 is powerful so that White probably needs to play  14.h4  when the White King never will find a safe spot anymore. }
13... d5 14. exd5
{ Here  14.f4  Neg4  15.e5  Nxe3  16.Qxe3  is great for Black after the simple  16...Ng4  , with ...Qb6 & ...f6 to come. White can't withstand this attack. }
14... Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Qxd5
{ Black has a fantastic attacking position for just one pawn. Stockfish already claims that Black is completely winning. This is not immediately obvious, but it is clear that White is in deep trouble. }

One notable exception is the Grand Prix setup of f4/Nc3/Bc4, which we recommend fighting differently.

{ We suggest playing this move, instead of our usual approach to continue with  6...c5  . The move  6...c5  is not a mistake in this position, but we dislike it for practical reasons. After  6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  we have transposed to a line that usually arises from the Sicilian.  The Sicilian move order is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.f4  g6  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Bc4  when more or less all the experts play  5...e6  and ...Nge7 to blunt White's Bishop. This has a good reputation for Black and is the reason why the Bc4-Grand Prix is a rare guest at the professional level.   However, looking at our position after a possible  6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  we would have played ...d6 and ...Nf6, which is a lot less desirable than a ...e6 and ...Nge7 plan. White often obtains a dangerous attack with simple means, most notably Qe1-h4 and f4-f5. White makes good use of the Bishop on c4, which is pointing towards our King.  We analyzed these lines and felt that Black needs to be very precise to withstand White's attacks. So while  6...c5  is not a mistake in a purely theoretical sense @@StartBracket@@Black should equalize@@EndBracket@@, we felt that White's practical job is a lot easier.  Searching for other ideas, we found  6...Nc6  to be a good option. What's the point of  6...Nc6?  . The idea is fairly straightforward. White needs to decide whether they want to allow ...Na5, when the c4-Bishop has no way to retreat and avoid being captures. After  7.O-O  Na5!  we'd make sure to get the Bishop and remove a dangerous attacker. White can prevent this scenario with  7.a3  but this is rather slow and gives us a good choice between  7.a3  Bg4  or  7...e5  .  These lines don't require much study time and promise an easier life than the transposition into a Sicilian line that is tricky to handle. }
7. O-O
{ Most of the time, White allows the ...Na5 idea and just castles.  If White plays  7.a3  we suggest  7...Bg4  . The threat ...Nd4 is annoying for White, so  8.h3  Bxf3  9.Qxf3  Nd4  10.Qf2  c5  is a logical sequence that gives Black good play on the Queenside with ...b5 to follow. }
7... Na5
{ According to the concept started with @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2B1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6@@EndFEN@@ 6... Nc6: we chase the dangerous c4-Bishop if White created no flight square. }
8. Bb3
{ White doesn't want to allow the doubled pawn on the c-file and retreats. }
8... e6
{ We don't need to take on b3 immediately. White has no good way to prevent the capture anyway. With  8...e6  we gain some control on the light squares and make f4-f5 difficult to play for White. Our c8-Bishop will find a good spot on b7 later. }
9. Qe1
{ White starts the typical Queen journey to h4, aiming for a Kingside attack. }
9... a6
{ A difficult move, but it makes perfect sense given White's idea Qh4. Now we can answer  10.Qh4  with  10...Nd7  when  11.Qxd8  Rxd8  does not run into Nb5. }
10. Qh4 Nd7 { Or  10...Nh5  , with a similar idea. } 11. Qg3
{ The Queen trade would be very toothless. White can't prevent ...Nxb3, and we'd enjoy the prospect of an endgame with the Bishop-pair advantage.   Instead of  11.Qg3  White has other Queen moves, like  11.Qh3  . Our approach would be the same as after 11.Qg3: trade on b3 and play ...f5 next. }
11... Nxb3 { We capture now, preparing the next move. } 12. axb3 f5
{ A typical idea to remember. We stop any f4-f5 ambition and intend ...b6 and ...Nf6 next, putting pressure on e4. We are happy with Black's prospects here, as White has no attack on our King and we have the long-term asset of the Bishop-pair.   We think that @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2B1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6...Nc6  is a good weapon against the Grand Prix setup.

By playing  1...d6  we stop White from pushing e4-e5 for the time being. We plan to develop our Kingside by fianchettoing the dark-squared Bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7. The Knight usually jumps to f6, and we are ready to castle Kingside quickly. }
2. Nc3
{ Our move 1...d6 does not stop White from playing 2.d4, and usually White accepts this invitation to build the perfect central pawn duo. It is by far the mainline, and it makes a lot of sense, of course.   However, White might avoid all the main lines that arise after  2.d4  and choose one of many second move alternatives. None of White's alternatives is theoretically challenging, but our opponents might play a pet setup that they also employ against other openings, particularly the Sicilian.

Most of White's offbeat lines against the Pirc follow a similar approach. White plays a combination of Bc4 and f4 - Grand Prix style - or plays with g3 like in the Closed Variation of the Sicilian. In almost all cases, we will suggest completing the Kingside development and playing ...c5 quickly to transpose into a harmless variation of the Sicilian.  One notable exception is the Grand Prix setup of f4/Nc3/Bc4, which we recommend fighting differently. In the main course, we examine some more offbeat ideas for White, while in the Quickstarter we focus on the two mentioned setups: the Closed Sicilian and Grand Prix style formations.

4. Bg2
{ White still could play  4.d4  to transpose into a regular Pirc line, the Fianchetto Variation which we have examinedhere. }
4... Bg7 5. d3 O-O 6. f4
{ White's most active way of playing this closed position is to involve the f-pawn. They could play more passively, for example, with  6.Nge2  or  6.Nf3  . Against these formations, you could play in the same way as against  6.f4  . Play ...c5, ...Nc6 and start a Queenside offensive with ...b5, ...a5 and so on.  You'll see some more ideas in our main continuation  6.f4  as Black's plans are the same. }
6... c5 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. O-O Rb8
{ Black's play is focused on the Queenside. Our g7-Bishop points to this side of the board, and we'd like to gain more space by pushing the b-pawn.   While we do our thing on the Queenside, White will expand on the Kingside. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4
{ This chapter and the following examine the Austrian Attack, which starts with  4.f4  . White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later.  The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.  The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent. With  4.f4  White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away.  The game's direction is not as apparent after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  , when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular line is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This line is examined in three chapters.   B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A, White may also play  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  , which hints at a possible queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.   C. After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise. In slower lines, like the Classical Variation @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Be2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.g3  , Black can get away with knowing only some concrete lines and ideas.  If you try to fight the Austrian Attack with vague ideas, you might just get destroyed. The upside is: if you know what to do, you'll be fine.  Let's start and have a look at White's sidelines on move 5 and  6. }
4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  In the current chapter, we examine ways for White to deviate from the main lines. The following lines are relatively rare.  We don't get too detailed here and instead focus on the critical lines in the next chapters. The more dangerous exceptions from the main lines are variations that feature a quick e4-e5, attacking us quickly. }
5. Bd3
{ An interesting move order for White. The more usual way to play is  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , so what's the point of starting with the Bishop move? Well, after  5.Nf3  , we play  5...O-O  , but a popular alternative for Black is  5...c5  6.dxc5  Qa5  .   By starting with  5.Bd3  , White wants to make it more difficult for Black to play ...c5. After  5.Bd3  c5  , he could play  6.dxc5  and Black lacks the usual counterplay with  6...Qa5  due to Bd3, the pin on the c3-knight would not matter. Given that, we don't intend to play with ...c5 and this move order nuance is less relevant for us.   After  5.Bd3  , our primary decision is between  5...O-O  and  5...Nc6  . Both moves seem perfectly fine and will likely transpose to the main lines after @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Bd3  O-O  6.Nf3  Nc6  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Bd3  Nc6  6.Nf3  O-O  , leading to the same position. }
5... O-O
{ We recommend castling first. It is possible to play  5...Nc6  with a possible transposition to the main lines after  6.Nf3  O-O  . White may deviate with @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2NB4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5...Nc6  6.e5  , though.   The pawn push is also possible after our move, so it makes sense to compare. We feel that  5...O-O  6.e5  is a bit easier for Black to handle in comparison. We have not yet placed a knight on c6, which allows a quick ...c5 in many positions.   To summarize:  5...Nc6  will also likely transpose, but our life seems a bit easier by starting with  5...O-O  . }
6. e5
{ This pawn advance is very rarely played. White's best move, and by far the most popular, is  6.Nf3  transposing to the mainline of the Austrian Attack, which we will examinehere.  The pawn advance leads to sharp play but provides great counter chances for Black. }
6... Ne8
{ This move looks best, in our mind.

We want to add that playing the knight to e8, instead of d7, has two upsides: we avoid a possible pawn sacrifice e5-e6!? and also allow ...Bc8-g4, which may come in handy to increase the pressure on White's centre.   The whole line  6.e5  is rather rare, and  6...Ne8  is a novelty. Therefore we don't want to drown you with lines, but rather want to illustrate some key ideas. }
7. Nf3 c5
{ We tear down the centre in the quickest possible way.  White's King is still in the centre of the board, and we are better developed. Therefore we like to open up the position as fast as possible. After  7...c5  White is not able to support his centre and needs to give it up. }
8. Be3 { This would be a mistake. } 8... cxd4 9. Bxd4 Nc6

The most popular line is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This line is examined in three chapters.   B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A, White may also play  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  , which hints at a possible queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.   C. After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise.

If you try to fight the Austrian Attack with vague ideas, you might just get destroyed. The upside is: if you know what to do, you'll be fine.  Let's start and have a look at White's sidelines on move 5 and  6. }
4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  In the current chapter, we examine ways for White to deviate from the main lines. The following lines are relatively rare.  We don't get too detailed here and instead focus on the critical lines in the next chapters. The more dangerous exceptions from the main lines are variations that feature a quick e4-e5, attacking us quickly. }
5. Bd3
{ An interesting move order for White. The more usual way to play is  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , so what's the point of starting with the Bishop move? Well, after  5.Nf3  , we play  5...O-O  , but a popular alternative for Black is  5...c5  6.dxc5  Qa5  .   By starting with  5.Bd3  , White wants to make it more difficult for Black to play ...c5. After  5.Bd3  c5  , he could play  6.dxc5  and Black lacks the usual counterplay with  6...Qa5  due to Bd3, the pin on the c3-knight would not matter. Given that, we don't intend to play with ...c5 and this move order nuance is less relevant for us.   After  5.Bd3  , our primary decision is between  5...O-O  and  5...Nc6  . Both moves seem perfectly fine and will likely transpose to the main lines after @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Bd3  O-O  6.Nf3  Nc6  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Bd3  Nc6  6.Nf3  O-O  , leading to the same position. }
5... O-O
{ We recommend castling first. It is possible to play  5...Nc6  with a possible transposition to the main lines after  6.Nf3  O-O  . White may deviate with @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2NB4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5...Nc6  6.e5  , though.   The pawn push is also possible after our move, so it makes sense to compare. We feel that  5...O-O  6.e5  is a bit easier for Black to handle in comparison. We have not yet placed a knight on c6, which allows a quick ...c5 in many positions.   To summarize:  5...Nc6  will also likely transpose, but our life seems a bit easier by starting with  5...O-O  . }
6. e5
{ This pawn advance is very rarely played. White's best move, and by far the most popular, is  6.Nf3  transposing to the mainline of the Austrian Attack, which we will examinehere.  The pawn advance leads to sharp play but provides great counter chances for Black. }
6... Ne8
{ This move looks best, in our mind. It is useful to compare to @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Nf3  O-O  6.e5  when we advise to play  6...dxe5  . In this line, the move  6...Ne8?!  is too passive. White has good replies in  7.Bc4  or  7.Be3  and maintains better chances.  The knight on f3 proves to be more useful than Bd3, compared to @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Bd3  O-O  6.e5  , when  6...Ne8  is a way to prove that 6.e5 might have been too optimistic.  Indeed, Black seems to have no problems, and White even has to avoid some pitfalls. We want to add that playing the knight to e8, instead of d7, has two upsides: we avoid a possible pawn sacrifice e5-e6!? and also allow ...Bc8-g4, which may come in handy to increase the pressure on White's centre.   The whole line  6.e5  is rather rare, and  6...Ne8  is a novelty. Therefore we don't want to drown you with lines, but rather want to illustrate some key ideas. }
7. Nf3 c5
{ We tear down the centre in the quickest possible way.  White's King is still in the centre of the board, and we are better developed. Therefore we like to open up the position as fast as possible. After  7...c5  White is not able to support his centre and needs to give it up. }
8. dxc5 { This is the best move according to the engine. } 8... dxe5
{ Very important! We want to destroy White's centre and  8...dxe5  accomplishes just that. After  8...dxc5?  White would be able to maintain the strong pawn on e5 and our Knight is looking silly. }
9. fxe5 Nc6
{ We develop a piece and attack the e5-pawn at the same time. White has an extra pawn, but both e5 and c5 are weak. Natural moves like ...Bg4 and ...Qa5 increase the pressure on these targets. }
10. Qe2 { White defends the e5-pawn. } 10... Bg4
{ We pin White's Nf3, thus the e5-pawn is under attack again. } 11. Bf4 Qa5 12.
O-O-O { White can't play  12.O-O?  Qxc5+  , dropping the pawn with check. }
12... Qxc5
{ Black has a slight advantage in this position. Our Knight will jump to c7 and possibly to e6 next. }

{ This chapter and the following examine the Austrian Attack, which starts with  4.f4  . White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later.  The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.  The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent. With  4.f4  White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away.  The game's direction is not as apparent after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  , when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular line is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This line is examined in three chapters.   B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A, White may also play  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  , which hints at a possible queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.   C. After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise. In slower lines, like the Classical Variation @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Be2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.g3  , Black can get away with knowing only some concrete lines and ideas.  If you try to fight the Austrian Attack with vague ideas, you might just get destroyed. The upside is: if you know what to do, you'll be fine.  Let's start and have a look at White's sidelines on move 5 and  6. }
4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  In the current chapter, we examine ways for White to deviate from the main lines. The following lines are relatively rare.  We don't get too detailed here and instead focus on the critical lines in the next chapters. The more dangerous exceptions from the main lines are variations that feature a quick e4-e5, attacking us quickly. }
5. a3
{ This move looks odd, but it has some merit. White is aware of the line  5.Nf3  c5  6.dxc5  Qa5  , and intends to play in the following way: @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.a3  c5  6.dxc5  Qa5  7.b4  showing the idea of the a-pawn move.

A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.  The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent. With  4.f4  White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away.  The game's direction is not as apparent after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  , when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular line is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This line is examined in three chapters.   B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A, White may also play  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  , which hints at a possible queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.   C. After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise.

If you try to fight the Austrian Attack with vague ideas, you might just get destroyed. The upside is: if you know what to do, you'll be fine.

4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  In the current chapter, we examine ways for White to deviate from the main lines. The following lines are relatively rare.  We don't get too detailed here and instead focus on the critical lines in the next chapters. The more dangerous exceptions from the main lines are variations that feature a quick e4-e5, attacking us quickly. }

The game's direction is not as apparent after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  , when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A.

After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that.

A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent. With  4.f4  White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away.  The game's direction is not as apparent after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  , when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular line is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This line is examined in three chapters.   B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A, White may also play  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  , which hints at a possible queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.   C. After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise.

6. Bc4

7. Bxf7+
{ Here  7.Nxe4?  d5  8.Bd3  dxe4  9.Bxe4  c5  is already better for Black.  The f4-pawn is a serious weakness in White's camp, and the position is about to open quickly to expose this problem. }
7... Rxf7 8. Nxe4 h6
{ Or  8...d5  , in both cases with fine play for Black.  This is very similar to the lines after 4.Bc4, but with White having played the additional move f4. We intend to make use of the Bishop-pair long-term. }

With the Bishop on e2, after  6.Be2  c5!  7.dxc5  Qa5  White has no time to take on d6, as we threaten the pawn on e4. Still, taking on c5 is White's most popular move by far. }
7. d5
{ White closes the centre and creates a pawn structure commonly known as a Benoni. This version of the Benoni is fine for Black, as we quickly start counterplay in the centre. }
7... e6
{ We strike first before White gets to prepare a dangerous e4-e5 break. This is important to do because White's aggressive pawn formation involving f4 does not harmonize well with the passive e2-Bishop.   If we give White lots of time, they might organize and get e4-e5 in after all. }
8. dxe6

8... Bxe6
{ We can develop with the natural move ...Nc6 and have a good game.   Next, we might try to play ...d6-d5 or put pressure on the e4-pawn. Our d6-pawn is on a half-open file, but White is not well set up to generate any play against it. }

{ This chapter and the following examine the Austrian Attack, which starts with  4.f4  . White builds a broad pawn centre and often tries to attack the Kingside later.  The f-pawn supports the pawn advance e4-e5, which is the most critical idea available for White. A supported pawn on e5 will seriously hamper our strong g7-Bishop, which is why fighting this idea is a crucial element of Black's strategy.  The Austrian Attack has always been regarded as the mainline of the Pirc and remains very popular on all levels. A very understandable statistic, as White's play is aggressive and very straightforward. The direct nature of White's strategy, however, is also helping Black to some extent. With  4.f4  White immediately commits to a central structure, so we know what to deal with straight away.  The game's direction is not as apparent after a more flexible move like  4.Be3  , when White might still play f4 later, but may also play with f2-f3 or Nf3, depending on Black's setup. The consequence is that the lines after  4.f4  are less ridden with transpositions and more forcing.   Let's talk a bit about the various lines.  A. The most popular line is  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Bd3  , which we answer with  6...Nc6  , aiming for ...e5. This line is examined in three chapters.   B. Instead of  6.Bd3  as in A, White may also play  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  , which hints at a possible queenside castling. This line is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter.   C. After  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  White also has the aggressive option  6.e5  , which is examinedhere in a dedicated chapter, as well.  D. Finally, there are early deviations on move 5 or 6, which are examined in the current chapter.  Before we check the possible sidelines @@StartBracket@@D@@EndBracket@@ in this chapter, we'd like to address an important point.  At various moments White has the option to play e4-e5, aggressively advancing in the centre. It is not possible to fight these lines with the same approach each time. You need to look at each one and learn how to play the best reply, as the small differences matter a lot.  The Austrian Attack is probably the part of the Pirc that demands the most memorization; there is no way to avoid that. White's play is rather concrete and aggressive, and our responses need to be precise. In slower lines, like the Classical Variation @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Be2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.g3  , Black can get away with knowing only some concrete lines and ideas.  If you try to fight the Austrian Attack with vague ideas, you might just get destroyed. The upside is: if you know what to do, you'll be fine.  Let's start and have a look at White's sidelines on move 5 and  6. }
4... Bg7
{ Now White's main move is  5.Nf3  by far. It makes a lot of sense to develop the Knight to its natural square before doing anything else.  In the current chapter, we examine ways for White to deviate from the main lines. The following lines are relatively rare.  We don't get too detailed here and instead focus on the critical lines in the next chapters. The more dangerous exceptions from the main lines are variations that feature a quick e4-e5, attacking us quickly. }
5. Nf3
{ Whites most natural and popular move. It is the start of all the main lines of the Austrian, examined in the next chapters. In the current chapter, we will discuss possible sidelines. }
5... O-O
{ We castle first, keeping our options flexible. Black's only good alternative is the move  5...c5  . It is not a bad move at all, we just preferred the position types after  5...O-O  .  After our choice White's most important options are  6.Bd3  ,  6.Be3  and  6.e5  . These are all examined in separate chapters here6.Bd3, 6.Be3 and6.e5  A reasonable alternative for White is  6.a3  which we have examinedhere in the current chapter via @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.a3  O-O  6.Nf3  .   The serious move that we still need to check is  6.Be2  . Instead, White also has  6.Bc4  , but this is less of a concern, as we will see. }
6. Be2
{ This is a rather rare move, but we need to be prepared.  Most importantly, our common plan to develop with  6...Nc6  does not work now, as  7.O-O  e5  8.dxe5  dxe5  9.Qxd8  Rxd8  10.fxe5  Ng4  11.Nb5  is great for White. This can be compared with the line @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.a3  O-O  6.Nf3  Nc6  7.Be2  when  7. ..e5?  does not work, either.  Here White has made an even more useful move than a3, which puts the whole idea out of business. However, we have a different idea. The Pirc is very versatile and you need to be ready to play the right pawn break, according to circumstances. }
6... c5
{ Seeing that breaking with ...e5 is difficult, we go for a different approach.  Due to the Bishop position on e2, White's e4-pawn is just protected by the c3-Knight. We will take advantage of that and attack White's centre from the flank.  Note that after @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Bd3  c5?!  is not that good because White's d3-Bishop protects e4 as well. Therefore  6.Bd3  c5?!  7.dxc5  is good for White, as  7...Qa5?  fails to  8.cxd6  .   With the Bishop on e2, after  6.Be2  c5!  7.dxc5  Qa5  White has no time to take on d6, as we threaten the pawn on e4. Still, taking on c5 is White's most popular move by far. }
7. e5
{ White's play is very ambitious, but may also lead to over-expansion. The advanced centre may easily crumble, as we have seen already in lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.e5  Nfd7  when one wrong step by White swings the game in our favour.   Here  7.e5  is quite similar in that regard, as it is rather White who needs to be careful. }
7... Nfd7
{ The same way as after @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.e5  . White's centre is under huge pressure now. }
8. e6
{ White sacrifices a pawn, similar to the line @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.e5  Nfd7  6.Nf3  c5  7.e6  . This seems to be White's best try, as it at least keeps the game roughly levelled.   After  8.exd6?!  exd6  Black is better, due to White's weaknesses in the centre.   Once the e-pawn is gone, the move f4 only has drawbacks. White could try  8.d5  , but the compensation after  8...dxe5  seems insufficient. }
8... fxe6 9. Ng5 { White tries to exploit our weakness on e6. } 9... Nf6
{ Let's bring a minor piece to our weakened Kingside. We play in the same way in the already mentioned line starting with @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.e5 }
10. dxc5 Nc6 { We recommend focusing on development and give back the pawn. }
11. cxd6 exd6
{ The game is complicated and offers chances for both players. We will play with ...d5, ...Bd7 and a Queen move next, connecting the rooks. }

In some variations, we might try to exploit this weakness.  2 White is not able to castle kingside on the next move. Black's King is already in safety, whereas White's King does not feel comfortable in the centre of the board.  3 The e3-Bishop is quite vulnerable at the moment. It's unprotected, and we can attack it by playing ...Ng4 under the right circumstances.   Let's think about our strategic options. Aiming for the ...e5-break is quite difficult.

Our c6-Knight attacks e5 and d4 but both squares are firmly under White's control and he might try to punish us immediately by playing  7.e5  .  In the resulting position, we lack the...c5-break because our c6-Knight is blocking the c-pawn. OK, let's forget about playing e7-e5 for the time being. We have another option! }

Often White will play e4-e5 while we push c7-c5. This formation is called 'Diamond formation' due to all pawns between the a-file and e-file being on dark squares. It indeed looks like a crystal or even a diamond. Creative names like that are fun and even help to visualize and memorize ideas. }

{ We go for the ...c5-pawn push, instead of the ...e5-break. The immediate  6...c5  fails, so we need to invest a tempo in preparing the move.   Furthermore, we can put more pressure on e4, a pawn that is quite vulnerable at the moment, by playing ...Bb7 next. After  6...b6  , we will frequently meet a particular pawn formation.  Often White will play e4-e5 while we push c7-c5. This formation is called 'Diamond formation' due to all pawns between the a-file and e-file being on dark squares. It indeed looks like a crystal or even a diamond. Creative names like that are fun and even help to visualize and memorize ideas. }
7. e5
{ White plays aggressively and pushes his e-pawn. The move is recommended by Chris Baker in A Startling Chess Opening Repertoire. }
7... Ng4 { We attack the unprotected Bishop on e3 and gain some time. } 8. Bg1
{ White wants to keep his dark-squared Bishop.   On the one hand, the Bishop is needed to control the dark squares and support the centre. On the other hand, White intends to play h3 soon, pushing the black Knight to a less ideas square on h6. }
8... c5
{ We reach the diamond structure, which we outlined earlier. White's centre is under severe pressure now. }
9. h3 Nh6
{ White has played aggressively, but the advanced pawn centre is already under heavy fire.  White's most popular move is  10.d5  now, but we'll check some alternatives to illustrate the dangers of White being over-extended.  One general problem is the Bishop on g1. It is difficult for White to move it back to e3, as we would jump with our Knight to f5 and kick the Bishop again. }
10. d5 { White wants to keep his centre and gain even more space. } 10... Bb7
11. Bc4
{ This move was suggested by Baker, who likes White's chances.   We agree that the position is quite sharp, and White benefits from more space. But Black's setup is very dynamic. It's has a coiled spring quality, with lots of energy ready to be released with great effect. }
11... Nd7
{ You may also insert  11...a6  12.a4  first, and then play  12...Nd7  . We like Black's chances and like to point out an instructive idea. }
12. Qe2 a6 13. a4 b5 { The coiled spring! } 14. axb5 axb5 15. Rxa8 Qxa8 16.
Bxb5 Nb6
{ Black is somewhat better, in our view. We can penetrate on a1 with our Queen and White's d5-pawn is weak, as well. White's position is overextended and tough to play. }

But there must be some disadvantage, as otherwise, the whole world would prefer to play Be3, right? On the downside, there is:  1 White's e4-square is not supported by Bd3. In some variations, we might try to exploit this weakness.  2 White is not able to castle kingside on the next move. Black's King is already in safety, whereas White's King does not feel comfortable in the centre of the board.  3 The e3-Bishop is quite vulnerable at the moment.

8. h3
{ If White plays  8.h3  or another slowish move, we can take the d4-pawn. }
8... cxd4 9. Nxd4 Bb7
{ We have reached an excellent version of a Sicilian Dragon now. Our Bishops are both fianchettoed and put pressure on the centre, making a much better impression than White's counterparts.

8. d5
{ White closes the centre, entering a Benoni structure.   The Benoni is usually regarded as favourable for White, but this particular version scores terribly for the first player. Even a strong former World Championship candidate such as Shirov lost a rapid game, despite being a 200 rating point favourite.   So, what's the reason for White's practical problems? Well, the Benoni structure, in general, might be nice for White, but White's piece placement is not ideal. The Bishop on e3 has no useful role and might be a liability soon. It can be hit with ...Ng4 under the right circumstances and is clumsily placed on the e-file after ...e6 when this file might open soon. The quick ...e6-break also makes it impossible for White to manage e4-e5, which is the most dangerous plan for White in the Benoni.   Objectively speaking, the position is probably balanced and offers both players chances, but our task is a bit easier to handle. }
8... a6

9. a4 e6
{ Very important! This break should be played quickly, giving Black counterplay. To take or not to take, that is now the question for White... }
10. O-O exd5 11. exd5
{ White has maintained the pawn on d5 and keeps an advantage in space. However, White's position has some drawbacks.   A key point is the move f4, which weakens multiple squares @@StartBracket@@e3 and e4@@EndBracket@@ and the King position. It also severely limits the Bishop on e3, which currently looks misplaced.   Therefore, White should try to play a quick f4-f5, which opens up the Bishop and starts a possible Kingside attack. White also has some standard ideas, typical of a Benoni, like placing a Knight on c4. This is not so easy to accomplish, though. }

{ Here  15...Qxa8  leads to a similar play and is fine, too. } 16. Nxb5 Nb6
{ The point of the ...b5 operation. We have successfully activated the Knight and now target the d5-pawn three times. }
17. Nc3 Nxc4
{ We stop the trainable line here because after the forced  18.Qxc4  Black has a whole list of good moves because the compensation does not depend on a single, precise continuation.  White is stuck to the defence of d5 and passively placed. Good moves for Black after  18.Qxc4  are, for example,  18...Qb6  intending ...Qb4,  18...Qc8  ...Qf5 idea or  18...Re8  all look fine for Black. }

{ We go for the ...c5-pawn push, instead of the ...e5-break. The immediate  6...c5  fails, so we need to invest a tempo in preparing the move.   Furthermore, we can put more pressure on e4, a pawn that is quite vulnerable at the moment, by playing ...Bb7 next. After  6...b6  , we will frequently meet a particular pawn formation.  Often White will play e4-e5 while we push c7-c5. This formation is called 'Diamond formation' due to all pawns between the a-file and e-file being on dark squares. It indeed looks like a crystal or even a diamond. Creative names like that are fun and even help to visualize and memorize ideas. }
7. Bc4
{ White develops his light-squared Bishop to an active-looking square. In similar situations, we recommend playing  7...Nxe4  , with the idea to win back the piece by playing d5 next. However, here this idea has a drawback. After  8.Nxe4  d5  9.Bd3  dxe4  10.Bxe4  the White Bishop is active and attacks our a8-Rook. We would be forced to play the awkward  10...c6  , which is rather undesirable. }
7... c5
{ We stick to our idea to push ...c5. As discussed, taking on e4 is unattractive at this particular moment. However, after White's reply, we need to reconsider this idea. }
8. Qe2
{ The main move by far. Whenever you play the combination of ...b6 and ...c5 without ...Bb7 already on the board, you need to check if White may exploit the weakened diagonal.   Here  8.e5?!  needs to be answered with  8...Ng4  , hitting the Bishop on e3. Other Knight moves would lose to the Bd5! idea, winning the poor Rook in the corner. }
8... Nxe4 { Now it works much better! } 9. Nxe4
{ Instead  9.Bxf7?  is a mistake, as White is giving up the strong Bishop without a clear reason. }
9... d5 10. Bd3 c4
{ That's the huge difference to 7... Nxe4?!. Now Black has a fine position. }
11. Bxc4 dxc4 12. Qxc4
{ White has won a pawn, but we have excellent compensation. } 12... Bb7 13. Ng3
e6
{ The critical point to understand is that Black's compensation in this position is not related to a direct attack but based on the two strong Bishops and the weaknesses in White's camp, in particular on the light squares.   A good idea for Black is playing ...Nc6-e7 next, then considering either ...Nd5 or ...Nf5. In the meantime, White has a hard time finding a target and constructive plan. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be3
{ In this chapter, we deal with an important deviation from the mainline  6.Bd3  .  White plays  6.Be3  , which develops the dark-squared Bishop first. The move has got several advantages:  1 White strengthens his control over the d4-square;  2 White is just two moves away from castling queenside;  3 White makes it more difficult for Black to push ...c5.  But there must be some disadvantage, as otherwise, the whole world would prefer to play Be3, right? On the downside, there is:  1 White's e4-square is not supported by Bd3. In some variations, we might try to exploit this weakness.  2 White is not able to castle kingside on the next move. Black's King is already in safety, whereas White's King does not feel comfortable in the centre of the board.  3 The e3-Bishop is quite vulnerable at the moment. It's unprotected, and we can attack it by playing ...Ng4 under the right circumstances.   Let's think about our strategic options. Aiming for the ...e5-break is quite difficult. The immediate  6...e5  leads to an advantage for White after  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.fxe5  Ng4  10.Bg5  .   Preparing the e5-push with  6...Nc6  is also not that attractive. Our c6-Knight attacks e5 and d4 but both squares are firmly under White's control and he might try to punish us immediately by playing  7.e5  .  In the resulting position, we lack the...c5-break because our c6-Knight is blocking the c-pawn. OK, let's forget about playing e7-e5 for the time being. We have another option! }

7. Qd2 { White prepares Queenside castling. } 7... Bb7
{ We develop our Bishop and attack e4 a second time. It is a very natural move that looks fine to us, but  7...c5  is an early alternative that has been tested, as well. }
8. d5
{ This odd move opens up the diagonal a1-h8 for our dark-squared Bishop.   We can attack the centre with ...c6 or play ...a6 and ...b5. We prefer the first plan. }
8... c6 9. O-O-O Nbd7
{ Instead, you can also play  9...cxd5  or the creative  9...b5!?   After the simpler  9...Nbd7  , we already like Black. Black has easy play against d5, and ...Rc8 will increase the pressure.  After ...Rc8 a fun idea could be to play ...cxd5 and ...Rxc3 in the style of the Sicilian Dragon. If we win the d5-pawn on top, this is well worth considering.  All in all, the move  8. d5 is a welcome sight. }

9. e5
{ This must be critical. White can insert  9.a3  a5  , but then again, pushing the e-pawn is the critical choice.   Of course, taking on b5 is not a problem. We get the e-pawn in return for the b-pawn, for example, after  9.Bxb5  Nxe4 }
9... b4
{ White may move the c3-Knight now or take on f6. It's challenging to evaluate what is better, but we think Black has fair chances in both cases. }
10. Ne2 Ng4 11. Bg1 c5
{ We have reached the type of game that Black aims for: White has expanded, but we attack the centre with pawns and fianchettoed Bishops.   Black is fine is this new position. Stockfish evaluates it as 0.00, but one look is enough to show that it is not a drawish position at all. }

{ In this chapter, we deal with an important deviation from the mainline  6.Bd3  .  White plays  6.Be3  , which develops the dark-squared Bishop first. The move has got several advantages:  1 White strengthens his control over the d4-square;  2 White is just two moves away from castling queenside;  3 White makes it more difficult for Black to push ...c5.  But there must be some disadvantage, as otherwise, the whole world would prefer to play Be3, right? On the downside, there is:  1 White's e4-square is not supported by Bd3. In some variations, we might try to exploit this weakness.  2 White is not able to castle kingside on the next move. Black's King is already in safety, whereas White's King does not feel comfortable in the centre of the board.  3 The e3-Bishop is quite vulnerable at the moment.

Our c6-Knight attacks e5 and d4 but both squares are firmly under White's control and he might try to punish us immediately by playing  7.e5  .

Our move  8...Nh5!  does stop  9.Nd5??  as  9...Rd8  is very embarrassing for White. So what should White play?   The most popular is  9.Ke1  but White has tried  9.Bc4  or  9.Be3  , as well. Our play is rather similar in all cases. We develop with ...Nc6, ...Bg4 and go for ...f6 soon, if possible. Let's check some lines to illustrate matters. }
9. Ke1
{ Possibly the main move. White avoids a Rook vis-a-vis on the d-file and aims to find a rather safe square on f2 for his King. }
9... Bg4
{ Black has also played  9...Nc6  with some success, but we suggest threatening ...Bxf3 immediately.  White has several moves to avoid the destruction of his pawn chain. It's not necessary to check all the lines, as Black's play is quite similar in all cases. We have ...Nc6, ...f6 and sometimes ...Bh6 to develop and put pressure on White's pawns. }
10. Nd4

We break in the centre and even have chances to gain an initiative against White's King if our opponent is careless. }
10... c5
{ On purely strategic grounds playing ...c5 looks dubious, as it weakens d5 and b5 considerably. But as usual in Chess, the concrete beats the abstract. The move just works well, as we will see. }
11. Nb3 Nc6
{ That s the all important point! We don't need to waste time with covering the c-pawn and rather focus on increasing our development. }
12. Nxc5 { White is greedy, but is clearly playing with fire. } 12... Nb4
{ Let's attack! We are threatening 13... Nxc2+ and force White's reply. } 13.
Bd3 f6
{ We are not in a hurry to take on d3, but rather want to pick up the Bishop-pair at leisure.   First, we open up the position, enjoying great compensation for the pawn. White's position is loose and the King feels insecure. Also, take note that the Bishop-pair alone will often be worth a pawn... and White has no good way to preserve it. }

7... Qxd1+
{ First of all, we exchange Queens. White has to make some concession now: either move the King or take with the Knight, which allows ...Nd5. }
8. Kxd1
{ White gives up his right to castle. This move is played more often than Nxd1, according to our database.   White's idea is to lure us into the following variation:  8...Rd8  9.Ke1  Nd5  10.Nxd5  Rxd5  11.Bc4  .  We would need to move our Rook again, and White would have a massive lead in development. This is one of the lines that we need to avoid. }
8... Nh5
{ The move looks strange at first glance. Isn't a Knight on the rim dim? Furthermore, it looks like the Knight is lacking space. There are no squares it can jump to at the moment, but this is not easy to exploit.   One key element is that h3 and g4 do not work for White, as our Knight could jump to g3 in this case. Furthermore, the Bishop on c1 is tied to the defence of the f4-pawn for the time being.   Having made a case why  8...Nh5!  is not as strange as it looks, we'd like to point out again that  8...Rd8+  9.Ke1  Nd5  10.Nxd5  Rxd5  11.Bc4  is more comfortable for White and should be avoided.

With ...c5 on the agenda, White's advanced centre will be under heavy fire. Is Black better then? No, because there is a catch: the King's Knight often is the best defender of the King, but this piece is now on d5 and will often take on c3, like after  8.Bc4  Nxc3  . We lack this important defender and White's e5-pawn and open-file easily help to drum up an attack on our King.    Imagine a setup with Bc4, O-O and Qe1-h4: this is very scary, to say the least! The conclusion is: we need to treat White's approach with some respect, otherwise we might get hurt badly. As mentioned, 8. Bc4 is White's main move now, but we'll check some alternatives. }

We lack this important defender and White's e5-pawn and open-file easily help to drum up an attack on our King.    Imagine a setup with Bc4, O-O and Qe1-h4: this is very scary, to say the least! The conclusion is: we need to treat White's approach with some respect, otherwise we might get hurt badly. As mentioned, 8. Bc4 is White's main move now, but we'll check some alternatives. }
8. Ne4
{ White avoids the exchange and claims that the Knight is good on e4. The obvious drawback of the move: it is slow! }
8... Bf5 { A natural move, gaining time on the loose piece. } 9. Ng3
{ White has no good alternative as,  9.Bd3?!  Nb4!  is great for Black. } 9...
Bg4
{ We wonder if White's Knight is good on g3. The squares f5 and h5 are under our control. Instead, our Knight on d5 is a beautiful piece.   Stockfish suggests moving the Knight back to e4 now. We could open up the position with  10.Ne4  f6!  in this case. If you are happy with a draw you might play  10...Bf5  and ask White if he has a better idea than repeating moves. }
10. Be2
{ Maybe the computer suggestion of  10.Ne4  is technically the best move, but it's not a very human decision. Let's take a look at what might happen if White continues with natural development. }
10... c5 { White is in trouble after this standard pawn break. } 11. dxc5
{ Instead  11.c3  cxd4  12.cxd4  Nc6  13.O-O  Qb6  looks awful for White, too. The centre is just falling to bits. }
11... Qa5+
{ We easily regain the c5-pawn and are happy to win e5 soon after. Clearly, White's opening concept has failed miserably. }

So, as a rule of thumb: you take on e5 AFTER you have castled, while against the early e5 you play ...Nfd7. The reasoning is quite logical: with ...O-O being played, White has the dangerous h4-h5 attack available after the Knight retreat. While a line like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.e5  Nfd7  7.h4  is not fatal, we feel that Black has a much easier job in practical play if you take on e5.   This is, in particular, true in faster time control games, when the initiative is vital. You might struggle to remember a defensive detail, fall behind on the clock, and get in trouble. Therefore we recommend playing  6...dxe5  , after which White chooses between the two pawn recaptures.  The resulting play is completely different, as  7.dxe5  leads to a Queen trade, while  7.fxe5  is a much more aggressive choice, aiming for an attack along the f-file. In the  7.fxe5  line, you need to know some concrete ideas against White's aggression, while  7.dxe5  is less dependent on knowledge. White's slow approach should not be underestimated, but in the end, we are not unduly worried about this line. }
7. fxe5
{ This can be regarded as the main move. Taking with the f-pawn keeps the Queens on the board and opens up the f-file for the Rook.   All nice and good, but Black is well developed, and we will soon attack White's centre with ...c5. First of all, our Knight has a good spot to jump to. }
7... Nd5
{ Our Knight occupies a strong position in the centre now. It is no surprise that White's most popular move is  8.Bc4  now, directly attacking our best piece. One important general point to address: From a strategic/long-term point of view, our position is fine and maybe even preferable.  With ...c5 on the agenda, White's advanced centre will be under heavy fire. Is Black better then? No, because there is a catch: the King's Knight often is the best defender of the King, but this piece is now on d5 and will often take on c3, like after  8.Bc4  Nxc3  .

8. Bc4
{ You can expect this move to be played most of the time in this situation. White develops a piece with tempo and places the Bishop on a natural diagonal, looking at f7 and our King! }
8... Nxc3
{ Clearly the most principled move. We lose no time with retreating and instead weaken White's structure. }
9. bxc3 c5
{ We need to fight against White's impressive pawn mass in the centre. White will attack our Kingside soon, and we need to start our counterplay immediately. }
10. Ng5
{ White wants to be tricky and avoids the possible pin after  10.O-O  Bg4  .  One of your authors faced this move in a Blitz game, which prompted us to have a look at it. It is ultimately good for Black, but it's good to know the best reply. }
10... h6
{ This is the move you simply need to know. Don't play  10...e6?  which would weaken the dark squares around our King fatally.  After  10...h6!  Black is better already. Stockfish limits the damage with  11.Nf3  but this is still a complete admission of failure. We'll briefly check  11.Ne4  , as this seems most likely to happen. }
11. Ne4
{ Instead  11.Nf3  Nc6  is better for Black @@StartBracket@@extra tempi@@EndBracket@@, but White is not in danger of falling apart quickly.   After  11.Nxf7  Rxf7  12.Bxf7+  Kxf7  13.O-O+  Kg8  Black's King is actually rather safe and White has given away all the developed pieces. Again, Black is clearly better. }
11... Nc6
{ We develop the Knight and put more pressure on White's centre.  Here Black has a wide choice of good moves like  11...Qc7  or  11...cxd4  . All these moves are clearly favourable for Black. }
12. Nxc5 { Did White simply win a pawn? } 12... Qa5
{ No, this is basically a double attack on c3 and e5! } 13. Bd2 Nxe5
{ We have restored the material balance and the much better position.   It is important to note that we have removed the e5-pawn and White is still stuck with the very weakened pawn formation of d4, c3 and c2. }

7. fxe5
{ This can be regarded as the main move. Taking with the f-pawn keeps the Queens on the board and opens up the f-file for the Rook.   All nice and good, but Black is well developed, and we will soon attack White's centre with ...c5. First of all, our Knight has a good spot to jump to. }
7... Nd5
{ Our Knight occupies a strong position in the centre now. It is no surprise that White's most popular move is  8.Bc4  now, directly attacking our best piece. One important general point to address: From a strategic/long-term point of view, our position is fine and maybe even preferable.  With ...c5 on the agenda, White's advanced centre will be under heavy fire. Is Black better then? No, because there is a catch: the King's Knight often is the best defender of the King, but this piece is now on d5 and will often take on c3, like after  8.Bc4  Nxc3  . We lack this important defender and White's e5-pawn and open-file easily help to drum up an attack on our King.    Imagine a setup with Bc4, O-O and Qe1-h4: this is very scary, to say the least! The conclusion is: we need to treat White's approach with some respect, otherwise we might get hurt badly. As mentioned, 8. Bc4 is White's main move now, but we'll check some alternatives. }

In comparison to 10.Ng5 there is additional pressure on f7 due to the Rf1. We thus would not be able to play ...h6 and would need to play ...e6, which is clearly not a move you like to play.   So what to do? Well, we have a multi-purpose move. We can develop a piece and indirectly increase the pressure against the central d4-square by pinning one of White's defenders. Our next move will be ...Nc6 in most cases, but the order of the two moves is of paramount importance! After  10...Bg4!  we need to check some possible moves for White. }

By moving the c6-knight, we free the c-pawn to prepare c6, limiting the scope of White's c3-Knight. }

We enjoy the Bishop-pair and can put more pressure on the weak d3-pawn by moving a Rook to d8. White can try to utilize the f-file and launch an attack on our King with ideas such as Qe1-h4.   Let's have a look at what happens if White starts this Queen manoeuvre right away. }
14. Qe1 Nh7
{ It is not possible to grab the d-pawn just yet, as White would be better after  14...Qxd3  15.Nxe5  .   Much better are the moves  14...Nh5  or  14...Nh7  . We suggest the latter, as now the pawn on d3 is hanging and ...Nxg5 is on, as well. }
15. Rd1 Nxg5 16. Nxg5 f6
{ We develop our Bishop to e6 or g4 next and reach an interesting position.   Our weakness of the King is compensated by the Bishop-pair and some pressure on the d-file. }

Just look at the difference in activity of White's and Black's dark-squared bishop.   A closer look reveals that White very likely needs to give up the b-pawn, as otherwise, this poor Bishop might never move.   After  16.Re1  b6  Black intends to play ...Bb7, attacking e4. Here it seems best for White to play  17.Bf4  returning the pawn for some activity. White seems to be in reasonable shape after this good defence, but it is not easy to conduct in a real game. }

Our idea is to attack White's centre with ...c6 on the next move, pretty much regardless of White's choice. White now usually opts for  10.Nxe5  ,  10.Bg5  or  10.Qe1 }
10. Qe1
{ Rarely played by White, but the move is Stockfish's first choice. White goes for some kind of a caveman-style attack @@StartBracket@@Qh4, Bh6, Ng5, Bxg7, Rxf6 and Qxh7 checkmate@@EndBracket@@, which is not be underestimated.   In any case, our play is based on ...c6, so let's not waste any time. }
10... c6
{ The thematic break which removes the d5-pawn. This has upsides and downsides: we get the e7-Knight back into play, but White gains access to the d5-square. }
11. dxc6
{ White needs to give up his centre pawn. He can't support it adequately, as  11.Bc4  would be answered by  11...b5  and  12... b4, hitting the defenders of the d5-pawn. }
11... Nxc6
{ This position is still rather unexplored. We'll have a look at the most aggressive move  12.Qh4  and the less crude  12.Be3  which is the engine favourite. }
12. Be3
{ This is Stockfish's top move, so we'll have a look at it. It's less likely to happen against an unprepared opponent, as  12.Qh4  looks far more obvious. }
12... Be6
{ We develop and take more control of d5. Please note that  13.Ng5  is not a problem at all, as we can answer it with  13...Ng4  . }
13. Rd1 { A logical move on White's part. } 13... h6
{ We don't want to allow White to play either Ng5 or Bg5.  Black has a good alternative in  13...Qa5  , but we think this prophylactic move is simpler to handle. We assess this position as roughly equal, while Stockfish gives White a small advantage without any clear way forward.  We'll check a 'human' move now,  14.Bc4 }
14. Bc4
{ White argues that Bishop on d3 is passive and trading defenders of the weak d5-square is strategically desirable. This makes sense, but it is not enough to prove an advantage. }
14... Qc8
{ Here  14...Qa5!?  is fine, too. The doubled e-pawns control many important squares, which compensates for the rigid pawn structure.  We prefer  14...Qc8  , keeping the structure intact and inviting the following line. After  15.Bxe6  Qxe6  16.Nd5  Rad8  17.Bc5  , we have the interesting option to sacrifice the exchange for the central pawn with  17...Nxd5!?  18.exd5  Rxd5  19.Rxd5  Qxd5  20.Bxf8  Bxf8  . Black has full compensation here, with ...e4 and ...Ne5 on the agenda.   Black's pieces are wonderfully centralized, while White's Rook is not effective. White has some other options, like  15.Bb3  Bxb3  16.axb3  Rd8  but Black's position is sound. Note that  17.Nd5  Nxd5  18.exd5  e4!?  is possible, activating our Bishop.  An important general consideration is that Black has a sound pawn structure, and therefore we don't mind trading some material, looking forward to a good endgame. }

Here d5 is a great square for our piece. From d5, we not only attack Nc3 and f4, but also take control of e3, a square that White would like to use for the Bishop.  Another idea to keep in mind is the Knight-jump to  b4  . This way, we could try to get rid of White's d3-Bishop. }
9. O-O
{ White ignores our threat to jump to b4 with a Knight and focuses on rapid development. }
9... Ndb4
{ This is a tough call. Instead, we could take the opportunity to destroy White's pawn formation by taking the Knight after  9...Nxc3  10.bxc3  we'd suggest  10...f6!  immediately fighting White's most important pawn, which leads to interesting play.  What we disliked about this line: After  10...f6  White has many possible replies, and it's not easy to tell the various ideas apart. Compared to our actual suggestion, this takes quite some effort.   After  9...Ndb4  we think that Black gets reasonable play with simple means. We often reach an endgame with mutual chances. If you'd like a more murky fight, then  9...Nxc3  10.bxc3  f6  is good to check. }
10. Be4
{ Otherwise, we'd take the Bishop with our Knight. We would gain the pair of Bishops and can target the White pawn that soon will be on d3. }
10... Qxd1
{ Here  10...f5  is a bit more confrontational, but also slightly dodgy. If you'd like a more tactical position, you'd best play 9...Nxc3. }
11. Rxd1 Bf5
{ An interesting move to get rid of White's beautifully placed e4-Bishop. } 12.
Bxf5 gxf5
{ After a series of more or less forced moves White needs to react to our threat of taking the pawn on c2. Let's take a look at one sample line from here.  After  13.Ne1  Rad8  14.Be3  e6  15.a3  Na6  16.Nf3  f6!  17.exf6  Bxf6  we reach an endgame with about equal chances. In return for the minor pawn weakness on e6 we activated our Bishop and have good counter chances.  At the moment we also have the option to play ...Bxc3, destroying White's pawn structure. It is very important to keep the f6-break in mind. Our Bishop is passive and the e5-pawn needs to be attacked to force the capture and open the long diagonal in the process. }

Stockfish gives White a small advantage, which might be true, but the position is very complex and there are various reasonable ways to deviate for both sides.

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

4... Bg7 5. Be2
{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

4... Bg7 5. Be2
{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

4... Bg7 5. Be2
{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

8. Bf4
{ As usual  8.Bh4  g5  9.Bg3  Nh5  is fine for Black. The Bishop can't escape, and we'll get the Bishop-pair as the small expense of a slight Kingside weakening.   8.Be3?!  would be odd, as after  8...Ng4  White probably needs to return to c1, which can't be challenging. }

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options.

{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  .

An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!

4... Bg7 5. Be2
{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

4... Bg7 5. Be2
{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

4... Bg7 5. Be2
{ As mentioned in the overview on move four, White has a wide choice here. The move  5.Be2  , called the 'Classical Variation', is examined in the current and the subsequent chapter. There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  .

For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  .

For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though. The one that we need to watch out for is e4-e5, the pawn advance.

{ Our move a6 has cleared this unusual square for our Knight. At first glance, it looks misplaced. But looks can be deceiving; there are some interesting points of the quirky Knight move. This line has been played twice by Magnus Carlsen, Levon Aronian, Ian Nepomniachtchi and David Navara, with good results.  Let's talk about White's next move because it will influence the course of the game significantly. We think that White's best move is  9.a4  when it's our turn to make an important decision. Let's have a look at why other moves than  9.a4  are less critical. We'll check  9.h3  and  9.Bg5  to illustrate matters. }

{ Move  9.a4  is the most challenging test of Black's line. Now ...b5 and ...Nb5 ideas are off the table for the moment.  Now we need to decide how to set up the central pawn formation.

9... e5
{ We suggest going for the closed central formation. In the second chapter on the Classical about the ...e5 lines, we discuss these structures, but in lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.d5  Ne7  our Knight is on e7.   At first glance, having the Knight on a7 instead looks ridiculous, but the situation is not as clear-cut as you might think. We'll discuss the merits of the Knight in a moment, but before we'd like to point out that Black has a reasonable alternative with  9...e6  , which has been tested in games by Levon Aronian and David Navara.  Keeping the long diagonal open with  9...e6  is the more solid choice, but we think that  9...e5  leads to fascinating fights and is a good practical weapon. The resulting positions are quite similar to a Classical King's Indian, and White might be unfamiliar with these pawn structures.  A key idea for White is a pawn advance on the Queenside, often involving c4-c5, aiming to open the c-file. This is not so easy to achieve, as the c3-Knight is blocking the pawn. Black's plan is a lot easier to implement: move the f6-Knight and play ...f5 to start advancing on the Kingside.   Let's discuss some concrete moves now. The position is unexplored; we only found one game in which White played the less critical  10.dxe6  when  10...Bxe6  and ...Nc6 next gives Black an easy game. Our pieces are actively placed and we can play against the e4-pawn.   White should try to make headway in the closed structure and avoid the en-passant capture. We'll examine  10.b4  as the starting move of the analysis, as White can hardly do without this move on the Queenside. }

On a7, it does not connect at all to a dark-squared blockade. Playing ...a5 would make much more sense if the Knight would be on d7 or even b8.   After moves other than  10.b4  or  10.a5  we won't play ...a5, but rather continue in the same way as we do after the pawn moves.

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  . If we play @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...a6  , we can retreat to a7 instead. This unconventional idea works well. For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.  In the present chapter, we will look at lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bf4  Nc6  8.h3  when we play  8...b5  .

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

{ Our move a6 has cleared this unusual square for our Knight. At first glance, it looks misplaced. But looks can be deceiving; there are some interesting points of the quirky Knight move. This line has been played twice by Magnus Carlsen, Levon Aronian, Ian Nepomniachtchi and David Navara, with good results.  Let's talk about White's next move because it will influence the course of the game significantly. We think that White's best move is  9.a4  when it's our turn to make an important decision. Let's have a look at why other moves than  9.a4  are less critical. We'll check  9.h3  and  9.Bg5  to illustrate matters. }
9. a4
{ Move  9.a4  is the most challenging test of Black's line. Now ...b5 and ...Nb5 ideas are off the table for the moment.  Now we need to decide how to set up the central pawn formation.

9... e5
{ We suggest going for the closed central formation. In the second chapter on the Classical about the ...e5 lines, we discuss these structures, but in lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.d5  Ne7  our Knight is on e7.   At first glance, having the Knight on a7 instead looks ridiculous, but the situation is not as clear-cut as you might think. We'll discuss the merits of the Knight in a moment, but before we'd like to point out that Black has a reasonable alternative with  9...e6  , which has been tested in games by Levon Aronian and David Navara.  Keeping the long diagonal open with  9...e6  is the more solid choice, but we think that  9...e5  leads to fascinating fights and is a good practical weapon. The resulting positions are quite similar to a Classical King's Indian, and White might be unfamiliar with these pawn structures.  A key idea for White is a pawn advance on the Queenside, often involving c4-c5, aiming to open the c-file. This is not so easy to achieve, as the c3-Knight is blocking the pawn. Black's plan is a lot easier to implement: move the f6-Knight and play ...f5 to start advancing on the Kingside.   Let's discuss some concrete moves now. The position is unexplored; we only found one game in which White played the less critical  10.dxe6  when  10...Bxe6  and ...Nc6 next gives Black an easy game. Our pieces are actively placed and we can play against the e4-pawn.   White should try to make headway in the closed structure and avoid the en-passant capture. We'll examine  10.b4  as the starting move of the analysis, as White can hardly do without this move on the Queenside. }

On a7, it does not connect at all to a dark-squared blockade. Playing ...a5 would make much more sense if the Knight would be on d7 or even b8.   After moves other than  10.b4  or  10.a5  we won't play ...a5, but rather continue in the same way as we do after the pawn moves.

These lines with the closed centre are fun to play and not well explored.   You also need to take into account that White might not be knowledgeable in King's Indian struggles, which is a bonus for us. The engines often like White due to his space-advantage, but in practice, the positions are complicated and promise an exciting fight. }

The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options.

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  .

For example, after  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  Na7!  was successfully played by Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian.   An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!   So what about ...b5? Do we ever play it? Yes, there are some cases, but we prioritize ...Nc6 and play ...e5 next, if possible. If White stops this idea, ...b5 becomes more relevant.

So, what does White do in the Classical, what's the strategy? Well, White wants to keep central control and retrain Black's ideas to break out of the spatial disadvantage. White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options.

6... a6
{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.

An additional point: In many cases, White will interpret  6...a6  as only geared towards ...b5 and automatically replies  7.a4  when after  7...Nc6  8.d5  we have the opportunity to play  8...Nb4!

White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options.

White often plays 'small moves', like h3, Re1, and a4, to improve his position step by step.  White does not have a clear-cut way forward in the Classical, it's all about flexibility and depends on Black's setup. There are direct ideas that can lead to a sharpening of the play, though.

There are many 'Classical Variations' in various openings, and the Pirc has one, too.  What is the definition of 'Classical' in Chess? The Classical values go back to the beginning of Chess as a subject of systematic research. Concepts like 'controlling the centre with pawns', 'developing pieces quickly', 'play for quick castling', 'keep a sound pawn structure' were developed by the greats of the past; names like Steinitz or Tarrasch come to mind.  A 'Classical Variation' follows these guidelines - sensible and logical, without being too fancy. In the Classical Pirc, White plays  5.Be2  and 6.O-O, when Black has various options. We'll talk more about the general strategy on move six. }

{ Well, that's not a very Classical reply, is it? No, it's not... but that idea went out the window on move one!  Jokes aside, what does  6...a6  accomplish? It's a rather sophisticated idea and best understood if you think about pawn formations and the future places for the Queenside pieces. One fundamental choice is the positioning of the Knight -do we go to c6 or d7? One popular way to play for Black is the formation ...c6, ...Nbd7, and ...e5 later.   This approach, starting with  6...c6  , is Black's most popular line and has a sound reputation. One drawback of this line is the relatively passive position of the d7-Knight, obstructing the c8-Bishop. If you develop this Bishop to g4 first, you'll often have to surrender the Bishop pair after h3. Not the end of the world, but the line  6...Bg4  didn't look too attractive to us for this reason. It is not very flexible.   The following line we checked was  6...Nc6  , developing the Knight to its most active square and preparing ...e5. Black is doing alright in this line, but we disliked that after  7.d5  Black's best is  7...Nb8  . This is a playable option but still not particularly attractive.   Finally, we'll get to the move that we recommend,  6...a6  . The small pawn move has more than one purpose. The one you notice first: playing ...b5, opening b7 for the Bishop, and getting ...b5-b4 on the map. However, we will only play the move ...b5 in some cases, and never on move seven! We'll discuss this in a moment, but we need to talk about the less obvious idea behind  6...a6  .   A drawback of  6...Nc6  is the line  7.d5  Nb8  .

7. h3
{ The move h3 is frequently played in the Classical Pirc. White stops all ...Bg4 and ...Ng4 ideas and makes it more convenient to develop with Be3 or Bf4 later.   We are not bothered much by this move, as ...Bg4 was not high on our agenda. Still,  7.h3  is flexible and one of White's main moves. }
7... Nc6
{ In fact, we do not have the intention to play ...b5 in the current position and develop our Queenside Knight instead. After  7...b5  , White could try to exploit our weakness on the h1-a8 diagonal by playing  8.e5!  which poses complex problems.

White's principled and most ambitious alternative is  9.d5  but it has little independent value.

{ An easy move: after Bg5, we don't need to worry about a possible Ng5 in reply, so this natural development suggests itself. }
11. Qc1 { A clever idea. White intends Rd1 with a tempo, and maybe Nd5 next. }
11... Re8
{ A good move. The idea is to keep an eye on the e5-pawn and free the square f8, which proves to be useful. }
12. Rd1 Qe7 13. Nd5
{ The critical move: White tries to exploit the pin, but we are well-prepared.  If White chooses a slow move, like  13.Bf1  , the move  13...Qf8!  is useful. We unpin and cover h6, so we enable ...h6 if needed. }
13... Bxd5 14. exd5 Nd4
{ This Knight jump is a frequent guest in our repertoire. } 15. Nxd4 exd4
{ The attack on the e2-Bishop gains a tempo needed for ...Qc5. White's d5-pawn might turn out to be weak, so White will probably take on f6. We have easily equalized. }

White can prevent this move in various ways, most importantly by advancing the d-pawn in lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.d5  or @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  or with placing a Bishop on f4 or g5.

In the previous chapter, we have discussed some general points about the Classical Variationhere and examined lines of type A above: White stops ...e5. In the current chapter, we deal with the lines classified as type B.  There are various versions of the described scenario for plan B.

In all cases, White White needs to decide about the central pawn formation. What to do with the d-pawn? We have just played ...e5, and White's three options can be assessed as follows:  1. Exchange on e5 and open the d-file. It is the most popular way to play. White plays for a small pull in a symmetrical pawn structure, but we are not worried much about this approach. It is a safe option for White but hardly threatening.  2. Gain space by advancing the pawn to d5. White closes the centre and shifts the play to the flanks.

White advances on the Queenside while we attack the other side of the board.  3. White keeps the tension. If White does not move the d-pawn, we'll capture on d4 and get good play.

7... Nc6
{ One of our favourite Pirc-moves. On c6, the Queenside Knight attacks the dark central squares, and we are ready to play ...e5 next.   White has two main replies. The first one is  8.d5  which we discuss in the Intro chapter of the Classical. White attacks our Knight, which leads to completely different structures than the other main choice.  In the present chapter, we'll examine  8.h3  which is a good prophylactic move in many scenarios. We'll briefly examine the minor alternative  8.Re1  . It mostly demonstrates why h3 is considered more useful for White. }
8. h3 e5
{ Alright, that was the plan. Now White needs to decide about the central tension. A closer look reveals that White only has two serious options: trade with  9.dxe5  or play for the advance  9.d5  .  After White has played the two good but slow moves a4 and h3, keeping the central tension does not work well.  9.Be3  is possible but not challenging for Black at all. }
9. dxe5
{ At the start of the present chapter we have discussed the different options that White has after we have played ...e5. One of them is the exchange on e5, which can happen in various versions. We have also examined @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.h3  Nc6  8.Be3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  in the present chapter. The version here, after @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  is the one that happens most frequently.  White has not committed any of the minor pieces yet, so we need to reckon with various combinations of Be3, Bg5 and Bc4. White might also play Qc1 at some point, with Rd1 to follow. What are both sides playing for?  The central pawn structure is symmetrical and the four Knights are placed well. The main difference is White's Bishop on e2 versus our Bishop on g7. White claims that their Bishop is easily activated with Bc4 which helps fight for control over the d5-square. On the other hand, our Bishop on g7 is staring at the e5-pawn, which looks like a more passive setup.  White's argument is not wrong, but our Bishop is not that badly placed. White is playing for the square d5, we play for d4... and our Bishop often helps to support a Knight jump to d4 as we will see in some variations.  What about our light-squared Bishop? We'd like to place it on e6, where is controls d5. White has played h3 so there is no other good option like ...Bg4. Speaking of h3, the move ...h6 is desirable for Black, too. The moves Bg5 or Ng5 in reply to ...Be6 are annoying and should be stopped. Finally, the square e7 is a good spot for the Queen, connecting the Rooks and allowing a Rook to d8.  To summarize: our target setup is ...Be6, ...h6, ...Qe7, then probably a Rook to d8. Of course, White is moving in the meantime, and we need to adjust. Still, keep this setup in mind.  White has several possible continuations now, and all the permutations of Be3/Bg5/Bc4 can be irritating at first. However, all the variations follow the same storyline: we try to achieve the target setup, while White tries to prevent it and gain control of d5.  Before we look at some moves, we'd like to mention that Black scores very well in the dxe5 positions, even though White should not be worse. One reason might be that White is often not prepared for the ...a6 & ...Nc6 lines and seeks a simple solution. If you have never studied it, closing the centre with d4-d5 is not an easy decision. It leads to positions that are much more in the spirit of the Classical King's Indian, quite a long way from what a 1.e4-player usually gets on the board.  We have seen that keeping the tension is unchallengeable, which leaves the dxe5 option. So frequently, White plays it as a 'cop out' with a somewhat weak mindset. We think this is the main reason for White's bad score, not the actual positions' quality.  There are players on the White side that play these positions to press small advantages and grind us down. But don't think that White is after simplifications and a draw after the exchange; looks can be deceiving. However, there will be players @@StartBracket@@see White's lousy score@@EndBracket@@ who view the trade on e5 as a way to avoid complications and simplify the game as much as possible. Against these players, it is crucial not to accept a draw readily but to continue playing and accumulating small advantages.  A good strategy can be to offer trades that are favourable for us. If White is too keen on exchanging all pieces, these offers can be tempting. Even sterile positions often can be won by pure persistence - play on until they break down. }

{ Our general idea is to play ...Nc6 and ...e5 next. White has two basic ways to play:  A. White can prevent this move in various ways, most importantly by advancing the d-pawn in lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.d5  or @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Re1  Nc6  8.d5  or with placing a Bishop on f4 or g5.

We decided to split the coverage of the Classical Variation into two chapters. In the previous chapter, we have discussed some general points about the Classical Variationhere and examined lines of type A above: White stops ...e5. In the current chapter, we deal with the lines classified as type B.  There are various versions of the described scenario for plan B. The most common one is @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  or @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.h3  Nc6  8.a4  e5  , which features White's prophylactic flank pawn moves.

In all cases, White White needs to decide about the central pawn formation. What to do with the d-pawn? We have just played ...e5, and White's three options can be assessed as follows:  1. Exchange on e5 and open the d-file. It is the most popular way to play. White plays for a small pull in a symmetrical pawn structure, but we are not worried much about this approach. It is a safe option for White but hardly threatening.  2. Gain space by advancing the pawn to d5. White closes the centre and shifts the play to the flanks.

White advances on the Queenside while we attack the other side of the board.  3. White keeps the tension. If White does not move the d-pawn, we'll capture on d4 and get good play. This option is the least challenging.  After this overview, we are ready to check the details. Let's get to work. We'll examine two moves now.

We only want to emphasize that it does not influence our plans much. }
7... Nc6
{ One of our favourite Pirc-moves. On c6, the Queenside Knight attacks the dark central squares, and we are ready to play ...e5 next.   White has two main replies. The first one is  8.d5  which we discuss in the Intro chapter of the Classical. White attacks our Knight, which leads to completely different structures than the other main choice.  In the present chapter, we'll examine  8.h3  which is a good prophylactic move in many scenarios. We'll briefly examine the minor alternative  8.Re1  . It mostly demonstrates why h3 is considered more useful for White. }
8. h3 e5
{ Alright, that was the plan. Now White needs to decide about the central tension. A closer look reveals that White only has two serious options: trade with  9.dxe5  or play for the advance  9.d5  .  After White has played the two good but slow moves a4 and h3, keeping the central tension does not work well.  9.Be3  is possible but not challenging for Black at all. }
9. dxe5
{ At the start of the present chapter we have discussed the different options that White has after we have played ...e5. One of them is the exchange on e5, which can happen in various versions. We have also examined @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.h3  Nc6  8.Be3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  in the present chapter. The version here, after @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  is the one that happens most frequently.  White has not committed any of the minor pieces yet, so we need to reckon with various combinations of Be3, Bg5 and Bc4. White might also play Qc1 at some point, with Rd1 to follow. What are both sides playing for?  The central pawn structure is symmetrical and the four Knights are placed well. The main difference is White's Bishop on e2 versus our Bishop on g7. White claims that their Bishop is easily activated with Bc4 which helps fight for control over the d5-square. On the other hand, our Bishop on g7 is staring at the e5-pawn, which looks like a more passive setup.  White's argument is not wrong, but our Bishop is not that badly placed. White is playing for the square d5, we play for d4... and our Bishop often helps to support a Knight jump to d4 as we will see in some variations.  What about our light-squared Bishop? We'd like to place it on e6, where is controls d5. White has played h3 so there is no other good option like ...Bg4. Speaking of h3, the move ...h6 is desirable for Black, too. The moves Bg5 or Ng5 in reply to ...Be6 are annoying and should be stopped. Finally, the square e7 is a good spot for the Queen, connecting the Rooks and allowing a Rook to d8.  To summarize: our target setup is ...Be6, ...h6, ...Qe7, then probably a Rook to d8. Of course, White is moving in the meantime, and we need to adjust. Still, keep this setup in mind.  White has several possible continuations now, and all the permutations of Be3/Bg5/Bc4 can be irritating at first. However, all the variations follow the same storyline: we try to achieve the target setup, while White tries to prevent it and gain control of d5.  Before we look at some moves, we'd like to mention that Black scores very well in the dxe5 positions, even though White should not be worse. One reason might be that White is often not prepared for the ...a6 & ...Nc6 lines and seeks a simple solution. If you have never studied it, closing the centre with d4-d5 is not an easy decision. It leads to positions that are much more in the spirit of the Classical King's Indian, quite a long way from what a 1.e4-player usually gets on the board.  We have seen that keeping the tension is unchallengeable, which leaves the dxe5 option. So frequently, White plays it as a 'cop out' with a somewhat weak mindset. We think this is the main reason for White's bad score, not the actual positions' quality.  There are players on the White side that play these positions to press small advantages and grind us down. But don't think that White is after simplifications and a draw after the exchange; looks can be deceiving. However, there will be players @@StartBracket@@see White's lousy score@@EndBracket@@ who view the trade on e5 as a way to avoid complications and simplify the game as much as possible. Against these players, it is crucial not to accept a draw readily but to continue playing and accumulating small advantages.  A good strategy can be to offer trades that are favourable for us. If White is too keen on exchanging all pieces, these offers can be tempting. Even sterile positions often can be won by pure persistence - play on until they break down. }
9... dxe5 10. Qxd8
{ Well, after the Queen trade, we can't operate with our standard setup anymore - it's too simplistic to pose any problems, though. }
10... Rxd8 11. Bc4
{ White wants to make it more difficult for us to develop our light-squared Bishop. }
11... h6
{ Controlling g5 is helpful, but this is not the only good move here. Stockfish likes  11...Be6!?  best, but we are somewhat reluctant to recommend this move. The resulting lines are fine, but the pawn structure is unattractive.  We are not worried about the pawns getting weak, but rather the loss of flexibility. Black has no pawn play left on the kingside in this formation, while ...f5 is a viable and essential idea in many endgames with a sound pawn structure.  Still, objectively speaking,  11...Be6  is fine, some other moves like  11...Re8  or  11...Nd4  are viable, too. }
12. Be3 Ne8
{ An uncommon setup in this line, but it makes a lot of sense. We prepare ...Nd4, and ...Nd6 can be useful, too. We assess this position as about equal. }

7... Nc6
{ One of our favourite Pirc-moves. On c6, the Queenside Knight attacks the dark central squares, and we are ready to play ...e5 next.   White has two main replies. The first one is  8.d5  which we discuss in the Intro chapter of the Classical. White attacks our Knight, which leads to completely different structures than the other main choice.  In the present chapter, we'll examine  8.h3  which is a good prophylactic move in many scenarios. We'll briefly examine the minor alternative  8.Re1  . It mostly demonstrates why h3 is considered more useful for White. }
8. h3 e5
{ Alright, that was the plan. Now White needs to decide about the central tension. A closer look reveals that White only has two serious options: trade with  9.dxe5  or play for the advance  9.d5  .  After White has played the two good but slow moves a4 and h3, keeping the central tension does not work well.  9.Be3  is possible but not challenging for Black at all. }
9. dxe5
{ At the start of the present chapter we have discussed the different options that White has after we have played ...e5. One of them is the exchange on e5, which can happen in various versions. We have also examined @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.h3  Nc6  8.Be3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  in the present chapter. The version here, after @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.a4  Nc6  8.h3  e5  9.dxe5  dxe5  is the one that happens most frequently.  White has not committed any of the minor pieces yet, so we need to reckon with various combinations of Be3, Bg5 and Bc4. White might also play Qc1 at some point, with Rd1 to follow. What are both sides playing for?  The central pawn structure is symmetrical and the four Knights are placed well. The main difference is White's Bishop on e2 versus our Bishop on g7. White claims that their Bishop is easily activated with Bc4 which helps fight for control over the d5-square. On the other hand, our Bishop on g7 is staring at the e5-pawn, which looks like a more passive setup.  White's argument is not wrong, but our Bishop is not that badly placed. White is playing for the square d5, we play for d4... and our Bishop often helps to support a Knight jump to d4 as we will see in some variations.  What about our light-squared Bishop? We'd like to place it on e6, where is controls d5. White has played h3 so there is no other good option like ...Bg4. Speaking of h3, the move ...h6 is desirable for Black, too. The moves Bg5 or Ng5 in reply to ...Be6 are annoying and should be stopped. Finally, the square e7 is a good spot for the Queen, connecting the Rooks and allowing a Rook to d8.  To summarize: our target setup is ...Be6, ...h6, ...Qe7, then probably a Rook to d8. Of course, White is moving in the meantime, and we need to adjust. Still, keep this setup in mind.  White has several possible continuations now, and all the permutations of Be3/Bg5/Bc4 can be irritating at first. However, all the variations follow the same storyline: we try to achieve the target setup, while White tries to prevent it and gain control of d5.  Before we look at some moves, we'd like to mention that Black scores very well in the dxe5 positions, even though White should not be worse. One reason might be that White is often not prepared for the ...a6 & ...Nc6 lines and seeks a simple solution. If you have never studied it, closing the centre with d4-d5 is not an easy decision. It leads to positions that are much more in the spirit of the Classical King's Indian, quite a long way from what a 1.e4-player usually gets on the board.  We have seen that keeping the tension is unchallengeable, which leaves the dxe5 option. So frequently, White plays it as a 'cop out' with a somewhat weak mindset. We think this is the main reason for White's bad score, not the actual positions' quality.  There are players on the White side that play these positions to press small advantages and grind us down. But don't think that White is after simplifications and a draw after the exchange; looks can be deceiving. However, there will be players @@StartBracket@@see White's lousy score@@EndBracket@@ who view the trade on e5 as a way to avoid complications and simplify the game as much as possible. Against these players, it is crucial not to accept a draw readily but to continue playing and accumulating small advantages.  A good strategy can be to offer trades that are favourable for us. If White is too keen on exchanging all pieces, these offers can be tempting. Even sterile positions often can be won by pure persistence - play on until they break down. }
9... dxe5 10. Bc4
{ White immediately improves the Bishop and connects it with the d5-square. As discussed before, White claims that the Bishop on c4 is better than our counterpart on g7. Now, we know that ...Be6, ...h6, and ...Qe7 is on our agenda - what to play first? }
10... h6
{ The best move. Of the three candidates,  10...Be6?  can be discarded immediately. We don't need to allow the doubled pawns.  10...Qe7?  is answered by  11.Bg5  threatening Nd5 and is very annoying to meet. Therefore we start with  11...h6  . }
11. Be3
{ A natural choice. The square g5 is unavailable, and Be3 introduces the idea Bc5 into the position. }
11... Qe7
{ Very logical play. The Queen move is part of our setup, at the same time preparing ...Be6 and stopping Bc5. }

{ A good move! White was threatening d6! and the e-pawn advance is the active way to fight this threat. If in doubt, play actively!   We have reached an about equal position, but with a lot of play left for both sides. We have activated our pieces nicely; in particular, the Knight on b4 asks White some questions. It puts pressure on d5 and can't be easily expelled with c3, as White needs to worry about ...Nd3. }

9... Ne7
{ We have reached a structure similar to the mainline of the King's Indian Defence. We need to have a look at this line to compare: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  . In both positions, White has a space advantage on the Queenside, based on the d5-pawn. This suggests that White should play on this side of the board.  The crucial difference between our Pirc line and the King's Indian is White's c-pawn. White needs to advance pawns on the Queenside to open files, and the c-pawn is the most important one. It is the pawn that should attack Black's pawn chain with c4-c5, opening files. A sample line in the King's Indian is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  9.b4  Ne8  10.c5  which shows this idea put into motion very quickly.  In our Pirc line, the pawn is on c2, making a similar scenario much more difficult to achieve for White. The Knight on c3 needs to move first, which costs some time.  Black's game is rather easy, in comparison. We'll play ...Ne8 and ...f5, starting our play on the Kingside, basically no matter what White does on the next moves.  We'll have a look at some possible moves to discuss more ideas. }

{ The point of the Knight tour to c4. White has to avoid a position like  12.f3?  f4!  when Black's attack with ...g5, ...h5, and ultimately ...g4 will likely lead to a disaster for White.   The much better move  12.f4  puts some pressure on e5, so we should take it. }

{ All captures come into considerations here, even the odd-looking  14...gxf5  . We like  14...Nxf5  , as it takes a look at the squares e3 and g3, which are potentially weak.  We don't need to worry about  15.g4  now, as  15...Nh6  16.g5?  Nh5  17.Bxh5  Rxf4!  18.Rxf4  Qxg5+  leads to a winning attack for Black.  White should play a more cautious move, but chances are about even anyway.

We only want to emphasize that it does not influence our plans much. }
7... Nc6
{ One of our favourite Pirc-moves. On c6, the Queenside Knight attacks the dark central squares, and we are ready to play ...e5 next.   White has two main replies. The first one is  8.d5  which we discuss in the Intro chapter of the Classical. White attacks our Knight, which leads to completely different structures than the other main choice.  In the present chapter, we'll examine  8.h3  which is a good prophylactic move in many scenarios. We'll briefly examine the minor alternative  8.Re1  . It mostly demonstrates why h3 is considered more useful for White. }
8. h3 e5
{ Alright, that was the plan. Now White needs to decide about the central tension. A closer look reveals that White only has two serious options: trade with  9.dxe5  or play for the advance  9.d5  .  After White has played the two good but slow moves a4 and h3, keeping the central tension does not work well.  9.Be3  is possible but not challenging for Black at all. }
9. d5
{ Advancing the pawn is White's most ambitious way to play. It gains space and pushes our Knight back to e7. }
9... Ne7
{ We have reached a structure similar to the mainline of the King's Indian Defence. We need to have a look at this line to compare: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  . In both positions, White has a space advantage on the Queenside, based on the d5-pawn. This suggests that White should play on this side of the board.  The crucial difference between our Pirc line and the King's Indian is White's c-pawn. White needs to advance pawns on the Queenside to open files, and the c-pawn is the most important one. It is the pawn that should attack Black's pawn chain with c4-c5, opening files. A sample line in the King's Indian is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  9.b4  Ne8  10.c5  which shows this idea put into motion very quickly.  In our Pirc line, the pawn is on c2, making a similar scenario much more difficult to achieve for White. The Knight on c3 needs to move first, which costs some time.  Black's game is rather easy, in comparison. We'll play ...Ne8 and ...f5, starting our play on the Kingside, basically no matter what White does on the next moves.  We'll have a look at some possible moves to discuss more ideas. }
10. Be3
{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square. In some cases, White may also have played the move Be3 earlier and only later closed the centre.  A typical sequence is @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.h3  Nc6  8.Be3  e5  9.d5  Ne7  10.a4  which leads to the same position. }

11. Nd2 { White intends to answer  11...f5  with  12.f3 } 11... f5 12. f3
{ White protects his e4-pawn and secures a retreat for the Bishop. We were threatening ...f4, trapping it. }
12... Nf6
{ Here  12...f4  is possible, but more or less an 'All-In!'-move, to use a poker term. After  13.Bf2  g5  White needs to find the right plan  14.a5!  followed by Na4 and c4-c5, when it's a matter of who crashes through first.  Computers love White, but it is not clear at all in a game between human players. Engines tend to overestimate the static features, so don't be too scared to enter such a position.   In this particular situation, we still recommend the move  12...Nf6  ., The plan ...Nh5-f4 looks strong and less committal. You can also consider  12...Kh8  , intending ...Ng8 and ...Bh6, for a more strategic approach. }
13. a5 Nh5
{ The Knight is on the way to f4, and you can still play ...g6-g5 and ...Ng6 later to drum up an attack. A great position to fight for the win and get an exciting game. }

Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3 {White develops the Bishop to a natural square while
still keeping many options open. The main virtue of 4.Be3 is its flexibility,
which poses a challenge to Black. White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6
and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other
interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these
various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking. However,
before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple
question: what is our reply to 4.Be3?} (4. Bg5 {This is one of White's more
aggressive setups. Similar to 4.Be3 White aims for rapid Queenside development.
Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to
launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play 4.Bg5 instead of 4.Be3?
After 4.Bg5 the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and
we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there
are drawbacks. First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and
possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we
will see. A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central
control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while
on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and
Queenside action. A crucial point to mention is that White's various
continuations after 4...Bg7 - 5.Qd2 , 5.f4 , 5.Nf3 and 5.e5 - require
different responses. There is no 'once size fits all' approach or a 'setup' to
go for. Each line leads to different position types and needs a specific
answer. We will examine 4.Bg5 in two chapters. The present one covers all
options for White after 4...Bg7 except the most popular move, 5.Qd2 , which is
examined in a dedicated chapter.} Bg7 {A p@rfectly normal move, but we need to
talk about it in more detail. On move four, White has three reasonable moves
of the Queen's Bishop, √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/
R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Be3 , 4.Bf4 , and 4.Bg5 . These moves share
some common ideas, but also differ considerably in some ways. In our
repertoire, we handle the moves 4.Be3 and 4.Bf4 in the same way, by playing an
immediate 4...a6! to answer 5.Qd2 with 5...b5! We keep the Bishop on f8 to
take the sting out of White's Qd2 & Bh6 idea. The line √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/
ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Be3 Bg7?!
5.Qd2 and next Bh6 scores particularly well for White and should be avoided.
The same applies for √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/
R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Bf4 a6! , as White's Bh6 idea works just as
well with a Bishop on f4. Now, let's look at √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/
3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Bg5 should we play
4...a6 here, too? No, this is a mistake due to 5.e5! highlighting a critical
difference between the Bishop placements. Therefore we suggest playing

R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Be3 Bg7?! No, because this time we can

Qd2 h6! which stops the exchange idea in its tracks. This line is coveredhere
in the second chapter on 4.Bg5 , which focuses exclusively on 5.Qd2 , White's
main move. In the variations √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/
PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Be3 and 4.Bf4 , we play 4...a6 ,

our Queenside formation against √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/
2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.Bg5? This decision depends on
White's fifth move and needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Some lines
feature relatively uncommon ideas in the Pirc, involving the move ...d6-d5. In
the current chapter, we will focus on 5.f4 , 5.e5 , and 5.Nf3 , while 5.Qd2 is
coveredhere in a separate chapter.} 5. f4 {White mixes Bg5 with the Austrian
Attack! Let's pause for a minute and evaluate the current position. By playing
f4 White signals the intention to play e5 soon, an idea that we always need to
have on the radar. This idea might be more potent than usual because the
Bishop on g5 often allows tactical ideas based on the vis-a-vis with our Queen.
The Bishop on g5 might be an annoyance for us, but it is also a liability for
White. We might play...h6 in the right moment when Bh4 leaves the Bishop
unprotected on h4. This point sounds less relevant at first, but hang on. An
additional fact: the square e3 is weak in White's camp, which often invites ...
Ng4 to hit this square. And last but not least, the setup Bg5 & f4 weakens
White's control over d4 and c5. We might either push ...c5 or ...e5 to take
advantage of the comparably weak d4-pawn, based on concrete tactics. All these
points add up to counterplay for Black - let's check the details.} O-O {
We'd like to open the position and attack White's centre, but first, we need
to get our King to safety. Now White's choice is between 6.Nf3 which is geared
towards Kingside castling, or 6.Qd2 heading in the other direction. These
moves require completely different replies, based on concrete tactics.} 6. e5 {
This aggressive-looking move is premature. Black gets a good game now, with
the right reply!} Ng4 {The e3-square is weak, remember? This is much better
than retreating the Knight. White needs to navigate a minefield now.} 7. Nf3 {
This is best, but not at all obvious.} f6 {Fighting against the e5-pawn.

f-file open already. White needs to find the only option 9.dxe5! giving up f4.
After 9...Rxf4 10.Qd2 Rf5 Black has snatched a pawn, but White has some
activity for it. The engine evaluated the situation as equal, given that White
plays perfectly the whole time. It is very messy, though, and not easy to play
for both sides. Still, we'd guess that most opponents would play 8...fxe5 9.

could also try 9.e6 when 9...d5 or 9...f5 are good. The e6-pawn is unlikely to
survive for long.} Ne3 {Or 9...Nb4 10.Qd2 Ne3 leading to the same position.}

playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is
essential to realize that the natural move 4...Bg7?! does not fit the bill.
This move looks like an automatic choice. We indeed continue like that in most
cases, for example, after √Æ√ÆStartFEN√Æ√Ærnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/
PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4√Æ√ÆEndFEN√Æ√Æ 4.f4 or 4.Nf3 . However, against 4.Be3
, there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.
Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After
Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time √Æ√ÆStartBracket√Æ√Æ..
.Bf8-g7-h6√Æ√ÆEndBracket√Æ√Æ, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack. It sounds
harsh, but 4...Bg7?! 5.Qd2 is not only better for White but would also be very
simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore
suggest a different approach. If 4...Bg7?! is out of contention, the moves 4...
c6 and 4...a6 are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to
consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a
slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need
to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play 4..
.c6 , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3.
This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book,
for example. We think that playing with 4...a6! is an exciting and less
explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the
Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these
lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a
quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.
With 4...a6 , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview
of White's ideas: A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside.
The starting moves for this idea are 5.Qd2 and 5.f3 , which we discuss in a
dedicated chapter. B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3
& g4 but develops with 5.Nf3 . This still could involve aggressive ideas with
Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This
approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3
combinationhere. C. White plays 5.h3 , which is not as popular as A and B but
is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but
might wants to change gears and go for f4!? 5.h3 was recommended in Christof's
Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to
be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter. D. Other ideas on move five
are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively
unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in
online games or at club level. White's play looks aggressive, which is
attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change
in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable.}
5. a4 {White wants to stop our plan to gain space on the Queenside. By doing
so, he weakens his Queenside, especially the square b4. Due to this weakening,
it is improbable that White will castle Queenside in the future.} (5. Be2 {
Rare, but not a bad move. White might continue with Nf3 but still keeps the
option to play f4, for example.} Bg7 {Sur@, it's a normal move, so why the

to mention that the line 5.h3 is not very popular for White, but this might
change, as it was covered in two important publications on Chessable. In 2018
it was first covered by one of the authors of this course, Christof Sielecki,

..O-O 7.Nf3 Black is in trouble, as 7...Nc6 8.e5 is no improvement, either. A
constant problem for Black is the possible advance e4-e5, when ...Nd5 is not
possible and ...Nfd7 is often answered with e5-e6! destroying Black's pawn
formation. This point leads to the idea 6...e6!? , which covers the d5-square
and therefore allows ...Nd5 in reply to e4-e5. Furthermore, after a later ...
Nc6, the e7-square is a good square for the Queen's Knight. We cover the
crucial squares d5 and f5, making pawn advances by White more difficult. After
the Knight is on e7, we finally play ...b7-b5 or ...b7-b6 to complete our
formation. White, with a large space advantage, should be able to preserve
some advantage, but Black is not without counter chances, as the following
sample lines demonstrate. We need to emphasize that 6...e6!? is pretty much
new ground, so there is no established theory that your opponent might know or
have prepared. We think that 7.Nf3 is White's most likely move, but we'll

We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill.

However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3
{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square while still keeping many options open. The main virtue of  4.Be3  is its flexibility, which poses a challenge to Black.  White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6 and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill. This move looks like an automatic choice. We indeed continue like that in most cases, for example, after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  or  4.Nf3  .  However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. f4
{ White mixes Be3 with the Austrian Attack. This move is somewhat rare but interesting. }
5... Bg7
{ Very natural and our choice. It looks tempting to play  5...Ng4  , but after  6.Bd2  it is not clear what we have accomplished.   If you want to explore something offbeat, then  5...b5!?  or even  5...d5  are interesting. These moves look less reliable than  5...Bg7  , though.  After  5...Bg7  White's most natural move is  6.Nf3  , but  6.Be2  is possible, too. White covers g4 with the Bishop and delays the Knight development.  A similar idea is  6.h3  which transposes to @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  a6  5.h3  Bg7  6.f4  which is coveredhere. }
6. Nf3

6... b5
{ We need to launch our counterplay immediately! If we'd play  6...O-O  here, the resulting position could be compared to the Austrian Attack line @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be3  when our reply is  6...b6!  quickly attacking e4 and preparing ...c5.

7. e5

7... Ng4 { White never spent a tempo on h3, which allows the Knight to jump. }
8. Bg1 b4

14. Nge2 Nb6
{ The game is very complex. White has a massive space advantage, but we have no pawn weaknesses and good piece play.   One idea is to move our c6-Knight, for example, to b4, and to push ...c5 afterwards. We'd like to organize some counterplay in the centre, reminding White that the King is still on e1. }

8. Bg2
{ White's usual continuation. The whole line is relatively unexplored, so there are many possibilities.  Another idea could be  8.f4!?  O-O  9.f5  c5!  with a razor-sharp position and chances for both sides. White has already thrown the kitchen sink after nine moves, but pawns don't go backward. This type of play leaves many weaknesses, which gives us good counter chances. }
8... e6
{ We take some more control over the central squares d5 and f5. A similar approach is seen multiple times in this chapter.   The Knight on b8 frequently travels to e7 in the future, blocking f4-f5 and possibly supporting d6-d5 in some lines. In general, Black's position is geared towards counter blows, hoping that White overextends. }
9. f4
{ White's centre looks impressive, but his King is without a pawn shield at the moment, and his advanced pawns might become loose later on. }
9... Nc6
{ This Knight is aiming for e7 to take more control over f5. White can still try to play  10.f5  , but  10.Nf3  looks better. }
10. Nf3 Ne7
{ As usual, White has got a clear space advantage, but he is in danger of over-extension, as well.   We plan to develop our d7-Knight to b6 to free our c8-Bishop. Our goal is to push ...d5 sooner or later. This way, we fight for the light central squares d5 and f5.   A strategically complicated fight is ahead. White has many possible moves now, so just a sample line: after the normal-looking move  11.Qe2  we can play  11...b5  and 12...Nb6 with a sharp and interesting position. }

White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6 and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill.

However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. h3
{ White answers our small pawn move on the Queenside with a small pawn move on the Kingside, claiming that it is worth a tempo to cover the g4-square. This approach looks slow, but it carries a serious punch, as we will see in this chapter.  Before we get to the move-by-move coverage, we need to mention that the line  5.h3  is not very popular for White, but this might change, as it was covered in two important publications on Chessable. In 2018 it was first covered by one of the authors of this course, Christof Sielecki, in 'Keep It Simple: 1.e4'. Two years later, Wesley So recommended it in his 'Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4'.

We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill.

However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. h3
{ White answers our small pawn move on the Queenside with a small pawn move on the Kingside, claiming that it is worth a tempo to cover the g4-square. This approach looks slow, but it carries a serious punch, as we will see in this chapter.  Before we get to the move-by-move coverage, we need to mention that the line  5.h3  is not very popular for White, but this might change, as it was covered in two important publications on Chessable. In 2018 it was first covered by one of the authors of this course, Christof Sielecki, in 'Keep It Simple: 1.e4'. Two years later, Wesley So recommended it in his 'Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4'.  Alright, back to the current position. Black's next is fairly natural. We complete the Kingside fianchetto. }

A constant problem for Black is the possible advance e4-e5, when ...Nd5 is not possible and ...Nfd7 is often answered with e5-e6! destroying Black's pawn formation.   This point leads to the idea  6...e6!?  , which covers the d5-square and therefore allows ...Nd5 in reply to e4-e5. Furthermore, after a later ...Nc6, the e7-square is a good square for the Queen's Knight. We cover the crucial squares d5 and f5, making pawn advances by White more difficult. After the Knight is on e7, we finally play ...b7-b5 or ...b7-b6 to complete our formation.   White, with a large space advantage, should be able to preserve some advantage, but Black is not without counter chances, as the following sample lines demonstrate.

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3
{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square while still keeping many options open. The main virtue of  4.Be3  is its flexibility, which poses a challenge to Black.  White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6 and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill. This move looks like an automatic choice. We indeed continue like that in most cases, for example, after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  or  4.Nf3  .  However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }

Furthermore, after a later ...Nc6, the e7-square is a good square for the Queen's Knight. We cover the crucial squares d5 and f5, making pawn advances by White more difficult. After the Knight is on e7, we finally play ...b7-b5 or ...b7-b6 to complete our formation.   White, with a large space advantage, should be able to preserve some advantage, but Black is not without counter chances, as the following sample lines demonstrate. We need to emphasize that  6...e6!?  is pretty much new ground, so there is no established theory that your opponent might know or have prepared. We think that  7.Nf3  is White's most likely move, but we'll check some more moves to show some key concepts. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3
{ White develops the Bishop to a natural square while still keeping many options open. The main virtue of  4.Be3  is its flexibility, which poses a challenge to Black.  White might intend to continue with Qd2, Bh6 and h2-h4-h5 to play for a first-round knockout, but there are other interpretations of the move, involving Nf3 and O-O. We need to check these various ideas by White to match White's flexible way of thinking.  However, before entertaining any sophisticated thoughts, we need to address the simple question: what is our reply to  4.Be3? }
4... a6
{ The move  4...a6!  is not the only playable move against 4.Be3, but we still award it an exclamation mark. It is essential to realize that the natural move  4...Bg7?!  does not fit the bill. This move looks like an automatic choice. We indeed continue like that in most cases, for example, after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f4  or  4.Nf3  .  However, against  4.Be3  , there is a concrete problem: White has the aggressive attacking plan of 5.Qd2, followed by Bh6. This straightforward approach is very effective. After Bh6, Black either needs to take the Bishop, losing more time @@StartBracket@@...Bf8-g7-h6@@EndBracket@@, or castle into the murderous h4-h5 attack.   It sounds harsh, but  4...Bg7?!  5.Qd2  is not only better for White but would also be very simple to play for our opponent. We need to be more cunning and therefore suggest a different approach. If  4...Bg7?!  is out of contention, the moves  4...c6  and  4...a6  are the main ideas for Black. Now, this is the moment to consider that White has the option of the caveman attack but might switch to a slower approach and continue with Nf3 and castle Kingside. This means we need to select a move that also fits into these scenarios. If you intend to play  4...c6  , you also need to play with ...c6 against the Classical system with 4.Nf3. This approach is chosen by Pirc expert Mihail Marin in his GM Repertoire book, for example.  We think that playing with  4...a6!  is an exciting and less explored option for Black. It turns out that the transpositions into the Classical are no problem, as ...a6 is a viable and interesting reply to these lines, as well. Now, how does it continue from here? We want to organize a quick counterplay on the Queenside and delay developing our Kingside Bishop.  With  4...a6  , we like to wait and see what White's plan is. Here's an overview of White's ideas:  A. Go for the Kingside attack and usually castle Queenside. The starting moves for this idea are  5.Qd2  and  5.f3  , which we discuss in a dedicated chapter.  B. White does not intend to throw the kitchen sink with f3 & g4 but develops with  5.Nf3  . This still could involve aggressive ideas with Qd2 and Bh6, but it might also just prepare O-O and lead to calmer play. This approach is covered in a dedicated chapter that covers the Nf3+Be3 combinationhere.  C. White plays  5.h3  , which is not as popular as A and B but is challenging. This move tells us that White is not after h4-h5 ideas, but might wants to change gears and go for f4!?   5.h3  was recommended in Christof's Keep It Simple: 1.e4 and Wesley So's Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4, so we need to be prepared. It is covered in the present chapter.  D. Other ideas on move five are covered in the current chapter. Many are transpositional and relatively unexplored. In practice, you'll face plan A most of the time, particularly in online games or at club level.  White's play looks aggressive, which is attractive to many 1.e4 players. Plan C is less common, but this might change in the future, given that it was recommended in popular courses on Chessable. }
5. h3
{ White answers our small pawn move on the Queenside with a small pawn move on the Kingside, claiming that it is worth a tempo to cover the g4-square. This approach looks slow, but it carries a serious punch, as we will see in this chapter.  Before we get to the move-by-move coverage, we need to mention that the line  5.h3  is not very popular for White, but this might change, as it was covered in two important publications on Chessable. In 2018 it was first covered by one of the authors of this course, Christof Sielecki, in 'Keep It Simple: 1.e4'. Two years later, Wesley So recommended it in his 'Lifetime Repertoires: 1.e4'.  Alright, back to the current position. Black's next is fairly natural. We complete the Kingside fianchetto. }
5... Bg7
{ A perfectly normal move, but we need to talk about it for a moment.

However, why not  5...b5?  Didn't we prepare this pawn push with 4...a6? Yes, but here it would be badly timed. After  5...b5?  6.e5!  a key point of 5.h3 is revealed. Black can't answer this advance with ...Ng4 and lines like  6...dxe5  7.dxe5  Nfd7  8.Qf3  is awful for Black. It's crucial to avoid @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5@@EndFEN@@  5...b5?  and preserve this option for a better moment.

The Knight on h5 makes it more difficult for White to keep the attack on the Kingside going, with the pawn push h2-h4-h5 off the table.  After ...Nh5 White likely wants to play Ne2 and Ng3 to get rid of our crucial defender.  This is easier said than done because ...Nc4! would be very annoying for White. The Knight jump attacks e3, d2 and b2 at the same time. White may stop ...Nc4 with the pawn move b3, but this move has its drawbacks as well.  We'd also like to mention that Ne2-g3 is not the end of the world, either. In some cases, we can even allow the capture on h5, as we will see. }
9. Bd3 { A natural move, but less aggressive than  9.b3 } 9... Bg7
{ Due to the push of the g-pawn, White's Bh6-idea is off the table. A good moment to play ...Bg7. }
10. Nge2 O-O
{ We suggest this uncompromising move. It is very committal, as after Ng3 we can't take on g3 and therefore need to allow Nxh5. Black has alternatives at this point, mostly  10...b4  or  10...Rb8  . If you dislike our choice, these moves should be investigated. }
11. Ng3 Na4
{ Once you recognize that this move is a playable option, it is tough to resist the temptation. Have you ever had doubled h-pawn and a-pawns in one game?  That being said, Black has other moves, like  11...Rb8  , for example - the main point is to avoid ...Nxg3 after you have castled. }

7. O-O-O
{ If White does not play  7.g4  this is most likely the way he will continue the game. }
7... Nb6
{ We already discussed earlier that we rather want to avoid Bishop moves for the moment.   The move ...Nb6 is useful to connect it to the c4-square and frees the d7-square for his fellow on f6. White has tried many moves here and we'll analyze some of them to get a better picture.   The most likely moves to face are  8.h4  our mainline, and  8.g4  . These moves lead to quite different positions, so there is no 'general strategy' at this point. }
8. g4
{ The move g4 is very popular for White in this type of position. White gains space and prepares h4-h5 or g4-g5. After the best reply, Black gets a good game without any trouble. }
8... h5
{ This is a strong defensive move. We immediately force White to decide about the fate of the g-pawn.  In both cases,  9.gxh5  or  9.g5  White has a hard time opening the Kingside position. With h5! we at least slow down White's play considerably. }
9. g5
{ White grabs space on the Kingside but closes this part of the board. Any attack will likely involve the push of the f-pawn now. }
9... Nfd7 10. f4 { Using the f-pawn is the only way forward for White. } 10...
b4
{ The b-pawn advance not only gains space on 'our' side of the board but also pushes away the defender of the e4-pawn. After White played f4, the e4-pawn becomes a target.  We'll check both Knight moves now, mostly because  11.Nce2  requires a non-standard reply. }
11. Nce2 { This move is bad, but not for the reason that first comes to mind! }
11... Bb7
{ The move  11...Nc4  looks very tempting but is questionable in this situation. After  11...Nc4  12.Qd3  Nxe3  13.Qxe3  White is better due to the development advantage.  They are ready to attack with f4-f5, and this makes the gain of the Bishop pair a moot point. Playing the much better move  11...Bb7  avoids these troubles. }
12. d5
{ After  12.Bg2  we play  12...c5!  attacking the centre. Now  13.dxc5  Nc4  14.Qd4  Nxe3  15.Qxe3  Nxc5  leads to an excellent position for Black. After ...Bg7 next, we'll have beautiful fianchettoed Bishops. }

They would need to play g4 at some point, but we control the square g4 with h5, Nf6, and Bc8. Playing for g4 is not White's only plan, though.   Let's discuss some general points about both side's ideas. The position is closed at the moment, in the sense that all pawns are still on the board. It is not a 'closed centre', though, when all the action is happening on the wings sometimes.  Let's take an example: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  5.d5  e5  4.Nc3  d6  5.e4  - In this Benoni structure the centre is closed and can't be easily opened. There won't be any open d-file any time soon.  In our position in the Pirc, the position is closed in the sense that there is no contact yet between the two armies, but hostilities might happen at any time. White could prepare g4, but also pawn pushes like f3-f4-f5 or e4-e5. On the other hand, Black might attack White's centre with ...e5, ...c5 or push forward on the Queenside. You notice all the ideas are based on pawn breaks and structure changes.  For Black, the key to these positions is to place the pieces well and prepare for the opponent's advances. At the same time, you need to make sure to make progress with your own play. Our play needs to be prophylactic in the best possible sense: watch out for your opponent's ideas, but do so with constructive moves that are not purely defensive.  So, how should Black's setup look like to meet these requirements? Black has a set of useful moves that fit well and form a harmonious setup. You mostly need to consider the order of the moves. Here's a guideline: - If White plays Nh3, take it with our Bishop. Our Bishop has a hard time finding a proper role, and White's Knight can improve to g5. This is more important than the Bishop-pair at the moment. White will often play  9.Nh3  right away or in the near future.  We think this move/idea is White's best shot. - The pawn move ...c6 is essential. We cover the square d5, which is very important to be equipped for e4-e5 by White. After e4-e5, we gain the d5-square for the Knights, and we need the maximum stability on this square. - After ...c6, we can play ...Qc7, which is a versatile addition to our setup.  The Queen supports ...e5 or ...c5 and makes e4-e5 more challenging to play. - After the moves h4 and ...h5 are on the board, White's Bh6-idea is impossible, and ...Bg7 becomes an option. - The move ...e6 can help strengthen the control of d5 @@StartBracket@@...c6 was a first step@@EndBracket@@ and make White's e4-e5-e6 push impossible. -  Finally, there is ...Rb8, which can be prepare ...Nc4 or ...Na4, when the b-file might open later. This list of moves is ordered roughly by 'urgency', so you'd usually start with ...c6, ...Qc7, ...Bg7, only then consider ...Rb8 or more direct action. We need those moves first to get stability, then see what to do next.  What you don't want to do: castle too soon! It is only a good idea once you have a clearer picture of the pawn structure and central action. You might want to castle if the centre opens up and you need to involve the h8-Rook quickly.  If the centre is open, an attack based on g4 is also less likely to work, making the King safer on the Kingside. So castling has to be carefully considered; it is never a 'routine move', but needs to be a conscious decision, based on the specific situation.  White is playing moves, too... and this requires adjustments, of course. We'll examine some lines now and discuss White's ideas in the process. }

{ Playing  4...a6  first is an essential move order nuance that we discussed in the 'Intro and Sidelines chapter'here.  The move is directed against White's most aggressive setups that involve Queenside castling and a quick Qd2 & Bh6 idea. In the current chapter, we will examine these ideas.  White usually starts with  5.Qd2  but you'll also meet  5.f3  frequently, which will often transpose, as a later Qd2 is very natural. Of course, White does have many other options on move five, but these are discussed in the mentioned Intro and Sidelines chapter. }
5. Qd2
{ The setup with Qd2 and f3 is a popular choice for White. The basic idea is to aim for Queenside castling and attack on the kingside or in the centre.  The pawn move f3 covers the e-pawn and prepares g4, a move that you'll face frequently. One reason for the popularity of White's system is the similarity to some Sicilian variations that White might know or have in their repertoire.

White's idea is simple and often very effective: develop the pieces on the Queenside first @@StartBracket@@ Be3 and Qd2 @@EndBracket@@, support the central pawn e4 by playing f3, castle Queenside, and push the kingside pawns forward.

6. f3
{ The main move by a mile. White supports the centre with the f-pawn and prepares a later g4 attack at the same time.  Quite frequently, this position arises via other move orders, like @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5@@EndFEN@@  5.f3  b5  6.Qd2  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.f3  a6  5.Be3  b5  6.Qd2 }
6... Nbd7
{ This is the most flexible move and better than the Bishop moves. Well, if we'd play ...Bg7, White's answer Bh6, is annoying. If we'd take White's Bishop, we lose a tempo compared to lines where we kept the Bishop on f8. We'd capture in two moves @@StartBracket@@Bf8-g7xh6@@EndBracket@@ instead of one @@StartBracket@@Bf8xh6@@EndBracket@@.  What about our other Bishop, the light-squared one? On b7, the light-squared Bishop would bang its head against a wall of White pawns: g2, f3 and e4. By playing ...Nbd7 first, we prepare to attack White's centre with either ...e5 or ...c5.   An additional idea is the Knight transfer to b6. From b6, it has access to c4. The move  6...Nbd7  also anticipates White's g4-g5 push. We'd like to have the option to play ...Nf6-d7 in response to g5. White now usually continues  7.O-O-O  or  7.g4  if he has Kingside play in mind, but  7.a4  is also met quite frequently. }
7. O-O-O
{ If White does not play  7.g4  this is most likely the way he will continue the game. }
7... Nb6
{ We already discussed earlier that we rather want to avoid Bishop moves for the moment.   The move ...Nb6 is useful to connect it to the c4-square and frees the d7-square for his fellow on f6. White has tried many moves here and we'll analyze some of them to get a better picture.   The most likely moves to face are  8.h4  our mainline, and  8.g4  . These moves lead to quite different positions, so there is no 'general strategy' at this point. }
8. h4
{ If you play the Pirc regularly, you will be getting used to this move. It's played often, in various lines, and is not very subtle. In most cases, we should stop the pawn immediately. }
8... h5
{ 'You shall not pass!' After ...h5 it's not easy for White to open files on the kingside without sacrificing a pawn. They would need to play g4 at some point, but we control the square g4 with h5, Nf6, and Bc8. Playing for g4 is not White's only plan, though.   Let's discuss some general points about both side's ideas. The position is closed at the moment, in the sense that all pawns are still on the board. It is not a 'closed centre', though, when all the action is happening on the wings sometimes.  Let's take an example: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  5.d5  e5  4.Nc3  d6  5.e4  - In this Benoni structure the centre is closed and can't be easily opened. There won't be any open d-file any time soon.  In our position in the Pirc, the position is closed in the sense that there is no contact yet between the two armies, but hostilities might happen at any time. White could prepare g4, but also pawn pushes like f3-f4-f5 or e4-e5. On the other hand, Black might attack White's centre with ...e5, ...c5 or push forward on the Queenside. You notice all the ideas are based on pawn breaks and structure changes.  For Black, the key to these positions is to place the pieces well and prepare for the opponent's advances. At the same time, you need to make sure to make progress with your own play. Our play needs to be prophylactic in the best possible sense: watch out for your opponent's ideas, but do so with constructive moves that are not purely defensive.  So, how should Black's setup look like to meet these requirements? Black has a set of useful moves that fit well and form a harmonious setup. You mostly need to consider the order of the moves. Here's a guideline: - If White plays Nh3, take it with our Bishop. Our Bishop has a hard time finding a proper role, and White's Knight can improve to g5. This is more important than the Bishop-pair at the moment. White will often play  9.Nh3  right away or in the near future.  We think this move/idea is White's best shot. - The pawn move ...c6 is essential. We cover the square d5, which is very important to be equipped for e4-e5 by White. After e4-e5, we gain the d5-square for the Knights, and we need the maximum stability on this square. - After ...c6, we can play ...Qc7, which is a versatile addition to our setup.  The Queen supports ...e5 or ...c5 and makes e4-e5 more challenging to play. - After the moves h4 and ...h5 are on the board, White's Bh6-idea is impossible, and ...Bg7 becomes an option. - The move ...e6 can help strengthen the control of d5 @@StartBracket@@...c6 was a first step@@EndBracket@@ and make White's e4-e5-e6 push impossible. -  Finally, there is ...Rb8, which can be prepare ...Nc4 or ...Na4, when the b-file might open later. This list of moves is ordered roughly by 'urgency', so you'd usually start with ...c6, ...Qc7, ...Bg7, only then consider ...Rb8 or more direct action. We need those moves first to get stability, then see what to do next.  What you don't want to do: castle too soon! It is only a good idea once you have a clearer picture of the pawn structure and central action. You might want to castle if the centre opens up and you need to involve the h8-Rook quickly.  If the centre is open, an attack based on g4 is also less likely to work, making the King safer on the Kingside. So castling has to be carefully considered; it is never a 'routine move', but needs to be a conscious decision, based on the specific situation.  White is playing moves, too... and this requires adjustments, of course. We'll examine some lines now and discuss White's ideas in the process. }
9. Nh3
{ We think this is the most likely move to happen and the most challenging at the same time. If you consider the position before @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/pn1p1np1/1p6/3PP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 3 8@@EndFEN@@  8.h4  White had problems developing the Kingside Knight.  Playing Nge2 doesn't work due to ...Nc4, so what to do? The move  8.h4  not only showed attacking ambitions but also prepared the Knight development to h3. From h3, the Knight might jump to g5 or go to f2. This is not too important, as we'll take the Knight anyway, as discussed before.   White may also delay Nh3 and start with a different move, but go for Nh3 later. The sequence  9.Bd3  c6  10.Nh3  Bxh3  11.Rxh3  is possible and transposes to @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/pn1p1np1/1p6/3PP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 3 8@@EndFEN@@  8.h4  h5  9.Nh3  Bxh3  10.Rxh3  c6  11.Bd3  which we will analyze in a moment. }
9... Bxh3 { According to plan. } 10. Rxh3 c6
{ We suggest starting with this move, followed by ...Qc7 and ...Bg7 next.  Now White's pawn push e4-e5 does not trouble us. We think that  11.Bd3  strengthens the e4-e5 push idea and is the most challenging move. }
11. e5
{ After trading on h3, White might have the idea to play the e-pawn to e6, which can be annoying.   A key decision now: to take or not take on e5? }
11... dxe5
{ We have to take here. After  11...Nfd5  12.Nxd5  Nxd5  13.e6!  fxe6  14.Rg3!  we would be in trouble. You always should have e5-e6 on your radar. Missing this idea can be costly. }
12. dxe5 Qxd2+ 13. Bxd2 Nfd5
{ We have reached an endgame that offers chances for both players. White enjoys the Bishop-pair, but this is not as relevant in a symmetrical pawn distribution.   Black benefits from the excellent anchor square on d5 for the Knights. Most of the pawns are placed on light squares, which harmonizes well with the Bishop. }

{ This is the most flexible move and better than the Bishop moves. Well, if we'd play ...Bg7, White's answer Bh6, is annoying.

We'd capture in two moves @@StartBracket@@Bf8-g7xh6@@EndBracket@@ instead of one @@StartBracket@@Bf8xh6@@EndBracket@@.  What about our other Bishop, the light-squared one? On b7, the light-squared Bishop would bang its head against a wall of White pawns: g2, f3 and e4. By playing ...Nbd7 first, we prepare to attack White's centre with either ...e5 or ...c5.   An additional idea is the Knight transfer to b6. From b6, it has access to c4. The move  6...Nbd7  also anticipates White's g4-g5 push. We'd like to have the option to play ...Nf6-d7 in response to g5. White now usually continues  7.O-O-O  or  7.g4  if he has Kingside play in mind, but  7.a4  is also met quite frequently. }
7. O-O-O
{ If White does not play  7.g4  this is most likely the way he will continue the game. }
7... Nb6
{ We already discussed earlier that we rather want to avoid Bishop moves for the moment.   The move ...Nb6 is useful to connect it to the c4-square and frees the d7-square for his fellow on f6. White has tried many moves here and we'll analyze some of them to get a better picture.   The most likely moves to face are  8.h4  our mainline, and  8.g4  . These moves lead to quite different positions, so there is no 'general strategy' at this point. }
8. h4
{ If you play the Pirc regularly, you will be getting used to this move. It's played often, in various lines, and is not very subtle. In most cases, we should stop the pawn immediately. }
8... h5
{ 'You shall not pass!' After ...h5 it's not easy for White to open files on the kingside without sacrificing a pawn. They would need to play g4 at some point, but we control the square g4 with h5, Nf6, and Bc8. Playing for g4 is not White's only plan, though.   Let's discuss some general points about both side's ideas. The position is closed at the moment, in the sense that all pawns are still on the board. It is not a 'closed centre', though, when all the action is happening on the wings sometimes.  Let's take an example: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  5.d5  e5  4.Nc3  d6  5.e4  - In this Benoni structure the centre is closed and can't be easily opened. There won't be any open d-file any time soon.  In our position in the Pirc, the position is closed in the sense that there is no contact yet between the two armies, but hostilities might happen at any time. White could prepare g4, but also pawn pushes like f3-f4-f5 or e4-e5. On the other hand, Black might attack White's centre with ...e5, ...c5 or push forward on the Queenside. You notice all the ideas are based on pawn breaks and structure changes.  For Black, the key to these positions is to place the pieces well and prepare for the opponent's advances. At the same time, you need to make sure to make progress with your own play. Our play needs to be prophylactic in the best possible sense: watch out for your opponent's ideas, but do so with constructive moves that are not purely defensive.  So, how should Black's setup look like to meet these requirements? Black has a set of useful moves that fit well and form a harmonious setup. You mostly need to consider the order of the moves. Here's a guideline: - If White plays Nh3, take it with our Bishop. Our Bishop has a hard time finding a proper role, and White's Knight can improve to g5. This is more important than the Bishop-pair at the moment. White will often play  9.Nh3  right away or in the near future.  We think this move/idea is White's best shot. - The pawn move ...c6 is essential. We cover the square d5, which is very important to be equipped for e4-e5 by White. After e4-e5, we gain the d5-square for the Knights, and we need the maximum stability on this square. - After ...c6, we can play ...Qc7, which is a versatile addition to our setup.  The Queen supports ...e5 or ...c5 and makes e4-e5 more challenging to play. - After the moves h4 and ...h5 are on the board, White's Bh6-idea is impossible, and ...Bg7 becomes an option. - The move ...e6 can help strengthen the control of d5 @@StartBracket@@...c6 was a first step@@EndBracket@@ and make White's e4-e5-e6 push impossible. -  Finally, there is ...Rb8, which can be prepare ...Nc4 or ...Na4, when the b-file might open later. This list of moves is ordered roughly by 'urgency', so you'd usually start with ...c6, ...Qc7, ...Bg7, only then consider ...Rb8 or more direct action. We need those moves first to get stability, then see what to do next.  What you don't want to do: castle too soon! It is only a good idea once you have a clearer picture of the pawn structure and central action. You might want to castle if the centre opens up and you need to involve the h8-Rook quickly.  If the centre is open, an attack based on g4 is also less likely to work, making the King safer on the Kingside. So castling has to be carefully considered; it is never a 'routine move', but needs to be a conscious decision, based on the specific situation.  White is playing moves, too... and this requires adjustments, of course. We'll examine some lines now and discuss White's ideas in the process. }
9. Nh3
{ We think this is the most likely move to happen and the most challenging at the same time. If you consider the position before @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/pn1p1np1/1p6/3PP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 3 8@@EndFEN@@  8.h4  White had problems developing the Kingside Knight.  Playing Nge2 doesn't work due to ...Nc4, so what to do? The move  8.h4  not only showed attacking ambitions but also prepared the Knight development to h3. From h3, the Knight might jump to g5 or go to f2. This is not too important, as we'll take the Knight anyway, as discussed before.   White may also delay Nh3 and start with a different move, but go for Nh3 later. The sequence  9.Bd3  c6  10.Nh3  Bxh3  11.Rxh3  is possible and transposes to @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/pn1p1np1/1p6/3PP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 3 8@@EndFEN@@  8.h4  h5  9.Nh3  Bxh3  10.Rxh3  c6  11.Bd3  which we will analyze in a moment. }
9... Bxh3 { According to plan. } 10. Rxh3 c6
{ We suggest starting with this move, followed by ...Qc7 and ...Bg7 next.  Now White's pawn push e4-e5 does not trouble us. We think that  11.Bd3  strengthens the e4-e5 push idea and is the most challenging move. }
11. Bd3 { White prepares e5-e6, which looks like White's best plan. } 11... Qc7
{ A good place for the Queen. In some of the following lines we'll see that it is slightly more precise to move the Queen first and delay ...Bg7. }
12. Kb1
{ A good prophylactic move, preparing e4-e5. The immediate  12.e5  is premature but now a more serious idea. }
12... Bg7
{ The next step to complete our setup. Now we'll consider the direct attack  13.e5  and look at a slower approach as well. }
13. Rhh1
{ We'll have a look at this move as an example for slower play instead of  13.e5  by White.  There are other 'slow play' options, but it's not so much about concrete moves here. We want to show typical ideas for this position type to help you navigate the whole complex in general. }
13... e6
{ This is an instructive moment. The move  13...e6  is strong, and the reasoning is not obvious. Thinking about alternatives will help to explain matters.  You can't castle, as  13...O-O?  14.g4!  hxg4  15.h5  kills Black. We need to stay in the centre for the moment, but this is not a real concern, as the centre is closed. Our pieces are on their intended spots, so we should prepare some action on the Queenside and against White's centre.   Ideas like ...b4 or ...c5 come to mind quickly, but we need to be careful with the timing. After  13...c5?  White has  14.e5!  when we badly regret the weakening of the d5-square. This is where @@StartFEN@@r3k2r/2q1ppb1/pnpp1np1/1p5p/3PP2P/2NBBP2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R b kq - 5 13@@EndFEN@@  13...e6!  starts to make sense. If you want to play ...c5 or ...b4 &...c5 additional stability in the centre is paramount. We need to look at some lines to demonstrate how this works out in practice. }
14. Rhe1
{ White centralizes and hinders  14...c5?  due to  15.e5  . The move ...c5 would have worked against other moves, though.   Stockfish suggests  14.Ne2  when  14...c5  is possible and leads to equal chances. }
14... b4
{ As mentioned  14...c5?  is premature, but our choice  14...b4  or the prep moves  14...Nfd7  or  14...Rb8  would work well. }
15. Ne2 Nfd7
{ Now White can't take on b4, as c6-c5-c4 would trap the Bishop. The position is complicated and exciting to play.  We have the idea ...c5, but our pawn structure is flexible. It is possible to play ...d5 in some situations, for example, after  16.f4  , the move  16...d5  makes a good impression. We might have ...Nc4 later. }

An additional idea is the Knight transfer to b6. From b6, it has access to c4. The move  6...Nbd7  also anticipates White's g4-g5 push.

{ If White does not play  7.g4  this is most likely the way he will continue the game. }
7... Nb6
{ We already discussed earlier that we rather want to avoid Bishop moves for the moment.   The move ...Nb6 is useful to connect it to the c4-square and frees the d7-square for his fellow on f6. White has tried many moves here and we'll analyze some of them to get a better picture.   The most likely moves to face are  8.h4  our mainline, and  8.g4  . These moves lead to quite different positions, so there is no 'general strategy' at this point. }
8. h4
{ If you play the Pirc regularly, you will be getting used to this move. It's played often, in various lines, and is not very subtle. In most cases, we should stop the pawn immediately. }
8... h5
{ 'You shall not pass!' After ...h5 it's not easy for White to open files on the kingside without sacrificing a pawn. They would need to play g4 at some point, but we control the square g4 with h5, Nf6, and Bc8. Playing for g4 is not White's only plan, though.   Let's discuss some general points about both side's ideas. The position is closed at the moment, in the sense that all pawns are still on the board. It is not a 'closed centre', though, when all the action is happening on the wings sometimes.  Let's take an example: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  5.d5  e5  4.Nc3  d6  5.e4  - In this Benoni structure the centre is closed and can't be easily opened. There won't be any open d-file any time soon.  In our position in the Pirc, the position is closed in the sense that there is no contact yet between the two armies, but hostilities might happen at any time. White could prepare g4, but also pawn pushes like f3-f4-f5 or e4-e5. On the other hand, Black might attack White's centre with ...e5, ...c5 or push forward on the Queenside. You notice all the ideas are based on pawn breaks and structure changes.  For Black, the key to these positions is to place the pieces well and prepare for the opponent's advances. At the same time, you need to make sure to make progress with your own play. Our play needs to be prophylactic in the best possible sense: watch out for your opponent's ideas, but do so with constructive moves that are not purely defensive.  So, how should Black's setup look like to meet these requirements? Black has a set of useful moves that fit well and form a harmonious setup. You mostly need to consider the order of the moves. Here's a guideline: - If White plays Nh3, take it with our Bishop. Our Bishop has a hard time finding a proper role, and White's Knight can improve to g5. This is more important than the Bishop-pair at the moment. White will often play  9.Nh3  right away or in the near future.  We think this move/idea is White's best shot. - The pawn move ...c6 is essential. We cover the square d5, which is very important to be equipped for e4-e5 by White. After e4-e5, we gain the d5-square for the Knights, and we need the maximum stability on this square. - After ...c6, we can play ...Qc7, which is a versatile addition to our setup.  The Queen supports ...e5 or ...c5 and makes e4-e5 more challenging to play. - After the moves h4 and ...h5 are on the board, White's Bh6-idea is impossible, and ...Bg7 becomes an option. - The move ...e6 can help strengthen the control of d5 @@StartBracket@@...c6 was a first step@@EndBracket@@ and make White's e4-e5-e6 push impossible. -  Finally, there is ...Rb8, which can be prepare ...Nc4 or ...Na4, when the b-file might open later. This list of moves is ordered roughly by 'urgency', so you'd usually start with ...c6, ...Qc7, ...Bg7, only then consider ...Rb8 or more direct action. We need those moves first to get stability, then see what to do next.  What you don't want to do: castle too soon! It is only a good idea once you have a clearer picture of the pawn structure and central action. You might want to castle if the centre opens up and you need to involve the h8-Rook quickly.  If the centre is open, an attack based on g4 is also less likely to work, making the King safer on the Kingside. So castling has to be carefully considered; it is never a 'routine move', but needs to be a conscious decision, based on the specific situation.  White is playing moves, too... and this requires adjustments, of course. We'll examine some lines now and discuss White's ideas in the process. }
9. Nh3

10... Nc6
{ We just develop and cover b4. Here Black has an exciting alternative in  10...Ng4  , after which White has no good way to keep the Bishop on the board, as f2 is under fire, too. After  11.cxd6  Nxe3  12.Qxe3  exd6  13.e5  Nd7  14.e6  we get to a sharp position, but it might fizzle out to simplifications quickly.  Our choice is less forcing and aimed at playing a fighting game without too many concrete lines. }
11. cxd6 Qxd6
{ We have lost a pawn but receive good compensation. We threaten ...Ng4 now, trying to remove White's important Bishop.   We'd like to trade this piece to make our star Bishop on g7 even more powerful. Another idea is the crude, but dangerous, a5-a4. White is far away from launching an attack and instead has to worry about defending. }
12. h3
{ The engine recommendation. It stops the ...Ng4 plan but is not the most obvious and 'human' move. It's not easy for White here, as a line like  12.Kb1  Ng4  13.Bf4  Qf6!  shows. }
12... a5
{ We suggest continuing with the attack. Black has a good alternative in  12...Qe6!?  , with a double attack on a2 and e4. White can't allow ...Qxa2, which forces  13.Kb1  Nxe4  14.Qc1  Bb7  when Black has regained the pawn.   It's not easy to decide between the two lines. We think just attacking with  12...a5  might be easier to play, but there is a matter of taste involved. }

We need to examine some alternatives for White:  7.Bh6  ,  7.Bd3  , and  7.O-O-O  are the moves to check. It's rare but possible for White to play  7.h3  or  7.a4  and return to the realms of lines examined via 6.h3. }
7. Bh6
{ White goes for the Bishop exchange, a typical attacking device. Our Bishop is a crucial defender of the King, so trading it makes a lot of sense.   An additional idea for White is not to take on g7 but to keep the Bishop on h6 and play h4-h5. The Bishop on h6 stops Black's ...h5-reply against h4, which is a commonly seen idea in our repertoire.   Sounds great for White, but there is a downside. This type of play is time-consuming, and our counterplay arrives in time. }
7... b5 { We finally launch our counterplay with the b-pawn. } 8. Bxg7
{ White exchanges the dark-squared Bishops right away. This makes out King position somewhat safer, as a one attacking option can be h4-h5, which is more dangerous if White keeps the tension with the Bishops still being on the board.   After the trade on g7 White's h-pawn push could be stopped by ...h5. }
8... Kxg7 9. Bd3
{ White needs to take care of the e4-pawn given our ...b4-idea.  9.Bd3  is a natural way to defend the important pawn.  Instead  9.e5  dxe5  10.dxe5  Qxd2+  leads nowhere, as the advanced e-pawn is more of a liability for White than an asset. }
9... Nc6
{ We develop our Queenside Knight and take more control of the dark squares in the centre of the board. It is somewhat uncommon to place the Knight in front of the c-pawn, but it works well here.   In addition, a setup with ...Bb7 and ...Nbd7 is not possible here, as both  9...Nbd7?  and  9...Bb7?  are refuted by  10.e5  . We are just too slow to complete this setup.   After our choice  9...Nc6  , the only critical test is  10.e5  . A slow move can't trouble Black; we'd have time to play ...e5 with a good game. }
10. e5
{ This is the acid test of our concept. If we'd manage to play ...e5, there is no reason at all why White would have any claim to an advantage. You could even argue that White's pieces are slightly misplaced, as the Bishop on d3.   The move  10.e5  is critical, as it seeks to activate White's pieces with tempo. The play is very concrete and tactical now. }
10... dxe5
{ We need to take on e5 first, so after  10...dxe5  11.dxe5  Ng4  , the pawn is hanging.   After  10...Ng4?  11.Be4  we have no good move. }
11. dxe5 Ng4
{ White's pawn on e5 is under fire. They need to play precisely now to pose any problems. }
12. Qf4
{ White's second most popular choice, but it runs into a cute tactic. White could also play  12.Qe2  to cover the pawn, but  12...Nd4  or  12...b4  are fine for Black. }
12... Ncxe5 13. Nxe5 Qd6
{ Pin and win! Well, here Black doesn't win right away, but it's already a bit better for Black.  White can get the pawn back with  14.Nxg6  hxg6  , but we are happy about the opening outcome. We are well centralized and manages to remove White's e-pawn in exchange for the h-pawn. }

{ At the moment, we are a Rook down for just two pawns, but White's King is insecure, and we'll often pick up more pawns, for example, b2. It's always tricky to decide how deep you want to continue with an analysis. We decided to cut it here and show the engine's two main lines, which end with equality after a slug-fest.   A.  17.Qe3  Nd7  18.Be4  Bxb2  19.Ke1  Nf6  20.Kf1  Rd8  It looks odd to trade, but it all comes with a tempo. The outside passers are very strong, and White is playing without the extra Rook at the moment.  21.Rxd8+  Qxd8  22.Qd3  Qa5  23.g4  c4  Crazy stuff, but that's what we signed up for!   B.  17.Ra1  is also 0.00 for the comp, but completely inhuman, as White needs to dodge several bullets to make a draw.  17...Qb5  18.Qa4  Qc4  19.Ke3  Bd4+  20.Nxd4  Qxd4+  21.Kf3  g5  We push White's King around, and White needs to find a defence.  Line A seems more likely to happen in practice, and it's just a cool position to play and fun to analyze. White's aggressive lines in this chapter can lead to messy and exciting positions. We have examined some new ideas for Black in this chapter ... and are ready to 'Fight fire with fire!'. }

Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses.

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bg5
{ This is one of White's more aggressive setups. Similar to  4.Be3  White aims for rapid Queenside development.  Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses. There is no 'once size fits all' approach or a 'setup' to go for. Each line leads to different position types and needs a specific answer.   We will examine  4.Bg5  in two chapters. The present one covers all options for White after  4...Bg7  except the most popular move,  5.Qd2  , which is examined in a dedicated chapter. }

{ This is one of White's more aggressive setups. Similar to  4.Be3  White aims for rapid Queenside development.  Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses.

{ White mixes Bg5 with the Austrian Attack! Let's pause for a minute and evaluate the current position. By playing f4 White signals the intention to play e5 soon, an idea that we always need to have on the radar.   This idea might be more potent than usual because the Bishop on g5 often allows tactical ideas based on the vis-a-vis with our Queen. The Bishop on g5 might be an annoyance for us, but it is also a liability for White. We might play...h6 in the right moment when Bh4 leaves the Bishop unprotected on h4.   This point sounds less relevant at first, but hang on. An additional fact: the square e3 is weak in White's camp, which often invites ...Ng4 to hit this square. And last but not least, the setup Bg5 & f4 weakens White's control over d4 and c5. We might either push ...c5 or ...e5 to take advantage of the comparably weak d4-pawn, based on concrete tactics.   All these points add up to counterplay for Black - let's check the details. }

9... Nxc6

{ This is one of White's more aggressive setups. Similar to  4.Be3  White aims for rapid Queenside development.  Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses. There is no 'once size fits all' approach or a 'setup' to go for. Each line leads to different position types and needs a specific answer.   We will examine  4.Bg5  in two chapters.

Still, we'd guess that most opponents would play  8...fxe5  9.fxe5?  and be much worse. }

{ This is one of White's more aggressive setups. Similar to  4.Be3  White aims for rapid Queenside development.  Quite frequently, our opponent aims for Queenside castling and intends to launch a Kingside attack. But why does White play  4.Bg5  instead of  4.Be3?   After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses. There is no 'once size fits all' approach or a 'setup' to go for. Each line leads to different position types and needs a specific answer.   We will examine  4.Bg5  in two chapters.

After  4.Bg5  the Bishop is more active than on e3. It attacks our f6-Knight and we have to reckon with e4-e5 in many cases. Sounds great for White but there are drawbacks.  First of all, the Bishop might get kicked away with ...h6 and possibly ...g5. In some cases, White needs to give up the Bishop-pair, as we will see.  A second point, compared to Be3 setups, is the neglect of central control on d4 and c5. On e3 the Bishop helps to control those squares, while on g5, and often h4 later, this piece is not connected to the centre and Queenside action.   A crucial point to mention is that White's various continuations after  4...Bg7  -  5.Qd2  ,  5.f4  ,  5.Nf3  and  5.e5  - require different responses. There is no 'once size fits all' approach or a 'setup' to go for. Each line leads to different position types and needs a specific answer.   We will examine  4.Bg5  in two chapters.

The Bishop on g5 might be an annoyance for us, but it is also a liability for White. We might play...h6 in the right moment when Bh4 leaves the Bishop unprotected on h4.   This point sounds less relevant at first, but hang on. An additional fact: the square e3 is weak in White's camp, which often invites ...Ng4 to hit this square.

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bc4
{ White moves his Kingside Bishop to an active square, pointing to f7, the weakest spot in Black's camp. This concept is also seen in the Italian game after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bc4  , which is why we decided to call the line 'Italian Pirc'.

He calls it the 'Short Attack', but we have only found one game played by Nigel Short in this variation, and this happened to be a simultaneous event.  Well, back to the actual merits of the move. Playing the Bishop to the 'Italian square' looks like a reasonable choice, but what are the drawbacks? There are two, one tactical and one strategic.  The tactical one is related to the idea ...Nxe4, followed by d6-d5. A typical line to illustrate this idea is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.O-O  Nxe4!  7.Nxe4  d5  , which gives us good play. Note that ...Nxe4 should only be played after ...O-O is already on the board. White may answer our Knight move with Bxf7+, dragging our King out in the open. After ...O-O, the capture on f7 can be answered with ...Rxf7!, keeping our King safe.   The slight strategic drawback of the move  4.Bc4  is that in some lines, Black manages to generate play on the dark squares, as the pinning move ...Bg4 gains strength. In connection with ...Nc6, Black gets some pressure on d4, often establishing a Knight on this central square.  In this chapter, most lines don't require exact knowledge... but there is one exception.

{ We evaluate this position as equal and with chances for both sides. In many ways, the position is similar to an open Sicilian. Just mirror the board vertically, and you see the point.   Black enjoys two centre pawns and the half-open f-file. The position on the Kingside looks somewhat loose at first glance, but it is safe. A key point is the absence of White's light-squared Bishop, which makes attacks against g6 less of a problem.   Just imagine a Bishop on d3, and it would be a completely different story. On the other hand, we have an excellent play on the f-file. Any attack on our g6-pawn we might defend with Qf6 and Ne7. Keep in mind that the pair of Bishops might play a role later on in the game, as well.   In the Sicilian Black frequently sacrifices the exchange on c3. Here it would be on f3, but it might be just as strong. For example, after the @@StartBracket@@admittedly rather stupid@@EndBracket@@ move  11.Qb3?  the capture on f3 would be excellent for Black. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bc4
{ White moves his Kingside Bishop to an active square, pointing to f7, the weakest spot in Black's camp. This concept is also seen in the Italian game after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bc4  , which is why we decided to call the line 'Italian Pirc'.  It seems that the line has no commonly accepted name, though. It is recommended in the book Gambit Opening Repertoire by Eric Schiller. He calls it the 'Short Attack', but we have only found one game played by Nigel Short in this variation, and this happened to be a simultaneous event.  Well, back to the actual merits of the move. Playing the Bishop to the 'Italian square' looks like a reasonable choice, but what are the drawbacks? There are two, one tactical and one strategic.  The tactical one is related to the idea ...Nxe4, followed by d6-d5. A typical line to illustrate this idea is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.O-O  Nxe4!  7.Nxe4  d5  , which gives us good play. Note that ...Nxe4 should only be played after ...O-O is already on the board. White may answer our Knight move with Bxf7+, dragging our King out in the open. After ...O-O, the capture on f7 can be answered with ...Rxf7!, keeping our King safe.   The slight strategic drawback of the move  4.Bc4  is that in some lines, Black manages to generate play on the dark squares, as the pinning move ...Bg4 gains strength. In connection with ...Nc6, Black gets some pressure on d4, often establishing a Knight on this central square.  In this chapter, most lines don't require exact knowledge... but there is one exception.

4... Bg7
{ We play the natural move and stay flexible. As mentioned before,  4...Nxe4?  is too early due to  5.Bxf7+  exposing our King.

5. Qe2
{ If White avoids the classical setup with Nf3, the move  5.Qe2  is likely the choice. White's idea is to push his e-pawn to e5 and possibly to e6. }
5... Nc6
{ We have many alternatives, such as castling or playing ...c6. However, 5... Nc6 is an interesting move. It points at a drawback of the early 5. Qe2: the pawn on d4 is weak and now needs some protection. }
6. e5
{ Wait, what? Shouldn't White be worried about d4? Still, this aggressive pawn push is the move you will most likely face in this position. White doesn't care about d4 and instead attacks our Knight. }
6... Ng4
{ We suggest  6...Ng4  , instead of picking up the gauntlet with  6...Nxd4  . We think that  6...Ng4  is a good move, and we suggest a new idea for Black in the main continuation. More on that later, once we check the details.  The second point is that we are sceptical about Black's chances after  6...Nxd4  , which forces the following sequence  7.exf6  Nxe2  8.fxg7  Rg8  9.Ngxe2  Rxg7  10.Bh6  Rg8  11.O-O-O  . A fascinating line that features a unique material balance, but we felt that it is easier to play with White. Black's main reply is  11...Be6  , when  12.Bxe6  fxe6  13,  h4  was the line that we disliked.   White still keeps the option to play f3 and place a Knight on the secure square e4. These lines are unconventional, and you might have a different opinion on Black's prospects If you like these positions - it is forced after  6...Nxd4  to move 13 - you can go for  6...Nxd4  .   We decided to avoid  6...Nxd4  , also for a psychological reason. White invited this line and likely feels at home if we accept the challenge. On the other hand, our move  6...Ng4  leads to entirely different positions.  As a nice bonus, White now frequently falls into a trap - let's look at the mistake  7.e6?  and White's only good move,  7.Bb5 }
7. Bb5
{ The only good move for White. The pawn centre is under heavy pressure, and playing  7.Bb5  and taking on c6 next is the only way to keep it stable.  We think that an aggressive player on the White side won't be happy with this scenario. The arising positions are objectively equal, but White's attacking chances are diminished without the active Bishop. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. g3
{ This move introduces the Fianchetto Variation. By playing  4.g3  , White signals that he is not going for a furious attack on our King. White instead wants to build up a solid position and control the game. It's a good variation for the type of White player who likes a positional game with relatively low risk.  White's most common way to develop is Bg2, Nge2, O-O, h3, Be3 and Qd2. In many cases, White wants to gain space on the Kingside after castling by playing f4, g4, and possibly f4-f5 or g4-g5 later on.  The Bishop on g2 will protect the important e4-pawn and discourages an advance of our b-pawn due to a possible e4-e5 push. Therefore we don't play for a Queenside expansion but prefer to play in the centre.  Our approach is playing a quick ...e5, followed by ...exd4.

It's important not to try anything too fancy in boring positions. Improve your pieces step by step and hope that your unambitious opponent gives you chances. Often it will take some time, but opponents with a rather weak mindset tend to break down at some point. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. g3
{ This move introduces the Fianchetto Variation. By playing  4.g3  , White signals that he is not going for a furious attack on our King. White instead wants to build up a solid position and control the game. It's a good variation for the type of White player who likes a positional game with relatively low risk.  White's most common way to develop is Bg2, Nge2, O-O, h3, Be3 and Qd2. In many cases, White wants to gain space on the Kingside after castling by playing f4, g4, and possibly f4-f5 or g4-g5 later on.  The Bishop on g2 will protect the important e4-pawn and discourages an advance of our b-pawn due to a possible e4-e5 push. Therefore we don't play for a Queenside expansion but prefer to play in the centre.  Our approach is playing a quick ...e5, followed by ...exd4. We open the long diagonal for our Bishop and start counterplay against the e4-pawn, based on ...Re8.  We'll discuss these ideas once we reach the main positions of this chapter. }

However, White played quite unambiguously, and there are still a lot of pieces on the board.  The key to winning such a position is patience. Improve your position step by step and wait for bad decisions by your opponent. Often an opponent with a weak mindset will try to trade pieces but give up little things in the process. Try to provoke trades that give you small edges and accumulate those over time. }

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. g3
{ This move introduces the Fianchetto Variation. By playing  4.g3  , White signals that he is not going for a furious attack on our King. White instead wants to build up a solid position and control the game. It's a good variation for the type of White player who likes a positional game with relatively low risk.  White's most common way to develop is Bg2, Nge2, O-O, h3, Be3 and Qd2. In many cases, White wants to gain space on the Kingside after castling by playing f4, g4, and possibly f4-f5 or g4-g5 later on.  The Bishop on g2 will protect the important e4-pawn and discourages an advance of our b-pawn due to a possible e4-e5 push. Therefore we don't play for a Queenside expansion but prefer to play in the centre.  Our approach is playing a quick ...e5, followed by ...exd4. We open the long diagonal for our Bishop and start counterplay against the e4-pawn, based on ...Re8.  We'll discuss these ideas once we reach the main positions of this chapter. }

This is welcome, though - we have a great reply with  11...b5!?  , generating good counterplay on the Queenside. }
11. Re1

Like in some Sicilian defence lines, White never manages to get serious pressure on the d-pawn, so this static weakness is not concerning. }
13. Be3

After  14...Re6  White has mostly played  15.Rad1  which makes a very harmonious impression. We'll also briefly check the alternatives  15.f4  and  15.Nd5 }
15. Rad1
{ White finds good squares for his pieces and increases the pressure on the d6-pawn. White has some alternatives, but they don't change the picture much.   After  15.f4  , Black has good counterplay against e4, which can be emphasized with  15...Qe8  or  15...Qe7  . You can also consider  15...Qd7  , planning ...Rae8 and ...b5.   You see that Black has many good options, which is why we don't discuss  15.f4  as a trainable line. A similar case is  15.Nd5  when  15...b5  or  15...Qd7  are just two promising lines of many. }

Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.   B.  3...c5  is often recommended when  4.d5  leads to a good Benoni-style play. But we didn't like  4.dxc5  in some lines that closely resemble a Sicilian Defence and looked tricky to play.   C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.

Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.   B.  3...c5  is often recommended when  4.d5  leads to a good Benoni-style play. But we didn't like  4.dxc5  in some lines that closely resemble a Sicilian Defence and looked tricky to play.   C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.

Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid.

In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next.   These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too. Let's have a look. }

It is important to note that White can use the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  when  4...a6  is our recommended answer.

7... b5
{ This fantastic resource is one of the lines that makes the early ...a6 an attractive choice. White's Knight move to e2 has a drawback: it lessens control over b5, which allows this dynamic option!   It turns out we don't even need to spend a tempo on ...c6 to prepare the b-pawn advance. So, why does this move work? We'll check the details shortly, but the basic idea is  8.cxb5  axb5  9.Nxb5  c6  10.Nbc3  Nbd7  followed by ...e5 and ...d5, blasting open the centre. White is behind in development, and the King is far away from castling, so this is enough for a pawn.   Alright, let's investigate some details now. Does White have to take on b5? Well, they almost always play this move, but we'll also check the move  8.Qd2  intending Bh6 next. }
8. cxb5
{ By far White's main move. Modern engines immediately show that Black has enough compensation, but this is far from obvious for a human player on the White side.   If you have never seen the idea, it might look like Black is playing recklessly. }
8... axb5 9. Nxb5 c6
{ The first step of Black's concept. We want to play ...c6, ...Nbd7, ...e5, and ...d5, which detonates the centre while White is not fully developed. A great feature of this concept is that it pretty much works against everything that White may try.   White has tried to untangle the Kingside in various ways, and the described standard idea works like a charm. Let's have a look at the ideas in action. }
10. Nbc3 Nbd7
{ The plan is ...Nbd7, ...e5 and ...d5, as usual in this line.   We'll now examine  11.Qd2  as the main move. The position after  11.Qd2  very often arises via the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Qd2  Nbd7  8.Nge2  b5!  9.cxb5  axb5  10.Nxb5  c6  11.Nbc3  which makes it the most important one to check. }
11. Qd2
{ White can also try to play without this move and move the e2-Knight to prepare a quick Be2 and O-O. We'll play in the usual fashion, going for ...e5 and ...d5 to open the game.   Here's a sample line:  11.Nc1  e5  12.Be2  d5  13.Nb3  exd4  14.Nxd4  Qb6  , when again we have good chances to use White's lack of coordination. We threaten ...c5 and ... Qxb2 in the final position of the sample line.   White can also try  11.Ng3  but our concept would be the same against this move. }
11... e5
{ We found 36 games in Mega Database 2021 that reached this position; White's score is terrible with nine wins and 21 losses! White has tried eight@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ different moves now, but we don't need to examine them all in detail.  We'll check White's most frequently played move  12.dxe5  which sees White struggling for equality, and the engine's recommendation  12.Rd1  which looks like a reasonable defence for White. }
12. dxe5
{ This move is played most of the time, but we can hardly talk about 'a popular move'.  In most cases, White was likely unprepared and needed to find a solution over the board.  12.dxe5  looks natural, but in analysis, you quickly see that White is struggling after the capture on e5. }
12... Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ Instead  13.Ng3  h5!  also gives Black nice play for the pawn. The threat h5-h4-h3 is powerful so that White probably needs to play  14.h4  when the White King never will find a safe spot anymore. }
13... d5 14. exd5
{ Here  14.f4  Neg4  15.e5  Nxe3  16.Qxe3  is great for Black after the simple  16...Ng4  , with ...Qb6 & ...f6 to come. White can't withstand this attack. }
14... Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Qxd5
{ Black has a fantastic attacking position for just one pawn. Stockfish already claims that Black is completely winning. This is not immediately obvious, but it is clear that White is in deep trouble. }

Why do we play  7...Nfd7  and not  7...Nbd7  with the same idea? The issue is  7...Nbd7  8.Nge2  c5  9.O-O!  when White refuses to advance the d-pawn.

The oldest game in Mega Database with  7...Nfd7!  was played between former World Champion Boris Spassky and Swiss IM Beat Z√ºger in 1984. Z√ºger employed the move multiple times in the 1980s, and several decades later, Stockfish 13 evaluates it as the best choice for Black. Let's have a closer look now. }
8. Nge2
{ White plays this natural move most of the time. In the mentioned game Spassky - Z√ºger the surprising  8.Be2  was played, when  8...c5  9.d5  b5  10.cxb5  axb5  11.Bxb5  Ba6  12.Bxa6  Nxa6  13.Nge2  Qa5  14.O-O  Nb6  lead to a typical Benko-style fight, with good chances for Black.   The pressure on White's Queenside is not easy to handle for White. Spassky still won the game after a tough fight. Stockfish suggests the aggressive-looking move  8.f4!?  when  8...c5  9.d5  b5  10.Nf3  Nb6  11.cxb5  axb5  12.Bxb5  Ba6  again gives Black good play in Benko style. }
8... c5
{ Now, White needs to decide if they want to advance the d-pawn or not. It's best to keep the tension, as we will see. }
9. d5
{ This is probably a dubious decision, as the arising Benko type position looks promising for Black. }
9... b5 10. cxb5 Ne5
{ A very annoying move for White to face. We see no clear way to equality for our opponent now. }
11. bxa6
{ Or  11.O-O  Nxd3  12.Qxd3  axb5  when White has no good way to take b5. Black is in great shape. }
11... Nxd3+ 12. Qxd3 Bxa6 13. Qd2 Nd7
{ Black is slightly better, with easy moves to play. The d7-Knight can often jump to c4 via b6 or e5, for example. We also have ...Qa5 and ... Rfb8 to increase the pressure. }

8. O-O-O
{ White castles Queenside, which makes our opponent's intention very clear. They want to attack the Kingside and play for checkmate! The typical attacking ideas are h4-h5, sometimes supported by g2-g4, or Bh6 to trade our Bishop.   The move  8.O-O-O  is very aggressive but also double-edged from White's perspective. Their attacking ideas are straightforward, but our counterplay on the Queenside arrives quickly, too.  We'll push our c- and b-pawn and often play  ...Qa5  to support the attack. This leads to wild games that are not every White player's cup of tea, which is probably why this line is less popular.  Before we check some details, one general piece of advice: If White plays the S√§misch in this ultra-aggressive style, we have to fight fire with fire. Every tempo counts, and material sacrifices are often mandatory.  Playing 'solidly' or 'defending.' leads to a disaster.

9. e5
{ White uses their doubled major pieces on the d-file to advance the e-pawn, a different strategy than the direct Kingside attack. }
9... Ne8
{ It is a bit more precise to play  9...Ne8  instead of capturing on e5 first. After  9...dxe5  10.dxe5  Ne8  11.f4  Qa5  White has some additional options compared to the version that we recommend. One is  12.Qe1  when  12...b5?  13.Nd5!  is a problem.   In our line  9...Ne8  10.f4  Qa5  11.Qe1  b5  12.Nd5?  does not work due to  12...Qxa2  . The d-file is closed, which changes all the tactics. }
10. f4 Qa5

{ White needs to find this move to pose any challenge. It's not an obvious choice, as  13...Qf5+  wins the e6-pawn, but  14.Bd3  Qxe6  15.c5  gives White a fantastic attack.   After a more human move like  13.exf6  Nexf6  Black is already better, with ideas like ...e5 or ...Ng4 on the cards. }
13... Nc5
{ As mentioned: don't take the pawn! Now the e6-pawn is attacked by both minor pieces, so White needs to find a concrete solution to avoid losing it for insufficient compensation.   They should play  14.Nd5  which leads to the forced line  14...Qxd2  15.Nxe7+  Kh8  16.Rxd2  Ne4  17.Rd8  N8d6  18.Rxf8+  Bxf8  19.Nxc8  Rxc8  20.Bd3  Re8  .

Before we discuss details, we'd like to point out that Black has some alternatives to  3...g6  , but we decided against recommending them. We saw some specific drawbacks about every line, while  3...g6  looked like it leads to the most interesting positions.   Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.   B.  3...c5  is often recommended when  4.d5  leads to a good Benoni-style play. But we didn't like  4.dxc5  in some lines that closely resemble a Sicilian Defence and looked tricky to play.   C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.  We think that  3...g6  is Black's best move if you look for a fight and want to play exciting Chess. The following lines will be full of dynamic ideas and tactics, so get ready for some fun complications! }
3... g6
{ We recommend playing  3...g6  and allow White to switch to the King's Indian S√§misch with  4.c4  .  This is not White's only option, though.

White may also play  6.Nge2  first, and only after Black's reply decide on the Bishop placement when  6.Nge2  a6  7.Be3  transposes to @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Bg5  a6  7.Nge2  .

As we have seen, the Bishop is more active on g5 in this regard, but there is a drawback. White neglects the control of d4 and c5, which does not apply to  6.Be3  . This fact is very relevant for our repertoire suggestion. If White plays Bg5, it is easy for Black to play ...c5 and, if necessary, apply more pressure on d4 with ...Nc6.   Let's check: the mainline of  6.Bg5  in our repertoire is  6.Bg5  a6  7.Qd2  c5  8.d5  b5!  which is very attractive for Black to play.

Here White never needs to play d4-d5, and Black has no way to pressure d4. Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }

Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next.   These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too. Let's have a look. }

7. Qd2
{ White plays this move most of the time. It may be the start of a very aggressive concept involving Queenside castling, but it may also just be a good move to wait for a commitment on Black's side.   For example, White could be waiting for ...Nbd7 and intends to reply with Nh3. Another idea for White is Bh6, which could be the start of an attack on the h-file with h4-h5 to follow. }
7... Nbd7
{ We recommend playing  7...Nbd7  , for more than one reason. Let's have a look:  A. It is a universally playable system without the danger of getting move-ordered. Even if you have played ...Nbd7 much earlier, you can still use it. This applies to the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3@@EndFEN@@  3.f3  g6  4.Be3  a6  5.Qd2  Nbd7  when you are committed to ...a6 and ...Nbd7 already.

It leads to exciting and sharp play and might not be a line that White has prepared in detail. We need to keep in mind that White started the game with 1.e4 and our opponent might not be an expert of the S√§misch.   C. It's considerably less theoretical workload than  7...Nc6  which is regarded as the mainline. This variation can be an exciting addition to your repertoire, but keep in mind that the S√§misch won't arise all that often via the @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  d6  move order.

The same Queenside counterplay will be our recipe against  8.O-O-O  which is White's main try if they are after aggressive play and an attack on our King. This line often leads to 'who comes first'-scenarios and tactical melees. }
8. O-O-O
{ White castles Queenside, which makes our opponent's intention very clear. They want to attack the Kingside and play for checkmate! The typical attacking ideas are h4-h5, sometimes supported by g2-g4, or Bh6 to trade our Bishop.   The move  8.O-O-O  is very aggressive but also double-edged from White's perspective. Their attacking ideas are straightforward, but our counterplay on the Queenside arrives quickly, too.  We'll push our c- and b-pawn and often play  ...Qa5  to support the attack. This leads to wild games that are not every White player's cup of tea, which is probably why this line is less popular.  Before we check some details, one general piece of advice: If White plays the S√§misch in this ultra-aggressive style, we have to fight fire with fire. Every tempo counts, and material sacrifices are often mandatory.  Playing 'solidly' or 'defending.' leads to a disaster. To modify a movie, quote: 'It's a gunfight, and you shouldn't show up with a knife.'. }

{ We prepare ...b5 and open up the route to a5 for the Queen. We also investigated  8...b5  but the reply  9.e5!  Ne8  10.c5!  proved to be too strong for White.   After  8...c6  , we'll analyze three moves. White can start the Kingside attack with  9.g4  or  9.h4  , or start a central action with  9.e5  .  White could also play  9.Bh6  , but after  9...b5  10.h4  , we'd transpose to @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/p1pp1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/2KR1BNR w - - 0 9@@EndFEN@@  9.h4 }
9. g4 b5
{ No rocket science: get the Queenside play going as fast as possible. } 10. h4

10... h5
{ We stop the h-pawn for the moment. It's worse to play  10...Qa5  when Black has no great reply to  11.Kb1  .

11. e5
{ This is the critical test. White can play differently, but a line like  11.Bh6  Qa5  12.Kb1  e5  looks fine for Black. Our Kingside is well-defended, and we have counterplay on the Queenside, giving us equal chances in a complicated fight. }
11... dxe5
{ It looks like this move is a new idea, at least it wasn't played in any of the games in Mega Database 2021. The point on the next move is more or less impossible to find over the board, so this is understandable. }
12. dxe5 Nxg4
{ Wow! Yes, this move is possible and works well! Black has no choice, as Knight retreats are answered with gxh5 and White breaks through. But what do we get for the piece? Let's examine after White takes it. }
13. fxg4 Qa5
{ Now Black has two attacking ideas that White needs to defend against. First, there is the move ...b4, which attacks the Knight. After a Knight move, our Queen might take on a2.   The second idea is to play ...Nxe5, taking a second pawn. If White takes on h5, we will get in the move ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 and possibly ...Rd8 with a tempo. We have given up a piece, but White's Kingside pieces are still on the back rank, and their King is less secure than ours.   So, what should White play now? To be honest, this is tough to say. Somewhat surprisingly for such a tactical position, there is a whole list of reasonable-looking moves. We'll have a look at some possible continuations now to illustrate matters.  A.  14.a3  Nxe5  15.gxh5  Bg4  16.hxg6  fxg6  17.Be2  Bf5  18.Nf3  Here  18...Nxf3  19.Bxf3  Rad8  already forces  20.Nd5  while @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  18...b4  is also possible and interesting.

We saw some specific drawbacks about every line, while  3...g6  looked like it leads to the most interesting positions.   Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.

C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.  We think that  3...g6  is Black's best move if you look for a fight and want to play exciting Chess. The following lines will be full of dynamic ideas and tactics, so get ready for some fun complications! }

Now, after  5...O-O  we arrive at a crossroads when White decides their placement of the c1-Bishop. The main continuation is  6.Be3  but developing the Bishop to g5 is possible too.  White may also play  6.Nge2  first, and only after Black's reply decide on the Bishop placement when  6.Nge2  a6  7.Be3  transposes to @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Bg5  a6  7.Nge2  .

Now, what's the difference between  6.Be3  and  6.Bg5?  There are two main points. First of all, the Bishop on g5 might pin Black's Knight after a later ...e7-e5 pawn move. This is best demonstrated with the line  6...e5??  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Nd5  and White wins. Well, we don't play with a quick ...e5 anyway, so no big deal.  As we have seen, the Bishop is more active on g5 in this regard, but there is a drawback. White neglects the control of d4 and c5, which does not apply to  6.Be3  . This fact is very relevant for our repertoire suggestion. If White plays Bg5, it is easy for Black to play ...c5 and, if necessary, apply more pressure on d4 with ...Nc6.   Let's check: the mainline of  6.Bg5  in our repertoire is  6.Bg5  a6  7.Qd2  c5  8.d5  b5!  which is very attractive for Black to play.

Here White never needs to play d4-d5, and Black has no way to pressure d4. Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next.

White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too. Let's have a look. }

C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.  We think that  3...g6  is Black's best move if you look for a fight and want to play exciting Chess. The following lines will be full of dynamic ideas and tactics, so get ready for some fun complications! }
3... g6
{ We recommend playing  3...g6  and allow White to switch to the King's Indian S√§misch with  4.c4  .  This is not White's only option, though. It is also possible to play  4.Nc3  when we directly transpose to @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  d6  2.d4  Nf6  3.Nc3  g6  4.f3  .   However, White's main alternative to  4.c4  is the flexible move  4.Be3  which we need to answer precisely. }
4. c4
{ White immediately reveals that transposing to a King's Indian S√§misch is welcome. }
4... Bg7 5. Nc3
{ White may also start with  5.Be3  when  5...O-O  and  5...a6  are fine for Black and of equal value.  5...O-O  looks a bit more natural, but the position after @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Be3  a6  we could reach via @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  a6  5.c4  Bg7  when we already have committed to ...a6 on move four. }
5... O-O

Now, after  5...O-O  we arrive at a crossroads when White decides their placement of the c1-Bishop. The main continuation is  6.Be3  but developing the Bishop to g5 is possible too.  White may also play  6.Nge2  first, and only after Black's reply decide on the Bishop placement when  6.Nge2  a6  7.Be3  transposes to @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Bg5  a6  7.Nge2  .

Now, what's the difference between  6.Be3  and  6.Bg5?  There are two main points. First of all, the Bishop on g5 might pin Black's Knight after a later ...e7-e5 pawn move. This is best demonstrated with the line  6...e5??  7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Nd5  and White wins. Well, we don't play with a quick ...e5 anyway, so no big deal.  As we have seen, the Bishop is more active on g5 in this regard, but there is a drawback. White neglects the control of d4 and c5, which does not apply to  6.Be3  . This fact is very relevant for our repertoire suggestion. If White plays Bg5, it is easy for Black to play ...c5 and, if necessary, apply more pressure on d4 with ...Nc6.

Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next.   These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too. Let's have a look. }

It is important to note that White can use the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  when  4...a6  is our recommended answer.

7. Qd2
{ White plays this move most of the time. It may be the start of a very aggressive concept involving Queenside castling, but it may also just be a good move to wait for a commitment on Black's side.   For example, White could be waiting for ...Nbd7 and intends to reply with Nh3. Another idea for White is Bh6, which could be the start of an attack on the h-file with h4-h5 to follow. }

White's d-pawn is not dangerous, and White has many weaknesses to attend to, like e3, b3, and d3. White needs to be careful in this situation, as their position looks harmonious and a clear plan.  We can try to get the pawn back and need to be alert if White offers some tactical possibility, based on the mentioned weaknesses. }

Here White never needs to play d4-d5, and Black has no way to pressure d4. Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next.   These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too. Let's have a look. }
6... a6
{ Our signature move in the 3.f3-line. We prepare counterplay on the Queenside with ...b5, in many cases supported by ...c6.   It is important to note that White can use the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  when  4...a6  is our recommended answer.

Both moves will often lead to the same positions, as  7.Qd2  Nbd7  8.Nge2  and @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Nge2  Nbd7  8.Qd2  are very natural sequences.   Against this line, we suggest playing with ...Nbd7 and play for a later ...b5. We'll also examine  7.Bd3  which requires a special antidote. }
7. Qd2
{ White plays this move most of the time. It may be the start of a very aggressive concept involving Queenside castling, but it may also just be a good move to wait for a commitment on Black's side.   For example, White could be waiting for ...Nbd7 and intends to reply with Nh3. Another idea for White is Bh6, which could be the start of an attack on the h-file with h4-h5 to follow. }
7... Nbd7
{ We recommend playing  7...Nbd7  , for more than one reason. Let's have a look:  A. It is a universally playable system without the danger of getting move-ordered. Even if you have played ...Nbd7 much earlier, you can still use it. This applies to the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3@@EndFEN@@  3.f3  g6  4.Be3  a6  5.Qd2  Nbd7  when you are committed to ...a6 and ...Nbd7 already.

It leads to exciting and sharp play and might not be a line that White has prepared in detail. We need to keep in mind that White started the game with 1.e4 and our opponent might not be an expert of the S√§misch.   C. It's considerably less theoretical workload than  7...Nc6  which is regarded as the mainline. This variation can be an exciting addition to your repertoire, but keep in mind that the S√§misch won't arise all that often via the @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  d6  move order.

9. a4 { No ...b5 for us, but that's not the end of the World. } 9... e5
{ We attack White's centre with the e-pawn, trying to open the centre while White's Kingside development is still not completed. }
10. d5
{ White closes the position and grabs space in the centre. Responding correctly to this move is crucial. Otherwise, our position would be too passive. }
10... cxd5
{ Before we start further action on the flanks, we clarify the position in the centre first. }
11. cxd5 Nh5
{ We HAVE to prepare ...f5 with this active move, which also enables ...Nf4 in key lines. If we'd play passively, White might crush us with all the space that they gained already. }
12. Nge2
{ We'd love to see  12.g4?  Nf4  happens, but this is a somewhat naive play by White. }
12... f5
{ F is for Forward! This position has been reached 20 times in Mega Database 2021. It's not clear what White's best try is. All continuations lead to sharp play.   We'll take a closer look at the moves  13.exf5  and  13.a5  , as played in seven of the games. }
13. exf5
{ The capture is a standard reaction to ...f5 in the S√§misch. White usually wants to avoid  13.O-O  f4!  14.Bf2  g5  when Black's attack is advancing quickly. White needs to be very careful not to get killed in short order. For example take a look at this sequence:  15.a5  Ndf6  16.h3  g4!  17.fxg4  Nxg4  18.hxg4  Bxg4  giving Black a raging attack with ...Qg5 next.   The position after  13.O-O  f4!  14.Bf2  g5  is much easier to play for Black in practice. Stockfish often finds a defence in analysis for White, which is very hard to do in the practical game. The engine evaluation of 0.00 after  14...g5  is alarming for White, as these structures usually get evaluated very favourably for White by the engines.  Alright, back to the capture on f5. White's idea is to insert the capture on f5, and only then castle. }
13... Nf4 { A novelty that improves considerably on  13...gxf5 } 14. Nxf4
{ This looks critical but works out nicely for Black. If White continues with  14.O-O  we happily bag the Bishop pair with  14...Nxd3 }
14... exf4 15. Bxf4
{ After  15.Bf2  g5!  , followed by ...Ne5, we get the pawn back and have a very active position. }
15... Nc5
{ A strong move, exploiting the weakness on b3. Now White's position is very loose and needs to be defended carefully to avoid severe problems.   Here are two sample lines to illustrate that White needs to dodge bullets. A.  16.Bc4  Re8+  17.Ne2  Bxf5  18.O-O  b5!  19.axb5  Qb6  leads to a strong attack for Black.   B.  16.Bc2  Bxf5  17.Be3  Qh4+  , when  18.Kd1  is forced as  18.g3  Qc4  is even worse for White. }

Therefore, the best that Black can achieve is a structure with ...cxd4 in the Maroczy Bind or Hedgehog style, which we want to avoid. Black does not equalize and has problems generating any active play.  Therefore, we suggest a different approach against Be3-setups: we play for the move ...b5, usually prepared with ...c6. In one crucial line, we even get to play ...b5 as an attractive pawn sacrifice, but more on that later.  So, as a general guideline: Against Bg5 playing ...a6 and ...c5, going for a pawn sacrifice in the Benko Gambit style works well. Against Be3 setups, we usually can't force a similar scenario and use a plan based on ...b5, often prepared by ...c6. }
6. Be3
{ Developing the Bishop to e3 is White's main move. White covers the d4-pawn and might prepare a quick Queenside castling with Qd2 and O-O-O next.   These lines are very sharp and exciting to play for both sides, but currently not very fashionable. White often prefers a more solid approach with Nge2, but against these lines, we have some good ideas, too. Let's have a look. }
6... a6
{ Our signature move in the 3.f3-line. We prepare counterplay on the Queenside with ...b5, in many cases supported by ...c6.   It is important to note that White can use the move order @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4@@EndFEN@@  4.Be3  when  4...a6  is our recommended answer.

7. Qd2
{ White plays this move most of the time. It may be the start of a very aggressive concept involving Queenside castling, but it may also just be a good move to wait for a commitment on Black's side.   For example, White could be waiting for ...Nbd7 and intends to reply with Nh3. Another idea for White is Bh6, which could be the start of an attack on the h-file with h4-h5 to follow. }
7... Nbd7
{ We recommend playing  7...Nbd7  , for more than one reason. Let's have a look:  A. It is a universally playable system without the danger of getting move-ordered. Even if you have played ...Nbd7 much earlier, you can still use it.

The same Queenside counterplay will be our recipe against  8.O-O-O  which is White's main try if they are after aggressive play and an attack on our King. This line often leads to 'who comes first'-scenarios and tactical melees. }
8. Bd3
{ White has Nge2 in mind, but does not want to block the f1-Bishop and play it to d3 first.   The setup with Bd3 and Nge2 makes a very harmonious impression but does not change our counterplay concept much. We'll play for the Queenside expansion with ...c6 and ...b5. }
8... c6
{ We don't like  8...c5  here, because White can continue to keep the tension in the centre with  9.Nge2  and never will advance the d-pawn.  9.d5?  b5!  would be great for Black, but we don't have enough pressure on the d4-pawn to force this advance.

Now White needs to decide if they want to allow ...b5 or not. }
9. a4 { No ...b5 for us, but that's not the end of the World. } 9... e5
{ We attack White's centre with the e-pawn, trying to open the centre while White's Kingside development is still not completed. }
10. d5
{ White closes the position and grabs space in the centre. Responding correctly to this move is crucial. Otherwise, our position would be too passive. }
10... cxd5
{ Before we start further action on the flanks, we clarify the position in the centre first. }
11. cxd5 Nh5
{ We HAVE to prepare ...f5 with this active move, which also enables ...Nf4 in key lines. If we'd play passively, White might crush us with all the space that they gained already. }
12. Nge2
{ We'd love to see  12.g4?  Nf4  happens, but this is a somewhat naive play by White. }
12... f5
{ F is for Forward! This position has been reached 20 times in Mega Database 2021. It's not clear what White's best try is. All continuations lead to sharp play.   We'll take a closer look at the moves  13.exf5  and  13.a5  , as played in seven of the games. }
13. a5 { A strategically sound move, fixing Black's Queenside pawns. } 13...

14... exf4 15. Bxf4 Nc5
{ We hit the weak spot on b3 and attack the centre at the same time. Now White's best is to play  16.Bc2  fxe4  17.Nxe4  and allow  17...Bxb2  , which regains the pawn.  The resulting position gives about equal chances, but if you indeed manage to get it on the board, you probably have a large time advantage by now üòÄ. }

Before we discuss details, we'd like to point out that Black has some alternatives to  3...g6  , but we decided against recommending them. We saw some specific drawbacks about every line, while  3...g6  looked like it leads to the most interesting positions.   Here's a quick overview about the alternatives and why we discarded them for our repertoire:  A.  3...e5  is a solid move, but  4.dxe5  dxe5  5.Qxd8+  is not only somewhat stale but also annoying for Black to play.   B.  3...c5  is often recommended when  4.d5  leads to a good Benoni-style play. But we didn't like  4.dxc5  in some lines that closely resemble a Sicilian Defence and looked tricky to play.   C.  3...d5  is answered with  4.e5  and leads to French-type positions that are far away from structures that we feature in our repertoire.   Let's talk about our move  3...g6  . As a general rule, not only when Chess is concerned, it is usually better to actively decide in favour of something, instead of just choosing an option because you feel it is the lesser evil.  We think that  3...g6  is Black's best move if you look for a fight and want to play exciting Chess. The following lines will be full of dynamic ideas and tactics, so get ready for some fun complications! }
3... g6
{ We recommend playing  3...g6  and allow White to switch to the King's Indian S√§misch with  4.c4  .  This is not White's only option, though.

It's best to trade on d4 first, so that after  7...cxd4  8.cxd4  Nc6  9.d5  the long diagonal is wide open for our Bishop.  In many comparable cases, the trade on d4 is imprecise because it frees the c3-square for White's Queen's Knight.

8. cxd4 Nc6
{ We suggest increasing the pressure on the d4-pawn.

We decided to stop the trainable line here, as Black has equal chances and some ideas to choose from. You can aim for ...e5 or ...d5. If White plays d4-d5, moving the Knight back to b8 is fine, but ...Nb4 is also possible. Our Bishop enjoys a great view after d4-d5, so we don't mind moving the Knight again. }

Let's have a look at White's options on move three now. }
3. Nd2
{ White covers the e-pawn with the Knight but still keeps the option open to play c3. The move c3 supports White's centre and builds the pawn chain b2-c3-d4. This is a strategically sound setup, directed against Black's planned Bishop position on g7.   These are nice points, but the move  3.Nd2  has drawbacks. It blocks both the c1-Bishop and limits the scope of the Queen. This is a key difference to the related line  3.Bd3  .  By playing  3.Bd3  White preserves the c3-option but does not obstruct the Queenside development. At first, this might sound like a minor point, but it is very significant. We recommend playing  3.Nd2  g6  , aiming for a later ...c5 attack on White's d4-pawn. This strategy works well, while after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3@@EndFEN@@  3.Bd3  , this approach is not sufficient.  Therefore we suggest a different way to tackle  3.Bd3  by not playing  3.Bd3  g6  , but  3...e5  . We discuss this in more detail in the coverage of  3.Bd3  . }
3... g6
{ We stick to our standard Pirc setup and fianchetto our dark-squared Bishop. Our next moves will almost invariably be ...Bg7, ...O-O and finally ...c5 to attack White's centre. }
4. Ngf3
{ The most natural continuation and the main move by far, White usually follows it up with Bd3 and c3, and they might as well start with these moves before playing  4.Ngf3  .  Moves like  4.c3  or  4.Bd3  are possible, but we'll complete our Kingside castling first, anyway. White's move order is not relevant here. }
4... Bg7
{ We continue to develop our Kingside pieces and want to castle next. This position has been tested quite extensively in recent years, but most of the time not via our Pirc move order.  There is the line @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.Nf3  g6  3.Nbd2  when  3...Bg7  4.e4  d6  leads to the current position. White sometimes selects this line to avoid a theoretical discussion in the Gr√ºnfeld or the King's Indian, which can be a good practical choice. White does not play to gain a large opening advantage but can play a solid game without a theoretical workload.   Now White's main choice is between various ways to develop the Bishop. Most often you'll meet  5.Bd3  and sometimes the related move  5.Bb5+  . The point of this check is to provoke the move  5...c6  and then retreat to  6.Bd3  . One possible setup for Black includes ...Nc6, and this formation is prevented now. This is no problem for us, as we never intended to play this line anyway.   Therefore  5.Bb5+  c6  6.Bd3  O-O  7.O-O  c5  will be just a transposition to @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5.Bd3  O-O  6.O-O  c5  with one move added.   Another move with little independent value is  5.c3  as after  5...O-O  White will decide on a Bishop placement. This will transpose to lines that we cover via the Bishop moves on move five. }
5. Bd3
{ White's most popular setup. The Bishop covers e4, which makes it easier to move the d2-Knight later. We continue with our standard recipe in the Nd2-line: complete castling and play ...c5 next. }
5... O-O 6. O-O c5
{ We attack White's centre with the c-pawn, asking White about the future of the d-pawn. The three options, advancing with d4-d5, covering it with c2-c3, or taking on c5, lead to entirely different position types. A common feature: Black has no problems and gets good play in all of them. }
7. c3
{ White supports the centre and wants to keep the ideal centre pawn duo e4 & d4. It is by far the most popular move. }
7... cxd4
{ Capturing on d4 makes sense on general grounds but also prepares the next move. }
8. cxd4 e5
{ Again, we attack the d4-pawn. At first, you might think that White can win a pawn on e5, but this fails due to the unstable Bishop on e5. We'll examine this line in more detail in a moment.   After  8...e5  White may also advance the d-pawn, which looks more challenging and leads to a sharp game. }
9. d5
{ The pawn advance is more ambitious than the trade on e5. Now we reach a pawn structure typical of the King's Indian Defence.   White's main issue is the misplaced Knight on d2, which clogs up the development of the Queenside. }
9... a5
{ A vital move to play. We secure the square c5 for our Knight. The Knight is optimally placed on c5, as it attacks the e4-pawn and is not obstructing the other pieces. Our light-squared Bishop will be well-placed on d7. }
10. Nb1
{ A resourceful player might find this move, correcting the Knight position. Even after the White's inventive retreat, Black has a good game.  The setup with ...Na6-c5 and often ...Bd7 would also work well against weaker moves than  10.Nb1! }
10... Na6 11. Nc3 Nc5 12. Be3
{ This move was played in A. Predke - A. Demchenko, Sochi 2020. Both players are Top 100 level, so it's a high-level encounter. }
12... Nxd3
{ We need to improve on Demchenkos  12...Bg4?  , which allowed  13.Bxc5!  destroying Black's structure and giving White a strong passed pawn.   Instead, our move  12...Nxd3  or  12...b6  are better. }
13. Qxd3 Ng4
{ And we are ready to play ...f5 next, with equal chances in an unbalanced position. }

We suggest avoiding ...g6, and rather opt for ...Be7, intending a later Be7-g5 manoeuvre.   It is not helpful to learn move sequences by heart in such a closed position but rather think about piece setups and ideas. The only important concrete move order point is to start with  4...Nbd7  , intending a quick ...Nc5.  Let's have a look at a typical continuation and discuss some plans in the process. }
4... Nbd7
{ We suggest starting with  4...Nbd7  . The move's idea is simple: we want to play ...Nc5 next and take the Bishop on d3. This has two benefits:  1. We have less space, so trading minor pieces is useful  2. Some moves later we'd like to play ...f5 to attack the e4-pawn. This is easier to do once the d3-Bishop is removed. }
5. c4
{ White supports his d5 pawn and gains more space on the Queenside. The advanced pawn on d5 suggests that White's play is mainly on the Queenside, with a plan like b2-b4 and c4-c5 being a long-term idea. }
5... Nc5
{ We go for the Bishop-pair right away. This move should be played immediately. If you delay the move, White might play Nc3 next and gain the option to retreat the Bishop to c2. }
6. Nc3
{ There is no way for White to keep the Bishop. The e4-pawn needs protection. }
6... Nxd3+ { Mission accomplished! } 7. Qxd3 Be7
{ We prefer this move to the fianchetto. There is no bright future for the Bishop on g7 after the centre is already closed.   An additional point is the idea to play a later ... Be7-g5, trading the currently passive Bishop. The play we suggest is ...O-O, .. .Nd7, and ...Bg5 next. Moving the Knight also prepares ...f5 to attack White's e4-pawn. }
8. Nge2
{ Somewhat surprisingly at first, White almost always elects to develop the Knight to e2. }
8... O-O 9. O-O Nd7
{ A good, versatile move. It prepares the exchange of the dark-squared Bishops with ...Bg5, but also has ...Nc5, followed by ...f5, in mind. }
10. Be3 a5
{ This looks more precise than the immediate  10...Bg5  when  11.b4  gains a lot of space on the Queenside. With @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NQB3/PP2NPPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 10@@EndFEN@@  10...a5  we stop this idea. }
11. Qd2
{ Alright, so we don't get ...Bg5 in right away. But this is no big deal, as we have other ideas. }
11... b6 { We'd like to play ...Nc5 and be able to answer Bxc5 with ...bxc5. }
12. Ng3 Nc5
{ We'll stop the trainable line here and discuss some more ideas. One thing to keep in mind is the move ...h6 next, still insisting on ...Bg5. White could go for f2-f4 in this position, but it will give our Bishop on e7 more scope after the capture on f4.   Stockfish suggest an additional idea. What about ...Bh4!? intending to take on g3 and play ...f5!? Not a bad idea at all! You see that there some interesting possibilities in these complex positions. }

White could play the aggressive @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5@@EndFEN@@  5.f4  but this is met with a surprise again: we have  5.f4  c5!  immediately provoking a crisis in the centre of the board.   We think  4...Nbd7  fits well to the fighting spirit of the Pirc and will be an excellent practical weapon. The play can get quite sharp and tactical quickly, so it's advantageous to study the lines in detail.  4...Nbd7  is not a move played on general grounds but based on some concrete lines that should be learned. This way, you'll have a substantial head start on your opponent. }
5. Ne2
{ White prepares castling but still keeps the option to play f2-f4 quickly. }
5... g6
{ The Bishop will be well-placed on g7 to put pressure on White's centre. We fianchetto all the time in the Pirc, so this is an easy choice. }
6. O-O Bg7 7. f4
{ White's almost exclusive choice at this point. They could play more cautiously, but this is not critical at all for Black.  Note that White's minor pieces are passive so that we can even play a quick d6-d5 in some cases. For example after  7.Nd2  O-O  8.h3  the move  8...d5  is possible to show that White's pieces are ineffective. }
7... O-O
{ We need to castle first and then decide how to continue. The main deficit in White's game is the misplaced Knight on e2. White has no pressure on e5, which gives us good options to fight White's centre.   We'll check  8.fxe5  and  8.Nd2  now, which are White's most popular moves. }

{ We have more than one good option here.  10...exd4  11.cxd4  g5  and ...c5 next is also possible here, but much messier. Our choice is a bit simpler and good for Black too. }
11. d5 c4 { That's the point! We unpin with a check on b6 now. } 12. Bc2 Qb6+
13. Kh1 Ng4
{ Even better than taking on b2. Not only is ...Ne3 a direct threat, but ... Nc5 and ...f5 will be awkward to face for White. Black already has the better chances. }

We improve our pieces and centralize.   The important point to realize is that we are not in a hurry despite the pawn deficit. We have lots of play on the light squares, and White has a hard time organizing.  It's good to show some more moves to illustrate. The sequence  12.O-O  O-O  13.Na3  Re8  14.Rd1  Bf5  15.b3  Nd3  shows a point of our play. If you feel unconfident about Black's compensation, we suggest trying to play with White against an engine.  Sure, we all know that the comps crush us from about any position - you will lose with White, but you'll also learn a lot about Black's chances. }

One notable exception is the Grand Prix setup of f4/Nc3/Bc4 which we recommend to fight differently. Let's have a look at the 'Odds and Ends' of the Pirc now. }
2. Nf3
{ This is played quite frequently but will often transposes to the main lines if White plays d4 shortly. Independent lines are very harmless, as White has already forfeited the option to play the more aggressive early f4-push. }
2... Nf6
{ We stick to our plan to develop our Kingside pieces and attack White's e4-pawn at the same time. }
3. d3
{ White blocks the f1-Bishop, intending a setup called the 'King's Indian Attack'. This formation consists of the moves e4, Nf3, d3, g3, Bg2, Nbd2, and O-O.   The term 'Attack' connected with this setup is funny because White rarely gets to attack if we play well. We suggest our reply of the Kingside fianchetto and playing ...c5. }
3... g6 4. g3 Bg7
{ The next few moves are very logical. Both players finish the plan to fianchetto the Bishop and castle Kingside. }
5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O c5
{ We complete our standard setup: develop the Kingside first, then play ...c5. Now White frequently plays a combination of the moves Re1, Nbd2 and c2-c3, geared towards playing d3-d4.   A good way to play for Black is ...Nc6 and quick ...e5 which focuses on controlling d4 and stopping a central pawn advance of our opponent. }
7. Nbd2
{ White may also start with  7.Re1  or  7.c3  .  Lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c5  7.Re1  Nc6  8.c3  e5  or @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c5  7.c3  Nc6  8.Nbd2  e5  are very similar or transpose to our chosen main sequence, starting with @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c5  7.Nbd2  . }
7... Nc6
{ We develop our Queenside Knight to its most natural square and increase our control over the dark central squares. }
8. Re1 e5
{ The pawn formation ...c5 and ...e5 is often called the 'Botvinnik' setup, named after the fifth World Champion. We secure our share of the centre and have a very solid position.   Based on the solid centre, we can start some action on the flanks @@StartBracket@@...b5 or after due prep ...f5@@EndBracket@@ or play for a later ...d6-d5 push in the centre.   White is far away from the 'attack', as the opening name suggested. }
9. a4
{ White wants to stop us from playing ...b5. A line like  9.Nc4  b5!  10.Ne3  Be6  already looks better for Black. }
9... h6
{ A good prophylactic move. We plan to develop our Bc8 to e6 but like to avoid the reply Ng5. }
10. Nc4 Be6
{ We like Black's position. Having a space advantage on move ten with Black is a great opening result. }

This is not bad for us, of course, but  4...d5  is stronger.  We'll discuss the reasoning after White's forced reply. }
5. exd5 Nxd5
{ Black has a comfortable game.   The pawn move to f4 is just a weakening in White's position because the e-pawn is missing. Without it, f4-f5 is very difficult to engineer, which is the main point of White's setup.   We'll develop with ...Bg7 and ...O-O next and hope to exploit the long term weaknesses in White's camp later. }

The Closed Sicilian is considered to be a quite harmless attempt by White, so we don't mind transposing into this line. }
3... g6
{ We suggest sticking to our standard approach of completing the Kingside fianchetto and playing ...c5 next. }
4. Bg2
{ White still could play  4.d4  to transpose into a regular Pirc line, the Fianchetto Variation which we have examinedhere. }
4... Bg7 5. d3 O-O 6. f4
{ White's most active way of playing this closed position is to involve the f-pawn. They could play more passively, for example, with  6.Nge2  or  6.Nf3  . Against these formations, you could play in the same way as against  6.f4  . Play ...c5, ...Nc6 and start a Queenside offensive with ...b5, ...a5 and so on.  You'll see some more ideas in our main continuation  6.f4  as Black's plans are the same. }
6... c5 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. O-O Rb8
{ Black's play is focused on the Queenside. Our g7-Bishop points to this side of the board, and we'd like to gain more space by pushing the b-pawn.   While we do our thing on the Queenside, White will expand on the Kingside. }
9. h3
{ Preparing g4. White may also play  9.a4  when  9...a6  renews our ...b5 plan. }
9... b5 10. g4 b4 11. Ne2 a5
{ We have accomplished the typical Queenside pawn expansion in this line. A good way to continue is playing ...Ba6 to aim for c5-c4. If White plays b3 to stop this advance, we have a5-a4 to open the a-file.   Here's a sample sequence to illustrate this idea:  12.Be3  a4  13.Rb1  Ba6  . White's play on the Kingside is progressing slowly, which is why Black is scoring a plus score in these structures. }

White often obtains a dangerous attack with simple means, most notably Qe1-h4 and f4-f5. White makes good use of the Bishop on c4, which is pointing towards our King.  We analyzed these lines and felt that Black needs to be very precise to withstand White's attacks. So while  6...c5  is not a mistake in a purely theoretical sense @@StartBracket@@Black should equalize@@EndBracket@@, we felt that White's practical job is a lot easier.  Searching for other ideas, we found  6...Nc6  to be a good option. What's the point of  6...Nc6?  . The idea is fairly straightforward. White needs to decide whether they want to allow ...Na5, when the c4-Bishop has no way to retreat and avoid being captures.

White can prevent this scenario with  7.a3  but this is rather slow and gives us a good choice between  7.a3  Bg4  or  7...e5  .  These lines don't require much study time and promise an easier life than the transposition into a Sicilian line that is tricky to handle. }
7. a3 { White creates a retreat square for the Bishop but loses more time. }
7... Bg4
{ We suggest this move, but  7...e5  is a worthy alternative. Black equalizes after  8.O-O  exf4  9.Bxf4  Be6  for example.  Our choice is a bit more combative and will lead to a different pawn structure. }

Against  2.Nc3  we suggest to continue with ...Nf6, ...g6, ...Bg7 and  ....O-O  . According to White's setup, we'll choose the central pawn configuration. }
2... Nf6 3. f4 g6
{ We continue with the fianchetto setup, as usual. Our adjustment against the Grand Prix setup only comes after we have castled.  After  3....g6  White usually continues with  4.Nf3  or  4.Bc4  if they have the Grand Prix in mind. The theoretically most challenging move is  4.d4  of course - we'd immediately transpose to the Austrian Attack. }
4. Nf3 Bg7
{ Now  5.Bc4  leads to the Grand Prix setup. White could still play  5.d4  for the Austrian Attack or play moves like  5.g3  or  5.d3  to stay within the current chapter's offbeat tracks. }
5. Bc4 O-O
{ The typical move. Whenever your opponent plays Bc4, you need to examine a possible ...Nxe4 idea, followed by the fork ...d6-d5. We analyze multiple versions of this fork trick in the chapter on the Italian Pirc. We usually only want to take on e4 if the reply Bxf7+ can be answered with ... Rxf7.   In the line here,  5...Nxe4  is less convincing due to  6.Bxf7+  , when we lose castling rights.

6. d3
{ By far the most popular and best move. White reliably covers e4 and avoids ...Nxe4 ideas.

6... Nc6
{ We suggest playing this move, instead of our usual approach to continue with  6...c5  . The move  6...c5  is not a mistake in this position, but we dislike it for practical reasons. After  6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  we have transposed to a line that usually arises from the Sicilian.  The Sicilian move order is @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.Nc3  Nc6  3.f4  g6  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Bc4  when more or less all the experts play  5...e6  and ...Nge7 to blunt White's Bishop. This has a good reputation for Black and is the reason why the Bc4-Grand Prix is a rare guest at the professional level.   However, looking at our position after a possible  6...c5  7.O-O  Nc6  we would have played ...d6 and ...Nf6, which is a lot less desirable than a ...e6 and ...Nge7 plan. White often obtains a dangerous attack with simple means, most notably Qe1-h4 and f4-f5. White makes good use of the Bishop on c4, which is pointing towards our King.  We analyzed these lines and felt that Black needs to be very precise to withstand White's attacks. So while  6...c5  is not a mistake in a purely theoretical sense @@StartBracket@@Black should equalize@@EndBracket@@, we felt that White's practical job is a lot easier.  Searching for other ideas, we found  6...Nc6  to be a good option. What's the point of  6...Nc6?  . The idea is fairly straightforward. White needs to decide whether they want to allow ...Na5, when the c4-Bishop has no way to retreat and avoid being captures.

White can prevent this scenario with  7.a3  but this is rather slow and gives us a good choice between  7.a3  Bg4  or  7...e5  .  These lines don't require much study time and promise an easier life than the transposition into a Sicilian line that is tricky to handle. }

8. Bb3

{ We don't need to take on b3 immediately. White has no good way to prevent the capture anyway. With  8...e6  we gain some control on the light squares and make f4-f5 difficult to play for White. Our c8-Bishop will find a good spot on b7 later. }
9. Qe1
{ White starts the typical Queen journey to h4, aiming for a Kingside attack. }
9... a6
{ A difficult move, but it makes perfect sense given White's idea Qh4. Now we can answer  10.Qh4  with  10...Nd7  when  11.Qxd8  Rxd8  does not run into Nb5. }

1. e4 d6
{ This is the starting move of the Pirc Defence. We open the c8-h3 diagonal for our light-squared Bishop, but this is not the primary purpose of that move. By playing  1...d6  , we stop White from pushing e4-e5 for the time being. We plan to develop our Kingside by fianchettoing the dark-squared Bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7. The Knight usually jumps to f6 and we are ready to castle Kingside quickly.  Our move  1...d6  does not stop White from playing  2.d4  and usually White accepts this invitation to build the perfect central pawn duo. It is by far the mainline, and it makes a lot of sense, of course.  However, White might avoid all the main lines that arise after  2.d4  and choose one of many second move alternatives. We will take a look at those alternatives in this chapter.  None of White's alternatives are theoretically challenging, but our opponents might play a pet setup that they also employ against other openings, particularly the Sicilian.

Most of White's offbeat lines against the Pirc follow a similar approach. White plays a combination of Bc4 and f4 - Grand Prix style - or plays with g3 like in the Closed Variation of the Sicilian. In almost all cases, we will suggest completing the kingside development and playing ...c5 quickly to transpose into a harmless variation of the Sicilian.  One notable exception is the Grand Prix setup of f4/Nc3/Bc4 which we recommend to fight differently. Let's have a look at the 'Odds and Ends' of the Pirc now. }
