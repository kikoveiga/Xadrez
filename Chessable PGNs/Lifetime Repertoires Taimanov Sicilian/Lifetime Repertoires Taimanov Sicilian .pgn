{ In this lifetime repertoire against 1. e4, I present you The Taimanov Sicilian, named after World Championship candidate and world-class concert pianist Mark Evgenevich Taimanov.   It is my first Lifetime Repertoire on Chessable, and it took me six months to complete it! It gives me immense satisfaction to present this course as I have covered all major alternatives of White starting from move 2. One of the primary differences between my Taimanov course and many others is that I covered the Scheveningen-system arising after 6. Be2. Thanks to this extensiveness, the number of trainable variations is quite high, and I believe the course will serve you as a comprehensive guide to different structures and themes arising in this rich opening. I tried my best to keep true to the spirit of my first French Toast course, being as honest and objective as possible in both the text section and the more descriptive video part.    I have used the latest engines, correspondence game databases, and books as reference. You might find that sometimes I did not choose the top variation of the engine to keep the course as human as possible. However, at times I had no choice but to follow the top lines, going into great depth and forcing lines. There isn't a single line I would fear using, even against the strongest opponents, and I have already played many of the variations in this course at various super events.  Studying the course might feel overwhelming at first, given the mass of variations presented. My suggestion would be to start lightly, familiarize yourself with the layout of the course in the Quickstarter section, and then slowly work your way through the detailed main repertoire.   I will also briefly discuss the main ideas and important points in the video at the end of each chapter.  There is no shame in taking your time to learn everything - they did not build Rome in a day, and even after spending years of studying the Taimanov there are many nuances even I fail to grasp firmly. }
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7
{ While we will deal with several sidelines as early as move 2, this is the root position of modern Taimanov lines. Interestingly, Mark Evgenevich himself preferred the Paulsen/Kan set-ups more @@StartBracket@@characterized by playing ...a6 on move 4 or 5 instead@@EndBracket@@ in his practical games. He started publishing his works on the Taimanov Sicilian quite late into his career, only after he turned 50. Nevertheless, his brainchild withstood the test of time much better, and modern theory regards his flexible ...Qc7 set-up much higher than the committal Paulsen/Kan variations.   I hope my Lifetime Repertoire will bring you many sweet victories, familiarize you with a host of fresh strategical and tactical ideas, and that you simply will enjoy the studying experience. While I tried my best to be as objective in evaluations and as thorough in explanations as possible, there is always room for improvement. Do not feel shy to write a review or ask questions if you have doubts about any position. And now, let us start exploring the ultimate answer to 1. e4! }

For example,   8...Be7  9.Re1  , the most popular position in the g3-Taimanov, is something I'd like to avoid.

It is still not a good time for  10...Nf6  this time due to  11.Bf3 !  e.g.  11...Qc7  12.e5  Bxf3  13.exf6  ± with a big edge for White. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be3
{ This is the entry gate to the infamous English attack, one of the most popular set-ups against all kinds of Sicilians, characteristic by White playing Be3 & Qd2, aiming to push his pawns on the Kingside with f3 & g4 later. We will examine its various subsystems and tricky move orders before finally delving into the main Be3 & Qd2 set-up. }
6... a6 7. a3
{ This modest move is actually quite venomous. It is almost always useful for White to get the b4-square under control and this way he can keep a lot of flexibility too. }
7... b5
{ We are playing in the same spirit as in the 6. f4 variation. As a matter of fact we might easily transpose there if White includes f2-f4 at some point. }
8. Nxc6 Qxc6
{ While one might investigate  8...dxc6  too, White seems to retain some pressure after the typical  9.Qg4 !  Nf6  10.Qg3  Qxg3  11.hxg3  += with a better endgame. Unless we are able to generate immediate counterplay in the centre or the Queenside, I'd rather avoid going for such endings. }
9. Be2
{ The most interesting option, aiming to harass Black's Queen from f3 at a suitable moment while developing White's Kingside. }
9... Bb7
{ We will investigate various plans involving White castling short. We need to time the ...b4 or ...d5 breaks here well, therefore you should pay attention to finesses behind different move orders and precise opening knowledge.  It would be nice if we had the tactical  9...Bxa3 ?  hit at our disposal but, unfortunately, it does not quite work. Besides other things,  10.Rxa3  b4  11.Qd4 !  +- is just crushing.   In general it is worth noting that ...Bc5 should be well-prepared. For example,  9...Bc5 ?  is met with the strong  10.Bd4 !  e.g.  10...f6  11.Bxb5 !  axb5  12.Qh5+  g6  13.Qxc5  +- winning a pawn as in Bronstein - Taimanov, Baku 1961. }
10. O-O Rc8
{ 10...Nf6 ?  runs into e5 after the preparatory  11.Bf3 !  e.g.  11...Qc7  12.e5  ± }
11. Qd2 Nf6
{ With the inclusion of O-O  11...b4 ?  is a gross mistake due to  12.axb4  Bxb4  13.Qd4 !  ±  ...Qxe4 is not possible anymore. }
12. Rfd1 b4
{ It is important you get it right, otherwise you might find yourself in a rather unperspective position. With White's Queen sitting on d2, ...Qc7 is unavailable due to the Be3-f4 maneuver. On the other hand we can pin it with ...Bb4! }
13. axb4 Bxb4
{ The e4-pawn is hanging, therefore White needs to waste a tempo on its protection. }
14. f3 d5
{ Black's opening issues in this line are calling for a radical solution.  Playing it slow with  14...O-O  could be quite dangerous for Black. His disadvantage might not be big, but it definitely is persistent. The main line of my analysis went  15.Bd4  d6  16.Bd3  e5  17.Bf2  Bxc3  18.bxc3  Qxc3  19.Rab1  Qxd2  20.Rxd2  Rc7  21.Bf1  d5  22.exd5  Bxd5  23.Bxa6  += always keeping a slight pull for White. }
15. Bd4
{ The critical try, allowing White's Queen to get to the hyperactive g5-outpost. }
15... dxe4
{ There is little choice but to bite poison apple.  After quiet moves like  15...Bc5  White will easily consolidate a sizeable advantage, e.g.  16.exd5  Nxd5  17.Ne4  Bxd4+  18.Qxd4  O-O  19.c4  ± }
16. Qg5 exf3 { And there is no turning back. } 17. Bxf3 Qc7 18. Nb5
{ This is the toughest line to crack. } 18... Qe7
{ Accepting the gift horse with  18...axb5 ?  is not good for Black and he is, in fact, losing after  19.Qxb5+  Bc6  20.Qxc6+  Qxc6  21.Bxc6+  Rxc6  22.Ra8+  Ke7  23.Rxh8  +- }
19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Qg7 Rf8 21. Bxb7 Qxb7 22. Nd6+ Bxd6 23. Rxd6 Rc6
{ The coast has cleared and after multiple exchanges we can start drawing some conclusions. While White has some compensation for the sacrificed pawn, there is little material left on the board and Black's King is reasonably safe on e8. While this position can certainly be analysed further, there is no imminent danger for Black while his extra pawn is there to stay. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be3 a6 7. Qf3
{ I'd say this is one of the most critical tries in the whole Taimanov Sicilian as well as one of most topical lines nowadays, if not the most discussed among all. As many high-profile players and analytics are involved in the theoretical discussions, the theoretical load is quite heavy. Let us break it down move by move. }
7... Nf6 8. O-O-O Ne5
{ There are multiple options available for Black on move 8 plus the possibility of the creative 7... Ne5 one move earlier if you want to conduct your own research. I was pondering between a couple of set-ups but ultimately decided to present a serious and principled approach. We cannot get away with superficial solutions in this line. }
9. Qg3 b5
{ We come to the first major crossroads. There are at least 5 major options we need to consider in depth. }
10. f4
{ The most popular and best researched move by a far margin. Even if you decide to skip all the other options on move 10 @@StartBracket@@which is not recommended!@@EndBracket@@, this is a definitive must-learn line. }
10... Neg4
{ Attacking the dark-squared Bishop gives us some room to prepare for the inevitable e4-e5. }
11. Bg1 { The most natural retreat. } 11... h5
{ With the Bishop on g1 we mostly need to wait for e4-e5 in order to play ...b5-b4. As you will see in many lines below, e4-e5 is a signal move for ...b4.   I am not so happy with  11...b4 ?!  12.Na4  h5  due to  13.Bd3  when it is quite tough to find a satisfactory set-up for Black if White does not commit to e4-e5. }
12. e5 b4 { Do not forget to insert this move first! } 13. Nb1 Ne4
{ The whole idea of 13. Nb1 is to maneuver the Knight to the c4-square. By changing the route of our own Knight we are nipping the whole idea in the bud, taking the d2-square under Ne4's supervision. }
14. Qe1 Bb7 15. Nd2
{ Obviously there is no better way of redeveloping the unfortunate piece than agreeing to its exchange. }
15... Nxd2
{ There is no point in playing  15...f5 ?  because we need the f5-square for the g4-Knight which will eventually pushed away - after  16.Nxe4  Bxe4  17.h3  ± White has a clear advantage. }
16. Rxd2
{ There seems to be a consensus among practical players on recapturing with the Rook instead of the Queen. White's plans often involve doubling on the d-file @@StartBracket@@with both Rooks@@EndBracket@@ or exchanging light-squared Bishops via the e4-square, thus recapturing with the Rook seems like the logical choice. }
16... Nh6
{ In principle there are two plans at White's disposal - either playing for Bd3-e4 or Bf2-h4, especially if we commit our Bishop to e7 too soon. Exchanging dark-squared Bishops seems to be in White's favour, therefore we start by non-committal moves like ...Nh6 & ...g6, waiting for White to show his cards.   There is nothing wrong with  16...g6  either and the play will transpose after we play ...Nh6 on the next move.   It is too soon for  16...Bc5 ?!  though, and White will squeeze some advantage from the position after  17.Kb1  Rc8  18.Bd3  Nh6  19.Nb3  Bxg1  20.Qxg1  += thanks to our exposed dark squares. }
17. Kb1 g6
{ White is out of useful waiting moves and needs to make a serious choice between Bd3 & Bf2.   From purely informational point of view there are some other ways of handling the position - for example  17...Be7  18.Bf2  g5 !?  led to an interesting struggle in Fernandez Martinez - Elyoseph, corr 2019, but this time I'd like to keep things simple and down to earth unless necessary. }
18. Bd3 Be7
{ Now that the Bf2-h4 plan is unavailable, we develop the Bishop to e7. } 19.
Qe2 h4
{ We want to omit ...Nf5 because, as we will see soon, the Knight will be useful in harassing White's dark-squared Bishop from g4 in case it tries to crawl out of the g1-square. ...h4 is quite useful for us, grabbing some space on the Kingside, threatening ...h3 and forcing White to commit to the Be4 set-up fully. }
20. Be4 Rc8
{ White does not want to exchange on b7 because that would only bring another piece on the long diagonal, not soothing the pain on the a8-h1 diagonal at all. Therefore it makes sense for us to hold the tension a bit longer.  As already noted earlier, we want to avoid ...Nf5.   20...Nf5 ?!  21.Bf2  Rc8  22.Bxb7  Qxb7  23.Rhd1  Nxd4  24.Rxd4  += is the kind of position we want to avoid - White has clear targets on the Queenside and his coordination is pretty good here. We need to throw some sand into his gears.   Nevertheless,  20...Bxe4  21.Qxe4  Rc8  is an acceptable alternative because White does not have anything better than transposing into the analysed lines with either  22.Bf2  or  22.g3  - it is hard to suggest anything more sensible than those two moves. }
21. g3
{ Understandably trying to create some play and tension, now that the long diagonal is completely exposed, we have a very simple antidote at our disposal, though. }
21... Bxe4 22. Qxe4 Qb8
{ The idea is to simply exchange Queens via a8 - White cannot let our Queen occupy such a dominant position. }
23. Nf3 Qa8
{ Although this leads to a pawn sacrifice, the ensuing endgame gives Black sufficient compensation thanks to his strong Knight. }
24. Qxa8 Rxa8 25. Nxh4 Bxh4 26. gxh4 Nf5 27. Bf2 Ne7
{ White's only hope was ...Nxh4, allowing him to get some pull on the Queenside. Winning the h4-pawn can wait while relocating the Knight to d5 solves all issues on the Queenside.   27...Nxh4 ?!  28.Bc5  a5  29.Rhd1  → seems tenable as well but there is no need to give White extra chances. }
28. Rhd1 Nd5 { White cannot create anything on the Queenside, for example } 29.
Rd4
{ White can never seriously consider   29.Rxd5 ?  exd5  30.Rxd5  as the extra exchange counts guarantees the rest of the game will be completely one sided. Black can either grind it slow or open the position with the juicy  30...d6 !  , either managing to exchange Rooks via the d8-square or to get the h8-Rook into play after  31.exd6  Kd7  ∓  either way it will be a very dim endgame for the first player. }
29... a5 30. R1d3 Rc8 31. Be1 Ke7 32. a3 Rc7
{ intending ...Rhc8, sees Black get enough play with easy and logical moves. }

If this strategical concept seems new to you, I heartily recommend studying 'Sam Shankland's Small Steps to Giant Improvement' and the relevant 'Breaking A Dam' chapter. }

{ Due to Covid-19, many over the board events have been cancelled. Luckily for us there has been a huge boom online and many chess events shifted online. Therefore games played on the internet by strong players become increasingly important - in this game we will examine some plans involving the typical a2-a3 move. }
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. a3
{ All set-ups involving a3, especially 6. a3 and   6.Be3  --  followed by  7.a3  , should be taken seriously. While relatively timid at first sight, White is preparing for aggressive f4 & g4 ideas in case Black plays ... Nf6 at a wrong moment. }
6... a6 7. Be3
{ In our repertoire we investigate this position via the 6. Be3 & 7. a3 move order. Staying flexible against various White's move orders should definitely be on top of your priority list in Taimanov as White will often try to outsmart you in a practical game. }
7... b5 8. Nxc6 Qxc6 9. Qd4
{ Let me just note that 9. Be2 seems to be the critical move here and we deal with it accordingly in the main analysis section. }
9... Bb7 10. O-O-O Rc8
{ 10...Nf6 !  I prefer this move over Matlakov's choice. The reason White tries to be tricky with including Bf1-e2 at some point is to prevent this move in view of e4-e5 & Be2-f3 which is, obviously, not working so well now.  11.e5  It is too late to try to revert to   11.Be2  in view of  11...Rc8  12.e5   12.Bf3  Bxa3  13.e5  Nd5  transposes.  12...Nd5  13.Bf3  Bxa3  Or even   13...Qc7  if you want to keep the game going a bit longer.  14.Rd3   14.Bxd5  Black is better here due to White being unable to exchange on d5 in view of the mate on c2.  14...Bxd5  Since White cannot play Nd5 due to Qc2 checkmate Black is better here.  14...Nxe3  with good game for Black. White's dark-squared Bishop is clearly missing in the ensuing open fight.  14.Rd3  Bc5  15.Qxc5  Qxc5  16.Bxc5  Rxc5 =  and everything will eliminate into a drawish Rook endgame.  11...Nd5  12.Nxd5  White cannot afford to let us rid him of his Bishop pair with ...Nxe3 but simplifications, especially exchanging Queens, are favourable for Black almost as a rule.  12...Qxd5  13.Rg1  Qxd4  14.Bxd4  Be7 =  Such endings are quite common in Taimanov and Black has absolutely nothing to worry about here. }
11. Be2
{ 11.Bd3  Nf6  It might seem as if   11...Bxa3 ?  is winning a pawn but in fact it is White who is winning material after a couple of moves  12.bxa3  Qxc3  13.Qxc3  Rxc3  14.Bd4  +-  , hitting both c3 & g7.  12.e5  Nd5  13.Be4  If we compare this position with the 10... Nf6 line where White's Bishop is on f3 instead, it is a bit better placed now since it is protecting c2. Nevertheless, Black is just fine after  13...Qc7  a typical Taimanov retreat.   13...Bxa3 ?  is again refuted with some neat tactics:  14.Nxd5  exd5  15.e6 !!  dxe6  16.Qxg7  Rf8  17.Bxh7  ±  and thanks to the h7-Bishop protecting c2 White will keep a significant edge.  14.Nxd5  Bxd5  15.Rd2  Bc5  16.Qd3  Bxe4  17.Qxe4  Qc6 =  There are not so many pieces left to play with and the position is equal. }
11... Qc7 { 11...Nf6  transposes to our 10... Nf6 analysis. } 12. Kb1
{ From the objective point of view White definitely could have tried   12.Rd2 !?  , both overprotecting the c2-pawn and preparing to double his Rooks on the d-file.  12...e5  The problem with   12...Nf6  is that  13.e5  Nd5  14.Nxd5  Bxd5  15.Bf3  Bxf3  16.gxf3  is quite nasty. If Black managed to exchange Queens he'd be more than fine, however White might develop some initiative on the Kingside here as the g-file is open.  13.Qd3  Nf6  14.Nd5  Bxd5  15.exd5  →  and White's chances seem to be slightly better to me. }
12... Nf6 13. e5
{ Giving up control over the important d5-square and overlooking a simple double attack at the same time.  ...Bxa3 was already a threat but Black has no problems after   13.Rd3  Bc5  14.Qxc5  Qxc5  15.Bxc5  Rxc5  16.f3  Ke7  with a pleasant endgame anyway. }
13... Nd5 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 { Suddenly White cannot defend both c2 & g2. } 15. Bf3
{ A strange decision. White should at least sacrifice the other pawn, trying to make use of the open g-file with a reasonable compensation.   15.Rd2  Bxg2  16.Rhd1  Bc6  17.Qf4  =∞  White has good compensation here, although a pawn is still a pawn. }

The Taimanov is bad because White just fianchettoes his Bishop and there is no visible target to attack in White's seemingly harmonious set-up.

15... Be5

Let us have a look at the following forcing line just for the sake of entertainment, but I do not expect any human to be able to calculate so precisely with a couple of seconds left on their clock.  29...Rxg3+  30.hxg3  Qxg3+  31.Kf1  Rg4  32.Qb4+  d6  33.Rxe6+  Kf8  34.Qxd6+  Kg7  35.Ke2  Rxf4  36.Rf1  Qh2+  37.Ke3 = }

And in general, the less pawns there are on the board the better his chances to eliminate into, say, Rook vs. Rook + Knight ending. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Qd3
{ This move is not as innocent as it appears. GM Vallejo employed this already back in 2014 and many strong players have picked it up as their weapon of choice since then. }
6... Nf6 { 6...a6  7.Nxc6  bxc6  8.Qg3  is something I want Black to avoid. }
7. Ndb5
{ 7.Nxc6  dxc6  8.Qg3  Qxg3  9.hxg3  e5  Black is doing fine here.   7.Bg5  a6  8.O-O-O  h6  9.Bxf6  Qf4+ !  The key move to remember! }
7... Qb8 8. Qg3 d6 9. Be3 a6 10. Nd4 h5 11. O-O-O
{ Pretty much main stuff all the way until 10... h5, a clever antidote against White's venomous set-up. Vallejo's last move is an inferior option compared to 11. f3, as tried by Caruana against me in 2019. }
11... h4 12. Nxc6
{ 12.Qf3 ?  fails due to the simple tactic  12...Nxd4  13.Bxd4  e5  14.Bb6  Bg4  -+  winning a clear exchange. }
12... hxg3
{ I got a bit tempted by this move but, in reality, it is totally unnecessary.  It is not difficult to improve on my play with   12...bxc6 !  13.Qf3  e5  as recommended in the course. }
13. Nxb8 Rxh2
{ 13...Ng4 !  It is quite tough to make such an unnatural move in a blitz game. I found it quite amazing when my engine suggested it when analyzing it - Black is fine after  14.Nxa6  bxa6  15.h3  Nxf2  16.Bxf2  gxf2  17.Rd2  Be7  18.Rxf2  Bh4  19.Rf3  Ke7  =∞ }
14. Rxh2 gxh2 15. Be2
{ 15.Nxa6 !  is the reason why my 11...hxg3  is not working so well for Black! One has to admit it is quite a pretty move and it is rather easy to miss it, especially in faster time controls.  15...bxa6  16.Bd3  Ng4  17.Rh1  Nxe3  18.fxe3  g6  It is far from over, of course, but White can play for a win with his extra pawn without any risk. }
15... Rxb8 16. Rh1 b5 17. f3 b4 18. Na4 Bd7 19. b3
{ 19.Nb6  Bb5  20.Bxb5+  axb5  21.Rxh2  Kd8 = } 19... Bxa4
{ My only excuse for giving away the Bishop pair and the a-pawn can be just my shortness of time, even so it is difficult to understand such a poor decision.   19...Bb5 !  20.Bxb5+  Rxb5  21.Rxh2  d5 = }
20. bxa4 d5
{ Defending passively with   20...Ra8  21.Rxh2  +-  is completely out of question. White's Rook will join the fight soon and the a6-pawn is horrendously weak. }
21. Rxh2 dxe4 22. Bxa6 Bd6 23. Rh4
{ 23.Rh8+ !  Kd7  24.Rxb8  Bxb8  25.fxe4  Nxe4  26.Bb5+  Kd6  27.a5  ± } 23...
exf3 24. gxf3 Nd5 25. Bg5 f6 26. Bd2 Kf7 27. Bc4 Ra8 28. Bb3 Ke7
{ Here I felt the worst is already behind as Black's Knight on d5 is doing a wonderful job of keeping the position together. }

{ Last 20 moves were basically played as we both had seconds on our clock left. Some of White's ideas discussed in the course may appear harmless at first sight, nevertheless they have to be examined and studied well. Most probably you will face them in shorter time controls or online chess - in a classical game you should aim to study the main lines more. }

[Result "*"]

{ This is a nice example of overlap with a seemingly completely unrelated opening. We might reach the typical French-like structure in the Taimanov in many variations and it definitely makes sense to enrich oneself with studying the following game as well. }
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 cxd4
{ We prefer to play ...c5 & ...cxd4 a tad sooner in the Taimanov :@@EndBracket@@ Nevertheless, the structure arising after }
8. Nxd4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O Nxd4 11. Bxd4 a6
{ is quite a typical sight in the Taimanov too. In the Sicilian we thankfully get the chance to dictate the moment we transition into the ...d5 & e5 structure, choosing a favourable one. Practically speaking, the current scenario is a bit dangerous for Black as he showed his cards too soon and White can adjust his set-up accordingly. Flexibility is definitely one of the reasons I'd always pick the Taimanov over the French Defence. }
12. h4
{ To be fair,   12.Qe3  has been scoring the best from a statistical point of view, but let us not delve into opening theory too much as this game is completely out of the scope of our repertoire. }
12... b5 13. a3 Rb8
{ Intending to counterattack with ...b4. In the Taimanov we usually get positions with a Queen on c7 instead, but the principle remains the same - we combine creating threats on the Queenside with a simplification of the position, claiming we will be faster than White's attack on the Kingside. }
14. Bxc5 Nxc5 15. Qd4
{ Taking ...b4 under control. On the other hand White is allowing Black to exchange Queens, the same method we often use in the Taimanov too.   15.b4 !?  Nd7  16.h5  could be a very interesting try, playing for an attack with Queens on the board. It is rather difficult to endanger White's King without the dark-squared Bishop, another reason to choose the Taimanov over the French!  On the other hand, White cannot play carelessly as   15.Bd3 ?  b4  could seriously hurt White's King:  16.axb4  Rxb4  17.Nxd5  Nxd3+ !  This zwischenzug spoils all the fun for White.  18.cxd3  Rb3  ↑  and White's extra pawn does not mean anything in view of the incoming a-pawn marsh to a3, breaching White's defensive line. As a matter of fact engines already evaluate this position as winning for Black! }
15... Qb6 { Now ...b4 is imminent and after } 16. b4 Nd7 17. h5 h6 18. Qxb6
Nxb6
{ Black remains very solid. It is important to understand the pros and cons of such a position before reaching it. At first glance White's position looks pleasant with his plans including shifting his Knight to d4 via e2, Bishop to d3 and slowly expanding on the Kingside. Black's position might appear passive at first sight but we have an important resource in breaking through with ...f6!, getting immediate counterplay. }
19. Ne2 Bd7
{ 19...f6 !  I definitely prefer this move and it can actually be anyone's game after  20.exf6  or   20.Nd4  fxe5  21.fxe5  Rf4  ∞  gxf6  21.Nd4  Bd7  ∞  - the position remains unclear, especially in a practical game where Black's central pawns might get very strong if White does not watch out for ... e5. Black will bring his Rook to e8 and play for the central advance. }
20. Nd4 Rfc8
{ This is just passive and I don't like this move at all. Black absolutely has to create counterchances and the rest of the game is suffering which is a prime example of what we need to avoid in the Taimanov at all costs!  It was still not too late to return to the true path with   20...f6 !  where Black should be doing well. }
21. Rh3 Na4 22. Kd2 Rc7 23. Rb1 Rbc8 24. Rbb3 Nb6 25. g4 Nc4+ 26. Bxc4 dxc4 27.
Rbg3
{ White missed several chances to open up the Kingside with a timely g4-g5 later on, eventually allowing Black to save the game by the skin of his teeth, but I seriously doubt it was an enjoyable task. }

{ I chose this game to demonstrate how quickly things can go wrong for White in the Scheveningen. GM Ulf Andersson, who was world no. 4 at his peak, was mostly famous for winning games from positions where his colleagues would sign a peace treaty instead. I heartily suggest studying his games in the Catalan too. Nevertheless, in the current game he managed to prove he was a clever tactician as well. }

Be3 d6 9. f4 Be7 10. Qe1 O-O 11. Qg3 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 b5 13. a3 Bb7
{ White's best move in this position is transposing into the main lines of the Scheveningen with 14. Kh1. There are many fine points behind both sides' moves in this variation and Kh1 turns out to be indispensable if White wants to even try to fight for an opening advantage. }
14. Bd3
{ In the course itself we are investigating a similar theme after   14.Rae1  Rad8  15.Bd3  e5 ! }
14... e5
{ Quite a typical break for the Scheveningen. Both sides need to keep an eye on it and this time White failed to be vigilant enough. }
15. fxe5 Nh5
{ Forcing White's Queen away from the e5-pawn.   15...dxe5  Funnily enough even this is possible :@@EndBracket@@  16.Bxe5  Qc5+  17.Rf2  Nh5  Black is not doing worse here either thanks to White's hanging pieces, but I digress... }
16. Qe3
{ This move is already a great mistake and Black is considerably better here.  The only way to keep the balance was   16.exd6  The difficult part of making such a move is that your mind simply rejects it due to the 'obvious' material deficit. If we stay open-minded, though, it should not be so difficult to estimate the final position correctly.  16...Nxg3  17.dxc7  Nxf1  18.Kxf1  Bd6  19.Nd5 !  This is the key, grabbing the Bishop pair and creating passed pawns in the centre after  19...Bxd5  20.exd5  Bxc7  21.b3 =  intending c2-c4. Even though Black is an exchange up, White should have just enough compensation thanks to his pieces covering most of the centre. }
16... dxe5 17. Bb6 Qd6 18. Kh1 Nf4
{ Black's Knight joins the party! White's Bishops are not coordinated at all, meanwhile the second player's army is in complete harmony. It took just a couple of random moves from White and he is already borderline lost. }
19. Rfd1 Qg6 20. Bf1 Bg5
{ Threatening ...Nxg2. Every Andersson's move is like another nail into White's coffin, forcing him into even more passivity. }
21. Qc5 Rfe8
{ Not only defending the e5-pawn, but setting a nasty trap as well. } 22. Re1
{ 22.Rd6 ?  runs into  22...Be7  23.Rxg6  Bxc5  -+  when White's Rook does not have any good squares on the 6th rank, thus he is forced to part with at least an exchange! }
22... Re6
{ White's Bishop is a poor sight, being pushed to the very edge of the board. }
23. Ba5 { 23.Bc7  Rc8  -+ } 23... Bh4
{ This is not the only winning move and there are already many paths to victory, but grabbing material seems like the most obvious way. White did not get a chance to come back into the game and his pieces remained offside until the bitter end. }
24. Nd5 Rc8 25. Qa7 Bxd5 26. Qd7 Rf8 27. exd5 Rd6 28. Qb7 Bxe1 29. Rxe1 Nxd5
30. c4 bxc4 31. Bxc4 Nf4 32. Bb4 Rd7 33. Qf3 Nd3 34. Bxf8 Nxe1 35. Qa8 Rd8
{ A fine example on the typical ...e5 break and richness of Black's ideas. Kudos to clean execution by Ulf Andersson! }
