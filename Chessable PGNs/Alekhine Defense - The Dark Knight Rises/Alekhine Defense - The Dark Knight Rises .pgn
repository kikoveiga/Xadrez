{ Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide ! Before you dive into the main course let's create a study plan based off of the frequency that you will be seeing certain variations based off of statistical and current trends. It should be noted that these study recommendations are from NM Tillis and are suggestions, the reader may wish to follow the pure stats that follow. This chapter is organized in a format that is believed to be most efficient for using the text. There are notes at the start of each variation giving an overview on its placement and importance in the scheme of the entire opening.   Classical Mainline/Anti Classical Alternative - 33%  Exchange Variation - 31.5%  2. Nc3 - 14%  4-Pawns Attack - 8%  Overzealous c5 - 2.5%  3. Nc3 - 2.5%  2. d3 - 2%  Tate Variation - 2%  2. Bc4 - 1%  3. Bc4 - 1%  2. d4/2. Nf3 - .5%  3. g3 - .5%  2. Qe2 - .5  2. f3 - .5,  misc. rare lines.  Any variation occurring less than 2% of the time needs only to fall under a general understanding, not a mastery. }

{ Different from the main course we will start with the absolute most critical positions and work our way to the least critical. The main course was designed to teach themes to the reader as they work through the main course. It is strongly suggested to give the text a once over and then follow the suggested study routine suggested in the Quickstarter Guide. }
1... Nf6
{ The starting position for the Alekhine Defense, named after the fourth chess world champion Alexander Alekhine who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament in games against Endre Steiner and Fritz Samisch. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defense. Modern champions of the Alekhine Defense are grandmasters Shabalov, Baburin and especially Bortnyk who use the opening with regularity, while Aronian, Adams, and Nakamura will use it on occasion. In the past, great players such as Fischer and Korchnoi included the defense in their repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. }
2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3
{ The Classical Mainline is considered the most theoretically challenging variation. }
4... dxe5
{ The most solid option at Black's disposal. Black will employ a strategy similar to that in the Scandinavian Defense - he will develop his light-squared Bishop before playing ...e6 and then create a solid setup without weakness. We intend to argue that White's space advantage is only symbolic and that we will have good chances to outlast our opponent. }
5. dxe5
{ A rare guest, Black should have a fleeting developmental knowledge of how to handle this position. Keep in mind, c6 is not required. }
5... Bg4
{ The best move pinning the knight and placing some pressure in the position. }
6. Bc4
{ In the event of 6. h3, we need to capture to not allow White to play g4 and e6 to cripple our structure. }
6... e6 { The bishop is outside of the chain leading to easy development. } 7.
O-O Nc6
{ It's also possible to play the solid c6, but the text move places pressure on the e5 pawn making it the Memory Marker for development. }
8. Bb5 Qd7 9. c4 Ndb4
{ The queen trade isn't a concern. Black is fine tactically and we prefer the endgame anyways since the e5-pawn is a bit weak. }
10. Qxd7+ Kxd7 11. Nc3 Bxf3
{ Compromising the pawn structure, we will end the line here where Black finishes with castling by hand with Rd8. }

{ One of the more critical variations as it has a different feel from the Tate variation. We also investigate a few other options: 4. c4 d6 With a direct transposition into the Exchange Variation; 4. Bd3 Is an annoying move order only because it stops our wanted ...d5 plan where our c8-Bishop has no good squares   4...d5  5.c3  followed by  f4  leaves Black in a very difficult position  5. Nf3   5.f4  g6  will transpose to the 4  f4  lines  5... g6 With typical ...g6 development schemes that we have seen in previous variations. Black will aim to hit the center with ...c5, either in one go or after ...Na6; 4. d5 A scary move for the uninitiated, but it is harmless 4... d6 5. f4   5.exd6  exd6  5... g6 6. c4 Bg7 Notice the similarities between this position and the earlier ... g6 4-Pawns Attack positions. White has extended the structure without even being provoked and this can only mean Black is much better already 7. Nf3 Bg4 And the White center will collapse; 4. g3 A move that will not pose any real difficulty. Black has immediate equality through multiple paths 4... d6 Is a good place to start 5. exd6 exd6 5... cxd6 is fine too if that is your preference, this line is not overly critical. }
4... a5
{ In many previous lines of the Anti-Classical 3... Nb6, White had the opportunity to play a4 in a position and we didn't show it. This is because it would be tedious to constantly point out the a4 possibilities and because we can sum it all up in one sentence. When you see a4, play ...a5. Simple, right ? Now please note that this is different from how we treated the Tate Variation because there we had the additional option of attacking key squares. }
5. Nf3
{ The other lines we investigate:   5.c4  d6  6.f4   6.exd6  exd6  Is also stronger once  a4  and  a5  have been inserted, and significantly better than  ...cxd6  because  ...cxd6  would emphasize the weakened  b5  square  (;)   5.Ra3  d6  6.exd6  exd6  We play ... ex rather than  ...cx  in order to not magnify the weakness on the b-file  7.Rg3  g6  8.Nc3  Bg7  So far so normal  9.Bg5  f6  10.Be3  d5  (Black can plan on going ...Nc6, ...Bf5 , ...Qd7 and ...O-O-O.) }

5. Nf3
{ Giving us a bit of an interesting situation because if we play the typical ...g6 here, which is our recommendation against 5. Nc3 by White, then White could play c4 and transpose to a line of the Four Pawns Attack which we did not previously cover. However, the alternatives to ...g6 are very sharp and require detailed knowledge to pull off with confidence and that just doesn't seem like a sensible approach for such a rare line. The solution then is to just learn some extra lines of the 4-Pawns attack! Luckily, it is not much extra work because we only have to consider the lines where White has played Nf3.   5.c4  dxe5  Transposes to the 4-Pawns Attack Variation;  ()   5.Nc3  included the position feels similar to the Austrian Attack variation of the Pirc/Modern  5...g6  6.Nf3  Bg7  7.Bd3   5.Nc3  g6  6.Nf3  Bg7  7.Bb5  c6  8.Bd3  Na6  will transpose after Black plays ...c5 which is our typical plan in this structure. }

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. b3
{ One of the least challenging continuations as our Alekhine Knight isn't even harassed in this variation. In typical fashion, we fight against the overextended e-pawn. }
3... d6 4. exd6 Qxd6
{ 4... Qxd6 is the strongest by far of the three possible recaptures. 4... cxd6 doesn't make much sense as it would compel us to fianchetto our dark-squared bishop when White is already setting up on the long diagonal and this would just give us awkward development. 4... exd6 is slightly passive here and we would lose our opportunity to play ...e5 later as we do in the 4... Qxd6 variations. }
5. Bb2 Nc6
{ 5... Bf5 is another completely acceptable move with the idea of simple development and pressure on c2. }
6. Nc3 Nxc3
{ We willingly trade here because otherwise White will just play Nxd5 and Bc4 with tempo on the Queen later  (of course after having played Nf3 so that the g2 pawn would not be hanging)  . }
7. Bxc3 e5
{ A large part of why we preferred to play 4... Qxd6 instead of 4... exd6 was so we could do this. }
8. Qf3
{ White's intention is not necessarily to play O-O-O. Often Qf3 is a good prophylactic move before developing the light-squared bishop. For instance, after 8 Bc4, Black has the annoying 8... Qg6 ! with a double attack on the g2 and c2 pawns. }
8... Be6 9. Bd3 O-O-O 10. Ne2 { 10.Be4  Nd4 ! } 10... Bd5
{ The immediate ... g6 allows White to play Be4. } 11. Be4 Bxe4 12. Qxe4 g6

[Result "*"]

1. e4 Nf6 2. f3
{ While clearly a dubious move that weakens the White King and neglects his piece development, 2 f3 is not a move that we should try to outright punish. In fact, 2 f3 could be hiding a cunning purpose if we were to continue with the routine and natural 2... d5. }
2... e5
{ This is one of the couple times in the repertoire that we vary from playing ...d5 against an Offline/Sideline. One of the reasons why we often choose to play ...d5 is that it avoids transposing to well-known positions from completely different opening systems. In a surprising twist, 2.. .d5 here could transpose to the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit ! 2... e5 is instead the strongest move that avoids reaching an extensive body of opening theory. 2... d5 Here we briefly show what can happen if we continue with the routine 2... d5 3. d4 dxe4 4. Nc3 With direct transposition to the Blackmar-Diemer mainline. While this gambit doesn't exactly pose Black a theoretical challenge, it would entail learning many more lines than we would care to allocate to the student in dealing with the Offline 2 f3 in the Alekhine ! Additionally, this transposition is exactly what White is looking for when he plays the strange 2 f3 and it makes sense to avoid White's only idea in the position. }
3. Nc3 Bc5 4. Nge2 d5 { Striking before White plays d4. } 5. exd5 O-O 6. Ng3 c6
{ This is the strongest move. We will control the center and leave White with an awkward development task. 6... Nxd5 was also possible but it is only slightly better for Black }
7. dxc6 Nxc6 8. Bc4 Nh5
{ With a direct threat of ...Qh4. A consequence of the early f3 advance. It is important to note that the tactics here are also based on the loose nature of the c4 Bishop. }
9. Nxh5
{ 9.d3  Any passive move leads to mounting pressure  9... Qh4;  9.Nge4  Qh4+  10.Kf1   10.g3  Nxg3 !  is the same tactic   10.g3  Nxg3  11.Nxg3  Qxc4  10...Ng3+  11.Nxg3  Qxc4+ }

{ 4...Qxd6 is the strongest by far of the three possible recaptures. 4...cxd6 doesn't make much sense as it would compel us to fianchetto our dark-squared bishop when White is already setting up on the long diagonal and this would just give us awkward development. 4...exd6 is slightly passive here and we would lose our opportunity to play ...e5 later like we do in the 4...Qxd6 variations }
5. Bb2 Nc6
{ 5...Bf5 is another completely acceptable move with the idea of simple development and pressure on c2 }
6. Nc3 Nxc3
{ We willingly trade here because otherwise White will just play Nxd5 and Bc4 with tempo on the Queen later  (of course after having played Nf3 so that the g2 pawn would not be hanging) }
7. Bxc3 e5 8. Qf3
{ White's intention is not necessarily to play O-O-O. Often Qf3 is a good prophylactic move before developing the light-squared bishop. For instance, after 8 Bc4, Black has the annoying 8...Qg6! with a double attack on the g2 and c2 pawns }
8... Be6 9. Bd3 O-O-O 10. Ne2 { 10.Be4  Nd4! } 10... Bd5
{ The immediate ...g6 allows White to play Be4 } 11. Be4 Bxe4 12. Qxe4 g6

Note that it would not be the same as our recommended ...exd6 in the Exchange Variation chapter since White has made no central pawn commitments yet. 5...Qxd6!? is actually quite interesting but requires obscure knowledge of specific lines and the student's time will be better spent elsewhere since they can simply play 5...cxd6 and reach a position that is both equal and easy to understand }

6. Qxd4 e6
{ In this case a transposition to the French structure is practically forced since the only alternative 6...Nb6 is no good. However, there is no need to fret! Black gains time by attacking the exposed Queen and equalizes simply }
7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Qf4 g6 { Black will pressure the over-extended e5 pawn } 9. O-O
Bg7 10. Re1 O-O
{ With a roughly equal position. Black can look to improve his minor pieces and expand on the Queenside }

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4
{ So far we have seen 3 c4 in the 'Overzealous 4 c5' and 'Tate System' sidelines, and this is our first time seeing the more popular move order of 3 d4 followed by 4 c4. While we will present 3...d6 as Black's response here, it should be noted that we offer the alternative 3...Nb6!? in our investigation of the mainline. If White is looking to play the exchange variation it will make little difference which move we play as after 3...Nb6 4 c4 play will transpose when Black plays 4...d6 }
3... d6
{ 3.Nb6  4.c4  d6  with direct transposition to the Exchange Variation } 4. c4
Nb6
{ Reaching a slight crossroads. The main move here is 5 exd6 - the aptly named 'Exchange Variation'. A secondary try for White is 4 f4 - the also aptly named '4-Pawns Attack' and this variation will be investigated later. Before we dive into the Exchange Variation, we will look at an understandably unpopular sideline try for White - 5 Nf3 }
5. Nf3
{ We like to note Champions of the Alekhine throughout the text. GM Edvins Kengis is definitely another Alekhine player to seriously analyze. The stem game we used for this line was Gallagher - Kengis, 0-1, Bern 1992 }
5... dxe5
{ While the most popular move in the database is 5...Bg4, we believe that it allows White to generate too much of an attack on our Kingside. This was also Taylor's conclusion in his book 'Alekhine Alert'. 5...g6 would transpose directly into the 5...cxd6 Exchange Variation which is offered as an alternative line in the chapter   5.g6   5.Bg4  6.Be2  e6  7.exd6  cxd6  8.O-O  Be7  9.Nc3  O-O  10.Be3  Nc6  11.d5  which is not fun to play }
6. Nxe5
{ 6.c5  N6d7  7.dxe5  e6  and White is losing the c-pawn   6.dxe5  Qxd1  7.Kxd1  Bg4  8.b3  Nc6  9.Bb2  O-O-O  Is already miserable for White }
6... g6
{ 6.N8d7  Can lead to disaster quickly  7.Nxf7 !  Kxf7  8.c5  Nd5 ?  9.Qh5  Ke6  10.g3  Where Black is busted }
7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Be3 c5
{ The most forcing and dynamic move pressuring the center. } 9. Be2
{ The most common of the variations in practice. White has a few more moves worthy of investigation:  9. dxc5 Qxd1+ 10. Rxd1 Bxe5 11. cxb6 Bxc3+ 12. bxc3 axb6 13. Bxb6 O-O 14. Rd2 Be6 Black has dynamic equality with many White targets to focus on in the ending.  9. Qf3 O-O 10. O-O-O Qe8 A logical move to avoid the pin. 11. Nb5 If White does not seek to put pressure on Black immediately he will consolidate with active play stemming from cxd4. 11... cxd4 12. Bxd4 Na6 Stopping the threat of  Knight fork. 13. h4 f6 This move will be the equalizer in multiple variations. 14. Ng4 e5 15. Bc3 h5 16. Ne3 Na4 With a dynamic position for both sides. }
9... O-O 10. O-O Be6 { A provocative move tempting the White structure. } 11.
d5
{ Another move for consideration:  11. dxc5 Bxe5 12. cxb6 Bxc3 13. bxc3 axb6 14. Qxd8 Rxd8 15. Rfb1 Nd7 With equality, Black will play Rdc8 with pressure. If White releases the tension on the doubled b-pawns any edge of the Bishop Pair will be negated.  In this variations White has numerous opportunities to capture on c5 leading to this ending which the reader should be comfortable going into. }
11... Bxd5 12. Nxg6
{ Taking the opportunity to go into a tactical variation forcing liquidation. }
12... hxg6 13. Nxd5 e6
{ Putting the question to the Knight forcing a return. The capture on b6 only helps develop Black. }
14. Nc3 Bd4
{ This went well for Black in 0-1  (31)  Hjorth,J  (2119)  -Holmstroem,J  (2155)  ICCF email 2014  15. Bxd4 cxd4 16. Ne4 Nc6 17. Qb3 Kg7 18. Rae1 f5 19. Nd2 e5 20. c5 Nd7 21. Qxb7 Rf6 22. Qb3 Rb8 23.

The alternative to 5...exd6 is the symmetry-breaking 5...cxd6. 5...cxd6 is a more 'combative' venture but accordingly it also undertakes more risk.

8. O-O Be7 9. Nc3 O-O 10. b3 Bf6
{ An important move as we need clearance on the d7 square for our Knights and we begin to focus on attacking the strong center. }
11. Be3 d5
{ The critical move and Memory Marker to fight for the center. In future variations we will see White's attempt at d5 himself and subsequent counterplay. }
12. c5 Nc8

Bg2 Nb4 Another odd move, Black seeks the  best way to redeploy the Knight in order to secure the center with the c-pawn 17. a3 Na6 18. f4 f5 An important move as we do not want to allow White to get too much space for his attack on the kingside. 19.

{ We will end the variation here following an old game: 0-1  (43)  Gipslis,A-Larsen,B Sousse 1967.

9... e5
{ A move suggested in another Alekhine Defense text, we can't in good faith suggest it. Tim Taylor is his text Alekhine Alert also agrees with our assessment. He suggests 5...exd6 as the best response for Black. Overall, this move is not terrible, but Black needs to play accurately from an awkward position to maintain the balance. There are two other moves worthy of investigation:   9... Nc6 The first choice move in the database for Black. As soon as one looks at the move statistics though horror strikes Black as White easily wins 70%+ of the games with the next move. 10. d5 Unlike our mainline in the text, Black is not accomplishing d5. We are now cramped and struggling to find good squares for our pieces over the next few moves. 10... Ne5 11. Be2 Most flexible, eyeing the g4 square. 11... f5 The most active and popular try, White is much better in all variations. 12. f4 Ng4 13. Bxg4 fxg4 Black has the Bishop Pair but little else. 14. Nge2 It is difficult to suggest a move for Black here. It should be noted that by touching the e-pawn White will capture resulting in an awkward d-pawn which will be very difficult to maintain.    9... f5 A move with the flavor of a Kings Indian looking for active play at the cost of safety. A move championed by GM Shabalov who has an uncompromising style suiting the move. 10. Qd2 e6 Black avoided the full e-pawn push as it results in a position similar to the mainline with the Queens coming off the board with the drawback of lack of flexibility with the f-pawn's location. 11.

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. d4 d6 5. f4
{ Unsurprisingly, this move begins the 4-Pawns Attack Variation. Before we dive into our chosen approach to neutralizing White's early aggression, we would first like present 3 games that give important context as to how we arrived at our eventual recommendation. The game we will look at first is: Zvara, Petr - Chetverik, Maxim, 1-0, Olomouc Agentura 64 Cup IM-B, 2007. This game exhibits a combative sideline for Black that we believe is more suited for Rapid or Blitz chess as it does seem to be objectively dubious }
5... g5
{ An interesting and extremely combative continuation. The two great downsides to this approach are 1  Black is taking on the lion's share of the risk in the position as White can continue by playing natural moves and Black cannot, and 2  There are too many moves available to White that Black needs to investigate. Without deep preparation, it can be very difficult for Black to find best play in these creative situations }

6. fxe5 c5
{ We considered this variation strongly because the forcing nature of play in this variation was very appealing. Unfortunately, this variation has a problem... }
7. d5
{ A required move for White   7.dxc5  Qxd1  8.Kxd1  N6d7  gets the pawn back where in the long term the  e5  pawn will be weak }
7... e6

We will not go into great detail but Black's development is very difficult in the resulting positions and they are not very fun to play }

White has bishop pair but has no accompanying pawn breaks to progress the position. Silva, Marco - Zilberman, Yaacov, 0-1, Nagler Memorial op, 1998 }

{ Giving us a bit of an interesting situation because if we play the typical ...g6 here, which is our recommendation against 5 Nc3 by White, then White could play c4 and transpose to a line of the 4-Pawns Attack which we did not previously cover. However, the alternatives to ...g6 are very sharp and require detailed knowledge to pull off with confidence and that just doesn't seem like a sensible approach for such a rare line. The solution then is to just learn some extra lines of the 4-Pawns attack! Luckily, it is not much extra work because we only have to consider the lines where White has played Nf3 }

{ The beauty of Chessable is a book ever has the chance to continue to evolve. The readers can expect as we emerge in the dawn of 2020 a new Quickstarter Guide will be placed in the text to assist readers in the most optimal study of the Alekhine. This bonus game is a reminder of the ferocity with which the Alekhine can punish the uninitiated. This was played on lichess.org at 3min time control on 12/27/19. }
2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6
{ My personal preference is much like a game of ping pong when it comes to selecting the Classical or Anti-Classical chapter as the main weapon. Personally, my results have been better with the Classical since the text has been published. }
4. c4 Nb6 5. exd6 cxd6
{ Another crossroads having the choice of the solid 5... exd6 or the more aggressive 5... cxd6. In faster time controls, I nearly universally choose the more aggressive option. This is for the reason to be able to play quickly in a complicated variation while being able to place pressure on my opponent due to the speed of play. This is mentioned to potentially assist the reader with their choice of which line to study. }
6. Nc3 g6 7. Nf3
{ When playing the 5...cxd6 Exchange Variation this is a move that should delight us as seen in the previous example game. }
7... Bg7
{ Black structurally has few other options, play can be quick and accurate. }
8. h4
{ An aggressive thrust but a move which should not make our breath or heart rate change. }
8... Bg4
{ Pressure is building on the White central pawns, there will be no realistic attack. }
9. Qd3 { White is already spread too thin, Black has the initiative. } 9... O-O
10. Be2 Nc6
{ Black is fully developed and ready to begin the assault. White is lagging behind from the h-pawn and extra Queen move. The best objective chance is to make a mess of the position, but it still leaves White worse:  11. h5 Nb4 12. Qd2 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 Nxc4  also  11. d5 Bxf3 12. gxf3 Ne5 13. Qe4 Rc8  is better for Black as well. }
11. Be3 d5
{ With the thematic d-pawn push seen in multiple variations throughout the course. We would love to secure the c4 square for the Knight. }
12. cxd5 { The best of the objectively bad options at this point. } 12... Nxd5
13. O-O-O
{ From this point on the reader should stop and attempt to solve this position as a Black to play and win tactically. Personally, I had a strong feeling that the position was winning by this juncture but failed tactically to find the best continuations. }
13... Rc8 { Getting another piece into the attack. } 14. Ng5
{ The aggressive posturing gives no relief from the queenside attack. } 14...
Bxe2
{ A less than accurate move, Black still maintains a large advantage, much better was  14... Ncb4  where White only has miserable options. }
15. Qxe2 Ncb4 { The idea struck me one move later than needed. } 16. Bd2
{ Standing no better was:  16. Kb1 Rxc3! } 16... Nxa2+ 17. Kc2 Qa5
{ The engine likes both 17...Bxd4 or 17...Qb6 as better, this move seemed provocative while keeping tension. }
18. Kb1 Naxc3+ 19. bxc3 { The last bit of game is left to solve. } 19... Rc6
{ Is good enough, much stronger and with flash is:  19... Rxc3  Which has the same intent as the main game but is much more aesthetically pleasing. }
20. Kc2 Nb4+ { Cutting off the escape square keeping the King in the net. } 21.
Kb3 Qa2+ { The Knight is a necessary contribution to end the conflict. } 22.
Kxb4
{ Mate in 4 in the position, perform better than I did in the situation. How many mates can you find? }

1. e4 Nf6
{ This game brought immense excitement to the Alekhine faithful as the boss decided to pick up our favored opening once again! }
2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. f4
{ Caruana shows bravado going for one of the more aggressive systems in the 4-Pawns Attack. }
5... g6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{ A key moment in development, White is making useful and flexible moves. }
7... Be6
{ An extremely important motif in the position. White has chosen the most dangerous move order for the Alekhine player. The following example line is what can take place if Black castles into it.  7... O-O 8. c5 This move scores better than 70% across the databases. 8... N6d7 9.h4 White has some truly nasty initiative. }
8. Nf3 { We now have no worries of the attack on the h-file. } 8... O-O
{ Only now are we making a threat on the c-pawn. } 9. b3
{ This solid looking move is most popular in practice so far. The only other tested alternative:  9. Qb3 The secondary move in the database. 9... a5 10.Ng5 a4 11. Nxe6 axb3 12. Nxd8 Rxd8 13. c5 dxc5 14. dxc5 Nc8 15. Bc4 bxa2 16. Rxa2 Rxa2 17. Bxa2 e6 18. Ke2 Ne7 Black is fine here with the idea of g5 to chip away at the pawn structure.  9.Qb3 a5 10. a4 Na6 11. Be2 d5 12. c5 Nc4 Is dynamic for both sides. }
9... dxe5
{ The position is equal, and interesting sidelines. An alternative seen multiple times in practice is  9... c5 }
10. dxe5 Nc6 11. Ne4 f6
{ Fighting for some much needed breathing room for the Dark Squared Bishop. }
12. Nc5 Qc8 13. exf6 Bxf6 14. Be2 Rd8 15. Qc1 Bf5 16. O-O Nd7 17. Nd3 Bxa1 18.
Qxa1 Nf6 19. Nde5 Nxe5 20. Nxe5
{ A potential attempt:  White should try 20. fxe5 Nh5 21. Qc3 c5 } 20... Qe6
{ Interesting is  20... Bg4 21. Nxg4 Nxg4 } 21. Bd4 Nd7 22. h3 Nxe5 23. Bxe5 c6
{ A bit more to the point is  23... Qb6 24. Kh1 Rd7 } 24. Qc3 h5
{ Keeping an eye on the g4 square limiting counterplay. } 25. Re1 Kf7 26. Qg3
Rd2 27. Bf3 Rd3 28. Qg5 Rad8 29. Kf2 Rd2+ 30. Kg3 R8d3 31. Qh6 Bxh3
{ Breaking the back of White in the position. } 32. Kh4 Rxg2
{ White has had enough. } *
