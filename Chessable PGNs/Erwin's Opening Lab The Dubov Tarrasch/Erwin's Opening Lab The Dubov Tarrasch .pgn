[Result "*"]

{ Welcome to my very first course for Chessable! Having discovered this website only recently I have become completely hooked. Therefore, I thought I should add something to the community by making my own course. The course at hand deals with a recent trend in opening theory. Russian Grandmaster Daniil Dubov, who became rapid world champion in 2018, has recently introduced a brand new way of playing the Tarrasch Defence. After the following moves: }
1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. g3 Nf6 7. Bg2
{ rather than playing the usual  7...Be7  , as played by World Champions like Spassky and Kasparov, Dubov plays as follows: }
7... cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bc5
{ It is rare these days to discover a fresh line as early as move 8! Of course the line we are discussing is not new. Illustrious names such as Schlechter, Teichmann and Marshall employed this variation, the latter even on numerous occasions. However, it is Dubov who has given the line a real boost and he is the first modern top player to employ this variation. His 'improvement' over the main lines in the Tarrasch Defence immediately grabbed my attention and in this course I intend to show you the main ideas behind this variation. I have separated the material into 7 parts:  Part 1: Introduction    Part 2: Defending the Knight -  9.e3   and  9.Be3    Part 3: Hanging Pawns -  9.Nxc6    Part 4: A Pawn Sacrifice -  9.Nb3  Bb6  10.Nxd5    Part 5: Pushing the h-pawn -  9.Nb3  Bb6  10.Na4    Part 6: The Big Test -  9.Nb3  Bb6  10.O-O   Part 7: Final Thoughts I hope you will enjoy this course as much as I did when preparing the material! }

Nxd4 Bc5
{ Compared to the traditional main lines of the Tarrasch Defence, starting with 7...Be7, we see that White is immediately being challenged here. The d4-knight is attacked and the big question of this variation is how to deal with that. White can exchange knights on c6, move it to b3 or simply protect the knight. Each course of action leads to vastly different type of play. In this chapter we will see what happens if White defends the knight on d4. }
9. e3
{ This is very passive and in particular makes the bishop on c1 very unhappy! }
9... O-O
{ We don't need to analyze this further. Black's development is running smoothly, and note that Bc8-g4 is already awkward for White to meet! }

Nxd4 Bc5 9. Nxc6
{ This move is the topic of the following few lines. Rather than defending the d4-knight, White radically changes the nature of the position, saddling Black with the so-called hanging pawn center. On the one hand, this gives Black some comfort, as the d5-pawn is no longer a weakness, but White has a clear strategic aim in mind. By going Na4 in the future, he plans to control the d4/c5 squares and install his light pieces there. This could cause Black to fall into a terrible bind. It is no surprise that Hikaru Nakamura, after carefully studying this variation, decided to play this way against Daniil Dubov. That game will be the cornerstone of the following variations. }

{ I like this active solution, but opinions differ at this point!     -  12...Re8  was seen in Smyslov-Keres during the candidates tournament of 1956. Following  13.Nxb6  Qxb6  14.Be3  Black, for better or worse, should have given the exchange, because after the game continuation  14...Qb5  White has a dream position.     - The more recent example Rodshtein-Dubov, Netanya 2019, saw  12...Bd7  but here  13.Nxb6  axb6  14.a4!?  looks interesting -   note that  14.b4?!  Qe7!  is the wrong move order here.  White intends to follow up with b2-b4 and obtain a favorable version of the line 11. Na4 Bb6 12. Nxb6, which we will be seeing next. All in all, I think there is good reason to deviate from these games, with 12... Ba6. }

{ The critical position of the entire line which, remarkably has not been seen in high level practice. As we have seen previously, all of Dubov's opponents chose different paths. I don't like opening books/courses that are unrealistic about the prospects one faces when playing a certain opening. So let me start by being brutally honest here: we can't hope for more than a draw in this line. However, in modern times, if White is well prepared it is in general hard to hope for more. After all, having the right to move first still has some meaning! As you will see though, I believe that here too Black should be alright. }
17... Qd8
{ I spent considerable time on  17...Qxd4  18.Nxd4  Bb7  when Black is very close to simply forcing a draw in the endgame. White has to be very precise in order to keep the game alive.  19.Nf3!  is the issue I didn't manage to solve. Following  19...c5  20.Kf1  transitioning into a rook ending with  20...Bxf3  21.exf3  is surely not an easy draw, if it is one at all! But if not for 20... Bxf3, White will slowly strengthen his position and try to make the extra pawn count. }

{ For advanced players, I will be looking at the current position in more depth over the next few chapters. For most of the readers though, I am sure that getting to this position and having a good idea of what to do next is more then enough ! For now Black is a pawn down, but his bishop is surely superior to White's knight, that for the moment is stranded on b3. Note that White's king is far more vulnerable with the light squares around it severely weakened. After White protects his a2-pawn on the next move, our plan is pretty straightforward. Black starts by provoking weaknesses, which he can do by means of Ba6 and doubling rooks on the e-file. Having provoked White's e- and f-pawn forward Black will place additional pressure on them, sometimes by means of f7-f5 or g7-g5, depending on the position at hand. For White, in the meantime, it's very hard to disentangle and it's no surprise that the position is generally considered very playable for Black. }

Nxd4 Qb6
{ We now know, over 100 years later, that   8...Bc5  is the right move, developing the bishop and simultaneously pressuring the knight. In this game we see what happens if Black plays this opening line inaccurately. }
9. Nxc6
{ 9.Be3  Qxb2  10.Ndb5 !  is very dangerous,   but  9.Be3  Bc5  simply transposes into lines 3 and 4 which we have seen before. }
9... bxc6 10. O-O
{ Possibly even stronger is the subtle   10.Qc2 !?  with the idea  10...Be7  11.Be3 !  as b2 is now protected and  11...d4  12.Bxd4 !  loses material. That means Black should move the queen on move 11, allowing White to gain complete control over the squares d4 and c5. }
10... Be7
{ The typical push   10...h5  comes way too early here, and as so often this attack on the flank is well met in the centre with  11.e4 ! }
11. Na4
{ The computer initially believes   11.e4  dxe4  12.Be3  to be the right way forward, but after the crude  12...Qxb2 !  13.Nxe4  O-O  14.Bd4  Qa3  15.Nxf6+  Bxf6  16.Bxf6  gxf6  White's structural advantage is only of a symbolic nature. }
11... Qb5 12. Be3 O-O 13. Rc1 Bg4
{ A good attempt to create some weaknesses. Instead   13...Bf5  14.Bc5  Rfe8  15.Bxe7  Rxe7  16.e3  would give White an easy advantage. }
14. f3
{ A move White really doesn't want to make. Better is   14.Re1  preparing Qc2, Bd4 and e3, while keeping the pawn on f2. Perhaps  14...Bb4  is what bothered Rubinstein, but here  15.Nc3  Bxc3  16.Rxc3 !  Qxb2  17.Rxc6  Qxa2  White has the important point  18.Rxf6 !  gxf6  19.Qd4 !!  when Black suddenly faces a mating attack. For instance  19...Be6  20.Qxf6  and there is no stopping Bd4/Bh6 followed by mate. }
14... Be6
{ I like the further provocation   14...Bf5 !?  and after  15.g4  ,  yet another provocation, to retreat all the way with  15...Bc8.  The bishop will reroute to a6, from where it pressures the e2-pawn. Black is in perfect shape here ! The game continuation is very passive. }
15. Bc5
{ Generally a desirable exchange. Getting the dark-squares bishops off the board makes the squares d4 and c5 weaker. }
15... Rfe8 16. Rf2
{ A very pretty move, vacating the f1-square for the bishop and preparing e2-e3 followed by Rfc2. }
16... Nd7 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. Qd4
{ A critical moment, and one very instructive for the Dubov Tarrasch. Given time, White will play e2-e3, Bg2-f1, Rf2-c2 with very serious pressure. As so often in this line, Black has to aim for active counterplay ! }
18... Ree8
{ And this is not it ! I hope the move   18...h5 !?  already comes naturally by now. Here both  19.Bf1   19.e3  Bf5  20.Bf1  Qb7  21.Nc5  Nxc5  22.Qxc5  Rae8  23.Qxc6  Qxc6  24.Rxc6  Rxe3  with an equal endgame, and  19...Qb7   19...Bf5  20.e4 !  20.e3  Rae8  21.b4  Bf5  are not clear at all. True, c6 is a weak pawn, but so is e3 ! I would probably prefer White here, after, say  22.Rc3  but the computer is not at all convinced, and as usual, may be right ! A sample line is  22...Re6   22...Ne5  23.Nc5  Qc8  also doesn't look clear.  23.Nc5  Nxc5  24.Qxc5  Rf6  when it's not easy for White to up the pressure against c6. }
19. Bf1 Rec8 { Again, way too passive ! } 20. e3 Qb7 21. Nc5 Nxc5 22. Rxc5
{ Now the suffering starts. White is in total control. Do observe the difference in the lines examined on move 18. Here Black is devoid of any counterplay. }
22... Rc7
{ Again not the most accurate. It was important to stop White from fixing the queenside with b2-b4. A must was therefore   22...a5 ! }
23. Rfc2 { Not bad, but   23.b4 !  would have punished Black's indiscretion. }
23... Qb6 { Once again,   23...a5  was the move. } 24. b4
{ Now the bind is complete. } 24... a6
{ This pawn was much less vulnerable on a7, but Black had to reckon with the threat of b4-b5 as well. }
25. Ra5
{ Perhaps I am being overly critical at this point, but as White I would have strengthened my position further before making this move. For instance   25.Bd3  Rb7  26.a3  Bd7   26...Rc7  27.Rxd5 !  loses on the spot and   26...Rc8  27.Kf2  h6  28.h4 !?  and Ra5 next is just winning, under these improved circumstances.  27.Kf2  h6  and now, apart from Ra5, there is the option of going  28.e4 !?  The important point to make here is that in a position of this nature, where White is in total control, it is vital to improve the position to the maximum, before trying to strike.  Last but not least it is worth mentioning that immediately 'cashing in' with   25.Rxd5   - with the idea  25.Rxd5  Qxd4  26.Rxd4  -  actually only makes matters messy after  25...cxd5  26.Qxb6  Rxc2  with unclear play. }
25... Rb8
{ It is hard to give a definite assesment but I feel   25...Qxd4  26.exd4  Rb7 !  27.a3  Rb6  followed by bringing the king over to d6, would offer Black very serious drawing chances, hence my criticism on move 25. After the game continuation, Black is no longer able to liquidate into this endgame and is just lost. }
26. a3
{ Excellent technique. Rubinstein likely hardly spent time on   26.Qxb6  Rxb6  27.Rxa6  Rxb4  28.Ra8+ !   28.Raxc6  Rxc6  29.Rxc6  Rb1 !  28...Rc8  29.Rxc8+  Bxc8  30.Rxc6  Be6  with a clearly better endgame but still far from winning. The game continuation is much better. }
26... Ra7 27. Rxc6
{ 'Chess is 99% tactics !' A pawn up, Rubinstein easily converted. } 27... Qxc6
28. Qxa7 Ra8 29. Qc5 Qb7 30. Kf2 h5 31. Be2 g6 32. Qd6 Qc8 33. Rc5
{ 33.Rxa6  also wouldn't have been bad. } 33... Qb7 34. h4 a5 35. Rc7 Qb8 36.
b5 a4 37. b6 Ra5 38. b7

{ For better or worse, Keres should have opted for   14...Rxe3  15.fxe3  Qxe3+  16.Kh1  Bd7  though the compensation is a bit sketchy. In the game Black is even worse off compared to the Rubinstein-Salwe game we saw previously. }
15. Rac1
{ This move is about as natural as can be, but perhaps the more forceful   15.a4 !  Qb7  16.a5 !  threatening to fix the pawn on a7, is even stronger. }
15... Bg4
{ 15...Bd7  16.Rfe1 !  followed by Bd4 and e2-e3 also doesn't solve Black's issues; they are of a structural nature. }
16. Rfe1 Re6 17. a4
{ The right move, but played for the wrong reason ! A good alternative is   17.Qd2  ,  preparing Rc5 next. Hitting the queen with  17...Ne4  is met with  18.Qd3  forcing the exchange of queens into a very favorable endgame. }
17... Qa6 18. h3
{ Smyslov starts losing the thread. Very strong is   18.b4  Rae8  19.Bf1  h6  20.Bd4  with a huge advantage, as  20...Bxe2  runs into  21.b5 ! }

19... Rb8 20. Bf1
{ Preparing to remove the bishop from e3 to d4 is natural, but objectively speaking, starting from 18. h3, Black has been allowed back in the game. Better chances for an advantage gave   20.g4  Bg6  21.Qc5 !  because trading the a-pawn for the b-pawn would be an excellent deal for White. }
20... Qb7 { 20...Ne4 !  21.Bd4  Bg6  was begging to be played. } 21. Bd4
{ In the tournament book, this is given as the final move of the game. Smyslov offered a draw and Keres accepted. I think Smyslov sensed he had let his advantage slip and decided to call it a day. As we have seen in the Rubinstein game, as well as this one, two World class players had trouble making something of their positional advantage and it just goes to show that even when the Dubov Tarrasch goes wrong, there are still plenty of resources. The key for Black is to always seek active counterplay ! Because other sources have the game continue, just in case, so will we. }
21... Qxb3
{ Also here   21...Ne4 !  was the right way forward. Note that because of the little move h2-h3, it becomes much harder for White to expel the knight from e4. After all, f2-f3 now leaves the g-pawn hanging. }
22. Qxb3 Rxb3 23. Bxa7
{ This trade is very favorable for White. The passed a-pawn is a monster ! }
23... Ra3 24. Ra1 Rxa1 25. Rxa1 Bxe2 26. a5
{ And we are to believe that Smyslov instead offered a draw at this point. Rather unlikely as he has a winning advantage. Endgame specialist as Smyslov was, he would certainly realize that! For completeness' sake,   26.Bxe2  Rxe2  27.Be3!  would have been even stronger,  but the game continuation also gives White a huge advantage. A sample line is   26.a5  Bxf1  27.Kxf1  Re8  28.a6  Nd7  29.Rb1 !  Rd8  30.Rb7  Kf8  31.Rc7   31.Rxd7 !?  Rxd7  32.Bb8  should also do.  31...Ke8  32.Rxc6  with a technical win. In such endgames the bishop is clearly superior to the knight as he can work on the entire board. The knight, on the contrary, always has a tough time stopping an outside passed pawn.  For me the key moments in this game are between move 15 and 20. In it, Smyslov loses his entire advantage, and understanding just why that happened brings us a great deal forward. We stand on the shoulders of giants ! }

For completeness sake I repeat the lines here:  20.Be4  Qc8  21.Rxc5   21.Qh5  looks scary at first, but Black can just ignore everything and play  Rxc3  22.bxc3  Qxc3  23.Qxh7+  Kf8  when the d-pawn will go to d2 next move and Black's king is far from getting mated.  21...bxc5  22.Nxe6  Qxe6  23.Bxd3  And again   23.Qh5  is not too scary. Black simply plays  Rd8  24.Qxh7+  Kf8  and the d-pawn will have the last word. 23. Bxd3 looks strong though. Hasn't White just won a pawn ?  23...Rd8  24.Bxh7+  Kxh7  25.Qxd8  Nf3+  26.Kg2  Nh4+  27.gxh4   27.Kh1  Qe4+  28.f3  Nxf3  doesn't alter the evaluation.  27...Qg4+  28.Kh1  Qf3+  29.Kg1  Qg4+  With a draw by perpetual check. This would have been a very elegant solution to the opening problem posed by Nakamura. }
20. bxc3 Qc7
{ Also possible is   20...Qe7 !?  with the idea that  21.f4  Bg4  22.Qd2  Nc4  23.Qxd3  Nb2  24.Qd2  Qxe3+  25.Qxe3  Rxe3  26.Nb5  Na4  27.Rc1  Bd7  is a very drawish endgame. }
21. Qd2 Bd7 22. Re1
{ 22.Be4  Qc5 !  attacks a3 and prevents  23.Bxd3  as  Qxd4 !  wins material with a knight fork on f3. White should therefor try 23. Bxb7 with messy play. }
22... Rc8 23. Rc1 Qc5 24. f4
{ Nakamura was unable to find the right setup and felt it time to pull the break ! An example of how things can escalate is   24.Bxb7  Rc7  25.Bg2  Qxa3  threatening Ne5-c4, as c1 is hanging, hence d3 taboo. }
24... Nc4 25. Qxd3 Qxa3 26. Rb1 Nd6 27. Ne2
{ Somewhat inaccurate. The straightforward   27.Rb3  Qa1+  28.Rb1  Qa3  29.Rb3  would have been a logical repetition. }
27... Bf5
{ This lets Hikaru off the hook. Black could have pushed a bit, starting with   27...Bg4 !  when  28.Rxb6   28.h3  Bxe2  29.Qxe2  Rxc3  looks dangerous but White may get away after  30.Qb2  .  28...Bxe2  29.Qxd6  Qc1+  30.Kf2  Qc2 !  is an important point. White is suddenly getting mated, following Rc8-a8 next move. }
28. e4
{ And White's draw offer was agreed. The big difference is that after   28.e4  Bg4  White can now respond with  29.Bf3  . With extravagant play Dubov made a smooth draw against one of the best players on the planet. }

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 c5 3. g3 e6 4. Nf3 d5 5. cxd5 exd5 6. d4
{ One of many move orders trough which the Dubov Tarrasch can be reached. }
6... Nc6
{ This particular move order gives Black the extra opportunity to postpone Nc6 and play   6...cxd4  7.Nxd4  Bc5  straight away, but it's not obvious this achieves anything. On the contrary  8.Be3  may now gain in strength as  Qb6  9.a3 !  stopping Qxb2 and threatening Na4, is a worse version of the common lines. }
7. Bg2 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bc5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Qc2
{ Or   10.O-O  O-O  11.Qc2  Bb6  12.Na4  transposing to the game. } 10... O-O
11. O-O Bb6 12. Na4 Bd7
{ 12...Ba6  is the move I recommend, since the game continuation gives White a good chance for an advantage. }
13. b3
{ Natural but likely not best. The odd looking   13.Nxb6  axb6  14.a4 !  was White's best bet,  not   14.b4  Qe7 !  which makes White lose time protecting the b-pawn.  Now  14...Re8   14...Qe7  15.Be3 !  c5  and here both  16.a5  and   16.Bg5  look strong.  15.b4  Qe7  16.Be3 !  with the idea  Qxb4  17.Rfb1 !  gives White a pleasant edge. }
13... Re8 14. Bb2 h5
{ There he is again ! White seemingly has things under control but lacks a clear plan. c6 is well defended and Black's pieces are all actively placed. With his last move Black indicates an offensive on the kingside. }
15. e3
{ It's always a tough question how to reply to the pawn push to h5. The move   15.h4  weakens White's kingside structure considerable and following  Ne4  it's easy to imagine sacrifices on f2 and g3 in the future.   15.h3  Ne4  16.e3  Qg5  is another sample line illustrating just how fast Black's initiative on the kingside can grow with every move. }
15... h4 16. Nxb6 axb6 17. Qc3 Rc8
{ The start of a phase in the game that Dubov plays inaccurately. To start with   17...Qc8 !  was an excellent move. Black plans to operate on the light squares and next moves will be Bd7-h3/g4, Qc8-f5, h4-h3 -in random order- with a strong initiative. }
18. Rad1
{ My greedy computer wants to grab the pawn with   18.gxh4  but that is a tough decision to make. In any case, after  Re6 !  followed by Ne8/h5, the rook will be switched to the kingside and Qxh4 will be threatened. Its obvious that Black has great compensation. }
18... hxg3
{ But this is a serious error ! It was essential to keep the pawn on the board with   18...h3  19.Bh1  Bf5  preparing operations over the white squares. Here  20.Rd4  Qd7  21.Rfd1  Qe6  22.Rh4  Rcd8  23.b4  Be4  24.Bxe4  dxe4  25.Qc2  Nh7 !  is a sample line that illustrates in what danger White is in. Ng5 now follows with great force. Keep this line in mind ! }
19. fxg3
{ A mistake in return !   19.hxg3  would have given White the better game. Without the h-pawns on the board White's king is much safer and if Black continues in the same fashion as in the notes to move 18:  Bf5  20.Rd4  Qd7  21.Rfd1  Qe6  22.Rh4  Rcd8  23.b4  Be4  The difference is evident. Simply  24.a4  gives White an already overwhelming advantage. Comparing the two lines gives on move 18 and 19 show the strength of the Black h-pawn ! }
19... Re6 20. e4 Qf8
{ Excellent regrouping, now e8 is available for the c8-rook. } 21. Rf4 Rce8 22.
exd5 Nxd5 23. Bxd5 cxd5 24. Rdf1 f6
{ Quite the transformation has occurred over the past few moves with White's light squared bishop being exchanged on d5. What results is a typical position with opposite-colored bishops. As a rule, the attacker has the advantage in opposite-colored bishop positions as he has essentially an 'extra' piece to work with. With the move f7-f6 Black has successfully shut down the bishop on b2. On the other hand, the now not yet very impressive looking bishop on d7 does have clear diagonals towards the White king. That, combined with Blacks control over the e-file make this position difficult for White. }
25. Qd3 Qf7 26. Bd4
{ 26.Qxd5  Bc6 !  wins a pawn but opens the long diagonal. That is something White should avoid at all cost. }
26... b5 { Useful, as it stops any expansion on the queenside with a2-a4. } 27.
g4 { This, and White's next move are aimed at restricting the enemy bishop. }
27... Re4 28. h3 Qe6 29. R4f2 b4 30. Rd1 Qd6 31. Kg2 Bc8
{ I like   31...R8e6  32.Qg3  Qe7  setting up the so called Alekhine's gun  (queen placed behind two rooks)  so named after Alekhine's impressive victory versus Nimzowich in San Remo 1930. With this setup in place, Black prepares the infiltration of White's position over the e-file. }
32. Qg3 Qe6
{ Of course   32...Qxg3+  33.Kxg3  would be a bad decision, giving up all attacking chances. }
33. Kh2 Re2 34. Rg1
{ 34.Rd2 !?  safer, completing an excellent job of keeping the position together. }
34... Qe4 35. Rxe2 Qxe2+ 36. Qg2
{ Now things go downhill fast. The unnatural   36.Rg2  Qd1  37.Bg1 !  was called for, as  d4  38.g5 !  gives White counterplay, just in time ! }
36... Qd3 37. Qxd5+
{ Perhaps White could have held on with   37.Bf2  Re2  38.Re1  as the engine indicates, but it's not that relevant. It's obvious White is under huge pressure following  Rc2  . }
37... Be6 { The monster has woken up and that signals the end of the game. }
38. Qc6 Bf7 39. Bf2 Re2 40. Qc5 Rc2 41. Qb6 Qf3 42. Rf1 Kh7
{ and before the bishop would appear on d5, White resigned. A very complicated struggle that revolved around the push of the h-pawn and the white square strategy so often used by Black in the Dubov Tarrasch. }

{ Correspondence games have always been the golden standard of chess games. Here the players have the luxury of consulting books, databases and, most importantly, the engine. Combine that with the playing tempo, which assures players can spend a couple of days on each move, and you have the highest level of chess games you can find. In recent years top OTB players have taken a keen interest in these games, as often new opening ideas are revealed. Our 5th and final model game covers a correspondence game. }

{ The most critical test, as seen in the theoretical section. If you want to refresh your memory on the ins and outs of the first 21 moves -that I have left without comments- I would refer you there. }
21... Rad8
{ 21...Re7  22.Qd2  Rae8  our go to plan of doubling on the e-file, is less appropriate here as after  23.e4  Black is unable to switch to the d-file. }
22. Qc2 Qe5
{ Centralizing the queen and provoking e2-e4 as the queen is threatening to nestle on e3. }
23. e4 Qe6
{ I prefer the forcing nature of   23...f5 !?  which, as I hope you will recall, leads to a fine endgame after a series of forced moves.  Note that an attempt to gain control of the d-file with   23...Rd4  24.Ne2  Bxe2  25.Rxe2  Red8  is neutralized after  26.Red2  . }
24. a3 g5 25. g4
{ In the line   25.Ne2  Bc4  26.Rxd8  Rxd8  27.Rd1  Rxd1+  28.Qxd1  Qf6  29.Qc2  Bxe2  30.Qxe2  Qd4+  31.Kg2  h5  we see the difference between correspondence and over the board chess. The engine claims this is all well within the drawing margin, with Stockfish even proclaiming the famous triple zero's. Undoubtedly, the computer is right and will make a draw here effortlessly. Indeed the Black queen is active and its very hard for White to make progress. For over the board players though, this position is a bit different. There is no way for Black to force a draw here, and White can continue playing 'forever' starting with  32.h4  gxh4  33.gxh4  . White will shuffle his queen and king around and in a practical game, it's going to be not so easy to hold. Humans, get tired, and make mistakes. It is this endgame that made me recommend the move 23... f5. }
25... Qf6 26. Qf2
{ 26.Kg2  would be boldly met with  h5 !  27.gxh5  g4  28.fxg4  Rxd1  29.Rxd1  Bb7 !  and just like in the Rodshtein-Dubov game, the monster has awoken ! }
26... Kg7 27. Na2
{ 27.Kg2  Rh8 !  28.Na2  h5  is similar to the note on move 26, Black violently cracks open the kingside.  29.gxh5  Rde8 !?  Now that the positions opens, it makes sense to keep an extra set of rooks on.  30.Nc3  Rxh5  31.Nd5  Qe5  with fine play for the pawn. }
27... Bc4 28. Nc3 Bb3 29. Rxd8
{ 29.Rxd8  And the players agreed a draw. Indeed after, say  Rxd8  30.Kg2  Rd4  31.e5  Qd8  32.Re4  Rd2  33.Re2  Rd3  it's hard to make anything of the extra pawn. If the knight moves with  34.Ne4  Black immediately goes  Bd5 !  pressuring on the long diagonal. A very high level game that shows Black does not need to hurry in order to prove compensation for the pawn. Playing healthy, active moves Black easily held the balance. In general I would always advise the reader to look up games from correspondence players when analyzing a new opening variation ! }
