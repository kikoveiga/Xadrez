1. e4 {Hello and welcome to this course on The Sicilian Dragon, one of the most 
popular variations of the Sicilian defense! At some point, every Sicilian player 
tries their hand at playing the Dragon. Why is the Dragon Sicilian so popular? 
Besides being a very aggressive opening with lots of opportunity for sharp tactics, 
it is a relatively easy to play system with clear attacking plans and ideas for the 
Black Player. The modern form of the Dragon was originated by German master Louis 
Paulsen around 1880. It was played frequently by Henry Bird that decade and was 
eventually recognized around 1900 when it started being employed by Harry Nelson 
Pillsbury and other masters. So, why is it called The Dragon and who thought of the 
name? The earliest known printed reference, found by chess historian Edward Winter, 
is in the Jan-Feb 1914 issue of Wiener Schachzeitung. Russian chess master Fyodor 
Dus-Chotimirsky claims in his 1953 autobiography that he coined the term 'Dragon 
Variation' in 1901. He thought Black's pawn structure resembled the star 
constellation Draco. Pretty cool huh? Let's look at a few interesting historical 
games to get a feel for the opening before we dive into the depths of theory.} c5 2.

is going to castle on the Kingside and put pressure on the centre (pawn on e7.) • 
Black cannot play ... d5 after Bc4, so he will elect to play on the Queenside. 
*White's Ideas:* • f4, f5 and opening the f-file in order to be attack the pawn on 
f7 with the Rook on f1 and the Bishop on c4. • Re1, Nd5: and after the Knight gets 
exchanged, the pawn on e7 will be under pressure. *Black's Ideas:* • ... Rc8, ... 
Ne5 followed by ... Nc4. - ... Na5, ... Nxb3 in order to get rid of the light-squared 
Bishop. • After White pushes f5, e5 becomes a nice square for the Knight on f6 (... 
Nd7 followed by ... Ne5.) • ... b5!? ... especially when f4 has been played and the 
White King is located on g1.} *

is going to focus on the centre and the Kingside. • Black needs to defend against 
an early e5 advance, while looking to create counter-play on the Queenside later in 
the game. *White's Ideas:* • An e5 advance, if Black does not pay enough attention. 
• f5: In order to open the f-file. • A Qf3 idea, combined with castling Queenside 
and then build an attack on the Kingside: g4, h4. *Black's Ideas:* • Preventing an 
early e5 advance by with an early ... Nbd7 and ... Qc7 if it's necessary. • If 
White pushes f5, then the e5-square will become a good outpost for our Knights. • 
... Rc8 combined with an ... Nc4 idea, also works well here as well.} *
