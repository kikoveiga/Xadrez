{ Welcome to 'The London System: Essential Theory'!  In this course, we provide a practical and complete  (yet concise)  repertoire for white based on the London System. We believe our chosen lines are interesting, sound and tricky for black to meet. Our desire was to turn this into a proper 'course', rather than a mere theoretical work - that's why we've included lucid and insightful video coverage, 10 model games and 30 tactics based on the repertoire. To guide you along the way we have included brief chapter introductions so you understand how the lines covered relate to the bigger picture.    As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations - for example 1... Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 and 1... Nf6 2. Bf4 c5.    The London System was previously regarded as a relatively harmless alternative to 1.d4 main lines, but its use in recent years by Magnus Carlsen and other top-flight Grandmasters has elevated it to main-line status. High-level encounters over the past several years demonstrate that black cannot expect to equalize by tossing out 'normal' moves in reply.   We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of transpositions which get to the same position, we had to choose which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section.   Our last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would recommend the London to newer players who have already gained some initial experience with the open games 1.e4  (critical to any aspiring player's development)  , and stronger players who seek a reliable strategic line that still packs a punch.  We wish you all the best in your London System endeavours!  John & Daniel }

1. --
{ In this chapter, we deal with lines were black meets our 1.d4 with 1...d5, but does not follow up at any point with ...c5. This is not the most critical challenge to our London, however it is quite popular and it is important to know how to deal with these lines. We decided not to go for the maximalist approach in this chapter - instead, we aim for a small, comfortable edge against sidelines while cutting down on the amount of theory that you need to know. As a result you can devote more effort to learning responses to black's most challenging tries, where good theoretical knowledge pays dividends. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves:   1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4.   2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer.   3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course.   4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use.   As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  .   We believe the variations that we've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful.   Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier.   1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop.   2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks.   3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. We will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis.   4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play.   5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack.   
The London System was previously regarded as a relatively harmless alternative to 1.d4 main lines, but its use in recent years by Magnus Carlsen and other top-flight Grandmasters has elevated it to main-line status.

1... d5
{ ...d5 is black's most classical response to the Closed Games. Black makes no attempt to unbalance the game right out of the gate but rather prefers to play solid and safe chess. ... d5 is a bit more commital than the super-flexible ... Nf6, but it does have a few exclusive openings that are unique to ...d5, such as the Queen's Gambit Accepted   note that the QGA is only possible after  2.c4  , which is not covered here  . 1... d5 is black's second most common retort to 1. d4 after 1... Nf6. We have divided the ...d5 chapters into two: those variations/setups with ...c5 and those without. We thought this was the simplest way to divide the content as there are a vast array of different move orders that black can utilise. Transpositions are rife in the London, especially after 1... d5, so please be aware of this. We decided to cover black's ...c5 setups after 2... c5, although he can reach the same positions by playing ...Nf6, ...e6 first etc. If black doesn't opt for ...c5, he can choose between ...Bf5 ideas or Chigorin plans  (involving ...Nc6)  . Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and .. .c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }
2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2. Bf4 move order as it is often beneficial for white to delay developing the kingside knight. Note that white's most popular move here is of course the Queen's Gambit 2. c4, which should objectively challenge black more but it also requires greater theoretical knowledge. }
2... Nc6
{ This move signifies the beginning of black's Chigorin defence. Although the Chigorin is typically employed against 2. c4, sometimes black decides to use the same setup against the London. We don't believe it is that effective and the knight might actually be a bit misplaced on c6. The knight attempts to put pressure on d4 and possibly support a future ...e5 lever, but the London seems to combat both of these things. By not playing c4  (not playing it early, at least)  black gets no counterplay against d4 because black's pawn on d5 blocks the queen. Additionally, the bishop on f4 does well to control the e5 square. }
3. e3
{ After reading the comment to the previous move, it should come as no surprise that we recommend avoiding c4 for quite some time. e3 is a solid, flexible move which protects d4 and allows white to complete his development. }
3... Nf6 4. Nf3 { White just wants to get his king to safety now. } 4... Bg4
{ A nice, active square for the bishop. The pin is a little bit unpleasant for white. }
5. Nbd2
{ White continues to develop without hamstringing any future plans with the c-pawn. Of course, the knight is misplaced on c3  (because it blocks the c-pawn)  , so it rather goes to d2. }
5... e6 6. h3
{ No harm in pushing the black bishop back while making space for our dark bishop on h2. }
6... Bh5 7. c3
{ c3 is played to take away the b4-square from the knight on c6...Nb4 could be a bit unpleasant when we go Bd3. }
7... Bd6 { Black offers the exchange of dark bishops. } 8. Bd3
{ The best square for our light bishop, but notice how we meet ...Bd6 in this case. Instead of Bg3 or Bxd6, we keep the bishop on f4 with no fear of ...Bxf4. Let's briefly discuss the structure after ...Bxf4 exf4. The doubled f-pawns provide white with complete control over the e5 outpost as well as the semi-open e-file for one of white's rooks. In the future, white can play the f5 break to open up the e-file. The downside is that the f4 pawn is slightly weakened and could be targeted by black in the future. All in all though, this structure should be quite favourable to white. }

2... e6
{ This plan hardly seems threatening, but it is reasonably popular. Black seeks total equality by exchanging the dark-squared bishops with ...Bd6. While this is could never be a 'refutation' of white's system, we should take care to avoid ending up in a dry, lifeless position. }
3. e3 { There's nothing better here than simply preparing development. } 3...
Bd6
{ Black carries out his plan of trading off the dark bishop. The logic behind this is simple - white has already expended a tempo developing his bishop to f4 and will spend another tempo when the bishops are exchanged, whereas black will only spend one tempo. In effect, because black develops his queen when recapturing on d6, black has "gained" a tempo. But - black has made a major concession to gain that tempo. He has traded off his good, dark-squared bishop for our 'bad', London bishop. This leaves us with a classic good   f1  vs bad   c8  bishop situation, which is a key advantage in the ensuing middlegame. }
4. Bxd6
{ We mentioned in the introduction that dropping the bishop back to g3 is another option, but our preference here is just to take on d6 for concrete reasons. }
4... cxd6
{ By recapturing with the pawn, black uses the d6-pawn to fill the weaknesses on the dark-squares created by the exchange of bishops. }
5. c4
{ This undoubles black's d-pawns, but white develops his bishop  (since black is forced to take on c4)  and secures a small space advantage. }
5... dxc4
{ As mentioned before, this is forced - black can't allow cxd5 since that would leave him with double, isolated d-pawns. }
6. Bxc4 Nf6 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O
{ White has a small, but comfortable edge here in the form of a small space advantage and the good vs bad bishop situation. If black plays ...d5 at some point, the space advantage is neutralised, but his bishop becomes even worse and dark-squared weaknesses are created on c5 and e5. White should probably play on the queenside and down the c-file in this scenario. If black avoids/delays ...d5, white can possibly explore central play with e4. }

Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and .. .c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }
2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2. Bf4 move order as it is often beneficial for white to delay developing the kingside knight. Note that white's most popular move here is of course the Queen's Gambit 2. c4, which should objectively challenge black more but it also requires greater theoretical knowledge. }
2... e6

Bd6
{ Black carries out his plan of trading off the dark bishop. The logic behind this is simple - white has already expended a tempo developing his bishop to f4 and will spend another tempo when the bishops are exchanged, whereas black will only spend one tempo. In effect, because black develops his queen when recapturing on d6, black has "gained" a tempo. But - black has made a major concession to gain that tempo. He has traded off his good, dark-squared bishop for our 'bad', London bishop. This leaves us with a classic good   f1  vs bad   c8  bishop situation, which is a key advantage in the ensuing middlegame. }
4. Bxd6
{ We mentioned in the introduction that dropping the bishop back to g3 is another option, but our preference here is just to take on d6 for concrete reasons. }
4... Qxd6 5. Qg4
{ A nice way to take advantage of the exchanged dark bishop. Black is forced to make a concession, since he can't defend g7 in a comfortable way. }
5... Kf8
{ Protecting the pawn with .. .Kf8 of course has the downside of forfeiting any possible plans of castling later on. }
6. Nc3
{ The knight is a bit better placed on c3 than d2 in this case since white intends to long castle and not move the c-pawn. Since blocking the c-pawn in this line isn't important, the knight is better placed on c3 since it influences the centre more. }
6... Nf6 7. Qh4 c5 8. dxc5 Qxc5 9. O-O-O
{ White has a comfortable edge here. Black has difficulties developing his pieces and can't castle of course. White will be planning to develop naturally and take advantage of black's undeveloped position, possibly with the e4 break. Since black will probably be on the look out for that break, white can also try g4-g5 - this is a strong idea to displace the knight on f6 and gain space. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves:   1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4.   2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer.   3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course.   4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use.   As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  .   We believe the variations that we've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful.   Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier.   1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop.   2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks.   3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. We will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis.   4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play.   5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack.   
The London System was previously regarded as a relatively harmless alternative to 1.d4 main lines, but its use in recent years by Magnus Carlsen and other top-flight Grandmasters has elevated it to main-line status. High-level encounters over the past several years demonstrate that black cannot expect to equalize by tossing out 'normal' moves in reply. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. Our last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would recommend the London to newer players who have already gained some initial experience with the open games 1.e4  (critical to any aspiring player's development)  , and stronger players who seek a reliable strategic line that still packs a punch. }

Despite this, a number of top players  (most notably Magnus Carlsen)  have utilised it recently both as a surprise weapon and as a way to deviate from well-known paths. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. My last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would thoroughly recommend the London to newer players  (who want a simple opening which gets them a solid position - this allows them to focus on other aspects of chess)  and enthusiastic stronger players who need a solid, reliable backup weapon. }

2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2. Bf4 move order as it is often beneficial for white to delay developing the kingside knight. Note that white's most popular move here is of course the Queen's Gambit 2. c4, which should objectively challenge black more but it also requires greater theoretical knowledge. }
2... c6
{ This will probably be the choice of Slav players, but it doesn't have too much independent value since it will most likely transpose to another line soon, e.g. }
3. e3 Qb6
{ It is very rare to play ...Qb6 this early, but it isn't as bad as it looks. Black hits b2 before we can deal with it in a very comfortable way. }
4. Qc1
{ 4. b3 is the main alternative here and it generally leads to similar positions. White will play c4 there as well, and often c5 too. However after 4. b3 the light squared bishops often get traded on d3, which we'd rather avoid. }
4... Bf5 5. c4 e6 6. Nf3 { Natural development. } 6... Nf6 7. c5
{ Often this move can be a positional error, or at the very least double-edged due to black's counter-break ...e5. However, with black's queen already played to b6 and the extra tempi we gain after 7. c5, this continuation is definitely favourable for white and therefore it is white's most common plan in this 3... Qb6 line. Black's counterplay with ...e5 is quite difficult to organise here since white has that square so well covered, whereas we have a clearcut plan of b4-b5. }
7... Qd8 8. Nc3
{ White's next few natural, developing moves are quite interchangeable. } 8...
Be7 9. b4 O-O 10. Be2 Nbd7 11. h3
{ White has a comfortable slight edge here. We have a few plans at our disposal. The main one is of course the b5 queenside break, but this can often be combined with Nh4  (to pick up the bishop pair)  or Ne5  (putting the knight on an outpost)  . }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves:   1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4.   2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer.   3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course.   4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use.   As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  .   We believe the variations that we've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful.   Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier.   1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop.   2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks.   3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. We will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis.   4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play.   5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack.   
The London System was previously regarded as a relatively harmless alternative to 1.d4 main lines, but its use in recent years by Magnus Carlsen and other top-flight Grandmasters has elevated it to main-line status. High-level encounters over the past several years demonstrate that black cannot expect to equalize by tossing out 'normal' moves in reply. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. Our last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would recommend the London to newer players who have already gained some initial experience with the open games 1.e4  (critical to any aspiring player's development)  , and stronger players who seek a reliable strategic line that still packs a punch. }
1... d5
{ ...d5 is black's most classical response to the Closed Games. Black makes no attempt to unbalance the game right out of the gate but rather prefers to play solid and safe chess. ... d5 is a bit more commital than the super-flexible ... Nf6, but it does have a few exclusive openings that are unique to ...d5, such as the Queen's Gambit Accepted   note that the QGA is only possible after  2.c4  , which is not covered here  . 1... d5 is black's second most common retort to 1. d4 after 1... Nf6. We have divided the ...d5 chapters into two: those variations/setups with ...c5 and those without. We thought this was the simplest way to divide the content as there are a vast array of different move orders that black can utilise. Transpositions are rife in the London, especially after 1... d5, so please be aware of this. We decided to cover black's ...c5 setups after 2... c5, although he can reach the same positions by playing ...Nf6, ...e6 first etc. If black doesn't opt for ...c5, he can choose between ...Bf5 ideas or Chigorin plans  (involving ...Nc6)  .

2... Bf5
{ Even if this is hardly going to be the London's refutation, it is important to check what to do if black 'copies' white. 2... Bf5 is perfectly natural, as there doesn't seem to be a way to immediately exploit it. }
3. e3
{ Once again, delaying the development of the kingside knight is more flexible than 3. Nf3. }
3... e6 { Black continues to 'copy'. } 4. Bd3
{ Carlsen's choice when he played white in this position and we think it is white's best chance to unbalance the position. If black takes on d3, we can introduce a pawn structure imbalance  (or activate our queen)  , and if he retreats to g6 then we have developed our bishop to d3 with tempo. }
4... Bxd3
{ Black's most popular response is to simply take the bishop. If he retreats to g6, then white has developed with tempo and he can continue with Nf3  (possible Ne5 is an idea)  and O-O. }
5. Qxd3
{ An alternative recommendation given in the Short & Sweet London course. It is safer and simpler, but that also means it is safer and simpler for black. White threatens Qb5+ to win the b7-pawn. }
5... c6 { This is a natural move played to prevent the Qb5+ threat. } 6. Nd2
{ Maybe this is a slightly preferable move order to Nf3 first. White makes black think about an early e4 advance. }
6... Nf6 7. Ngf3
{ The position is close to equal, but white still retains a slight pull. To white's benefit is the fact that he is ahead in development and has the possibility of carrying out the e4 and c4 breaks at some point. It is also important to note that white should meet ... Bd6 with Bg5 - we want to keep pieces on the board. For a good model game on how to play this position, we recommend taking a look at how Carlsen beat Giri from this position in 2016. }

Transpositions are rife in the London, especially after 1... d5, so please be aware of this. We decided to cover black's ...c5 setups after 2... c5, although he can reach the same positions by playing ...Nf6, ...e6 first etc. If black doesn't opt for ...c5, he can choose between ...Bf5 ideas or Chigorin plans  (involving ...Nc6)  . Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and .. .c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }
2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2. Bf4 move order as it is often beneficial for white to delay developing the kingside knight. Note that white's most popular move here is of course the Queen's Gambit 2. c4, which should objectively challenge black more but it also requires greater theoretical knowledge. }
2... Bf5
{ Even if this is hardly going to be the London's refutation, it is important to check what to do if black 'copies' white. 2... Bf5 is perfectly natural, as there doesn't seem to be a way to immediately exploit it. }
3. e3
{ Once again, delaying the development of the kingside knight is more flexible than 3. Nf3. }
3... e6 { Black continues to 'copy'. } 4. Bd3
{ Carlsen's choice when he played white in this position and we think it is white's best chance to unbalance the position. If black takes on d3, we can introduce a pawn structure imbalance  (or activate our queen)  , and if he retreats to g6 then we have developed our bishop to d3 with tempo. }
4... Bxd3
{ Black's most popular response is to simply take the bishop. If he retreats to g6, then white has developed with tempo and he can continue with Nf3  (possible Ne5 is an idea)  and O-O. }
5. cxd3
{ In the Short & Sweet London course, the recommendation was 5. Qxd3 which is certainly a simpler choice. However, for this more advanced course, we put a focus on finding lines which give positions with some imbalances. Although both 5. Qxd3 and 5. cxd3 are roughly equal objectively, our main recommendation is 5. cxd3 since it introduces some interesting pawn structure imbalances. The doubled d-pawns allow white to play down the c-file or potentially launch a minority attack on the queenside. }
5... c5 6. dxc5
{ Naturally, allowing ...cxd4 is a mistake since it would leave us with doubled isolated pawns. }
6... Bxc5 7. Nf3
{ Natural development. Note that we stay as flexible as possible by keeping the pawn on d3. This way, the c4 and e4 squares  (which would otherwise be weak)  are covered and we have the extra possibility of playing the e4 break at some point. }
7... Nc6 8. O-O Nf6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Rc1 Be7 11. Qb3
{ The position is pretty much equal once again, but we once again have a slight preference for white. White's structure is slightly more flexible, which means that he has the e4 break available in the future. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves: 1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4. 2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer. 3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course. 4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use. As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  . We believe the variations that I've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful. Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier. 1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop. 2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks. 3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. I will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis. 4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play. 5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack. _______________________ The London System is not known for being a theoretical mainroad and therefore there tends to be less theory on it than many other openings. Despite this, a number of top players  (most notably Magnus Carlsen)  have utilised it recently both as a surprise weapon and as a way to deviate from well-known paths. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. My last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would thoroughly recommend the London to newer players  (who want a simple opening which gets them a solid position - this allows them to focus on other aspects of chess)  and enthusiastic stronger players who need a solid, reliable backup weapon. }

6. Qb3 { Hitting the b7 pawn. This is surprisingly unpleasant to deal with. }

{ ...b6 is a slight, but noticeable weakening of black's pawn structure on the queenside. We can take advantage of this by playing cxd5 - after ...exd5, c6 becomes weak and after cxd5 the light squares on the queenside become weak. }
7. c5 { The ensuing endgame is known to favour white. } 7... Qxb3 8. axb3 Nbd7
9. b4
{ This is a very typical pawn structure which is known to favour the side with doubled b-pawns. the b4-b5 plan suggests itself, and black has no time to prevent this with ... a6 due to the pressure on the a-file. }

The position is relatively close to level, but white is obviously slightly to be preferred due to his marginally more active pieces. This activity allows white to maintain a very slight, nagging pressure - the kind that Carlsen converts into full points on a daily basis. In the symmetrical structure after dxc5 or . ..cxd4, white should try to use his activity to pick up the bishop pair somehow - possibly by targeting the bishop on f5 with Nh4xg6. }

Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and ...c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }
2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2. Bf4 move order as it is often beneficial for white to delay developing the kingside knight. Note that white's most popular move here is of course the Queen's Gambit 2. c4, which should objectively challenge black more but it also requires greater theoretical knowledge. }
2... e6
{ This plan hardly seems threatening, but it is reasonably popular. Black seeks total equality by exchanging the dark-squared bishops with ...Bd6. While this is could never be a 'refutation' of white's system, we should take care to avoid ending up in a dry, lifeless position. }
3. e3 { There's nothing better here than simply preparing development. } 3...
Nf6 4. Nf3 Bd6
{ Offering the trade of dark bishops is a very solid option for black. } 5.
Nbd2
{ White has a plethora of options here: 5. Ne5, 5. Bg3, even 5. Bg5 and so on. After looking at these, it doesn't seem like white is getting anywhere objectively and the positions appear very balanced. 5. Nbd2 is still probably equal, but it offers white some more chances to unbalance the position. }
5... Bxf4
{ Black is bound to play this sooner or later. If he delays it and develops instead, we simply develop too. }
6. exf4
{ White's doubled f-pawns are a welcome addition to our position. The semi-open e-file together with the f5 break provide white with some nice dynamic possibilities here. }
6... O-O 7. g3 { Securing f4. } 7... b6
{ Preparing to either develop the bishop to b7 or exchange light bishops with ...Ba6. }
8. Rc1
{ A useful prophylactic move which discourages black from playing ...c5xd4, opening the c-file, since the rook is well-placed in that case. We are trying to delay the light bishop's development in order to save a tempo after black plays ...Ba6, so in the meantime Rc1 is the best 'improving move' white has at his disposal. }
8... c5 9. c3 Qd6 10. Ne5 Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. O-O
{ White is on the more comfortable side of a fairly equal position. The knight outpost and semi-open e-file give white some imbalances to play for a win. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves: 1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4. 2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer. 3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course. 4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use. As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  . We believe the variations that I've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful. Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier. 1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop. 2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks. 3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. I will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis. 4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play. 5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack. _______________________ The London System is not known for being a theoretical mainroad and therefore there tends to be less theory on it than many other openings. Despite this, a number of top players  (most notably Magnus Carlsen)  have utilised it recently both as a surprise weapon and as a way to deviate from well-known paths. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. My last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would thoroughly recommend the London to newer players  (who want a simple opening which gets them a solid position - this allows them to focus on other aspects of chess)  and enthusiastic stronger players who need a solid, reliable backup weapon. }
1... d5
{ ...d5 is black's most classical response to the Closed Games. Black makes no attempt to unbalance the game right out of the gate but rather prefers to play solid and safe chess. ... d5 is a bit more commital than the super-flexible ... Nf6, but it does have a few exclusive openings that are unique to ...d5, such as the Queen's Gambit Accepted   note that the QGA is only possible after  2.c4  , which is not covered here  . 1... d5 is black's second most common retort to 1. d4 after 1... Nf6. We have divided the ...d5 chapters into two: those variations/setups with ...c5 and those without. We thought this was the simplest way to divide the content as there are a vast array of different move orders that black can utilise. Transpositions are rife in the London, especially after 1... d5, so please be aware of this. I decided to cover black's ...c5 setups after 2... c5, although he can reach the same positions by playing ...Nf6, ...e6 first etc. If black doesn't opt for ...c5, he can choose between ...Bf5 ideas or Chigorin plans  (involving ...Nc6)  . Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and .. .c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }
2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2. Bf4 move order as it is often beneficial for white to delay developing the kingside knight. Note that white's most popular move here is of course the Queen's Gambit 2. c4, which should objectively challenge black more but it also requires greater theoretical knowledge. }
2... Bg4
{ A bizarre and very rare idea. It is specifically directed against Nf3 and e3  (due to the pin on the e2 pawn)  . This is not a good move though and we should switch up our plans slightly to fully exploit it. }
3. Nc3
{ We'll be seeing more of this in the later chapters. 3. f3 can be played immediately too. }
3... e6 4. f3
{ Kicking the bishop back and preparing e4 in the future possibly. To fully exploit the misplaced bishop on g4, we need to deviate from the usual London setup. }
4... Bh5 { Otherwise on f5 the bishop gets hit after e4. } 5. Qd2
{ With the idea of long-castling. White has a couple other nice options here as well, such as 5. e4 followed by 6. Nxe4. }
5... Nf6 6. h4
{ A little trick - the idea is to trap the bishop with g4 and h5. 6. g4 immediately is fine too, but both moves transpose anyway. }
6... h6 { Creating a retreat square on h7 for the bishop. } 7. g4 Bg6 8. O-O-O
Nc6 9. a3
{ To prevent any ...Bb4 or ...Nb4 ideas in the future. White is better developed than black and has a potentially dangerous initiative developing on the kingside, resulting in an edge here. }

Potentially we can long castle soon and then roll our kingside pawns forward so that the position can open up for our bishops. }

However, by not taking on b4, black gifts us a number of interesting possibilities on the queenside as well, such as playing down the b-file. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves: 1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4. 2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer. 3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course. 4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use. As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  . We believe the variations that I've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful. Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier. 1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop. 2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks. 3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. I will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis. 4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play. 5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack. _______________________ The London System is not known for being a theoretical mainroad and therefore there tends to be less theory on it than many other openings. Despite this, a number of top players  (most notably Magnus Carlsen)  have utilised it recently both as a surprise weapon and as a way to deviate from well-known paths. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. My last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would thoroughly recommend the London to newer players  (who want a simple opening which gets them a solid position - this allows them to focus on other aspects of chess)  and enthusiastic stronger players who need a solid, reliable backup weapon. }
1... d5
{ ...d5 is black's most classical response to the Closed Games. Black makes no attempt to unbalance the game right out of the gate but rather prefers to play solid and safe chess. ... d5 is a bit more commital than the super-flexible ... Nf6, but it does have a few exclusive openings that are unique to ...d5, such as the Queen's Gambit Accepted   note that the QGA is only possible after  2.c4  , which is not covered here  . 1... d5 is black's second most common retort to 1. d4 after 1... Nf6. We have divided the ...d5 chapters into two: those variations/setups with ...c5 and those without. We thought this was the simplest way to divide the content as there are a vast array of different move orders that black can utilise. Transpositions are rife in the London, especially after 1... d5, so please be aware of this. I decided to cover black's ...c5 setups after 2... c5, although he can reach the same positions by playing ...Nf6, ...e6 first etc. If black doesn't opt for ...c5, he can choose between ...Bf5 ideas or Chigorin plans  (involving ...Nc6)  . Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and .. .c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }
2. Bf4
{ One of the standard 'London moves'. As previously mentioned, white can typically make use of multiple move orders, such as playing 2. Nf3 and 3. Bf4. We prefer the 2.

The variation ends up in an endgame where white is active but black has a better pawn structure. Since it is very equal, we have decided not to recommend this as the main choice for the repertoire. Note that it still is an interesting and decent option, but just the fact that it results in an equal endgame within a few moves rules it out as our main recommendation. 3. e3 is the most common choice of white and keeps plenty of possibilities on the board. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 signifies the beginning of the Closed Games, i.e. it is not 1. e4. 1. d4 seeks to control the whole centre and 'threatens' e4 on the next move, much like 1. e4  (which threatens d4)  , however there are some significant differences between the two most common first moves: 1. e4 aims for quick castling after Nf3 and developing the light bishop. White will typically take a bit longer to get his king to safety after 1. d4. 2. Despite this, white's king comes under direct attack less often after 1. d4 and is therefore often safer. 3. Both first moves have the goal of achieving the 'ideal' d4 and e4 centre, but they both go about it in different ways. After 1. e4 white usually prepares d4 by playing c3. This is not so easy to replicate after 1. d4, since after f3 the e1-h4 diagonal is exposed. Therefore white typically opts for a different strategy: undermining black's d5-pawn with c4. Note that this is called the Queen's Gambit and will not be covered in this course. 4. The 'Sicilian equivalent' for 1. d4   which is the Dutch Defence,  1...f5  leads to a very different type of game to the standard Sicilian. This is mostly because black exposes the h5-e8 diagonal, of which white often attempts to make use. As mentioned before, and obviously evidenced by the course's title, this is about the London System. Being a 'system' opening, white typically makes the same few moves against virtually everything black can throw at him. These moves are typically d4, Bf4, Nf3, e3, c3 and Be2/d3 followed by O-O. Despite this, we don't necessarily believe that playing the same moves against everything is the best approach, and as a result we have decided to spice things up a little bit in certain variations   for example  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  g6  and  1...Nf6  2.Bf4  c5  . We believe the variations that I've chosen lead to good, fighting positions for white - in contrast, white often ends up in a dry, lifeless situation in the London if he is not careful. Before we move on and cover some actual variations, let us point out some key recurring characteristics and themes of the London System - many of these feature repeatedly, so we'd rather point them out earlier. 1. The bishop on f4 is an active piece, but this means that it can also often become a target to black's knight. After playing the moves Bf4, e3 and Nf3  (cutting off the queen's access to the h5-square)  black often has the possibility of ...Nf6-h5 at his disposal with the idea of winning the bishop pair. Since the bishop pair shouldn't be given up for free, white typically plays h3 to provide the bishop with a fallback square on h2. We recommend staying on the lookout for this manoeuvre, since losing the bishop pair often means the end of white's chances for an advantage. Also, note that this shouldn't be overdone - if white can manage without h3, omit it. Examples include positions where white can meet ... Nh5 with Bg5  (only possible with a knight on f3)  successfully. In other cases . ..Nh5xf4 isn't much of a threat, because the d4 and f4 pawns can provide some dynamic possibilities of their own. Still, it is important to be aware of this idea as it often pops up - and more often than not, you should play h3 to safeguard your bishop. 2. Another standard idea for black to exchange off our dark bishop is ...Bd6. This is less dangerous than ...Nh5, but it is also much trickier to avoid. Rather than taking on d6 immediately however, it is often better to drop your bishop back one square to g3. If black captures on g3, you can recapture with the h-pawn which leaves you with some interesting possibilities down the h-file. Note that this is another reason not to play h3 before it is truly necessary: if black goes ...Bd6, you will be unable to retreat to g3 because you'd be forced to recapture on g3 with your f-pawn. While this general rule applies in many cases, there are, as usual, exceptions. Sometimes keeping the bishop on f4 is a good option, since black's taking on f4 allows white some interesting dynamic possibilities down the e-file. Sometimes Bxd6 is also played, albeit rarely because both recaptures are decent for black. The recapture with the queen would support both the ...c5 and ...e5 breaks. 3. One of black's most common ideas, which is especially applicable to the ...d5 variations, is ...Qb6. This is often an irritating option which forces white to do something about the threat to the b2-pawn. I will recommend a specific move order to try combat this, based on delaying c2-c3. This will allow white to play the sacrificial Nc3 in certain variations - more on this in the ...d5 analysis. 4. White, if given the chance, would usually like to start a kingside attack  (this is once again especially applicable to the ...d5 variations)  . The standard opening salvo is Ne5, and from there play can go in a number of directions. Sometimes white reinforces the knight with f4, initiating the Stonewall pawn structure, followed by kingside play. 5. The other standard plan for white is very similar to the Colle System: the e4 pawn break. Since white only nudges his c-pawn to c3 instead of c4, white often goes for the e4 lever instead. This can be more impactful since it usually carries the threat of e5  (note that the c-pawn equivalent of c5 is less dangerous because of strong ...e5-based counterplay)  . Once e5 has been played, white has secured a sizable space advantage on the kingside and in the centre. This logically means that he should play on those parts of the board, i.e. he might continue with a kingside attack. _______________________ The London System is not known for being a theoretical mainroad and therefore there tends to be less theory on it than many other openings. Despite this, a number of top players  (most notably Magnus Carlsen)  have utilised it recently both as a surprise weapon and as a way to deviate from well-known paths. We encountered some small practical difficulties regarding which variations and move orders to cover. Since the London is full of different move orders which get to the same position, we had to make a choice which to include. We attempted to put a greater focus therefore on black 'systems' rather than specific variations. We recommend going through the complete course first, and then if you have specific move order queries ask in the comment section. My last comment before moving onto some real chess is that we would thoroughly recommend the London to newer players  (who want a simple opening which gets them a solid position - this allows them to focus on other aspects of chess)  and enthusiastic stronger players who need a solid, reliable backup weapon. }
1... d5
{ ...d5 is black's most classical response to the Closed Games. Black makes no attempt to unbalance the game right out of the gate but rather prefers to play solid and safe chess. ... d5 is a bit more commital than the super-flexible ... Nf6, but it does have a few exclusive openings that are unique to ...d5, such as the Queen's Gambit Accepted   note that the QGA is only possible after  2.c4  , which is not covered here  . 1... d5 is black's second most common retort to 1. d4 after 1... Nf6. We have divided the ...d5 chapters into two: those variations/setups with ...c5 and those without. We thought this was the simplest way to divide the content as there are a vast array of different move orders that black can utilise. Transpositions are rife in the London, especially after 1... d5, so please be aware of this. I decided to cover black's ...c5 setups after 2... c5, although he can reach the same positions by playing ...Nf6, ...e6 first etc. If black doesn't opt for ...c5, he can choose between ...Bf5 ideas or Chigorin plans  (involving ...Nc6)  . Black can also go into a 'triangle' setup with ...e6 and .. .c6, but this is hardly dangerous since white gets a free hand to play e4 at some point while black lacks counterplay. }

{ We don't have some huge advantage here, but white's position does seem a bit more pleasant. Our plan should be to prepare the e4 break, with Qe2 perhaps, and after ...dxe4 we can try to put our queenside pawn majority into motion. }

{ The Queen's Indian setups in this chapter are characterised by a queenside fianchetto  (...b6 and ...Bb7)  together with ...e6 - black usually delays ...d5. Black's idea is to remain flexible and fight for control of the e4 square. We examine what to do based on how black deploys his d-pawn - whether he plays ...d5 or ...d6 later on. }

{ Natural development. This is white's best option. It is too early to contest for the e4-square. Note that ...Nh5 is not a threat because of Bg5. }
4... Bb7 5. Bd3
{ e2 is also a possible square for the bishop, but putting just a little bit of pressure on e4 can go a long way to wresting control over that square from black. Once again ...Nh5 is not a threat on account of Bg5. }
5... Be7
{ Black takes the d8-h4 diagonal under his control and now ...Nh5 is a real threat to gain the bishop pair. }
6. h3
{ Of course, we don't want to give away the bishop pair for nothing. h3 makes the h2 retreat square available for white's bishop. Please be aware that black can choose from a plethora of move orders in this position. He can play ...d5 and ...c5, followed by taking on d4, or play ...c5, take on d4 and then play .. .d5 etc. We have covered 3 variations from this position: 1...d5 + ...c5 2...d5 and black takes on d4 after ...c5 3...c5 and black plays ...d6  (he takes on d4 at some point)  . }
6... c5
{ One of the many move orders black can choose. In most cases though, ...c5 features in black's plans at some point. }
7. O-O O-O 8. c3 { Reinforcing d4. } 8... d6
{ In this variation black chooses to go into a slightly more dynamic pawn structure based on d6 and e6 pawns instead of d5 and e6 pawns. This means that the bishop on b7 remains active and the ...e5 break is a remote possibility, but the big downside is that black loses his stranglehold over the e4 square. }
9. Nbd2
{ The best square for the knight of course. From here it contributes to the fight for e4. }
9... Nc6
{ The knight gets in the way of black's bishop here, but on the other hand it stops our standard plan of marching the a-pawn up the board. }
10. Qe2 Re8 11. Rad1

This results in an opponent spending more time and possibly even being frightened into an error, such as .. .bxa5. }
10... e5

1. --
{ We have arrived at one of the most interesting chapters in this course! Often 1.d4 repertoires deal with the King's Indian and Grunfeld separately, but our repertoire choice allows them to be covered in one fell swoop! This is because after 2...g6 we play 3.Nc3. We deviate from the usual London System development scheme and plan to take over the centre with e4. Our choice of line is especially unpleasant for the King's Indian player, since allowing e4 transposes into a Pirc. Black has 2 main options here:  1. Stopping e4 with 3...d5 is the choice most Grunfeld players will opt for. We offer two options for white here: 4.e3 and 4.Qd2. These lines are quite different, so it is useful to have both of them in one's repertoire. However, white players need to learn 4.e3 to have a complete repertoire due to a move order trick at black's disposal: 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 Nf6 3.e3 g6! 4.Nc3. If you choose, you can pause the 4.Qd2 variations in Chessable if you are satisfied with 4.e3, but we like both variations and think that learning 4.Qd2 and 4.e3 is worthwhile.  2. Allowing e4 with 3...g6 will be the choice of black players willing to play a Pirc as well as those who don't notice the transposition trick. After 4.e4 King's Indian players will be playing a Pirc - theoretically, we see this transposition as a net gain for white. }

5... Bxh6
{ Taking on h6 and foregoing short castles is also possible of course, but this comes with its own problems. }
6. Qxh6 Bf5
{ Black's best and most active option. He exploits the fact that white's queen is on h6 and attacks the c2 pawn. Note that it's black's only move which achieves equality here. Black's most common choice, 6... c5, is well-met by 7. dxc5 Qa5 8. a3 with a good position. Instead, after 6... Bf5 black must tread a fine line to emerge equal. }
7. O-O-O
{ Long castling is natural and probably best. Jobava's choice of 7. Qd2 might be a bit too passive while the pawn sacrifice 7. f3 leads to interesting play, but it seems to be more dangerous for white than black. }
7... Ng4
{ This has only been played once, but it's black's only path to equality ! Many black players were probably scared of 8. Qg7, but this isn't as dangerous as it appears - 8... Rf8 9. Nh3 e6 etc. The h7-pawn is invulnerable because of ...Qf6 followed by ...Rh8, trapping white's queen. If black doesn't choose 7... Ng4, white will play 8. f3 followed by 9. g4. }
8. Qf4 { As already mentioned, 8. Qg7 appears promising but it underperforms. }
8... Qd6
{ Once again black's only move to equalise. Black needs to take advantage of his brief initiative to push white back. }
9. Qf3
{ Swapping queens is fine and perfectly playable, but most players would probably rather avoid heading to an equal ending so early on in the game. }
9... Nf6
{ The knight has fulfilled its role on g4 and returns to its ideal square. }
10. h3
{ h3 is a good, multi-purpose move. It bars black's minor pieces access to the g4 square and possibly toys with the idea of lunging with the pawn to g4. }
10... Nc6 11. e3
{ The position is roughly equal with chances for both sides in an interesting and fresh position. White needs to decide now how to complete development. One possible idea is to drop the queen back so that the knight has access to f3. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5
{ Benoni setups against d4 are typically characterised by ...c5 and a kingside fianchetto at some point. By playing ...c5, black puts quick pressure on d4 and forces white to make a call: advance the pawn or protect it.

3. d5
{ By having the bishop on f4 instead of a pawn on c4, there are a few key differences between the positions of the Queen's Gambit and the London Benoni. Firstly, not having the pawn on c4 is in many ways an advantage. The c4 square is much better used for white's knight. Typically, white reroutes his kingside knight to c4 via f3 and d2. From here the knight eyes the d6 pawn and supports an e5 advance. Secondly, not having the pawn on c4 reduces white's control over b5. This means that black can try exploit this with 3... b5. Fortunately, this variation isn't too great, as we'll demonstrate in a short while. Thirdly, having the bishop on f4 instead of c1 means that b2 is hanging. Black can try exploit this with 3... Qb6, which will be one of the variations that we'll cover. }
3... d6
{ A very natural move and black's second most common choice after 3... Qb6. }
4. Nc3
{ Remember: the ommision of c4 is a good thing ! This means that the c4 square is free for our knight which will be routed there via f3 and d2. }
4... e5
{ Black offers a favourable transposition  (for him)  into the Czech Benoni. }
5. dxe6 { If possible, we'd prefer not to lose time retreating. } 5... fxe6
{ The weaker of the two recaptures. Black is weakening his own king shelter a bit here and creating some pawn structure weaknesses which we can exploit with the plan of e4-e5. }
6. e4 Nc6 7. Nf3
{ We threaten e5 - this would be disastrous for black since it would leave him with an isolated pawn on the open e-file. }

3. d5
{ By having the bishop on f4 instead of a pawn on c4, there are a few key differences between the positions of the Queen's Gambit and the London Benoni. Firstly, not having the pawn on c4 is in many ways an advantage. The c4 square is much better used for white's knight. Typically, white reroutes his kingside knight to c4 via f3 and d2. From here the knight eyes the d6 pawn and supports an e5 advance. Secondly, not having the pawn on c4 reduces white's control over b5. This means that black can try exploit this with 3... b5. Fortunately, this variation isn't too great, as we'll demonstrate in a short while. Thirdly, having the bishop on f4 instead of c1 means that b2 is hanging. Black can try exploit this with 3...

While the fundamental idea behind 1... f5 is obviously to control e4, his general opening plan isn't fixed. In fact, 3 broad categories of Dutch opening schemes exist: 1. The Classical Dutch.

As mentioned in the introduction, the Dutch is basically the 'mirror image' of the Sicilian.

2. Bf4
{ There are many decent options for white against the Dutch, but we are going to stick to the London 2. Bf4. It is a flexible move that is useful in all 3 of the Dutch systems. }
2... Nf6
{ Flexible. Instead, black can signal his intentions with 2... d5 or 2... g6 for example, but his best option would be just to transpose to the lines covered here. }
3. e3
{ White also makes a simple, non-commital move. We wait for black to show which Dutch variant he is planning to play. }
3... e6
{ Black has declined to choose any fianchetto ideas, so now we know that he will either opt for the Stonewall or the Classical Dutch. }
4. Be2
{ Natural development - we stay flexible. This move is similar to 4. Nf3 and will most likely just transpose, but it is nice to have the extra option of h3 for the knight and f3 for the bishop. }
4... d5
{ The Stonewall is characterised by the c6-d5-e6-f5 pawn formation. As the name suggests, it is particularly solid and quite difficult to crack. Black accepts some positional weaknesses  (the bad light bishop and some dark-squared weaknesses)  , but in exchange any dynamic and attacking plans white had were curbed. By closing the centre, the opening's outcome will be determined by plans and ideas rather than concrete variations. White will be looking to plant a knight on e5 at some point, develop and then look for a pawn break  (which could be f3 + e4, b4-b5 or even g4)  to break down the Stonewall. }
5. Nf3 Be7 6. O-O O-O
{ This position can of course be reached via a variety of move orders, such as 4. ..Be7. }
7. c4
{ To have a chance of breaking down the Stonewall later on, we need to create some pawn tension in the centre. This tension is virtually always in our favour, since we decide when to exchange  (only when you can see a concrete reason to exchange on d5)  . It is very rare for black to take on c4 since this leaves e6 horribly weak. }
7... c6 8. h3
{ A useful move, creating the h2 fallback square for our bishop and covering g4. }
8... Ne4 9. Nbd2 b6 10. Ne5
{ White has a good Stonewall here. Black typically looks to create some play on the kingside if possible, but clearly not much has been achieved on that front. White has developed well and soon can begin to exploit the holes black has created in his pawn structure. }

5. Nf3 Bd6
{ It does seem strange for black to offer the exchange of his good bishop for our bad bishop... }
6. O-O
{ ...but there is a reason why black offers the exchange ! Taking on d6 would favour black since he'd recapture with the pawn, and that pawn on d6 would fix all the dark squared weaknesses black had in the centre. }
6... O-O 7. c4 Bxf4
{ Note that if at any point black played ... c6, we would immediately exchange bishops because then black is forced to recapture with the queen. With the dark squared bishops gone, the weaknesses black has on the dark squares becomes even more pronounced. }
8. exf4 dxc4
{ If black doesn't take here soon, he'll be left with a very bad backward e6 pawn with nothing to compensate. }
9. Bxc4
{ Black has managed to inflict a pawn structure defect on us too, but the pawn on d4 can be defended far more easily than the pawn on e6. }
9... Nc6 10. Nc3
{ White has a clear advantage here. The pawn on e6 is bound to fall at some point, while black's target of d4 is not as easily exploited. This is in part due to the standard bad bishop on c8 advantage we have. }

Ngf3 e6 9. Nh4
{ Via a slightly different move order, we have reached a key position in the ...d5 ...c5 chapter. Carlsen is going after the bishop pair here. }
9... Be4 { 9...Bg6  is another option discussed in the ...d5 ... c5 chapter. }
10. Nxe4 Nxe4
{ 10...dxe4  is also possible, and it is discussed in the ...d5 ...c5 chapter. However, Wojtaszek foregoes this because it creates an unnecessary weakness, which can be fatal in the hands of Carlsen. }
11. Nf3 Bd6
{ Eliminating white's bishop pair advantage, but white does retain his good light-squared bishop. }
12. Bxd6 Nxd6 13. Bd3 Qc7
{ 13...O-O  14.Qc2  h6  15.Qe2  followed by 16. O-O. White retains a comfortable, slight edge. }
14. Qc2
{ Carlsen is staying flexible with his king on e1 while waiting for black to castle long or short. }
14... O-O-O
{ Certainly a double-edged option. The kings on opposite sides of the board give white  (Carlsen)  something to target. Safer was short castles, but there white enjoys a comfortable, slight edge. }
15. O-O h6 16. a4
{ Naturally, white will expand on the queenside, where black's king is. } 16...
Kb8 17. Rfe1
{ White is improving his worst placed piece before expanding with b4. } 17...
Rc8 { Threatening ...Nb4. } 18. Qd1
{ A rather odd square for the queen, but Carlsen's reasoning is soon made clear. }
18... Rhe8
{ Black is trying to counter white's queenside expansion with a central ...e5 break. This does leave the d5 pawn rather weak though, so maybe it was more advisable to pursue a kingside pawn storm. Regardless, white keeps an edge. }
19. Bf1
{ White's seemingly strange redeployment of pieces has a purpose, which will become clear soon. }
19... Re7 20. Rc1 Rd8
{ Clearly, black is gearing up for the ...e5 break, but it is questionable whether this is the right plan.   20...g5  was surely more critical. }
21. Re2
{ Finally, white's piece rearrangement scheme becomes clear. The knight is heading to d3 via e1.  The immediate   21.b4  +=  was another option. }
21... Ne4
{ 21...g5  is better once again to generate some active counterplay. } 22. b4
Ng5
{ 22...g5  23.b5  Na5  24.c4 !  and white's queenside play gains some real traction. }
23. Ne1 e5 { Black executes the break he has been planning for a while. } 24.
b5 Na5 25. Rxe5 Rxe5 26. dxe5 Qxe5 27. c4
{ After some of the tension in the centre was released, white emerges with a clear advantage. Black's fundamental issue is how uncoordinated and misplaced his pieces are - the knights in particular. }
27... Ne6 28. Nf3 Qf4
{ A critical error.   28...Qd6  was a better attempt.  29.cxd5  Qxd5  30.Qe1  Hitting the knight on a5.  b6  31.Rc3  ±  Black's pieces remain uncoordinated and his king has become exposed to boot. }
29. cxd5 Rxd5 30. Qxd5 Qxc1 31. g3
{ As GM Stohl writes: 'A strong multi-purpose move. It gives the king luft, limits the Ne6, prepares Ne5 and frees g2 or h3 for the bishop. Carlsen winds up the attack impeccably.' White is winning here due to his more harmonised pieces and black's exposed king. }
31... Qc5 32. Qd7 Qf8 33. Ne5 Nc5 34. Qd5 Kc7 35. Nxf7 Nxa4 36. Qe5+ Kb6 37.
Nd6 Nc5 38. Ne8
{ A very nice display by Carlsen ! Take note of the patient build-up and manoevering while black seemed to be preparing the wrong plan  (the ...e5 break)  . In particular, the Nf3-e1-d3 redeployment is an idea to keep in mind, as well as a4 + b4 when black castles long.  1-0  (38)  Carlsen,M  (2850)  -Wojtaszek,R  (2748)  Reykjavik 2015 }

{ Via a slightly different move order, we have reached a critical and common position in the whole London system, covered in the ...d5 ...c5 chapter. The reason for choosing this rather old game was not for its theoretical importance, but rather the instructive way in which white counters a premature ...c4 with a strong central e4 break. }
7... h6 { A bit odd - this isn't necessary for black. } 8. Be2
{ 8.Bd3  is our preferred square for the bishop in most cases. } 8... a6
{ Also, a strange and unnecessary pawn move by black. } 9. Ne5
{ A typical idea for white - it is useful to always consider this knight hop. Sometimes white follows up by dropping the bishop back and play f4 to solidify the knight on e5. }
9... O-O 10. O-O Nxe5 11. Bxe5 { Recapturing with the pawn was also possible. }
11... b6 12. Bd3
{ The bishop 'fixes' its early mistake and goes to the better square. } 12...
Bb7 13. Qe2 c4
{ This move defines the rest of the game. Black grabs some space and hopes to expand further on the queenside with ...b5-b4. On the other hand, ...c4 makes white's e4 break far stronger, since now taking on e4 will leave the c4 pawn a bit weak and isolated. }
14. Bc2 b5 15. e4 { White carries out his thematic break. } 15... Nxe4 16. Nxe4
dxe4 17. Bxe4 Bxe4 18. Qxe4
{ Up until now, the play has been rather unremarkable by both sides and the position seems to be fairly dry and equal. However, the way how Pribyl continues is particularly instructive. }
18... Re8 { 18...Qd5  is also good. } 19. Rfe1 Bf8
{ Black plays too passively and allows white's kingside initiative to develop. }
20. Re3
{ This rook lift idea is worth keeping in mind. White swings his rook over to the kingside so it can soon put some pressure on black's king. }
20... f6
{ Black seems to panic a little bit and chases away white's bishop, but simultaneously creates a massive weakness on e6 and a clear target for white to play against.   20...g6  might be a little better here, since e6 remains protected at least. However, white is still comfortably better anyway.  21.Rf3  += }
21. Bf4 g5
{ If black's previous move wasn't a mistake, this certainly is. Black is rushing his pawns in front of his king forwards, which is surely a recipe for disaster.   21...Qd5  Black needs to hang tight and not making any weakening pawn moves.  22.Qc2  += }
22. Bh2 Bg7 23. Rae1 Qd7 24. Qg4 { Hitting e6. } 24... Kf7
{ Having the king exposed like this is the last mistake - black's pawn cover, having advanced already, will soon be broken down by white.   24...f5  another weakening pawn move, but this one is rather forced. Otherwise, black's king comes out into the open which was expertly exploited by white.  25.Qe2  ±  White is still close to winning here. }
25. f4 { Immediately setting about attacking black's exposed king. } 25... Rad8
26. f5 { Continuing the onslaught, with a nice tactic in mind. } 26... e5
{ Black tries to close the centre, but it is too little too late.   26...exf5  loses immediately.  27.Qh5+  Kf8  28.Rxe8+  Rxe8  29.Rxe8+  Qxe8  30.Bd6+ !  +- }
27. h4 Kg8 28. dxe5 fxe5 29. hxg5 h5 30. Qe4

g6 Rf8 34. Qxd5+
{ 34.Qh4  +-  keeping the queens on the board wins more cleanly. } 34... Rxd5
35. Rxe5 Rxf5 36. Rxd5
{ White messes up a bit here.   36.Re8+  Kg7  37.R8e6  +-  with Be5 coming next, white is winning. }
36... Rxd5 37. Be5 Bf2
{ The losing mistake.  After   37...Bf8  38.Bd4  Rd6  39.Re8  Rxg6  40.Bc5  Rf6  41.Ra8  +=  White is certainly better here, but very far from winning. }
38. Re2 Bc5 39. g3 Rd1+ 40. Kg2 Bd6 41. Bd4 Bf8 42. Re8
{ With g7 coming, black resigned. This game is instructive since it shows how effective the e4 break can be against ...c4. White managed to win a seemingly dry and equal position, because black created weaknesses with unnecessary pawn moves which white expertly exploited.  1-0  (42)  Pribyl,J  (2485)  -Ivanovic,B  (2440)  Zalaegerszeg 1977 }

{ Keeping up the pressure. } 13... Qc8
{ Already the losing mistake. It is such a natural move  (getting the queen out of the d-file)  , but it cost black, a very strong GM, the game ! And this isn't a once off - at the time of writing, this is black's most common move from this position, having been played 6 times !   13...Rc8  was the move given previously for black in the ...d5 ...c5 chapter. After  14.Rd1  +=  white has a slight edge, due to his active pieces and the queenside pawn majority. }
14. Bxh7+
{ And here's why this game is being shown ! The famous Greek Gift sacrifice ! Unfortunately there wasn't a good opportunity to showcase it in the previous chapters, since we always prefer to show black's best defences  (which wouldn't allow it)  . However it is a vital idea to know ! White sacrifices a bishop for a pawn to wreck black's kingside pawn cover and lure the king forward. Next white usually follows up by bringing the queen and knight into the game with Qh4/ Qh5+ and Ng5. }

{ And black will soon be mated. This game is showcased for 2 reasons: it shows the danger to black when he takes on e4, but moreover, this game demonstrates how deadly the Greek Gift sacrifice can be. Always keep an eye out for these Bxh7+ ideas so that you can take your chance to end the game swiftly and cleanly when the opportunity presents itself.  1-0  (34)  Moskalenko,A  (2464)  -Aleksandrov,A  (2592)  Kazan 2016 }

{ 7...Qxa2  can be even more disastrous for black, as shown in the ...d5 ...c5 chapter. }
8. Bb5 e6 9. O-O Qxc5
{ Not the best, and very risky for black. Black has no time to waste on recouping the c5 pawn and instead should be focusing on catching up in development. White's initiative grows rapidly from this point on.  Quick development with   9...Be7  is examined in the theory notes. }
10. c4
{ Good, forceful play. When white has an initiative, he needs to take advantage quickly before it fizzles out. By creating tension in the centre, white hopes to open up lines which will favour our more active pieces. }
10... a6
{ Once again, black is neglecting development.   10...Be7  was to be preferred.  11.Nb3  Qa3  12.Nbd4  White still has pressure, but it is not overwhelming:  O-O  13.Nxc6  bxc6  14.Bxc6  Ba6  15.Bxa8  Rxa8  16.Rb3  Qa5  17.Qb1  ±  White emerges with a material advantage, but black has some compensation. }

This game was useful to demonstrate just how quickly black's position can fall apart in this line if he neglects development for just 2 moves. We saw how the powerful c4 break took advantage of this. White also made use of the chronic lack of squares from which black's queen suffers.  1-0  (20)  Blomqvist,E  (2541)  -Jensson,E  (2378)  Sastamala 2016 }

Nc6 9. Nbd2 d5
{ This position is covered in the QID setups chapter, but the structure is reminiscent of the ...d5 ...c5 chapter. However, because of black's move order, we didn't have the chance to play our e4 break, so the game's nature is a little different here: manoevering and minor positional improvements are prevalent in this line. }
10. Qe2 Bd6 11. Rfe1
{ Up until this point, we have covered this in our theory notes in the QID setups chapter. White avoids taking on d6 to ease black's task and instead invites him to take on f4. }
11... Ne7
{ Tomashevsky refrains from giving Carlsen an early imbalance which he might exploit - instead he remains flexible and solid. Black's knight is heading to g6.   11...Bxf4  was covered in the theory notes.  12.exf4  +=  The semi open e-file gives white good play. }
12. Rad1
{ Carlsen improves his position bit by bit. Clearly, with his rooks on the e and d files, he is looking at central play. }
12... Ng6 13. Bxg6
{ Carlsen gets the imbalance he was looking for ! He 'sacrificed' his good bishop to create a defect in black's pawn structure. }
13... hxg6 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 15. Ne5
{ This is very nice play by Carlsen. The doubled g-pawns seem like something very minor and almost irrelevant, but Carlsen takes full advantage. Evicting the knight from e5 with ...f6 is much more difficult since the pawn on g6 would hang. Additionally, white now has the option of reinforcing the knight with f4 in the event black tries to exchange knights with ...Nd7. }
15... g5
{ 15...a5  +=  Judging by how the game progressed, perhaps 15... g5 was not best - but it is clear that white is in the driver's seat in any case. }
16. f4 { An interesting choice. Carlsen invites complications. } 16... gxf4 17.

The main reason white was trying to open up the f-file - Carlsen was planning to sacrifice the exchange on f6 to rip open black's kingside.  exd2 !  Keeping black's king sheltered at least.   18...gxf6 ?  is losing:  19.Qg4+  Kh7  20.Rf1 !!  exd2  21.Rf4  with mate soon to follow.  19.Rf4 !

{ White's activity and black's wrecked pawn structure give white a near-winning advantage. As GM Nielsen says: 'Black is basically in a zugzwang. playing...f6 allows Ng6 and mate on h8. The f-rook defends f7, the other, the bishop on b7, which can't move, as then a7 would fall. So what is left, is to move the a-pawn.' }

Clearly, the e5 break is one of white's main ideas here, but white seems to have rushed it, which gave black a few chances to equalise. What won the game for white in the end was the the strength of the d-pawn - one of white's key advantages in this endgame, due to the space it grants white, as well as the the obvious threats of promotion later in the game. Black failed to realise the danger of this pawn, when he declined to exchange it earlier with ...exd5. This game also goes to show how this endgame is exceptionally complex - there is plenty of room to outplay a weaker opponent here, and even strong GMs can err.  1-0  (39)  Vachier Lagrave,M  (2768)  -Peralta,F  (2574)  Tromsoe 2014 }

We have tried to choose puzzles that represent typical or thematic tactical ideas which are important in our repertoire. As a result, you will be seeing plenty of Bxh7! The tactics are mostly from white's perspective, but we have added a few for black since it is just as important to know what to look out for. Many of these tactics aren't too difficult - they are simply showcasing thematic tactical ideas we think you should be aware of.  Good luck and enjoy! }
