{ I have been waiting for this for a long time - the moment when I finally publish my first book! My name is Miodrag Perunovic. I am an International Master @@StartBracket@@IM@@EndBracket@@, the current team captain of the Serbian men's national team and a FIDE Senior Trainer - the highest title awarded to coaches in the world.  In addition to being a dad, husband, judge and an avid tennis player, I am a renowned chess coach who has had the opportunity to successfully work with over 700 students from around the world. I am proud to have worked with students from 107 countries, with ratings ranging from 1000-2700, and ages ranging from 5 to 80 years old.   Throughout my coaching career, I have worked with three World Champions @@StartBracket@@U20, U14 and U12@@EndBracket@@, seven World Vice Champions, four bronze medal winners, and more than 40 State champions!     The work in front of you is the result of many years of coaching with a large number of GM's and IM's, as well as with a huge number of students on all levels. Using my experience there, I tried to create a unique opening repertoire that fit anyone's style and I adjusted it based on what the best lines were in practice.  The opening choices we cover in this book are unorthodox yet theoretically sound and impose difficulties on players ranging from beginner all the way up to GM. Sicilian players will be disappointed to have spent countless hours learning volumes of mainline Sicilian theory only to see us get them out of theory as early as move 2. Not only does this opening repertoire allow us to dictate the pace and nature of our games with white, but we also cut the risk of becoming victim to an opponent's home-cooked preparation!  I have taught these lines to the vast majority of my students of all skill levels @@StartBracket@@Beginner - GM@@EndBracket@@. They have fantastic results and are excited about this repertoire. Having played the Sicilian for 20 years, I was frankly scared of these lines and used to have major problems against them. My students have experienced great results and I as a Sicilian player, have been most wary for all these years! Not only a weapon in classical chess, but this repertoire has also helped me and my students boast an impressive score against top IMs, GMs in online blitz.  Although many of these lines are no longer popular, I managed to revive many of them through deep analysis with other GM's and lessons with my students, but also through play in classic and blitz chess, and I succeeded, injected a new spirit into them and I am sure that I have weakened the Sicilian!  I wish you the best of luck in exploring the secrets of this repertoire!  Significance of the repertoire     

It significantly shortens our preparations - without the relentless learning of deep and unclear Sicilian lines.  We dictate the types of positions - we do not give Black the opportunity of choosing the Najdorf, Dragon, Rauzer, Taimanov, Svesnikov or other popular Sicilian lines   It is a particularly deadly weapon for accelerated time controls, such as Blitz games, due to a large number of tactical tricks, Black has a lot of problems surviving out of the opening  Open Sicilian: @@StartBracket@@2.Nc3 g6 & 2.Nc3 a6@@EndBracket@@ White can follow up with Nf3 and d4 here, Closed Sicilian: @@StartBracket@@2.Nc3 a6@@EndBracket@@ White can follow up with g3 ideas here, GPA - Grand Prix Attack: @@StartBracket@@2.Nc3 Nc6@@EndBracket@@ ideas or an early f4 are in the air here, and KIA - King's Indian Attack: @@StartBracket@@2.Nc3 e6@@EndBracket@@ when White can play setups with g3 and Bg2  It has proven to be successful among many of my students - GM’s: Eric Hansen, Denis Kadric, Milan Zajic IM’s: Stankovic, Radovanovic, Rajkovic as well as many FM’s where the best was FM Milos Milosevic

White does not want to give up the Bishop pair after   5.Bb5  Bd7  6.Bxc6  Bxc6  ,  so he gives up a tempo with the Queen, with the intention of castling on the opposite wing after b3 and Bb2 and creating an attack on the Kingside with the typical plan of Nge2, f3, g4 and h4. }

Black is hoping for a fairly active game with the main idea of Qa5, followed by Bb4, Ne4 or Rc8.

11... Qxd2 12. Rxd2
{ White has a slightly better position thanks to a healthier pawn structure and the possibility to attack the d5 pawn for the rest of the game. Most likely White's idea should be 13. f3 with the idea of g4-h4 and Ne2 with a long-lasting middlegame advantage mainly due to strong control on the d4 square. }

{ This adventurous continuation, usually chosen by Najdorf defense players @@StartBracket@@naturally, 2...Nc6 excludes the Najdorf@@EndBracket@@, gives White the opportunity to achieve a development advantage and choose the system in which a6 is worth the least. Lately, lots of top players used this 2...a6 move against 2.Nc3 and at some point it even started to cause White lots of problems since Black had very strong results with it, especially against the line with   3.f4!  Although, I am pretty sure that after you thoroughly check the following analysis, that you have no reason to be scared at all anymore and that the   3.Nge2  Chameleon line will become one of your favorite weapons! }
3. Nge2
{ The Sicilian Chameleon, which we also can adopt after 2...e6, is a great idea for such robotic continuations by Black. With 3.Nge2 White aims for a Closed Sicilian where the move a6 is most often a waste of tempo, but also keeps the possibility of switching to the Open Sicilian with d4 at a proper moment of Whites choosing open! Black has several lines after White continues with 4.g3, most of them lead to good positions for White characteristic of a Closed Sicilian where again a6 turns out to be dubious. }

{ An unorthodox move by Black early in the opening, but this aggressive move was expected considering 2...a6. In my opinion, it is the only logical follow up against the Chameleon. Black obviously intends an immediate attack on Black's central pawn on e4 with Bb7 and b4. }

{ The position is a critical crossroad for choosing White's future plans. The position is reminiscent of the Tarrasch defense, except that the pawn is on c2 @@StartBracket@@instead of e2@@EndBracket@@, so the e-file is open instead of the c-file. This of course has both advantages and disadvantages. The open file is ideal for a White Rook on e1. Without a pawn on e2, Black may embarrass the Queen on d1 with Bg4! So perhaps the best medicine for this is the 9th move h3! but it is also logical to continue to develop the Bishop on @@StartBracket@@e3, f4 or g5@@EndBracket@@. }
10. h3
{ As we mentioned previously, this small but useful move does not allow Black a more active setup with Bg4 and Qd7. Otherwise, the specific position is a typical example of a weak isolated pawn blockaded in the center. For us, the Chameleon system is also versatile because it can arise in different orders, depending on when Black plays d5. Black can continue in various ways, but they all lead to inferior positions due to the weakness of the d5 pawn. For example, if White goes with   10.Be3  this would be the standard and the best placement of the Bishop in this type of position. White has Nxc6 and Bd4 as one of the plans. By moving to positions with hanging pawns, Black will have new headaches. Practice has shown that Black has fewer problems with the White Bishop on f4 or g5, although after  10...Bg4!  simple and powerful move Black develops a piece with tempo and gets good counter chances  11.Qd3  is the most active and seemingly dangerous for Black because weaknesses are created on b5 and f5. However, Tregubov showed in the next two games that Black has sufficient counterplay, thanks to the activity of his pieces,  11...Qd7!  Black plays simple strategic moves. His Rooks are ready to occupy the open lines and this gives Black good counter chances. }
10... Qb6 11. Nce2
{ A logical move that is part of White's blocking intentions. White keeps control of the d4 square  (The Knight is the best blocking piece!)  , it gives c3 followed by Qb3 and Be3, with quite an easy position for playing afterward. }

{ Solidifies the position of the Knight on d4 even better and White is about to realize full plan against IQP with Qb3 and Be3. }
12... Bd7 13. Qb3
{ In order to secure 14.Be3 next since the b2 pawn would hang if 13.Be3? was played instead. }
13... Qa6 14. Be3
{ White had a comfortable game in the position against an isolated pawn: Berend, F-Adianto, Beijing 2008. This game, which Black lost, shows that it is challenging for Black to play such positions, even though Black was rated 200 points higher. }

{ This move reminds me of Najdorf, Moscow and Checkhover variation positions. Black has just made a concession, creating weaknesses on the light squares, but he hopes eventually to somehow take advantage of the Bishop pair. }
9. Qd3
{ Why here? It supports the typical positional plan with Nd2-Nc4, from where it either attacks the d6 pawn or goes over to e3 with further control of the light squares, especially d5. Also, Qd3 will be lined up by Rfd1 afterwards as well. }
9... h6
{ This is necessary, in order to allow Black Nf6 and to prevent any Bg5-Bf6 idea by White }
10. Nd2 { White is aiming for e3 to tighten control over the weak d5 square. }
10... Nf6 11. Nc4 Be6 12. Ne3
{ I suggest this move as it leads to a small but long-lasting advantage with safe control of the center and a bit more space. It is imperative that d5 has to be stopped by Black and that this type of play is only for those who like small and nice positional advantages. }

The point of the line is that White is getting ready to comfortably place his Bishop on b3 after the exchange of the Knights.

5... Bg7 6. O-O

It makes sense since Black wants to support Nd4 with Ne7-Nec6, but also defend the d4 pawn with Nc6 @@StartBracket@@once White takes on d4 - Nd4 cd4@@EndBracket@@ and at the same time it restricts any Bb5 and its further activity. Usually played by Taimanov and Kan players. }
5. O-O
{ 5...Nxb5  tranposes to  4...Nxb5  ,   while   5...Ne7  6.Nxd4  cxd4  7.Ne2  transposes into our analyzed line with 5...a6. }
5... a6 6. Bd3
{ This is a very important strategic move by White. By having the Bishop on d3 White threatens to capture on d4 and then the pawn on d4 would be blockaded by this Bishop and would be chronically weak for the remainder of the game. Black now has three possible options:   6...Nf3?!   6...Nc6  and the main one   6...Ne7 }
6... Nc6
{ This Knight retreat is a common idea in similar positions. Black's Knight has done a pretty good job in terms of preventing an active game in the center for White coupled with d4 at some point, Bd3 looks pretty weird too, while White's trouble child on Bc1 suffers for a while longer. }
7. b3
{ The seemingly logical   7.Re1?!  is bad due to an active  7...g5!?  where Black gets a strong initiative.  Also   7.e5  was seen in the game Grischuk, A - Vachier Lagrave,M Stavanger 2015 & Degraeve,J - Jaracz,P Germany 2007, but the active  7...d5!  8.exd6  Bxd6  brought White nothing out after the opening. }
7... Nge7 { Goes for Ng6 and pretty strong control over the dark squares } 8.
Re1 Ng6 9. Bb2 Be7 10. Nd5
{ A strong move that casts the entire Black concept of Nc6, Ng6 and Be7 with suspicion. White has just opened up the Bishop on b2, in case of ed5, the d3 Bishop will get active as well, Re1 and e-file will open too, so all things considered I would not mind playing every game like this! :-@@EndBracket@@ }
10... exd5 11. exd5 O-O 12. dxc6 dxc6 13. Ne5
{ White has just opened up the Queen on d1 for either Qf3 or Qh5 and a strong Kingside attack, which would eventually see him doubling Rooks on the e-file as well. White definitely looked way more promising and went on to win in Sedlak,N - Perunovic,Milos Niksic 2016 }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ White signals his obvious intention with the early 3.Bb5 foray to capture the Knight on c6 and ruin Black's pawn structure. The exchange on c6 deserves emphasis because it would not gain much if White did not have the option of a Grand Prix-like assault with f2-f4 after 2.Nc3. This is the biggest improvement by White in this system and it especially works against sidelines such as   3...g6?!  and   3...e6?!  ,  quite typical reactions by club players, often overlooking the differences between the annoying Rossolimo Sicilian   @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.Bb5  and this more traditional Sicilian by White. I would like to point out the practical strength of this system, because experience has shown that historically Black had the biggest trouble against this one of all the Sicilian sidelines! The main supporter of this variation is GM Sergei Tiviakov. Many players named this 'Tiviakov's variation' out of respect for his theoretical contributions and nowadays he is followed by many top players such as: Carlsen, Caruana, Andreikin, Morozevich as well as some of the top Azerbaijani players Radjabov, Safarli, Guseinov. I like to also call it the 'Azeri Sicilian' as many Azerbaijani GM's have employed this weapon against the Sicilian. }
3... Nd4
{ Undoubtedly this is the best answer, as Black need not allow Bxc6 and a fractured pawn structure. Keep in mind,   3...Nf6  4.Bxc6!  Black usually transposes into positions we examined under 3...g6?! or 3...e6?!  There is also   3...a6?!  @@StartBracket@@this is a common positional mistake made by club player@@EndBracket@@, in order to learn basic plans and ideas, please check the analysis against the 3...g6?! and 3...e6?! variations, and once you examine those lines, I am sure you will not have any more problems in dealing with 3...a6?! properly as well, because you will have similar positions, with even a big plus - it's a tempo up compared to those lines, since they can not achieve any advantage from 3...a6 in any of those lines! White may continue in several ways but I suggest the most active  4.Nf3  ,  while for decades the most popular move was   4.Bc4  ,  lately it has been fully overtaken by the popular 4.Nf3 where White has demonstrated some very strong results. }
4. Nf3
{ This became recently an idea that was used literally by almost all top GM's including Carlsen, Caruana, Grischuk, Andreikin and others, previously   4.Bc4  was the most popular move by White, but it led to unclear positions. The same idea like 4.Nf3, is seen in other openings as well @@StartBracket@@Grand Prix, the Rossolimo, English opening reversed colors@@EndBracket@@. White does not want to waste time with his Bishop @@StartBracket@@it anyways went on b5 to be swapped off for Nc6@@EndBracket@@, so White rushes with his development. So, here we have a critical position from where Black can opt for five @@StartBracket@@5@@EndBracket@@ different plans:   4...g6  - Mainly used by players who like g6 structures and positions with the Bishop on g7   4...e6  - Very common choice, mainly used by Taimanov and Kan variation players, with flexible plans for Black   4...Nf6  - A line that gives White relatively nice positions with lots of tactical opportunities   4...a6  - Lately the most popular and seems like the critical line }
4... Nf6
{ Of all the possible fourth move Black responses the following position will surely become one of your favorites! It is easy to learn, full of tactical threats and some very nasty tricks and on the top of all that, White has an amazing plus score in it! In the database it scores more than 75% for White! }
5. e5 Nxb5 6. Nxb5 Nd5 7. Ng5
{ This is one of my favorite lines! After the forced sequence of moves, we have a very unorthodox position. White is willing to create threats against f7 , taking advantage that on   7...e6  there follows  8.Ne4  and it turns out that the Knight on b5 is well placed. This seemingly weird Knight maneuver prevents Black from completing development and obviously creates strong immediate threats. Speaking of concrete threats, there are several such as Qh5, Qf3, c4 and Nf7. }
7... f6
{ Since practice has shown that this line is extremely difficult to play for Black, it turned out that this move is the only chance for Black to fight for something. Black is aware that the Knights on g5 and b5 are so strong and takes action to remove the one around his King. }
8. Qf3 { Threatens Qd5 } 8... Nc7 9. exf6 exf6
{ The following moves are forced and it is quite difficult to make any reasonable comments since from this point onwards most of the analysis is based on very concrete chess engine calculated moves and you have to be ready to learn most of the lines by heart. }
10. Qe4+
{ An important intermediate move that keeps the advantage for White! Both 10...Be7 and 10...Qe7 do not work, so the next move is forced... }
10... Ne6 11. Nxh7
{ I have mixed feelings about this move. It looks both: winning and risky. It is none of those! White grabs material and would like to complete his development afterwards. I guess it is one of those: easier said, then done! }
11... d5 12. Qg6+ Kd7 13. Nxf8+ Qxf8 14. d3
{ White seems a bit better. Even though White is up a pawn, Black is not without counterplay as after a6 Black has the resource Nd4, but also placing one of the pieces onto the open e-file, to challenge the exposed King on e1. }

It seems that after that game, this line has become a frequent guest in tournaments with recent positive results by White. White does not want to give up the Bishop pair after   5.Bb5  Bd7  6.Bxc6  Bxc6  ,  so he gives up a tempo with the Queen, with the intention of castling on the opposite wing after b3 and Bb2 and creating an attack on the Kingside with the typical plan of Nge2, f3, g4 and h4. Black has a choice between two defensive setups:   5...g6  or first   5...Nf6  then g6 with Dragon-like characteristics or   5...Nf6  with e6 to follow and a more flexible center. }

8. O-O-O
{ It is interesting to point out that that Black has reached an important strategic crossroad here. He can play   8...O-O  and allow the opponent to create a very complicated attacking position starting with a quick pawn storm - f4 and g4  or stop such a scenario with the preventative   8...a6  Because of the threat of ...b5 White might opt for the more modest-looking  9.f3  ,  promote King safety with   9.Kb1  or our recommendation   9.f4! }
8... O-O

9... a6 10. g4
{ White should not hesitate and this is why the 10. g4 pawn sacrifice should be remembered. It gives White open g-file in the event of Ng4, if not, White will continue with g5 and a pawn storm on the Kingside.   10.f4  is rather risky since Black gets a strong initiative after  10...b5!  11.Qe1  I find this move quite normal looking since it gives threats of e5 and defends potentially weak e4 pawn  11...Qc7  12.g4!?  with chances for both players. }

{ A move that gained full popularity after Carlsen's victory over Wojtaszek in 2018. It seems that after that game, this line has become a frequent guest in tournaments with recent positive results by White. White does not want to give up the Bishop pair after   5.Bb5  Bd7  6.Bxc6  Bxc6  ,  so he gives up a tempo with the Queen, with the intention of castling on the opposite wing after b3 and Bb2 and creating an attack on the Kingside with the typical plan of Nge2, f3, g4 and h4. Black has a choice between two defensive setups:   5...g6  or first   5...Nf6  then g6 with Dragon-like characteristics or   5...Nf6  with e6 to follow and a more flexible center. }
5... a6
{ a move typical for Najdorf and Scheveningen variation Sicilian players } 6.
b3 Nf6 7. Bb2 e6 8. O-O-O b5
{ I believe lately this approach by Black has scored well mainly due to the b4 threat and the possibility to weaken the e4 pawn. That also means that White can hardly push f4, since it would leave the e4 pawn undefended. Black's most lethal plan should be Nd7 followed by Nc5 with rapid Queenside action. }
9. f3
{ A novel type of position in this variation worthy of discussion; The Bishop on b2 not only attacks along the long diagonal but also provides additional safety for the White King. White is always ready to unleash a Kingside attack starting with g4 and I would assess the arising position as completely unclear. }
9... Be7 10. Kb1
{ As I frequently advise, this is an important preventative maneuver safeguarding the King. White may now calmly proceed to unleash his Kingside attack with g4. Watch out! If an immediate 10.g4? fails to 10...Ng4! where White was left down a pawn and had to fight for compensation afterward in Guseinov-Martinez Alcantara 41st Barbera Open 2018 }

3. Nge2

Black has several lines after White continues with 4.g3, most of them lead to good positions for White characteristic of a Closed Sicilian where again a6 turns out to be dubious. }
3... b5
{ An unorthodox move by Black early in the opening, but this aggressive move was expected considering 2...a6. In my opinion, it is the only logical follow up against the Chameleon. Black obviously intends an immediate attack on White's central pawn on e4 with Bb7 and b4. }

There were plenty of tricks to be solved before and I would be willing to take this risk. After all, White has a pawn majority on the Queenside, a well-positioned centralized Knight on d4 supported by Be3, the c-file seems to be in his control as well, the only drawback might be Black's better center.

{ This is the critical test for the whole variation. White tries to look for the advantage with lines such as:   12.c3!?  ,   12.Qf3!?  ,  and   12.c4 }
12. c3
{ defends the Knight and provokes weaknesses on the queenside. This turns out to be the most critical continuation by White and looks like it may secure certain chances for the advantage. In practice, it has worked perfectly fine for me and my students so far! }
12... Nxa4 { the alternatives are bad and lead Black into severe problems } 13.
Qxa4
{ White is more active and threatens Ne6. Black has only one way to fight against White's threats }
13... Qb6
{ This move turned out to be a common answer by Black in my practice and there is a fine reason for it! It allows Black to develop with Nc6 afterwards, it defends the pawn on b4 and supports further activity with Bc5 and 0-0. It is also important to point out, that it prevents any Ne6 ideas by White too, which practically means that Qa4 loses its function on the Queenside! }
14. Qd1
{ This is a very special retreat and Queen maneuver! White is aware of the fact that Bc5 is Black's idea, that Qa4 does nothing anymore on the Queen side and we take action in time. The Queen wants to reposition itself to the King side  (Qa4-Qd1-Qg4)  in order to take advantage of the weak Kings position since there is no Knight around to defend! }
14... Bc5
{ Black just continues his development and hopes to castle which would bring him a fairly simple middlegame considering the fact that he is up a pawn. }
15. Qg4
{ An important move that is the logical follow up of previous   14.Qd1.  Now  15...O-O  would not work due to  16.Bh6  which would lead to serious material loss. }
15... bxc3 16. bxc3 Nc6
{ Looks like Black secures safe development and position without possibility by White to carry on with initiative, but keep in mind, Black does not have an easy time on the King side either since castle does not work. }
17. Rd1
{ We need to defend and solidify our center without simplifying and losing the tension in the center. }
17... g6 18. Bh6
{ A typical idea that prevents 0-0 and makes King's position even harder since it remains exposed in the center! }
18... Rb8 19. Qf4
{ White had decent compensation regardless the fact that he was down a pawn in the game Debevec,B - Slawinski,T ICCF email 2008. At the moment, threats are Nc6, a logical idea and plan could be Rd3 followed by Rad1, there is also Nb3 to kick the Bc5 away and open Rd1. Keep in mind, there are always ideas like Qf6 or Bg7 too! }

14. Qh5
{ Simply a magnificent move! All of a sudden, Black just collapses! There are numerous threats, but the strongest one is the critical one Ne6! An interesting fact is that I've had more than 20 games just like this within the last couple of months. Black simply blunders the following 14.Qh5! trick and that's what I find great about this line, there is a big probability that you will win your games in this fashion! Good luck! }

{ A crucial moment to point something out! Because in the past I forgot this key move, I lost a completely winning Blitz game! This is probably the last move you need to remember about this line, but as I previously stated - it's a decisive one! It opens up rooks on the back rank, makes Be7 bad in terms of defending, and gives White a variety of winning moves such as Rac1, Re4, etc. }

3. Nge2

Black has several lines after White continues with 4.g3, most of them lead to good positions for White characteristic of a Closed Sicilian where again a6 turns out to be dubious. }
3... b5

3. Nge2

Black has several lines after White continues with 4.g3, most of them lead to good positions for White characteristic of a Closed Sicilian where again a6 turns out to be dubious. }
3... b5

12... h5
{ Absolutely the strongest move for Black! Black is planning an active game on the Kingside and expelling White's active Bishop with g5 will be his priority. The plan could be g5, followed by h4, Rc8 and Ne5. }
13. e5
{ A multi-purpose move! White expands in the center in order to absolutely dominate the d-file, but also wants to cripple the flexibility of Black's pawn structure on the Kingside. Obviously, exf6 is threatened. }
13... f5 14. h4
{ Black is in an inferior position with a permanently weak pawn on d7. Also, there is a possibility of Rfd1, while Ra1 has to keep standing on a1 to support a4 Queenside break. Bf4 does a great job too! Supports e5 pawn, indirectly prevents d7 pawn from moving and at the same time altogether with h4 pawn gets a strong grip on g5! }

{ This is one of the most typical strikes in this whole 2. ..a6 variation. White takes advantage of Re1, exposed King on e8 alltogether with ed5 and Bg2 that will give White strong open e-file and c6 outpost. Black has no other way but to take the challenge! }
12... exd5 13. exd5+ Kd8 14. Nc6+
{ This is an important move to show the strength of Bg2 in cooperation with pawn on d5, also to open Qd1, but what really makes it even easier is the fact that Ra4 could always be added into the attack via Rb4 or Rc4. }
14... Bxc6 15. dxc6 Nb6 16. Rd4
{ After a couple of nice tactical strikes and well led initiative, White had completely winning position and very soon won in Chiburdanidze,M - Hoffmann,H Lugano 1989. Threats are c4 followed by c5, Bf4 since the only bareer between White pieces and Black's king is d6 pawn, while Kd8 looks terrible, Bf8 passive, Rooks on a8 and h8 inactive. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 a6
{ This adventurous continuation, usually chosen by Najdorf defense players @@StartBracket@@naturally, 2...Nc6 excludes the Najdorf@@EndBracket@@, gives White the opportunity to achieve a development advantage and choose the system in which a6 is worth the least. Lately, lots of top players used this 2...a6 move against 2.Nc3 and at some point it even started to cause White lots of problems since Black had very strong results with it especially against the line with   3.f4!  Although, I am pretty sure that after you thoroughly check the following analysis, that you have no reason to be scared at all anymore and that the   3.Nge2  Chameleon line will become one of your favorite weapons! }
3. Nge2
{ The Sicilian Chameleon, which we also can adopt after 2...e6, is a great idea for such robotic continuations by Black. With 3.Nge2 White aims for a Closed Sicilian where the move a6 is most often a waste of tempo, but also keeps the possibility of switching to the Open Sicilian with d4 at the proper moment of Whites choosing! Black has several lines after White continues with 4.g3, most of them lead to good positions for White characteristic of a Closed Sicilian where again a6 turns out to be dubious. }
3... b5
{ An unorthodox move by Black early in the opening, but this aggressive move was expected considering 2...a6. In my opinion, it is the only logical follow up against the Chameleon. Black obviously intends an immediate attack on White's central pawn on e4 with Bb7 and b4. }
4. g3

Bb7 5. Bg2 e6
{ In case of   5...d6  6.d4  cxd4  7.Nxd4  the game would sooner or later transpose into one of the lines arising after  5...e6 }
6. d4
{ Again the most accurate move order! We are asking black to chose between a suboptimal Sicilian Taimanov with   6...cxd4  7.Nxd4  Nc6  and a dubious benoni structure after   6...d6  where the b7 bishop is ineffective. }
6... cxd4 7. Nxd4
{ Apart from the main line with 7...Nf6, examined in the previous two chapters,   Black has other alternatives that are worthy of consideration:   7...Nc6  and   7...b4  ,  while   7...d6  is weaker than the others.These continuations will be examined in turn. }
7... d6 { allows White an ideal set up } 8. O-O Qc7 9. Re1
{ Black has neglected the development of the Kingside, so he must constantly worry about the tactical strike Nd5. In addition, the exposed pawn on b5 if it does not show its true role in time, becomes a 'Trojan Horse' for White, because it could be undermined with a4! }
9... Nd7
{ This could be an interesting waiting move and attempt against e5 break especially if White does not know the following critical idea coped with a4 and Nd5. Black hopes for Be7 @@StartBracket@@delaying Nf6 in order to avoid e5@@EndBracket@@ and he would like to complete development somehow without allowing e5 at all costs. }
10. a4
{ Once again White goes for typical break on the Queen side, that forces Black to react with 10...ba4 or 10...b4. As we have learned already, before taking any action, White should always go with this move. If 10...ba4 it would give White 11.Ra4! which could harass Bb7 with Rb4-Rb7  @@StartBracket@@known trick from famous game Kasparov - Shirov@@EndBracket@@ and it turns out that plan is very dangerous along with Bg2. }
10... b4 11. Na2
{ Quite logical reaction by White that threatens b4 pawn and in a way forces Black to create new weakness on b5 and along the c-file. }
11... a5 12. c3
{ An important move in similar Sicilian positions! White opens up c-file, tries to get the knight back into the game, reach b5 square and also to get the full activity after Bg5 and Rc1. }
12... bxc3 13. Nxc3
{ All of a sudden, b5 turns out to be unbelievably weak and there is no piece to protect that square and the weak d6 pawn. }
13... Ngf6 14. Ncb5
{ There is a nice point behind this move. It kicks the Qc7 away with the tempo, points out the d6 weakness, opens up the c-file and gives White Bg5 followed by Rc1. }
14... Qb8 15. Bg5 Nc5 16. e5
{ With this typical central break, White opened up the position, gave his pieces maximum activity and demolished Black's King in a razor attack in Kupreichik,V - Petrosian,A Lvov 1988.   16...Bxg2  does not seem to be working in a view of  17.exf6  ,   16...dxe5  does not work due to  17.Nc6!  ,  while the jump   16...Nfe4  leads to immense complications in the event of  17.exd6! }

13. Be2
{ This is a typical idea by White in positions where the pawn on g4 has already been pushed forward. By playing Be2, we overprotect our strong pawns on f3 and g4, and support a future h4-h5. In case of   13.Bxb5?!  Don't you dare even think to grab this pawn! It will give Black amazing compensation after  13...Bxb5  14.Ncxb5  Nc4  with great counter chances for Black mainly thanks to the open b-file and weakened c4 square. }
13... Nc4
{ Logically following Black's plan. This move forces Bxc4, where Black can either play ...bxc4, opening the b-file, or ...Rxc4, preserving some future ideas of an exchange sacrifice on c3. }
14. Bxc4
{ Compared to the main line of the Dragon variation, here White saved a tempo with the light squared bishop, but lost one tempo since the Queen had moved from d4 to d2. After the dust has settled, we might notice that White's chances seem to be more promising mainly thanks to prophylactic defensive moves that are typical for the Chinese Dragon  (Ka1, Rb1, Nde2)  . }
14... bxc4
{ Black would like to launch an attack doubling his rooks on the b-file assisted with Qa5. Nevertheless, we are about to see two nice prophylactic defensive moves complete with Bh6 in order to remove that smile off their face... There is a quite normal possibility of transposing into one of the lines that is considered to be the refutation of the Dragon variation with 14...Rc4?! although after 15.b3! White has upper hands! For example 15...Rc5? 16.Ne6! or if 15...b4!? according to the latest analysis, 16.bc4 positions favor White! }
15. Nde2
{ This move has quite a few ideas. First, it removes the Knight from d4, which overprotects the knight on c3. Secondly, it prepares Bd4 to oppose the bishop on g7  (Black's major attacking piece)  . }
15... Rb8
{ This goes along with Black's original plan. While Black has many other possible ideas here such as ...Bc6 and ...Qa5, our ideas will be the same along all lines. }
16. Ka1
{ King moves onto a1! It allows White to play Rb1 afterwards  (with better protection of the possibly weak b2 square)  . In practice, Ka1, Rb1, and Bd4 or Bh6 turned out to be absolutely adequate defensive  (and attacking!)  ideas... }
16... Qa5
{ With the idea of 17...Bg4! Watch out guys, this is a position similar to the Dragon and Black is always very tricky. For example, right now threat might be Bg4 followed by Ne4 with a crushing attack by Black. If white parries that out, Black would probably be happy with doubling his rooks on the b-file where he would try to organize promising counter chances... }
17. Bh6
{ The resulting position is much easier to play for White, as after Nde2  (strengthens the knight on c3)  , Bh6  (exchanges Black's best fighter, stopping any attacks along the long diagonal)  , the defensive idea Ka1 with Rb1  (if necessary)  and slowly White builds an attack on the kingside with future ideas of h4-h5. }

Black can continue in various ways, but they all lead to inferior positions due to the weakness of the d5 pawn. For example, if White goes with   10.Be3  this would be the standard and the best placement of the Bishop in this type of position. White has Nxc6 and Bd4 as one of the plans. By moving to positions with hanging pawns, Black will have new headaches. Practice has shown that Black has fewer problems with the White Bishop on f4 or g5, although after  10...Bg4!  simple and powerful move Black develops a piece with tempo and gets good counter chances  11.Qd3  is the most active and seemingly dangerous for Black because weaknesses are created on b5 and f5.

This of course has both advantages and disadvantages. The open file is ideal for a White Rook on e1. Without a pawn on e2, Black may embarrass the Queen on d1 with Bg4! So perhaps the best medicine for this is the 9th move h3! but it is also logical to continue to develop the Bishop on @@StartBracket@@e3, f4 or g5@@EndBracket@@. }

White's plan is g4, followed by Ng3, Nce2 and g5 to begin the pawn storm and Kingside assault by pushing the Kingside pawns and by directing all minor pieces organizing the attack. What makes this position easier for White are relatively easy and familiar plans with most of the action  on the King side, so Black's King will need to look to safety, which makes Black's games way more difficult and impractical. }

6. Rb1

{ Quite complicated and messy position worth of trying with White pieces since d4, Be3 and Bf1 are about to be done. In my opinion, it seems better for White.

{ White intends to double the rooks and possibly go with Rh4. However, the real plan is:   18.Qf3 !  Qc7  19.Ne5  →  with a very active game and solid chances for initiative. }
18... Be7
{ Black once again had   18...f6 !  19.Rae1  Qd7  ⇆  with the idea of Qf5 or Qf7 }
19. Rae1
{ White is fully activated, forcing a useful exchange of dark squared Bishops for himself. }
19... Bf6 20. Bxf6 Qxf6 21. Ne5
{ One of the typical positions where the Knight dominates over the opposing Bishop thanks to a better pawn structure. }
21... Bf5 22. R4e3 Rac8
{ Worthy of consideration was an exchange sacrifice   22...Bxc2 !?  23.Nd7  Qf5  24.Qxf5  Bxf5  25.Nxf8  Kxf8  +=  Black has a Bishop and pawn for an exchange, but also chances for a draw, thanks to the broken pawn structure and the fact that all White pawns are on the color of the opponent's Bishop! }
23. d3
{ It is now obvious that the Knight is a more promising piece than the opposing Bishop. Just look at c4, c6 and d7 and the maximum activity of White pieces and understand that Black must be more concerned about defense than active play. }
23... Be6 24. h4 Rfd8 25. Qg5
{ The pawn on the g5 will strengthen the White's position. } 25... Rd4 26. Nc4
Qxg5 27. hxg5 Rb8 28. Ne5 Rc8 29. g6
{ White noticed that the plan to switch Knight to g5 gave him the best chance, so he freed up the g5 square and eliminated h-pawn. A simple and good plan was   29.Rf1 !?  with idea f4-f5. }
29... hxg6 30. Nxg6 Kh7 31. Ne5 g6 32. Rg3 Rd6 33. Nf3 Kg7 34. Ng5 Rh8
{ Better was   34...Bf5  although it is after  35.Re7  Rd7  36.Rxd7  Bxd7  37.Re3  +=  White retains slightly better chances. }
35. Rge3 Bc8 { Necessary was   35...Bd5  ± } 36. Re7
{ Now it's all a matter of technique } 36... Rf6 37. Rc7 Rf5 38. Ne4 Re5 39.
Re3 Be6 40. f4 Reh5 { 40...Rf5  41.Ng5  +- } 41. Ng3
{ Double strike. Black resigns because he is about to lose a Bishop on e6 or a Rook on h5. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 4. Nf3
{ This became recently an idea that was used literally by almost all top GM's including Carlsen, Caruana, Grischuk, Andreikin and others, previously   4.Bc4  was the most popular move by White, but it led to unclear positions. The same idea like 4.Nf3, is seen in other openings as well @@StartBracket@@Grand Prix, the Rossolimo, English opening reversed colors@@EndBracket@@. White does not want to waste time with his Bishop @@StartBracket@@it anyways went on b5 to be swapped off for Nc6@@EndBracket@@, so White rushes with his development. So, here we have a critical position from where Black can opt for five @@StartBracket@@5@@EndBracket@@ different plans:   4...g6  - Mainly used by players who like g6 structures and positions with the Bishop on g7   4...e6  - Very common choice, mainly used by Taimanov and Kan variation players, with flexible plans for Black   4...Nf6  - A line that gives White relatively nice positions with lots of tactical opportunities   4...a6  - Lately the most popular and seems like the critical line }
4... a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. O-O g6 7. e5 Bg7 8. Re1 f6 9. Be4 fxe5 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11.
Nxe5 Nf6 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4 O-O 14. Bg5 Qe8 15. Rad1
{ For comments up to this point, check the theoretical section. White has no pawns in the center and lacks the Bishop pair, but the maximum activity and coordination of his figures obviously have greater significance. The position would be a good example for A. Nimzovic's book 'My System' in which one of the strategic themes is the control of space in the center by pieces instead of pawns. }
15... Kh8
{ Black wants to get rid of the centralized Knight on e5 with d6, so he moves away from checks to c4. However, it is better to activate the Ra8 first and thus prevent from choking after Qb6!   15...Rb8 !  16.b3  and there follows an unusual but defensive move  16...Rb7  +=  with the idea of expelling the White pieces with h6 and then to play d6.   16...Kh8 ?!  White has a simple plan with  17.Bxf6  Bxf6  18.Ne4  ±  with the threat of Nf6 and after logical  18...Bg7  he might go into attack with  19.Ng5  ↑  with idea Qh4!? }
16. Qb6
{ One of the crucial moves in this game! White has a very specific threat of Qc7 to pressure the d7 pawn or trap the rook on a8 with Na4-b6. Black no longer has a useful move because he is in some kind of positional stalemate. }
16... h6 17. Bh4 e6 18. Bxf6 Rxf6
{ A little more resistant was   18...Bxf6  but there follows  19.Qc5 !  with the idea of Nxg6 or Qxf8, seems like Black is facing unsolvable problems.  19...Kg8  The trade does not ease Black's position   19...Bxe5  20.Qxe5+  +-  with the next Ne4 also leads to a strategically easily lost position, because Black, in addition to undeveloped pieces and poor pawn structure, also has a lot of weaknesses in his position.  20.Ne4  +-  is similar to the game. }
19. Ne4
{ And due to numerous threats and weaknesses on f6 and d6, Black resigned. 1-0 }

{ This adventurous continuation, usually chosen by Najdorf defense players @@StartBracket@@naturally, 2...Nc6 excludes the Najdorf@@EndBracket@@, gives White the opportunity to achieve a development advantage and choose the system in which a6 is worth the least. Lately, lots of top players used this 2...a6 move against 2.Nc3 and at some point it even started to cause White lots of problems since Black had very strong results with it especially against the line with   3.f4!  Although, I am pretty sure that after you thoroughly check the following analysis, that you have no reason to be scared at all anymore and that the   3.Nge2  Chameleon line will become one of your favorite weapons! }

{ This became recently an idea that was used literally by almost all top GM's including Carlsen, Caruana, Grischuk, Andreikin and others, previously   4.Bc4  was the most popular move by White, but it led to unclear positions. The same idea like 4.Nf3, is seen in other openings as well @@StartBracket@@Grand Prix, the Rossolimo, English opening reversed colors@@EndBracket@@. White does not want to waste time with his Bishop @@StartBracket@@it anyways went on b5 to be swapped off for Nc6@@EndBracket@@, so White rushes with his development. So, here we have a critical position from where Black can opt for five @@StartBracket@@5@@EndBracket@@ different plans:   4...g6  - Mainly used by players who like g6 structures and positions with the Bishop on g7   4...e6  - Very common choice, mainly used by Taimanov and Kan variation players, with flexible plans for Black   4...Nf6  - A line that gives White relatively nice positions with lots of tactical opportunities   4...a6  - Lately the most popular and seems like the critical line }

{ This adventurous continuation, usually chosen by Najdorf defense players @@StartBracket@@naturally, 2...Nc6 excludes the Najdorf@@EndBracket@@, gives White the opportunity to achieve a development advantage and choose the system in which a6 is worth the least. Lately, lots of top players used this 2...a6 move against 2.Nc3 and at some point it even started to cause White lots of problems since Black had very strong results with it especially against the line with   3.f4!  Although, I am pretty sure that after you thoroughly check the following analysis, that you have no reason to be scared at all anymore and that the   3.Nge2  Chameleon line will become one of your favorite weapons! }
