1. d4 f5
{ Here is a more detailed list what this course covers and what is left out.  - 2. c4, 2. Nf3 and 2. g3   These moves will be covered in a separate course aimed only at Leningrad Dutch players. There is very little overlap after these moves for Leningrad Dutch  (Nf6, g6, Bg7, d6)  , classical Dutch  (Nf6, e6, d6, Be7)  and Stonewall  (Nf6, e6, d5, c6, Bd6)  players.   - 2. Nc3   Here I cover the 2... Nf6 3.Bg5 d5 system. It is Black's best answer to 2.Nc3. In the 4. Bxf6 line I chose not to cover the popular setup with Nc6 and Qd7 but the not so well-know but equally good setup with c6 which as far as I know has not been properly covered in any of the books I have read. Usually only a few lines are given in which Black played at least one dubious move.   - 2. Bf4   Against this move I chose to give two completely different setups. One close in spirit to the Leningrad Dutch and one resembling the classical Dutch.   The system based on the Leningrad Dutch is a bit risky if White chooses the Bf4, e3, Nc3 move order and plays h4 as soon as Black plays g6. The problem is that in order to avoid the dangerous exchange sacrifice h5 Nxh5, Rxh5 which gives White a strong attack, Black is forced to lose a tempo with h6 which also weakens the square g6. I still play this system exclusively but I could not give this system as the only repertoire choice with a clean conscience.  The system based on the classical Dutch is solid and likely the reason why 2. Bf4  (without an early Nf3)  is not more popular among stronger players.   - 2. e4, the Staunton Gambit  The Staunton Gambit is covered in two chapters. The first covers the slightly dubious 4. g4 and the harmless 4. f3 system. The most challenging move 4. Bg5 is covered in a separate chapter. I chose 4...g6 as the repertoire move. It is less popular than 4... Nc6 but in my opinion at least as good. Here studying the lines with 5.h4 is important.   - 2. Bg5   There are two good answers to 2.Bg5, 2...g6 and 2...h6 followed by g5. The first is solid but has quite a bit of theory and a number of tricky transpositions while the second is a bit more risky but playable and currently my main choice. Here I would make sure that I remember the key lines and key ideas in the 4.e4 system because Black's positions tend to be a bit dangerous in exchange for the piece White is forced to sacrifice for some, but probably insufficient, compensation.  - 2. e3 and 2. c3   These moves are not covered because    - concrete analysis is difficult because there are too many transpositions     - almost always Nf3 is played very soon    - pretty much every sensible setup for Black equalizes.   My suggestion is to play any setup you like to play in the Dutch  (I play either the Leningrad with an early Nc6 to prepare e5, or a Queen's Indian setup with Nf6, e6, Be7, b6 and Bb7)  and take it from there.   - 2. h3   Here I only consider lines starting with 2. h3 Nf6 3. g4 because after other moves White is simply a tempo down on regular lines with the possible exception of some lines in the Bf4 systems. The repertoire choice is 3...d5 after which White tends to be a bit behind in development.  - 2. g4   Actually, more reasonable than it may look at first sight and rather popular among stronger players. Here I suggest to take on g4 but ignore a subsequent h3 to avoid opening lines on the kingside. Black should quickly develop here with Nf6, Nc6 and aim for castling queenside.  - 2. Qd3   Here I give two options, the surprising 2... Nc6 and going for a Stonewall. I play 2... Nc6 since I learned about this move. But since White can force Black to sacrifice a piece for sufficient compensation with 3. Qxf5 I propose the Stonewall as a safe alternative. The white queen is misplaced on d3 in the Stonewall. Unfortunately, there is no reasonable way for Black to go for a Leningrad setup against 2. Qd3.  - 2. Nh3   Here I suggest g6 which will very likely transpose to the mainlines in the Leningrad Dutch after g3 and Bg2. Attempts by White to avoid such a transposition are discussed in this short chapter. If you prefer the classical Dutch or the Stonewall then 2... e6 is also perfectly fine. The flexible move 2... Nf6 is possible but it gives White the independent option 3. Bg5 which is discussed in the introduction to the chapter on 2. Nh3.  - 2. h4  This move is not covered here. 2. h4 is a good move if Black chooses a Leningrad setup. But against a classical Dutch or a Stonewall it is at best a loss of a tempo. I probably would try to play a Stonewall without c6, castle long and try to open lines against the white king with h6 and g5  (in case White castles kingside)  .  - 1. Nf3 f5  A chapter I added because the beta-testers told me to do so. Here I discuss the move 2.d3 aiming for a quick e4 which can be dangerous if Black is unprepared. }

1. d4 f5
{ - 2. Bf4  If you play 2... Nf6 and e6 I would look at all lines. They all look reasonably popular. If you play 2... Nf6 and g6 then I would not worry much about the critical line 1. d4 f5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 g6 4. Nc3 d6 5. h4 it has only occurred in 4 games. I would concentrate on lines with an early c3 or h3.  - 2. e3  The standard Leningrad setup seems to be doing pretty well here.  - 2. Nc3  After 3. Bg5 d5 is much less popular than the weaker 3...e6. After d5, 4. Bxf6 is the most popular move but the setup with an early Bd3 and Qf3 is rarely played. Nonetheless I would practice the variations with 4. Bxf6 and 4.e3 marked important.  - 2. Bg5  Here the tricky e4 lines are not so often played. I think it is enough to know that at move 6 Black has to play d5 if White plays Bc4 and the reason for doing so  (blocking the bishop's control of f7 with tempo)  . However, I would practice the e3 and Bg3 lines. The most common line here is 4. Bg3 f4??  which loses after 5.e3. So perhaps the most import piece of advice is do not play 4...f4.  - Staunton gambit   4. Bg5 is the most popular way to play the Staunton gambit. But the repertoire move g6 is played in only about 10% of the games. If it is played then White responds most of the time with the harmless 5.Bxf6 and sometimes with 5. f3. The tricky 5.h4 is rare. So looking once at the introduction of the 4. Bg5 chapter to learn about 5.h4 is probably enough. I would practice all the other lines marked important and perhaps all lines with 5. Bxf6.  4. f3 is quite popular as well, especially lines with an early Bxf6. Here I would also practice all lines marked important and in addition all lines with an early Bxf6.  4. g4 is rarely played. Knowing that 4...h6 should be played is probably enough.  
- h3  I would look at the important lines. h3 and g4 has been played a few times but the repertoire line 2. h3 Nf6 3. g4 d5 is rare. Here by far the most popular move is 4. g5. So I would focus on the lines with an early g5 by White.  - Nh3  This has been played a few times but looking at the introduction to that chapter once may be enough.  - g4  This is occasionally played. Most popular is 2. g4 fxg4 3. h3 d5 4. hxg4. Lightly studying these lines should be enough.  
- Qd3  This is almost never played, so skipping the Qd3 chapters should be ok.  - 1. Nf3 f5 2.e4 fxe5 3. Ng5   This is rather popular but neither of the repertoire suggestions seems to be well known. 3... d5 4. d3 Qd6! has only been played once. So deep knowledge is not necessary. I think understanding why 4... Qd6 is necessary to prepare h6 is enough. But even better may be 3... Nc6. Most White players play 4. Nxe4 and after d5 and e5 Black is already better.  - 1. Nf3 f5 2.d3 Nc6   This is rare but if it occurs then 3. e4 is almost always played, so you can at least skip the 3. d4 lines. }

I think it may be enough to know that at move 6 Black has to play d5 if White plays Bc4 and the reason for doing so  (blocking the bishop's control of f7 with tempo)  but I would look at the lines at least once to make sure that you have seen the kind of positions which can arise at least once. However, I would focus on practicing the e3 and Bg3 lines, especially those with an early h5 by White. Still the most common line here is 4. Bg3 f4??  which loses after 5.e3. So at least remember not to play 4...f4.  - Staunton gambit   4. Bg5 is by far the most popular way to play the Staunton gambit. But the repertoire move g6 is played in only about 15% of the games. If it is played then White responds most of the time with the harmless 5.Bxf6 and sometimes with 5. f3. But the tricky 5.h4 is occasionally played as well.

Lightly studying these lines is probably enough.  - Qd3  This is rarely played, but if it is then after 2...d5 the moves 3.g4 and 3. Nc3 are the most popular. So playing 2...d5 with the idea of a likely transposition to the 2.g4 lines is possible. But I would at least have a rough understanding of the Stonewall to be safe. 2...Nc6 has not been played.   - 1. Nf3 f5 2. e4 fxe5 3. Ng5   This is rather popular but neither of the repertoire suggestions seems to be well known among Black players. 3... d5 4. d3 Qd6! has been played a few times. Learning the lines to the very end is probably not necessary but I would at least try to remember the first moves. If you play 3... Nc6 then 4. Nxe4 is played quite often  (after d5 and e5 Black is already better)  but the better 4. d3 is most popular. So feeling comfortable with 4. d3 e3 5. Bxe3 e5 is probably a good idea.   - 1. Nf3 f5 2. d3 Nc6   This is rare but if it occurs then 3. e4 is almost always played, so you can at least skip the 3. d4 lines. }

The dubious moves Nd7 and Bd6 on move 8 of the mainline given in the introduction to the chapter on 2. Nc3 are the most popular moves for Black. So I would study probably all lines on 4.

{ This move is the most precise, something which took me a while to understand.

If there is a knight on d7 and no white knight on f4 then Qg3 is good because if Black plays Qe7 or Qf6 to prepare castling then Qc7 is annoying for Black as in   9...Bf7  10.O-O-O  Nd7  11.g4  hxg4  12.hxg4  fxg4  13.Qxg4  f5  14.Qg3  Rxh1  15.Rxh1  Qf6  16.Qc7    Conclusion.

1. d4 f5 2. Nc3
{ White wants to play e4. If Black does nothing to stop this then White     will get a good position. }
2... Nf6
{ 2...g6  This move is too dangerous. White can immediately attack      with  3.h4  Even the simple   3.e4  fxe4  4.Nxe4  is better for White. The          attack with h4-h5 can be kept in reserve.  3...Bg7  4.h5  followed by e4 is good for White.   2...d5  3.Bf4  This position may be playable but I don't see any      active plans for Black. For example  3...e6  4.e3  Nf6  5.Nf3  Bb4  6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  followed by c4 and White is a bit better. }
3. Bg5 { Again threatening 4. e4. } 3... d5
{ Black weakens e5 but stops e4 and here the bishop is not so well      placed on g5. Ne4 is often possible if White chooses a quieter setup      and if White captures on f6 we have a pawn covering the e5 square. }
4. Bxf6
{ Because Black has stopped the threat e4 White now wants to exploit     the doubled pawns. }
4... exf6
{ Black gets a stable center after Be6-Bf7, c6 and g6 and h5 when      necessary. Putting all the pawns on white squares takes away most      squares from Black's light-squared bishop but the bishop does make it      more difficult for White to play c4 and if White tries to open the      kingside with a quick g4 then the bishop protects key squares and gets     breathing room again. If White does nothing then Black plays Nd7, Bd6      or Bh6, Qe7 and O-O-O with a good position. The setup with Nd7 and c6      which I recommend here is not so popular but it is perfectly fine if      you play precisely for the next few moves. The key is to keep the      bishop on f8, play Be6 followed by g6, c6 and Bf7 and h5 if needed and     only then play Nd7. Other move orders give White the chance to open      the kingside with moves like Bd3, Qf3, h3 and g4. The move order I      recommend here has not been considered in any of the books I      consulted. }
5. e3 Be6
{ One of the key moves of this variation. The light-squared bishop is      needed to defend the kingside. The bishop will go quickly to f7 to      protect the pawn on g6 which in turn protects the pawn on f5. Other      important moves for Black are a quick g6 if f5 is attacked to allow      the bishop to retreat to f7, a quick c6 to defend d5, replying with h5     to h4 and putting the knight on d7. }
6. Qf3 g6
{ Black protects f5 in order to allow the bishop to retreat to f7.  Here the move Nc6 with the follow-up Qd7, Ne7, O-O-O is much more      popular. I played this system as well until I noticed that the      reasons, for calling the system I propose here inferior, were      incorrect. I think both systems are playable, but when given a choice      I tend to prefer the lesser known system. As a final bonus we are able     to avoid   6...Nc6  7.Bb5 }
7. Bd3 c6 { Protecting d5 to prepare Nd7 without allowing Nxd5. } 8. Nge2 h5
{ 8...Nd7 ?  9.h3  White prepares g4.  9...h5  With g6 unprotected      Black cannot stop g4.  10.g4  hxg4  11.hxg4  fxg4  12.Bxg6+  and White is      clearly better.   8...Bd6 ?  9.Nf4  Bf7  10.h3  h5  Not enough to stop g4 because the      rook on h8 hangs with check after  11.g4  hxg4  12.hxg4  Rxh1+  Black has     no time for fxg4 because the rook on h8 can be taken with check. But      if the bishop stays on f8 then fxg4 is possible in this line.   8...Bf7  This move is possible as well but slightly imprecise. After  9.h3  h5  we transpose to @@StartBracket@@8... h5 9. h3      Bf7  (@@StartBracket@@variation:8238582/#/9/w@@EndBracket@@.) }
9. Nf4 Bf7 10. h3 Nd7
{ Since the bishop is already on f7, defending g6 and not allowing Bxg6     with check after fxg4, Black does not need the square d7 for his king      any longer and can play Nd7. }
11. O-O-O Rg8
{ Black is ready for g4 @@StartBracket@@take twice and play f5@@EndBracket@@ . One tactical motif      to keep in mind is Ne5 / dxe5 fxe5 followed by e4. Qe7 or Qc7 are also     possible instead of Rg8 but since protecting g6 is usually necessary      and the best square for the queen is not yet clear I prefer Rg8. }
12. g4 hxg4 13. hxg4 fxg4 14. Qxg4 f5
{ followed by either Qf6, Bd6 or Bd6, Nf6 and Qe7 before castling      queenside. }

For instance  18.gxf5   18.g5  h5  Black can keep the kingside closed.  18...Qa3  19.Bb1  exf5  followed by Qd6 and I don't think White has      enough compensation. }

They lead to      rather quiet positions and are worth investigating if you don't like      the sharper lines I suggest. The one important point to remember here      is that you can and should wait with taking the bishop as long as it      does not threaten to escape.

5. Bg3 d6
{ I like the setup with Bg7 and d6 because it does not seem to be so      well-known. Here the natural move   5...f4 ?  is a mistake. After  6.Bxf4  gxf4  7.Qh5+  Kf8  8.Qf5+  Black has to return the piece with  8...Nf6  because   8...Ke8  loses after  9.Be2  9.e5  White regains the piece with the better position. }
6. Bc4 { White's most ambitious move. } 6... d5
{ White has four options. He has to decide how to take on d5 @@StartBracket@@bishop or     pawn@@EndBracket@@ and also whether or not to include the check on h5. Taking with      the bishop and including the queen check looks most logical to me.  Black's idea is that after both exd5 and Bxd5 e6, Bb3 the move f4      works because the light-squared bishop's diagonal has been closed. The     immediate   6...f4 ?  does not work because White has  7.Bxf4 !  gxf4  8.Qh5+  Kd7  9.Be6+  Kc6  10.Qd5+  Kb6  11.Qb3+  and mate in a few more      moves }

{ If White does not take on f4 then Black should not take on g3      unless White threatens to escape with the bishop after playing for      instance h3, or if Black is sure that taking is preferable to allowing     a future Bxf4. The main reason is that once Black takes on g3 White      has the choice of opening either the h- or f-file to strengthen his      attack. If Black does not take immediately White is forced to spend at     least a tempo on forcing Black to take, time which Black can use to      complete his development. For instance   9.c3  Nf6  10.Qe2  Nxd5  is good      for Black.   9.d6 ?!  Qe8  10.Qf3  White cannot afford to exchange queens.  10...Nc6 !  11.c3  cxd6  is very good for Black. }

If Black castles      short quickly then White's most dangerous plan is to play Nf4 and      after knights are exchanged on f4 play for a quick e4, possibly      prepared by f3. }

1. Nf3 f5 2. d3
{ This is White's most unpleasant option. The idea is to play a quick e4 to get positions typical for the open games but with a premature f5 by Black. d4 transposes to the mainline Leningrad Dutch.    2.b3  d6  3.Bb2   3.d4  is likely to transpose to the mainline.  3...e5  Black can continue with Nf6, g6, Bg7, O-O and Nc6 to get a comfortable version of the Leningrad.     2.e4  fxe4  3.Ng5  now Black has two options: the safe Nc6 and the risky and more ambitious d5.  3...d5  The move I usually play. Black wants to play h6 to force the knight back to h3 while keeping the extra pawn.   3...Nc6  4.d3  White hopes to develop his bishop to d3 with an attack on the light squares.  4...e3  5.Bxe3  e5  Black can develop freely with Nf6, Be7 or Bb4 if Nc3 has been played, and O-O. The positions resemble positions from the open games in which White chose some unambitious system.  4.d3  Qd6!  prepares h6 because now Black can answer Qh5+ with g6.   4...h6?  5.Qh5+  wins for White.  5.Nc3   5.dxe4  h6  6.Qh5+  g6  7.Qh4  Bg7  8.Nf3  Bf6  is a bit better for Black.  5...h6  6.Nb5  Qc6  7.dxe4  hxg5  8.exd5  Qd7  with a complicated game. I prefer Black but White has attacking chances for the piece. }
2... Nc6
{ 2...d6  3.e4  this is the idea of 2. d3  e5  4.Nc3  and now, regardless whether Black plays Nc6 or Nf6 White can play exf5 and d4 with a better position.   2...Nf6  3.e4  d6   3...fxe4 ?  4.dxe4  Nxe4  5.Bd3  is good for White.  4.exf5  Bxf5  5.d4  Qd7  is Pruissers interesting suggestion. But I don't fully trust Black's position. }
3. d4
{ White loses a tempo but Black's knight on c6 looks awkward.   3.e4  e5  4.Nc3   4.d4  transposes to a line from the Vienna game but with colors reversed. For instance  fxe4  5.Nxe5  d6   5...Nf6  leads to more complicated positions.  6.Nxc6  bxc6  is roughly equal.  4...Bb4  is fine for Black. }
3... e6
{ Black's best option is probably to choose a classical Dutch setup with Nf6, Be7 and O-O where the extra move Nc6 fits well, but I believe going for a Leningrad setup is also reasonable because the pawn on e6 takes the sting out of an early d5. }

1. d4 f5 2. Bf4 Nf6
{ Black wants to play the typical Leningrad moves next: d6, g6, Bg7 and O-O. One problem is that as long as White does not play Nf3 and block the path of the queen to h5 the attack with h2-h4-h5 is quite dangerous for Black. Black has the following options:   - play d6 and g6 anyway and answer h4 with h6 to be ready to answer h5 with g5   - play d6 and then e6 first and if White plays Nf3 then play g6, Bg7 and Qe7   - play e6, Be7, b6, Bb7 and perhaps a5, Na6 in the spirit of the Queen's Indian.   I have played all three setups without having a clear favorite. Here I am suggesting to play g6 as soon as possible. Mostly because it is the most flexible option if White plays an early Nf3. }
3. e3
{ 3.Nc3  This move poses the biggest problem if Black wants to use a Leningrad setup. The safest move here is e6. The idea is to fight for the square e4 with Bb4 and if White stops this with a3 then Black can switch to a classical Dutch with d6, or play a6 to stop Nb5 and then play d5 and c5 giving Black a good game. This is the option I suggest if you find the system suggested in this chapter too risky. Since the most straightforward move g6 is too dangerous I suggest to play the semi-waiting move d6 before committing to a Leningrad setup. If White plays Nf3 next then g6 is fine. If White continues to prepare g6 with h4 then we have to give up on g6, or at least postpone it.  3...d6   3...g6 ?!  This is move simply does not work here.  4.h4  Simple and strong.  4...h6 ?!  Often a good move with the intention of answering h5 with g5. Unfortunately here it fails because g6 is weak.   4...d6  Allowing h5 in the Dutch after g6 has been played is often dangerous. Here it leads to a clear advantage for White.  5.h5  Nxh5  6.Rxh5  An exchange sacrifice every Leningrad player needs to be aware of. Usually there is no quick mate but White's attack almost plays itself: e3, Qxh5, Nf3, O-O-O, Bc4, Rh1 etc.  6...gxh5  7.e3  is very dangerous for Black.   4...Bg7  The comments after d6 apply verbatim.  5.h5  Nxh5  6.Rxh5  gxh5  7.e3  5.Qd3 !  The refutation.  5...d6   5...Bg7  6.Qg3 !  with a double attack on c7 and g6.  6.e4  Black's position is just awful.  4.h4   4.e3  g6  transposes to 3. e3 g6   4.Qd2  does not make much sense here.  4...Nbd7  5.O-O-O  preventing e5  5...c6  with b5 to follow looks unpleasant for White.  4...e6  This can lead to positions resembling the classical Dutch but where White's h4 is not really useful.  5.e3  Qe7 !?  with the idea Nc6 and e5 is interesting and my suggestion if you look for something unusual.   5...Be7  6.Nf3  O-O  This is the sensible choice and gives an improved version of the classical Dutch. I would probably fianchetto my bishop next and then decide where to put the knight.  6.Nf3  Nc6  followed by Bd7 and the perhaps e5. But since White hasn't really shown his hand yet waiting for a few moves with a6, g6 and h6 is also possible. I would keep the decision in which direction to castle open as long as possible. }
3... g6 4. h4
{ 4.Nc3  d6  5.h4   5.Bc4  e6  Closing the bishop diagonal. Black plans to continue with Bg7, Qe7, O-O and Nc6. Often after the king has moved to h8 or h7, in case h7-h6 has been played, Black plays e5 as well.  6.Nf3  Bg7  7.O-O  Qe7  is about equal   5.Nf3  Bg7  6.d5  Probably too ambitious. White stops Nc6 and e6 and hopes to exploit the weakened e6 square.  6...O-O  7.Bc4  h6  stopping Ng5 and preparing an escape for the king.  8.O-O  Kh7  followed by c6. Black is a bit better since White's pieces, especially the bishops, do not have any targets but rather are targets themselves. Black, on the other hand has the clear plan of expanding on the queenside with c6, b5 and perhaps b4 and Qb6.  5...h6  transposes to 4. h4 h6 5. Nc3 d6.   4.Bc4  Bg7  5.Nd2  e6  as before the bishop diagonal should be closed. Black can still decide whether to go for a queen's indian setup with b6 and Bb7 or to play O-O, Kh8, Nc6, d6, Qe7 and e5.  6.c3  O-O  7.h4  Nc6  with mutual chances. }
4... h6
{ 4...d6  5.h5  is another variation of the exchange sacrifice.  5...Nxh5   5...Bg7  6.h6  is good for White.  6.Rxh5  gxh5  7.Qxh5+  Kd7  8.Qxf5+  is good for White.   4...Bg7  5.h5  and by now you know the rest. }
5. Nc3
{ White has another option which may lead to a small plus.   5.Nh3  d6  6.Bg3  Nh5  allowing Nf4 and h4-h5 is not pleasant for Black.  7.Bh2  Bg7  8.Be2  O-O  Black sacrifices a pawn for speedy development.  9.Bxh5  gxh5  10.Qxh5  e5  11.Nc3   11.dxe5  dxe5  gives Black compensation for the pawn since the pile-up of White's pieces on the h-file does not make much sense without control over the square f4.  11...exd4  Black regains the pawn but gives White control over f4.  12.exd4  Qe8+  13.Qe2  Bxd4  14.O-O-O  Qxe2  15.Nxe2  Bg7  is playable but more comfortable for White. }
5... d6 6. Qf3
{ Demuth gave this position as the reason for prefering 3... e6 against 3. Nc3. He may be right but matters are far from simple.   6.Bd3  White plans to open the center with e4 which would expose the weak pawn on g6.  6...Nc6  A good response. Black prepares e5 and plans to answer e4 with Nb4 and a subsequent exf5 with Nxd3+ and Bxf5.  7.Nf3  Bg7  This position is roughly balanced. Black plans to castle next. }
6... Nc6
{ Black plans to complete his development with e6, Qe7, Bg7 and either O-O or Bd7 and O-O-O. The move e5 is also always a possibility. White has three main moves here. Attack g6 with Qg3, disrupt Black's plan immediately or castle queenside to wait for Black's next move. }
7. d5
{ Probably not the strongest move but nonetheless critical. If Black cannot defend here then the system has to be abandoned.   7.O-O-O  A logical move but now Black can prevent d5 with e6.  7...e6  8.Bc4   8.e4  may cause problems for Black  Qe7  9.Qg3  Rg8  10.Kb1  Bd7 =   7.Qg3  If Black has already put the bishop on g7 then Kf7 is the only option. But here we can also play the simpler Rg8.  7...Rg8  8.O-O-O   8.d5  Nb4  9.O-O-O  e5  10.dxe6  Bxe6  is fine for Black  11.Bb5+  c6  12.Bxd6  Qa5  13.Qe5  looks scary but Black is fine after  13...Kf7  14.Bd3  Nxa2+  15.Nxa2  Qxa2  16.Bxf8  Rgxf8  8...e6  Black plans to continue with Qe7, Bd7 and O-O-O with a balanced position. }
7... Nb4 { wins a tempo. } 8. O-O-O Bg7
{ A bit surprising since Rg8 is no longer effective. The point here is that White has castled queenside already and has opened the long diagonal for the bishop. }
9. Qg3 O-O { Kf7 is also possible but I prefer O-O here. } 10. a3
{ 10.Qxg6  Ng4  The point. Because White castled already f2 is hanging and the white queen is in trouble after Rf6, Bd7 and Be8. }
10... a5 { Another move which is fun to play. } 11. axb4 axb4 12. Nb1 Ne4
{ Black has a strong attack which gives him enough compensation for the piece. White will have trouble to untangle the pieces on the kingside. A likely continuation is   13.Qxg6  Rf6  14.Qh5  Nxf2  and Black is better after taking on h1. }

3. e3 g6 4. Nc3 d6 5. Bc4
{ Bc4 is not so dangerous, but Black should not play d5 but rather e6 and Qe7. After a later O-O and Kh8 Black can then continue with e5. The bishop on c4 is not only not dangerous but it also disturbs White play on the queenside. White cannot play c4 and conversely many typical moves by Black, for example, c6 and b5, Nc6-a5 or Nc6-e5, come with tempo. }

Black has the following options:   - play g6 anyway and answer h4 with h6 to be ready to answer h5 with g5   - play d6 and then e6 first and if White plays Nf3 then play g6, Bg7 and Qe7   - play e6, Be7, b6, Bb7 and perhaps a5, Na6 in the spirit of the Queens Indian.

3. e3
{ The least committal move.   3.Nc3  e6 !?  the safest move and the move-order I would choose if I intend to answer Nc3 and e3 with e6 and d6. Starting with 3... d6 makes sense if you plan to answer 4.e3 with the risky g6, but just playing it in the hope that White plays 4. Nf3 and that you can safely switch to a g6-system does not make much sense in my opinion because you lose the option 4. e3 Bb4  4.e3   4.a3  d6  gives Black an improved version of the 3. e3 d6 4. Nc3 d6 lines since White wasted a move on a3.  4...Bb4!   4...d6  Transposing to 3. e3 d6 4. Nc3 e6 is another option. But Bb4 is stronger.  5.Ne2?!  White tries to avoid the doubled pawn but Black has no problems whatsoever.   5.Bd3  Bxc3+ !  6.bxc3  d6  followed by Nc6, O-O and Qe7 or Qe8 gives Black a good game. For instance  7.Nf3  O-O  8.O-O  Qe8 !  9.Rb1  b6  10.Qe2  Bb7  11.a4  Nc6  =+  5...O-O  6.a3  Be7  Black loses a tempo but White's a3 is also not worth much and, more importantly, the knight on e2 is misplaced. Black can either go for the straightforward d6, Nbd7 and e5 or fianchetto the bishop with b6 and Bb7 and then play Nbd7 and c5. For instance  7.g3  d6  8.Bg2  Nbd7  9.e4  e5  10.Be3  Nb6  11.dxe5  dxe5  12.Qxd8  Rxd8  13.exf5  Bxf5  14.Bxb7  Rab8  15.Bg2  Bxc2 =  White has the better pawn structure but Black the more active pieces. }
3... d6
{ Black keeps the option of going for a Leningrad style setup open. I propose to play e6 only after White has played Nc3. Otherwise White can still transpose to the c4 lines in which case I want to still go for a Leningrad setup. }
4. Nc3 e6 { The safe choice. } 5. Bd3
{ 5.h3  Be7  6.g4  is an interesting setup for White. White wants to continue with gxf5, Qf3, O-O-O and then attack along the g-file.  Ne4 !?  Demuth's suggestion which reduces White's attacking options.  7.Nge2   7.gxf5  exf5  8.Nxe4  fxe4  9.Bg2  d5  10.c4  c6  11.Ne2  Be6 =  followed by O-O and Bd6 or Nd7 is fine for Black.   7.Nxe4  fxe4  8.Qd2  White wants to castle quickly and then attack the pawn on e4.  Nd7 !?  9.Bg2  d5  10.O-O-O  c5  is an interesting setup for Black. Black gets enough counterplay in the lines  11.f3  cxd4  12.fxe4   12.Kb1  O-O  13.fxe4  e5  14.Bg3  Nb6  12...e5  13.Bg3  Bg5  14.Kb1  Bxe3  7...O-O  8.Bg2  d5  9.Nxe4  fxe4  Black has a few choices now; either play c6, Nd7-f6, or play b6 and Bb7 or Ba6 in case White plays c4. Black has a playable position although White may be a little bit better here. }
5... Nc6 { Putting pressure on d4 to prevent e4. } 6. Nf3 Nb4
{ Demuth's move. The idea is to either chase the bishop away to stop the threat e4 or if White plays e4 anyway the Black can take the bishop on d3. If White moves the bishop away from d3 and later plays a3 then the knight can go to d5. Getting rid of the knight on c3 is good for Black because it increases Black's control over the key square e4. }
7. Be2 Be7
{ Black plans to play b6, Bb7 and O-O and if the knight on b4 is chased away with a3 then return to d5 to exchange it for the knight on c3.   7...h6  with the idea  8.O-O  g5  9.Bg3  Bg7  and Qe8, O-O, Nc6 and e5 is also interesting. }

Black gets a good game with c5, e6 and Nc6.  5.Nf3   5.Bf4 ?!  e5 !  is a nice tactical shot worth knowing.

If White tries Bf4 and Nb5, then ...e5 is usually a good response; if White takes with the bishop then c7 can be protected by Bb4+ and Ba5 and if White takes with the pawn then the bishop is blocked and the knight can be pushed back  (here Nh5 to save the knight with tempo may be necessary in case there is a knight on f6)  . }

Black can simply complete his development with Be7 and O-O while White has to look for a way to regain the pawn.  4...c5 !?  Black's play is similar to that against the Advance variation in the French.

Qxb2  10.Nd2  Qxc3  and Black will pick up White's remaining central pawns.   3.Bf4  Again the usual development scheme d5, Nf6, Nc6, Bf5, Qd7 and O-O-O can be used. The only thing which needs to be checked is how Black can deal with an early Nb5. Black has another option with the bishop on f4. Black can attack White's center with c5 immediately. With the bishop on g5, Bxf6 and dxc5 may cause problems because d5 could fall. But with the bishop on f4 this is not a problem.  3...Nf6  4.Nc3   4.h3  d5  5.Nc3  Nc6  Here Black can also play c5 followed by Nc6 or cxd4 and Nc6.  6.Nb5  e5  7.dxe5  Nh5  8.Bh2  g3  9.fxg3  a6  4...d5  5.Nb5   5.Bg2  Nc6  6.Nb5  e5  7.dxe5  Nh5  =+  5...e5  6.Bxe5  Bb4+  7.c3  Ba5  is slightly better for Black.

1. d4 f5 2. Qd3
{ Black faces the usual quandary: should he try to find a way to go for a Leningrad-like position with g6, Nf6, and d6, or bail out and choose either a classical Dutch setup with Nf6, e6, d6, Be7, O-O, or a Stonewall setup with d5, e6, Nf6, Bd6 and O-O.  First, let's look at the usual Leningrad moves: after 2... Nf6 3. Qxf5 Black does not get much if any compensation for the pawn, 2... g6 gives White a strong attack after 3. h4, and 2... d6 allows 3. Nc3 and now Back has to either lose a tempo with 3... d5, or allow White to play e4 after say Nf6 with a good position for White.  If you like classical Dutch positions then 2... e6 should be fine as well although I don't like Black's position after   2.Qd3  e6  3.g4  fxg4  4.h3  g3  5.Qxg3.   If you like Stonewall positions then 2... d5 is a good choice. The queen on d3 is not well-placed for the standard anti-Stonewall maneuvers. This option is the topic of another chapter. }
2... Nc6
{ This interesting move was suggested by Demuth. It has already been played in one GM game. The attempts to punish it   3.d5  and   3.Qxf5  lead to unique positions in which Black is doing well.   3.g4  is also harmless.  If White tries to steer into calmer waters with   3.Nf3  or   3.g3  the best moves in my opinion, then Black can still go for Leningrad structures with e6, Nf6 followed by g6, Bg7 and O-O. Compared to the standard Leningrad positions Black spent an extra move on e6 and played an early Nc6 while White played Qd3. I must admit I am not sure who profits from these extra moves. }
3. Qxf5
{ The critical move because it forces Black to offer a  (correct)  piece sacrifice. White has a few alternatives.     3.Nf3  e6  preventing d5   3...d6  4.d5  Ne5  5.Nxe5  dxe5  6.e4  seems to be better for White.  4.g3  the only GM game in this line went   4.e4  Nb4  5.Qe2  fxe4  6.Qxe4  Nf6  7.Qe2  c5  and Black was already a bit better.  Nf6  5.Bg2  g6  6.O-O  Bg7  7.c4  d6  8.Nc3  O-O  leads to Leningrad-like positions.   3.g3  Nf6  4.Bg2  g6  5.Nf3  d6  transposes to 3. Nf3     3.g4  fxg4  4.h3  g3!  a typical maneuver to avoid the opening of the h-file  5.fxg3  Usually White likes to play   5.Qxg3  here but in this variation the queen has to protect d4.  e5!  and Black is at least equal.     3.d5  Nb4  4.Qxf5   4.Qb3  e6!  5.dxe6  dxe6  6.Nc3  Nf6  leads to an equal position.  4...Nf6  threatens d6 and the queen cannot defend c2 any longer  5.Na3  c6!   5...Nbxd5  6.e4  d6  is about equal.  6.dxc6  d5  7.Qg5  Nxc6  gives Black plenty of compensation for the pawn. }
3... Nxd4
{ This is Black's only good move. But Black has to be willing to sacrifice a piece for a long lasting attack here. }
4. Qh5+
{ 4.Qd3  e5  5.Nf3   5.e3  Nc6  6.c4  Nf6  7.Nc3  Bb4  is about equal.  Nc6  6.e4  Nf6  is at least equal. If White's light-squared bishop could go to b5 we would get a position from the Jaenisch gambit in the Ruy lopez: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 4. d3 fxe5 5. dxe4 Nf6 6. Qd3 }
4... g6 5. Qe5 { This double attack is White's point. } 5... Nxc2+ 6. Kd1 Nf6
7. Kxc2 Bg7
{ The starting point of this variation. Black intends to play d5 and O-O in the next two moves. The order does not seem to matter much but starting with d5 seems to be more precise since after d5 the move Nh5 can be played in some lines. White's main defense is to put pressure on d5 with moves like Nc3, e4 or Nh3 and Nf4 so that Qxd5 is possible after discovered attacks on the queen by the knight.  This chapter contains too many lines on this piece sacrifice to remember them all. I would play through them to get a feeling for what the main ideas are but unless you have concrete reasons for believing the piece sacrifice will get on the board I would not spend too much time on these lines. I put them up in case you want to check what I suggest against a specific setup. }

IMPORTANT  Please don't try to memorize all of the following lines. These are the lines I checked in order to convince myself that the piece sacrifice is correct. I would play through them to get a feeling for what the main ideas are but unless you have concrete reasons for believing the piece sacrifice will get on the board I would not spend too much time with these lines. I put them up in case you want to check what I suggest against a specific setup. }

7. Kxc2 Bg7
{ The starting point of this variation. Black intends to play d5 and O-O in the next two moves. The order does not seem to matter much but starting with d5 seems to be more precise since after d5 the move Nh5 can be played in some lines. White's main defense is to put pressure on d5 with moves like Nc3, e4 or Nh3 and Nf4 so that Qxd5 is possible after discovered attacks on the queen by the knight. Also White has to choose the moves so that Bf5+ can be properly answered.   The next question is how two analyze this position systematically. The first point is that Black will play d5 next regardless of White's next move  (excluding nonsense moves like Qxe7+ of course)  . I consider the following lines.    8.e4  d5  9.exd5?   8.Nc3  d5  9.Nf3?   8.Nc3  d5  9.e4   8.Nh3  d5  9.e4   8.Nh3  d5  9.Nf4   8.Nh3  d5  9.f3   8.Bg5  d5  9.Bxf6?   8.Bg5  d5  9.e4  O-O   8.Bg5  d5  9.Nc3  O-O   The last two lines above lead to balanced endgames but in case you want to try for more there are more risky lines leading to more complex positions given as alternatives where Black plays c6 instead of O-O. }

1. d4 f5 2. Qd3
{ In this chapter we look at Black's move 2... d5. If White plays quiet moves we get a Stonewall but with the unusual move Qd3. But in the majority of games White played 3. g4 after which we will transpose to lines from the 2. g4 chapter. Nonetheless, it is a good idea to have some rough guidelines on how to play the Stonewall just in case.  Before looking at these positions it is useful to have a summary of what to do in the regular Stonewall.      Black's pieces   - Black puts his pawns on f5, e6, d5, c6   - the dark-squared bishop usually goes to d6  (in older games e7 was more common)   - the light-squared bishop nowadays is mostly developed via b6, Bb7  (before Bd7-e8-h5 or g6 was more common)   - knight on g8: f6   - knight on b8: stays for a while on b8 especially if b6 is planned to protect c6. If White plays a4 then Na6 is also often good   - the pawn move c7-c6 can be delayed to take the sting out of the Bf4xd6 maneuver because after cxd6! the square e5 is no longer weak.   White's pieces   - light-squared bishop: usually g3 and Bg2, sometimes e3 and Bd3   - knight g1: usually f3 sometimes followed by Nf3-e5-d3 or Nf3-e1-d3, sometimes Nh3-f4-d3   - dark-squared bishop, often a3 or f4, trying to exchange Black's bishop on d6, sometimes b2   - knight on b1, stays for a while on b1 if White wants to play Ba3. Otherwise Nb1-d2-f3 is typical   key squares, typical manoeuvers, typical plans   - e5 is probably the most import square in the Stonewall. If White can control e5 with pieces then White is usually better. If White has to recapture with a pawn on e5 then Black has often equalized   - to increase the control of the dark squares  (especially e5)  White wants to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bf4  (not fearing Bxf4 gxf4)  or Ba3   - endgames with a white knight against Black's light-squared bishop tend to be good for White.   - Bd7-e8-h5 can be useful but if White manages to move his pieces in time then the bishop can be useless on h5   - after cxd5 by White Black usually wants to take back with the e-pawn, unless the light-squared bishop has been fianchettoed. In that case cxd5 is often better because the pawn on c6 can become weak }

1. --
{ What to remember.   - Black puts his pawns on f5, e6, d5, c6. Only if White plays an early Bf4 then keeping the c-pawn on c7 is good as well because it allows Black to answer Bxd6 with cxd6  - the dark-squared bishop usually goes to d6  (in older games e7 was more common)   - the light-squared bishop nowadays is mostly developed via b6, Bb7  (before Bd7-e8-h5 or g6 was more common)   - If White plays Nh3 and Bf4 then retreating the bishop from d6 to e7 followed by h6 and g5 is an interesting strategy to keep the knight on h3 out of the game.   - e5 is probably the most import square in the Stonewall. If White can control e5 with pieces then White is usually better. If White has to recapture with a pawn on e5 then Black has often equalized  - if White delays c4 then a quick c5 is often good for Black  - Ne5 can be answered with c5, Nc6, Qc7  - don't play c7-c6 too quickly  (c5 can be played in one move, Bxd6 can be answered with cxd6.) }

1. d4 f5 2. Nh3 g6
{ In this position Black can  (and if he wants to play a Leningrad should)  play g6 immediately because White cannot play h4 at this moment. Usually the game will transpose to the standard Nh3-systems if White fianchettos his light-squared bishop. There are four other moves I considered here.    2...e6  transposing to a classical Dutch or the Stonewall is also possible but since Nh3 is a fairly standard move in these systems we do not get anything in return for abandoning the Leningrad.   2...d6  3.Nc3  followed by Bg5 and e4 is better for White.   2...Nc6  can lead to standard Nh3 lines in the Leningrad if White plays g3 but I was not so sure about the following line  3.d5  Ne5  4.e4  fxe4  5.Nc3  Nf6  6.Ng5  White regains his pawn back without any of the concessions this usually requires in the Staunton Gambit.   2...Nf6  this looks like the most flexible move, but there is one line I was not so happy with.  3.Bg5  e6  After h6 or g6 the bishop can simply take and d5 only makes sense when the c-pawn has been blocked by a knight on c3. And finally   3...Ne4  4.Bh4  followed by f3, did not look appealing either.  4.e3   4.Nf4  Be7  5.e3  O-O  6.h4  Nc6  should be fine for Black.  h6  5.Bxf6  Qxf6  6.Nf4  g5  7.Nh5   7.Nd3  Bg7  8.h4  g4  9.g3  d6  10.Bg2  e5  with a roughly balanced position.  7...Qf7  8.Be2  Nc6  may be fine for Black but the position after  9.Nf4  Qg7  10.Bh5  Kd8  11.Ng6  Rg8  12.Nxf8  Rxf8  is not really to my liking. }

The knights on c6 and c3 are equally misplaced but the pawn on h4 can turn out to be a serious weakness for White.  6.g3  e6  7.Bg2  Qe7  not a very typical move in the Stonewall while the bishop is still on f8 but here Black is planning to castle queen side after Bd7. If White castles short Black can also play Qf7, h6 and g5. }

1. d4 f5 2. e4
{ Sometimes White plays the move e4 after Nc3 or f3 or both. But if you remember to answer e4 with fxe4, f3 with d5 and Nc3 with Nf6 you are fine in all move orders. }
2... fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6
{ There are now three moves regularly played in this position. In increasing order of strength  (and popularity)  these moves are 4. g4 ?!, 4. f3 and 4. Bg5. The bishop move is the best and deserves its own chapter. 4.g4 is a bit dubious but has been played by strong players and shows up fairly regularly in Blitz. I doubt that White can fully equalize after 4. g4 if Black plays aggressively. 4. f3 is better and leads to equal positions without posing Black any problems. }
4. f3
{ 4.g4  threatens g5 and if White were able to push the pawn to g5 then Black would be in trouble. Fortunately, that is not possible.  4...h6!  Clearly the best move. If White plays g5 now then Black gets a better version of the standard Staunton Gambit because the half-open h-file is much more useful than the half-open g-file. Trying to prepare the pawn push with h4 does not work either because White's h-pawn will be pinned after hxg5  5.f3  d5  Now White has several options, 6.h3, 6.Bg2, 6.Bf4, 6.fxe4 but after h3 Black can put pressure on White's center with Nc6 and e5, after either of the bishop moves c5 is strong and after fxe4 White has problems with g4. }
4... d5
{ The reason why 4. f3 is not so strong. Black can play d5 immediately without having to fear Bxf6 and Qh5+. Black's plan is simple: Bf5, Nc6, Qd7 and O-O-O. If White plays Nge2 and Ng3 then protect the bishop with e6. If White plays Bc4 then Nc6-a5 is good as long as the bishop cannot retreat to e2. }
5. Bg5 Bf5 6. fxe4 dxe4 7. Nge2 e6 8. Ng3 Be7
{ The main line. Black has equalized and White has to put in some effort to regain the pawn. }
9. Bb5+
{ White wants to provoke c6 to prevent the Nc6-a5 maneuver after Bc4.    9.Qd2  Nbd7  followed by h6 is already slightly better for Black. }
9... c6
{ 9...Nc6  is possible as well. After the fairly forced line  10.d5  a6  11.dxc6  Qxd1+  12.Rxd1  axb5  13.cxb7  Rb8  14.Nxf5  exf5  15.Nxb5  Rxb7  the position is roughly equal. }
10. Bc4 Nbd7 { White lost a tempo to prevent Nc6-a5. } 11. O-O Nb6 12. Bb3 Qd7
{ The position is about equal. White can now regain the pawn with   13.Bxf6  Bxf6  14.Ncxe4  Qxd4+  15.Kh1  O-O-O  16.Qxd4  Bxd4  17.c3  Be5  18.Nxf5  exf5  19.Rxf5  Rhe8 }

[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5
{ The best move in my opinion. Black threatens to regain the pawn while preventing d5.   4...d5  5.Bxf6  exf6  6,  Qh5+  g6  7.Qxd5  is good for White.  The move d5 is important for Black because it supports the pawn on e4. The goal is not necessarily to keep the extra pawn but to make it more difficult for White to develop harmoniously. There are several lines in which a white knight on e2 blocks the bishop either from developing if the bishop is still on f1 or from retreating to e2 if attacked by Na5 if the bishop is on c4. }
4... g6
{ One of three popular moves  (the others are c6 and Nc6)  but currently my favorite. The point of this move is not to play Bg7, although sometimes the bishop goes to g7 later, but to prepare d5 which is not possible immediately because White has Bxf6, Qh5+ and Qxd5. }
5. h4
{ Objectively 5. f3 may be stronger but 5. h4 is certainly the most dangerous move where some knowledge is necessary. White's alternatives are   5.Bxf6  exf6  6.Nxe4  d5  and Black is already slighly better.   5.Bc4  c6  6.d5  Bg7  and Black gets a good game by attacking d5. For instance  7.Nge2  e6  8.dxe6  d5  and Bxe6.   5.f3  d5  6.fxe4   6.Qd2  Bg7  7.O-O-O  Nc6  8.Bb5  White can also transpose to 6. fxe4 with 8. fxe4 here.  O-O  9.fxe4  Nxe4  10.Nxe4  dxe4  with a balanced position.  Nxe4  I like this move because it sidesteps any later Bxf6.  7.Nxe4  dxe4  8.Bc4   8.Qd2  Bg7  9.O-O-O  Nc6  gives Black a good position.  Nc6  followed by Na5 gives Black a good position. }
5... d5 6. h5
{ The only dangerous move for Black. But Black is fine as long as he knows what he is doing. After other moves Black prepares castling queenside with Nc6, Bf5 and Qd7 or Qd6. }
6... Bf5
{ 6...Bg7?!  7.h6  Bf8  8.f3  is good for White.   6...Nxh5?  7.Rxh5  gxh5  8.Qxh5+  Kd7  9.Qf7  is close to losing for Black. }
7. Bxf6
{ Otherwise Black can play Qd6 and Nc6 and O-O-O with a small advantage. } 7...
exf6 8. g4
{ The point of White's last move. The pawn on g6 is no longer protected after the bishop retreats. }
8... Be6 { Protecting d5 and keeping the 7th rank for the queen. } 9. hxg6
{ This is White's idea. } 9... Qd7
{ The key move in this variation. This move  - protects h7   - prepares to castle long after Nc6  - prepares Qg7 to protect the rook on h8  - keeps an eye on d5  (Qe7 instead of Qd7 runs into Nxd5 in some lines)   - threatens g4 }
10. g5
{ After other moves Black can force the exchange of White's g-pawn and the Black's h-pawn with Qg7 after which the bishop pair and the protected passed pawn on e4 give Black an edge. One line worth knowing is   10.f4  Qg7!   10...exf3  11.Bd3!  is what White is hoping for  11.f5  hxg6!  12.Rxh8  Qxh8  13.fxe6  Qh4+  14.Ke2  Qh2+  regaining the piece with a clear advantage. }
10... fxg5
{ 10...Qg7  is also possible but this gives White the extra option  11.gxf6  which is fine for Black after Qxg6. }
11. Qh5 Bg7
{ 11...Qg7  is an ambitious alternative. Black protects the rook to threaten hxg6 and vacates the square d7 for the knight. But since the resulting variations are rather complicated it is only given as an alternative here. }
12. gxh7+ Qf7 13. Qxg5
{ 13.Qxf7  Kxf7  14.f3  Bxd4  15.fxe4  Bxc3  16.bxc3  dxe4  looks a bit better for Black.   13.Nb5  Na6  14.Qxg5  Bf6  15.Qg3  O-O-O!  is also good for Black. }
13... Nd7
{ Black has a good position. If necessary Black can play Bf6 to be able to castle or play Nf8 and Nxh7 to regain his pawn. }

The king on f7 may look a bit more exposed but it does protect the weak square e6. The main disadvantage of Kf7 is that it stops the occasionally desirable maneuver Be6-f7. The upshot is that if White places moves like Qe2+ and you don't want to exchange queens then Kf7 is a perfectly safe and reasonable answer. }

1. d4 f5 2. Nc3
{ White wants to play e4. If Black does nothing to stop this then White will get a good position. Black has two moves which stop White from playing e4 without sacrificing a pawn. My suggestion here is the less committal move Nf6. 2... d5 is playable but I dislike 3. Bf4 which gives White control of the dark squares in the center without getting anything in return. }
2... Nf6
{ 2...g6  This move is too dangerous. White can immediately attack with  3.h4  Even the simple   3.e4  fxe4  4.Nxe4  is better for White. The attack with h4-h5 can be kept in reserve.  Bg7  4.h5  followed by e4 is good for White.   2...d5  3.Bf4  This position may be playable but I don't see any active plans for Black. For example  3...e6  4.e3  Nf6  5.Nf3  Bb4  6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  followed by c4 and White is a bit better. }
3. Bg5 { White threatens e4 again. } 3... d5
{ Black weakens e5 but stops e4 and here the bishop is not so well placed on g5. Ne4 is often possible if White chooses a quieter setup and if White captures on f6 we have a pawn covering the e5 square. }
4. Bxf6
{ 4.Bf4  This is of course possible, but the extra tempo makes Black's life a bit easier.  4...e6  5.e3   5.Nb5  Bb4+  6.c3  Ba5  followed by O-O or a6 gives Black a good position.  5...Bb4  followed by O-O and c5 is fine for Black  6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  c5  is fine for Black after Nc6 and O-O. The extra tempo gives Black a good game here.   4.e3  The safest option for White.  4...e6  Here I follow one of Demuth's suggestions. Black plays Be7, Ne4, c5 and Nc6, castles kingside and then decides what to do about the bishop on c8. The maneuver Bd7-e8-h5 is one option but starting to push the queenside pawns with c4, Bd7 and b5 looks good as well.  5.Nf3  Be7  6.Ne2  White wants to play c4  Ne4  7.Bxe7  Qxe7  8.c3  c5 }
4... exf6
{ Black gets a stable center after Be6-Bf7, c6 and g6 and h5 when necessary. Putting all the pawns on white squares takes away most squares from Black's light-squared bishop but the bishop does make it more difficult for White to play c4 and if White tries to open the kingside with a quick g4 then the bishop protects key squares and gets breathing room again. If White does nothing then Black plays Nd7, Bd6 or Bh6, Qe7 and O-O-O with a good position. The setup with Nd7 and c6 which I recommend here is not so popular but it is perfectly fine if you play precisely for the next few moves. The key is to keep the bishop on f8, play Be6 followed by g6, c6 and Bf7 and h5 if needed and only then play Nd7. Other move orders give White the chance to open the kingside with moves like Bd3, Qf3, h3 and g4. The move order I recommend here has not been considered in any of the books I consulted, }
5. e3 Be6
{ One of the key moves of this variation. The light-squared bishop is needed to defend the kingside. The bishop will go quickly to f7 to protect g6. Other important moves for Black are a quick g6 if f5 is attacked to allow the bishop to retreat to f7, a quick c6 to defend d5, replying with h5 to h4 and putting the knight on d7 but keeping the bishop on f8 while tactics involving an early g4 by White are still possible. }
6. Qf3 g6
{ Black protects f5 in order to allow the bishop to retreat to f7.  Here the move Nc6 with the follow-up Qd7, Ne7, O-O-O is much more popular. I played this system as well until I noticed that the reasons, for calling the system I propose here inferior, were incorrect. I think both systems are playable, but when given a choice I tend to prefer the lesser known system. As a final bonus we are able to avoid   6...Nc6  7.Bb5 }
7. Bd3 c6 { Protecting d5 to prepare Nd7 without allowing Nxd5. } 8. Nge2 h5
{ 8...Nd7 ?  9.h3  White prepares g4.  9...h5  With g6 unprotected Black cannot stop g4.  10.g4  hxg4  11.hxg4  fxg4  12.Bxg6+  and White is clearly better.   8...Bd6 ?  9.Nf4  Bf7  10.h3  h5  Not enough to stop g4 because the rook on h8 hangs with check after  11.g4  hxg4  12.hxg4  Rxh1+  Black has no time for fxg4 because the rook on h8 can be taken with check. But if the bishop stays on f8 then fxg4 is possible in this line.   8...Bf7  This move is possible as well but slightly imprecise. After  9.h3  h5  we transpose to 8... h5 9. h3 Bf7. }
9. h3 Rg8
{ This move is the most precise, something which took me a while to understand. To understand why lets have a closer look at the position.  - White's only plan to fight for an advantage is the pawn push g4 to open the kingside.  - if g6 is not protected White has the intermediate check Bxg6 after fxg4, so Black will have to play Bf7 or Rg8.  - if Black's dark-squared bishop has moved to d6 then the threat Rxh8+ can win an important tempo for White as in 8...Bd6? above, so Black should keep the bishop on f8 for the time being.  - White can force Black to play Bf7 with Nf4 anytime.  - if g6 is protected with Rg8 and the bishop is still on e6 then White cannot play g4 because Black can take with the f-pawn and then with the bishop.   - after g4 hxg4 / hxg4 fxg4 / Qxg4 f5 the queen has to decide where to retreat to. If there is a knight on d7 and no white knight on f4 then Qg3 is good because if Black plays Qe7 or Qf6 to prepare castling then Qc7 is annoying for Black as in   9...Bf7  10.O-O-O  Nd7  11.g4  hxg4  12.hxg4  fxg4  13.Qxg4  f5  14.Qg3  Rxh1  15.Rxh1  Qf6  16.Qc7  Conclusion. Black should  - keep the bishop on f8.  - play Bf7 only when White plays Nf4.  - play Rg8 when White plays h3 while g6 is still unprotected. }
10. O-O-O Nd7 11. Nf4
{ 11.Rdg1  White wants to play g4 without having to put the knight on f4.  Bf7  12.g4  fxg4  13.hxg4  hxg4  14.Qxg4  f5  15.Qg3  Nf6  and Black can complete his development with Bd6, Qe7 and O-O-O. }

1. d4 f5 2. Nc3
{ White wants to play e4. If Black does nothing to stop this then White will get a good position. Black has two moves which stop White from playing e4 without sacrificing a pawn. My suggestion here is the less committal move Nf6. 2... d5 is playable but I dislike 3. Bf4 which gives White control of the dark squares in the center without getting anything in return. }
2... Nf6
{ 2...g6  This move is too dangerous. White can immediately attack with  3.h4  Even the simple   3.e4  fxe4  4.Nxe4  is better for White. The attack with h4-h5 can be kept in reserve.  Bg7  4.h5  followed by e4 is good for White.   2...d5  3.Bf4  This position may be playable but I don't see any active plans for Black. For example  3...e6  4.e3  Nf6  5.Nf3  Bb4  6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  followed by c4 and White is a bit better. }
3. Bg5 { White threatens e4 again. } 3... d5
{ Black weakens e5 but stops e4 and here the bishop is not so well placed on g5. Ne4 is often possible if White chooses a quieter setup and if White captures on f6 we have a pawn covering the e5 square. }
4. Bxf6
{ 4.Bf4  This is of course possible, but the extra tempo makes Black's life a bit easier.  4...e6  5.e3   5.Nb5  Bb4+  6.c3  Ba5  followed by O-O or a6 gives Black a good position.  5...Bb4  followed by O-O and c5 is fine for Black  6.a3  Bxc3+  7.bxc3  c5  is fine for Black after Nc6 and O-O. The extra tempo gives Black a good game here.   4.e3  The safest option for White.  4...e6  Here I follow one of Demuth's suggestions. Black plays Be7, Ne4, c5 and Nc6, castles kingside and then decides what to do about the bishop on c8. The maneuver Bd7-e8-h5 is one option but starting to push the queenside pawns with c4, Bd7 and b5 looks good as well.  5.Nf3  Be7  6.Ne2  White wants to play c4  Ne4  7.Bxe7  Qxe7  8.c3  c5 }
4... exf6
{ Black gets a stable center after Be6-Bf7, c6 and g6 and h5 when necessary. Putting all the pawns on white squares takes away most squares from Black's light-squared bishop but the bishop does make it more difficult for White to play c4 and if White tries to open the kingside with a quick g4 then the bishop protects key squares and gets breathing room again. If White does nothing then Black plays Nd7, Bd6 or Bh6, Qe7 and O-O-O with a good position. The setup with Nd7 and c6 which I recommend here is not so popular but it is perfectly fine if you play precisely for the next few moves. The key is to keep the bishop on f8, play Be6 followed by g6, c6 and Bf7 and h5 if needed and only then play Nd7. Other move orders give White the chance to open the kingside with moves like Bd3, Qf3, h3 and g4. The move order I recommend here has not been considered in any of the books I consulted, }
5. e3 Be6
{ One of the key moves of this variation. The light-squared bishop is needed to defend the kingside. The bishop will go quickly to f7 to protect g6. Other important moves for Black are a quick g6 if f5 is attacked to allow the bishop to retreat to f7, a quick c6 to defend d5, replying with h5 to h4 and putting the knight on d7 but keeping the bishop on f8 while tactics involving an early g4 by White are still possible. }
6. Qf3 g6
{ Black protects f5 in order to allow the bishop to retreat to f7.  Here the move Nc6 with the follow-up Qd7, Ne7, O-O-O is much more popular. I played this system as well until I noticed that the reasons, for calling the system I propose here inferior, were incorrect. I think both systems are playable, but when given a choice I tend to prefer the lesser known system. As a final bonus we are able to avoid   6...Nc6  7.Bb5 }
7. Bd3 c6 { Protecting d5 to prepare Nd7 without allowing Nxd5. } 8. Nge2 h5
{ 8...Nd7 ?  9.h3  White prepares g4.  9...h5  With g6 unprotected Black cannot stop g4.  10.g4  hxg4  11.hxg4  fxg4  12.Bxg6+  and White is clearly better.   8...Bd6 ?  9.Nf4  Bf7  10.h3  h5  Not enough to stop g4 because the rook on h8 hangs with check after  11.g4  hxg4  12.hxg4  Rxh1+  Black has no time for fxg4 because the rook on h8 can be taken with check. But if the bishop stays on f8 then fxg4 is possible in this line.   8...Bf7  This move is possible as well but slightly imprecise. After  9.h3  h5  we transpose to 8... h5 9. h3 Bf7. }
9. h3 Rg8
{ This move is the most precise, something which took me a while to understand. To understand why lets have a closer look at the position.  - White's only plan to fight for an advantage is the pawn push g4 to open the kingside.  - if g6 is not protected White has the intermediate check Bxg6 after fxg4, so Black will have to play Bf7 or Rg8.  - if Black's dark-squared bishop has moved to d6 then the threat Rxh8+ can win an important tempo for White as in 8...Bd6? above, so Black should keep the bishop on f8 for the time being.  - White can force Black to play Bf7 with Nf4 anytime.  - if g6 is protected with Rg8 and the bishop is still on e6 then White cannot play g4 because Black can take with the f-pawn and then with the bishop.   - after g4 hxg4 / hxg4 fxg4 / Qxg4 f5 the queen has to decide where to retreat to. If there is a knight on d7 and no white knight on f4 then Qg3 is good because if Black plays Qe7 or Qf6 to prepare castling then Qc7 is annoying for Black as in   9...Bf7  10.O-O-O  Nd7  11.g4  hxg4  12.hxg4  fxg4  13.Qxg4  f5  14.Qg3  Rxh1  15.Rxh1  Qf6  16.Qc7  Conclusion. Black should  - keep the bishop on f8.  - play Bf7 only when White plays Nf4.  - play Rg8 when White plays h3 while g6 is still unprotected. }

The position after c5-c4 is about equal. Black has more space but White has the 'better' bishop although it won't be easy for White to find a good use for his bishop. Black will castle short and them probably expand further on the queenside with moves like Bd7, Be8, b5, a5, b4. If White exchanges the knight on e4 with Nf3-d2xe4 then Black could consider taking back on e4 with the d-pawn  (if b5 has already been played)  and then open the position with e5. For instance }

[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 h6
{ 2...g6  This is a good and solid move but it has three disadvantages. There is quite a bit of theory, there are many transpositions, and finally, since it is the most common move in this position, White players are well-prepared for this move. Since I did not manage to reduce the number of variations to a reasonable level and since I play the less common 2... h6 at least as often as 2... g6, I decided to go with 2... h6.   2...Nf6  is also possible but I believe that White is better after  3.Bxf6  exf6  White gets an improved version of the 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bg5 d5 4. Bxf6 exf6 lines because c4 is still possible. For instance:  4.e3  d5  5.c4  This puts immediately pressure on Black's center. This is not possible in the aforementioned 2. Nc3 line because the knight blocks the c-pawn there. Black can try to keep a pawn on d5 with  5...c6  But now White can increase the pressure on d5 with  6.Nc3  followed by Qb3, cxd5 and Ne2-f4 or a queenside expansion with c5 and b4-b5. I do not trust Black's position here. }
3. Bh4
{ The only sensible alternative is Bf4 but then Black gets the free move h6 which is quite useful when the bishop is on f4. }
3... g5
{ Now White has three reasonable moves: Bg3, e3 and e4. The first two will usually lead by transposition to the same positions where White can fight for a small advantage. After e4 White is usually willing to sacrifice the bishop in return for 2-3 pawns and attacking chances. }
4. e4
{ Not the strongest move but the most dangerous move to meet without preparation.   4.Bg3  d6  5.h4  5. e3 transposes to 4. e3  5...f4  is good for Black.   4.e3  The strongest move in my opinion.  Nf6  The most flexible move. Black stops the check on h5. Since d4 is well protected there is no need to hurry with Bg7. Sometimes it is also useful to protect g5 with Rg8 after a quick h4 by White.  5.Bg3  d6  restricting the bishop on g3.  6.h4  g4   6...Rg8  This is the move that Pruijssers suggests. It keeps the pawn duo f5 and g5 intact. However Black ends up in a rather passive position after the moves  7.hxg5  hxg5  8.Be2  e6   8...Be6  9.c4  Na6  is possible  (I have played it)  but can run into problems after a quick b4.  9.c4  I have spent a lot of time on this position but haven't found a path to an acceptable position for Black. Black has problems finding squares for his queenside pieces because Nc6 will always run sooner or later into d5. The check on h5 can also be a problem, for instance, after Ne4 by Black.  7.h5  The most principled move. White stops Nh5 and gains space on the kingside.   7.Ne2  Nh5  8.Nbc3  Bg7  gives Black enough counterplay. Black can castle to either side and the knight on b8 will probably go to f6 to replace the knight on h5 which will very likely be exchanged after Ne2-f4.  7...Be6  8.Ne2   8.Bd3  Qd7  preparing Bf7  9.c4  Bf7  10.Qb3  is a setup suggested by engines and played by correspondence players. Now Black has two choices: c6 followed by Na6 and Bg7, or ignoring the threat Qxb7 and just go Bg7.  Bg7  11.Nc3   11.Qxb7  O-O  12.Qxa8  c5  with a roughly balanced position because White will have to return the material to free his queen.  11...O-O  12.Nge2  Nc6  with mutual chances, the model games section contains an example.  8...Bf7  9.Nf4  Now Black has two interesting moves: Qd7 and Nc6. Often both moves will be played.  9...Qd7   9...Nc6  is interesting as well. But Black has to be prepared for  10.Bb5  a6  11.Bxc6  Starting with the queen move may look a bit artificial but it avoids the pin and the queen starts covering the potential weaknesses on f5 and e6.  I believe Black has enough counterplay in either case. The pawn on h5 may become a target and Black can still castle either way: Bg7 and O-O, or Qd7/Nc6 and O-O-O. }
4... Bg7
{ 4...Nf6  The best move after 4. e3 but now White has 5. e5  5.e5  e6  Black loses his knight but gets the bishop in return. The resulting positions are balanced. If you don't like the sharper positions after 4... Bg7 then this line is a reasonable alternative.  6.exf6   6.Bg3  f4  7.Bd3  This looks dangerous, but after the correct reply  7...d5  8.Bg6+  Kd7  Black is fine.  6...Qxf6  7.Bg3  f4  Black does not need to hurry with regaining his piece. Taking on g3 allows White to open the f- or h-file, so waiting until White loses a tempo with f3, h3 or h4 is safer. If White takes on f4 then Black is fine after gxf4 because the kingside will remain closed for a bit longer. }
5. Bg3 d6
{ I like the setup with Bg7 and d6 because it does not seem to be so well-known. Black gets easy equality or White has to sacrifice a piece for unclear compensation. If this looks too risky for you, have a look at the alternative 4... Nf6.   5...f4 ?  6.Bxf4  gxf4  7.Qh5+  Kf8  8.Qf5+  followed by e5 is good for White. }
6. Bc4
{ White's most principled move. White is willing to sacrifice a piece for 2-3 pawns and attacking chances. Other moves are fine for Black. }
6... d5
{ The idea of this move is to close the diagonal a2-g8 with tempo  (exd5 closes it directly and after Bxd5 e6 White has to retreat with the bishop)  and then win the bishop on g3 with f4. Playing f4 directly fails:   6...f4 ?  7.Bxf4  gxf4  8.Qh5+  Kd7  9.Be6+ }
7. Bxd5 { 7.exd5  f4  White gets some compensation for the piece. } 7... e6 8.

{ If White does not take on f4 then Black should not take on g3 unless White threatens to escape with the bishop after playing for instance h3, or if Black is sure that taking is preferable to allowing a future Bxf4. The main reason is that once Black takes on g3 White has the choice of opening either the h- or f-file to strengthen his attack. If Black does not take immediately White is forced to spend at least a tempo on forcing Black to take, time which Black can use to complete his development. For instance   9.c3  Nf6  10.Qe2  Nxd5  is good for Black.   9.d6?!  Qe8  10.Qf3  White cannot afford to exchange queens.  Nc6!  11.c3  cxd6  is very good for Black. }

{ 10...Kd8  is the move I originally wanted to recommend here. To me it looks about equal. The king on d8 looks a bit awkward but Black can generate play on the queenside with Bd7 and b5, possibly followed by Rb8 and Nc6.   10...b6  is the engine move. The idea is to continue with Bb7 and Kc8 and to answer h4 with Bg7. For instance  11.O-O-O  Bb7  12.h4  Bg7  13.hxg5  hxg5  14,  Rxh8  Bxh8  The bishop is more active on b7 than it would be on d7 but the plan with Rb8 and b5 does not make much sense any longer here. Conclusion: choose either move but 10...b6 is very likely the objectively stronger move. }

Also White's best plan in this position is to attempt to exchange the light-squared bishops to weaken the light squares on the kingside, especially e6 and g6.  11...bxc6  12.Qd3  Qd7  Black is fine. If White plays Ng6 at some point then both Bxg6 and Rg8 are reasonable answers. Black can continue with Bg7 and e6 to keep his pawn structure flexible. If White castles queenside the opening the position with c5 is an option.  13.Nc3  Bg7  14.Ng6  Otherwise Black castles kingside.  14...Rg8  Black threatens Nxh5. The position is unclear. Black has the weaker pawn structure, but the weak pawns on c6 and a6 are not easily attacked. In the meantime the knight on g6 is not very stable. }

For instance  13.dxe5   13.Ng6  Bxg6  14.hxg6  exd4  15.exd4  Qe7+  16.Kf1  O-O-O  Black can block White's bishop on b3 with d5  (although this improves the range of the bishop on g3)  anytime. Afterwards it may be difficult to defend g6.   13.Bxf7+  Kxf7  14.Ne2  exd4  15.exd4  Re8  Black is ahead in development but has some weaknesses on the kingside.

{ 13...e5 ?  is no longer possible.  14.dxe5  dxe5  15.Ne6  is better for White. White can recapture on d1 with the rook and if Black takes on e6 then Bxe6 comes with check. }
14. Qd2
{ stopping Na5 because White has Nxd5 with a discovered attack onto the knight. }
14... e6
{ This looks a bit passive for Black. But allowing the exchange of the light-squared bishops is a bit dangerous. I would probably prepare c5 with Rc8 or b6  (which also prepares Na5)  next. Going for e5 looks difficult because d5 can become weak after dxe5. I believe this position is playable for Black but against a strong and well-prepared opponent 9... Qd7 may be safer. }

{ 6... Rg8 looks better at first sight because it avoids weakening the f4-square. I chose 6... g4 as the repertoire move because I tend to get good positions with it while I struggle with Rg8 and also because I have not found a convincing answer to   6...Rg8  7.hxg5  hxg5  8.Be2  e6  9.c4 }
7. h5
{ The obvious reply. Giving the bishop breathing room, stopping Nh5 and also fixing the weakness on g6. On the otherhand h5 can become weak as well, especially if Black plays Be6-f7. A subsequent Qe8 will likely pick up the pawn. }

{ Black is fine. If White retreats the bishop to e2 then Black can start counterplay on the queenside with Rac8 and c6. Critical is:   14.Bc2  Nxc4  15.Qb1  but if Black returns the pawn with  15...Ne4  16.Nxe4  fxe4  17.Bxe4  then Black can put pressure on the queenside with  17...Qb5  and a balanced position. }

Nf6 is a safe option After 5. e5 e6 6. exf6 Qxf6 you get the piece back with f4 but you should not hurry with taking on g3 because opening the f or h line may be unpleasant  - the problems which can arise when you play f4 too early, for instance Bxf4, Qh5+, Qf5+, e5   
1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 h6 3. Bh4 g5 4. e3 or Bg3  - White's strongest option.  - both 4. e3 Nf6 5. Bg3 d6 or 4. Bg3 d6 5. e3 Nf6 are possible move orders  - 4.

13... Ne4 14. f4
{ f4 is rarely a good move against the Stonewall. One of White's advantages in Stonewall positions is that a white knight on e5 cannot be challenged by a pawn but that a black knight on e4 can always be pushed back by f3. After f4 this is no longer true. Black has fully equalized now. }

{ Black threatens to open the b-file with bxc5. What I like about this      move is that Black does not just play aggressively on the kingside  (which I would probably end up doing)  but threatens to become active      on the queenside as well. To prevent this White has to slow down his      play on the queenside considerably. }
21. Na2 Be8
{ Another important move. The black bishop makes room for the h-pawn      and at the same time protects the only easily accessible weakness      Black has on the queenside. Black is better. }

Another plan is to stablize the center with d5 and perhaps c6 like in a reversed French Steinitz variation. Finally, Qe7, Nd8-f7 was also possible.

{ 12...O-O-O ?!  Letting White activate his light-squared bishop with exf5 and Bc4 is a bit risky.

If c5 is the right square for the queen then Qa3 is faster and has the added benefit of putting pressure on d6.   13...Qa3  14.h4   14.Bb4  Qa4  -/+  with the idea c5 is better for Black.  14...b5  This looks playable as well but is a bit more ambitious than b6.   14...b6  Black prepares Ba6  15.h5  Ba6  16.Rb3   16.Bb3  Qxd6  17.hxg6  hxg6  16...Qc5  17.Bd3   17.Bxa6  Nxa6  18.hxg6  hxg6  19.Bc3  Qd5  20.Qa1  Rf7  is ok for Black.  17...Bxd3  18.Rxd3  Na6  19.hxg6  hxg6  20.Bc3  Nb4  and Black survives. For instance  21.Rdh3  Bxc3+  22.Rxc3  Qd5  23.Rch3  Qxd1+  24.Kxd1  Nd5  25.g4  Nf6  26.g5  Nh5  27.Ng3  Rxf4  28.Nxh5  gxh5  29.Rxh5  Raf8 =  15.Bd3   15.Bc1  Qa4   15...Qa5+  16.Bd2  Qa3  repeats or forces White to transpose to 15. Bd3  16.Bd3  Qxa2   16...Na6  17.h5  is better for White. For instance  17...Nc5  18.hxg6  Qxa2  19.Rxh7  Qxb1  20.Kf2  Rf6  21.g4  +/-  17.Be3  b4  18.h5  Ba6  19.Be4  Bxe2  20.Kxe2  Qc4+  Black gets enough counterplay.  21.Bd3   21.Qd3  Qxd3+  22.cxd3  a5  23.hxg6  hxg6  24.Bxg6  a4  =+  21...Qd5  22.Kf1  c5  23.hxg6  c4  24.Rh5  Qxd6  25.Bxc4   25.Be4  Qxd1+  26.Rxd1  hxg6  27.Bxg6  a5  =+  25...Rxf4+  26.Bxf4  Qxf4+  27.Qf3  Qxc4+  28.Kg1  hxg6  29.Qxa8  gxh5  30.Qxb8+  Kh7  31.Qxb4  Qxc2 =  15...Na6   15...Qxd6  tempting but better for White. For instance  16.h5  Na6  17.hxg6  Nc5  18.Rxh7  e5  19.Rb3  Nxb3  20.axb3  Qe7  21.Bc3  d6  22.Be4  +/-  16.h5  Nc5  17.Rh3   17.Nc1  Nxd3+  18.Nxd3  Qxd6  19.hxg6  hxg6  20.Qg4  Qd5  21.Qxg6  Qf5 =  Black defends.  17...Nxd3+  18.Rxd3  Qc5  19.hxg6  hxg6  20.Rg3  Kf7  is about equal. A possible continuation is  21.Be3  Qd5  22.Nd4  e5  23.Qd3  Qxd6  24.fxe5  Bxe5  25.Rg4  c5  26.Nf3  Bg3+  27.Kd2  Qxd3+  28.cxd3  Bc7  29.Bxc5  d6  30.Rh4  dxc5  31.Rh7+  Kg8  32.Rxc7  c4 =  33.Re1  Bf5  34.Ree7  Rfe8 }
14. O-O Qf5
{ 14...b5  15.Bd3  a5  16.Bc3  Qf7  17.Bxg7  Qxg7  might have still been a way out for Black. }
15. Kh1 Qc5 16. f5
{ The key move. After other moves Black has enough time for b6 and Ba6, for instance   16.Bd3  b6  17.Bb4  Qh5  18.Rf3  Ba6  19.c4  c5  with a complicated position. }
16... Qxc4
{ 16...Rxf5  17.Rxf5  gxf5   17...Qxf5  18.Bd3  Qe5  19.Ng3  ±  followed by Qf3  18.Ng1 !!   18.Rb3  Qxc4  19.Rg3  wins as well  18...Qxc4  19.Qh5  White wins. }
17. Rf4
{ 17.Rb4  Qd5  18.fxg6  Rxf1+  19.Qxf1  hxg6  followed by e5 or Qxd6 wins for Black }
17... Qd5 18. fxg6 hxg6
{ Trying to get some pieces off the board doesn't help after   18...Rxf4 ?  19.Nxf4  Qxd6  20.gxh7+  Kxh7  and now both Rb3 or Qh5 followed by Rb3 win for White. }
19. Rg4 Rf6
{ 19...Rf2  20.Rxg6  with the idea Qe1 and Bc3  20...Qe4  Black has a double attack, but after  21.Rg3  Qxe2  22.Qxe2  Rxe2  23.Bh6  ±  White wins. }
20. Nc3 Qh5 21. Ne4 Rf7 22. Ng3 Qh7
{ If Black allows Rxg6 then White can simply increase the pressure on g7 with Nh5, Bh6 and Qg4 winning back the piece with a continuing attack. }
23. Bg5 c5 { 23...Be5  24.Rh4  Qg7  25.Ne4  is no better for Black. } 24. Rh4
{ Winning the Black queen. } 24... Qxh4 25. Bxh4 Nc6 26. Qg4 Ne5 27. Qa4 b6 28.
Rxb6 Nc4 { 28...axb6  29.Qxa8 } 29. Rb1 Nxd6 30. Qg4 Bb7

{ 32.Bg5  Nf5  33.Nxf5  exf5  34.h4  wins as well. } 32... Nf5 33. Nxf5 exf5
