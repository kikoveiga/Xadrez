{ This is a madman's repertoire for chess barbarians.   I am proud, happy and tired to present it to you, this the 2nd  (and final)  part of my 1. d4 repertoire. It’s been my biggest challenge as an author thus far. But I feel confident that I have created a repertoire that is full of fire!   My approach is the same as with 'Break The Rules: Play The Trompowsky!' which I published 3 months ago. Most of the lines that you will study here don't guarantee White any objective advantage, by an engine’s standard, but White's results in practice have been excellent.  This repertoire:  a  is very sharp and tactical. The variations I present are designed for players who aren't afraid to fight for a full point right from the start of the game.  b  has been put together after more than 10 years of playing experience. I recall losing only one game with White back in 2012. I have firsthand knowledge and experience to share with you.  c  contains well over 600 trainable variations which, along with the 120+ lines from 'Break The Rules…,' brings the total to well over 700 for the complete 1.d4 repertoire.   As you’ve probably gathered from the 'Go for The Throat' title this is not a positional repertoire that is based on simplicity or playing for a small edge.  I've always preferred this type of aggressive approach to chess but there has always been one thing that bothered me, in most chess books which propose this types of play there were usually some holes in the analysis that gradually made these variations unplayable. I guarantee that ALL of my 600 lines have been checked with the best engines and have been meticulously analyzed so you won't be hitting your head against this wall.  A few lines might end with a perpetual check for Black. But, you can rest assured that Black will have to earn his perpetuals with either stellar opening preparation or super GM level calculative abilities.  I could do what some authors do - offer White a repertoire where Black plays only mediocre lines, skip all of Black's good replies and claim that 1. d4 d5 2. Nh3!!! is a serial killer type-of-move. But, this goes against my philosophy of building a repertoire for my future students and most importantly, for myself. In every line that is objectively equal, instead of making up some unreal evaluations I give you plans and explanations on how to proceed. Remember that even if Black somehow manages to equalize, that isn't the end of his problems.  Now going into some detail. I feel there is no DECENT sideline opening for White after 1. d4 d5 that leads to a tactical fight right from the start. There is 1. d4 d5 2. Bg5 trying to play in the style of the Trompowsky, but objectively Black can at least equalize after 2... h6 followed by 3... c5  (as played in the game Plichta - Terrieux, Portugal Open 2019)  . Even stronger is 2...f6! 3.Bh4 Nh6! followed by ...Nf5 and ... h7 - h5 - h4 when it's Black who starts asking difficult questions. There is also 1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4, but I think that 3...a6 solves Black's problems. Also, I've never played this line with White so I wouldn't be able to share my knowledge and experience in this line.  Please note that it was impossible to avoid repeating some lines from other authors because in some variations there really is only one line for White that gives us an advantage, so whenever necessary I give the same line. So if you feel that I've copied a few variations then the verdict is crystal clear - guilty - a life sentence of playing the London system for this man  (please no)  ! All of the accompanying explanations and annotations, however, are my own.   This repertoire contains 22 chapters.   Below, I give a brief summary of each chapter.  1  The Botvinnik System 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5 dxc4 6. e4 - definitely the sharpest chapter of the book. That's why I decided to start with it. If Black knows his theory up to move 30 he will survive. Otherwise, you will get a full point.  2  The Anti-Moscow Gambit - 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 - I'm sure that people who were on the USA side of the Cold War are delighted with this title. This line is a younger brother of the Botvinnik System, but White gets huge initiative for the sacrificed pawn. During my chess career, I've played this line 4 times  (2 classical + 2 rapid)  scoring 100% with an average opponent rating of around 2250.  3  The Cambridge Springs - 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. cxd5 - It was a popular line around 20 years ago but it almost disappeared from top chess practice. My suggested line 8. Rc1!? instead of 8. Qd2 will catch a lot of people by surprise and it scores very well in practice.  4  The Queen's Gambit Declined Hybrid - 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5 Be7 - Black will get the most passive line of this opening. Normally in QGD Black strikes with ...c7-c5 while here his pawn has already moved to c6.  5  The 4... dxc4 5. a4 Bf5 6. Ne5 Slav without 6... Nbd7 - Here we will analyze lines such as 6... e6 or 6... Na6. White gets a modest advantage in all of these.  6  The 4... dxc4 5. a4 Bf5 6. Ne5 Slav with 6... Nbd7 - Black will be quite close to equalizing, but he will never be able to fully level the chances.  7  The 4... a6 Slav - Black's setup is designed to be very solid but quite passive. It's not a problem to get a small advantage against this line, but it was hard for me to find a line that leads to sharp positions. I asked my colleague GM Daniel Sadzikowski for help and he suggested a very interesting line starting with 5. Qc2. You can expect fireworks here!  8  Rare lines of The Slav - All of the nonsense lines that Black can choose to avoid main lines. You can expect quick wins for White when you memorize the lines.  9  Queen's Gambit Accepted 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 - Of course we grab the centre. I need to admit that some lines were influenced by works of GM's Avrukh and Schandorff but most of my analysis is quite fresh. Black is very close to equalizing in the 3... e5 line but, trust me, only after a lot of bleeding.  10  Queen's Gambit Declined Main Line - 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 We will go for the line that made this opening almost disappear in the 60s and 70s. Only lately had Black started to look for some alternatives but without success. Botvinnik's old plan  (which was also used by Kasparov)  with f2-f3 followed be e3 - e4 is still kicking and alive.  11  Queen's Gambit Declined Minor Lines - Here you will find all of the options that Black can go for if he wants to avoid the mainline. 3... Be7 is objectively equalizing for our opponent, but only after the line that a mere 4 players have managed to play  (!)  , otherwise, Black is suffering.  12  The Marshall Gambit of The Triangle System - 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c6 4. e4!? leading to razor-sharp complications with a big initiative for White.  13  The Tarrasch Defence 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 - It was never popular until Mr Garry Kasparov started using it. I think that 6.dxc5! will catch many of your opponents by surprise.  14  The Chigorin 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 - We will play 3. Nf3 followed by a sharp plan for White. More details inside the chapter!  15  The Albin Counter-Gambit 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 - We take the pawn and are very happy - life is good in this line.  16  Various 2nd moves for White - 2... Bf5 2... c5 or 2... Nf6 - all of them fail to equalize. You can expect a big novelty in the 2... Bf5 line where something that was supposed to work for Black works for White very well. 3. Qb3 will bamboozle your opponents and you should be happy about that!  17  The Dutch 1... f5 - I couldn't go for any other recommendation than 2.g4! It's one of the first lines that I created while working with an engine and I love the super sharp positions arising out of this gambit.   18  The French 1... e6 2. e4 d5 3. Bd3!? - A very interesting sideline that leads to atypical positions for The French Defence. It doesn't require a ton of work and most of the lines are very sharp.  19  The Pirc 1... d6 2. e4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bg5 Bg7 5. e5!? - I decided to go for a not so popular but high scoring line. Note that I abandoned playing the Pirc as Black because of 4. Bg5 in which I experienced two painful losses against lower-rated opponents.  20  The Philidor - Here we analyze different versions of the Philidor. Against the most popular one, we go for the 5.g4!? gambit which is very interesting and fun to play.  21  The Modern 1... g6 - We will develop our Bishop to g5 and create problems for Black  (sound familiar?)  .  22  Various 1st moves - Odds and ends. Don't ever expect problems in any of these lines.  'Wait a minute! This was supposed to be 1. d4 repertoire and you give us Philidor, Pirc, and French? What's wrong with you, dude?!'   Ok, let's imagine 1. d4 d6. If we play 2. c4 or 2. Nf3 Black can respond with 2... Nf6 and trick us into the King's Indian, which is outside of our repertoire. It's possible to play 1. d4 d6 2. Bg5 and I've used this line in the 2019 Polish Blitz Championship, but I don't believe it to be any good. By process of elimination, 2. e4 is the only response to stay within the boundaries of our repertoire.  What about 1... e6? After 2. c4 Nf6 we reach the Nimzo-Indian after 3.Nc3 or the Queen's Indian after 3. Nf3 b6 not to mention the Bogo Indian after 3... Bb4+ or the Benoni after 3... c5. As you can see, 2.e4 is the only sensible option.  Please note that almost every line I suggest scores a huge 60+% of the time in databases. This means that even considering the fact that Black can objectively equalize, in practice, he will face tremendous problems. And in my opinion, that's the way to rock in the time of modern opening theory.  It took me around 4 times as long to create this course compared to the Tromp. It's the most honest and aggressive repertoire I could make. I could probably cut 30-40% of Black's sidelines but then it would be incomplete and you, dear reader, would risk meeting one of these lines in practice without knowing them.  I would like to thank my friend - CM Andrzej Krzywda - for writing a foreword for this course. You may recognize him from his great blog 'From 2100 to International Master - Andrzej Krzywda.  During last three months he played a ton more 'Tromps' than I did and, he is quite happy to start playing the lines from the 2nd part too!  Last but not least I want to thank one person - TheFalconer who helped me improve this repertoire every step of the way. In other words, he looked at every line in this repertoire and suggested a lot of improvements  (which was not easy because of my English 'skills')  . You, man, are the legend!

{ Hello everyone, my name is Andrzej Krzywda and I’m a ~2200 player from Poland. I’m on my journey from 2100 to International Master and so far I've managed to make my first IM norm.  This journey is a long and struggling experience. There are ups and downs.   The path to improvement in chess has so many dimensions that it’s hard to measure it really correctly. Apart from all the possible metrics  (points, wins, norms, ratings)  there are things like joy, fun, happiness - without it I’d quit a long time ago.  I like to find inspirations among people who already did what I’m trying to do - have a higher rating. I met FM Kamil Plichta while being on my journey and I consider Kamil to be my chess mentor. He’s already an FM, he made one IM norm, his rating is much higher than mine.   Kamil is true openings expert. He’s already widely known for this, especially in the Polish chess world  (some GMs using his analysis)  but world wide as well.  I’d say that Kamil’s strength boils down to the following aspects:  - psychological approach to chess, finding positions which are uncomfortable for the opponent  - aggresive play, killer-like attitude  - deep opening preparation  - excellent skills on working with chess tools, engines, databases  I’m a big fan of Kamil’s opening repertoire 'Break the Rules: Play the Trompowsky!' which you can also find exclusively here Chessable. I started playing this myself and just in my first Trompovsky classical game I made a draw against a Grandmaster! The famous Tromp brought me many points against GMs and IMs in blitz and rapid games too.  I was very excited when I found out that Kamil is working on the complimentary repertoire - the missing 1. d4 d5 and all of the other sidelines - of which the Trompowsky is only small part.   During my journey to IM I consider a regular extension of my opening repertoire to be a must. Thanks to Kamil I now have more aggressive options to play especially in all the 1. d4 d5 lines, where it’s hard to be super-active with White.  I’ve been a beta tester of this repertoire. And, so far, I've found this repertoire to be of the highest quality. I already played some of these lines in some rapid games with great results. I like the choice of the Carlsbad structure - I think it’s a good fit with the Bg5 based on the Tromp lines.  I’m also enjoying the lines against the Slav - some surprises are waiting for my opponents!  What I like in Kamil’s choices is that he’s using the database stats combined with engines, but he also gives it a human touch. This results in the types of positions which are hard to play against for our opponents.  I’m recommending all FM Plichta’s work, this repertoire and the Tromp one. I’m happy that I can rely on his openings, while on my journey to IM and I wish you all the best possible chess improvements, while having fun with aggresive play!

Objectively this variation should lead to a draw, but that means that Black must play over 20 correct moves starting from the 9th move. Scared ? Don't be !

{ This move combined with the presence of the a6-Bishop is the main idea of this line for Black. }
17. bxc3 bxc3 18. Bxc3 Nxf6 19. f3
{ The position is quite murky, but White will place his Queen on c2 - and possibly the queenside Rook on c1 - to start 'watching' the c6-pawn. Also remember that the standard plan in the Botvinnik structures is to go h2-h4. Our King will find a shelter on f2 where it is surprisingly safe + we are a pawn up. }

11... Bb7

5. Bg5

In most of the lines White scores a huge 60% +, which indicates how problematic Black's position can be to handle in practical play. Objectively this variation should lead to a draw, but that means that Black must play over 20 correct moves starting from the 9th move. Scared ? Don't be !

We will double the Rooks on the d-file and Black can't look for salvation. }

{ White enjoys the usual compensation here. As you can see Black lags in development, while all of our minor pieces are nicely coordinated. The rule says, that when you have a lead in development, you should open the position, so we strike with e3-e4 immediately. I will just add that White scores 76.9% from this position. }

{ We solidify our Knight's position while strengthening the centre - especially the e5-square - and create a possibility for the future Rf1-f3-g3/h3 lift. If Black wants to get rid of our Knight, he will have to weaken his kingside with h6 or f6. }

In both of them Black castles, but one of them involves queenside castling and the other one involves kingside castling. So remember that - when you have a possibility to attack the a7-pawn - do it ! It means that if Black castles kingside there is no point to attack a7 as it is protected. So we play Qe3 after Black's O-O-O - now we attack the a7-pawn - and Qe5 after O-O.

Our King is on c2, but it is perfectly fine there, as Black doesn't have too many pieces to attack it. Tournament practice confirms, that the Bishop is more valuable than the three pawns. Some lines may be confusing for you so let me give you a hint. I always had problems with remembering in which line I play Qe3 and in which Qe5. In both of them Black castles, but one of them involves queenside castling and the other one involves kingside castling. So remember that - when you have a possibility to attack the a7-pawn - do it ! It means that if Black castles kingside there is no point to attack a7 as it is protected. So we play Qe3 after Black's O-O-O - now we attack the a7-pawn - and Qe5 after O-O. When you can't remember something it is good to use this kind of trick. }

{ This move defines the line which is called the Chameleon Slav or the Chebanenko Slav. The famous coach of Moldovian players, Viacheslav Chebanenko had a big impact on development of this line. I also saw in some sources, that this variation is just called the a6-Slav. At first glance Black's idea may look ridiculous, as the ...a7-a6 move doesn't contribute to development at all. However it has some venom. Black's idea is to play ...b7-b5 gaining some space on the queenside. Also Black can play ...e7-e6 with or without ...Bf5/Bg4 when his position will be quite passive, but extremely solid.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ In this chapter we will take a look at the Queen's Gambit Accepted. Black takes on c4 not to win a pawn, but to win some time for development. He will try to open some lines to develop both of his Bishops. Normally in the classical Queen's Gambit Declined the c8-Bishop is a problem, but now the d5-pawn won't obstruct its way. Black's main theme is to prepare counterattacking ideas against our strong centre. }
3. e4
{ Of course when given a chance we want to grab the centre. Now Black has no less than five different lines and every one of them has an independent flavour. The top players react with  3...e5  or  3...Nf6  most often , but the other moves can be seen from time to time here or there. }
3... Nf6
{ This is the 2nd most popular move for Black. He relies on piece play leaving eventual pawn breaks for later. }
4. e5
{ This is the best continuation. We give up the d5-square, but gain some time for the development. Also our e5-pawn secures us a nice space advantage, which can be a good starting point for a future kingside attack. }
4... Nd5 5. Bxc4 Bf5
{ This rare move was suggested by one of my readers - chess95. I thought it is going to be my usual 'switch on an engine and the database and kill the line', but in fact, this line has much more venom than I initially thought. Black's idea is very simple - develop the light-squared Bishop and only then play ... e6. }
6. Qb3
{ This is our move. It is also possible to play  6.Ne2  e6  7.O-O  Nb6  8.Bb3  but our Bishop was forced to go to b3 instead of usual d3 so I abandoned that idea. }
6... c6
{ The only move.  6...e6  is dubious since White can play  7.Qxb7  with no compensation for Black. }
7. Ne2
{ I think this is the most accurate move. The most popular continuation for White is   7.Bxd5  cxd5  8.Qxb7  but it allows Black to get huge compensation after  8...Qc8!  9.Qxc8+   9.Qxa8  leads to perpetual after  9...Qxc1+  Bxc8  and we can discuss if White can get any advantage after something like  10.Nc3  e6  11.f4  , but tournament practice shows that Black has nothing to fear and I think it would be completely impractical to go for this variation. }
7... Qb6
{ After 7... e6 White can play the improved version of the line from comments to 7. Ne2.   So  7...e6  8.Bxd5  cxd5  and after  9.Qxb7  Black can't exchange Queens by means of ... Qc8. }
8. Qg3
{ This move is a novelty but I think it has some venom. White usually played 8. Qf3 attacking the Bishop, but Black wants to play ... e6 anyway, so I think our Queen is useless on f3. We play 8. Qg3 to pressurize Black's kingside - especially the g7-pawn. }
8... Bxb1
{ This is a common move in this line. Be careful! Black threatens ... Qb4+ picking up our Bishop so an intermediate Bxd5! is necessary!   If Black plays slowly with  8...e6  then after  9.O-O  White enjoys a good position and Black still has to find a way to develop the kingside. }
9. Bxd5 cxd5 10. Rxb1 e6 11. O-O Nc6 12. Be3
{ The dust has settled and we can sum up the latest few moves. Black managed to exchange his potentially bad light-squared Bishop and White is left with a potentially bad Bishop on his own. However, things are not so simple. White's King is safe and we have freedom of movement. On the other hand, Black has to think twice where to put the King, because both short and long castling looks dangerous. Also, If Black wants to develop the dark-squared Bishop, he needs to do something about the g7-pawn. If the pawn is moved to g6, then suddenly our Bishop is super valuable, because of newly created dark-squared weaknesses. White's next move will be Rfc1 finishing development and then we can improve our position with useful moves such as b2-b4 gaining space on the queenside, or even Qg4 followed by Ng3-h5 with even more pressure on the kingside. All in all, I think if Black treads the position with the extra care he will be equal, but I would avoid playing the Black side in practice at all costs. }

6... Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 { Once again we see this typical idea. } 8. Be4 f5
{ This move is quite tricky. The point is that if our e4-Bishop moves, Black will follow up with ... f5-f4 clearing the f5-square for his Bishop. }

9... fxe4

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ In this chapter we will take a look at the Queen's Gambit Accepted. Black takes on c4 not to win a pawn, but to win some time for development. He will try to open some lines to develop both of his Bishops. Normally in the classical Queen's Gambit Declined the c8-Bishop is a problem, but now the d5-pawn won't obstruct its way. Black's main theme is to prepare counterattacking ideas against our strong centre. }
3. e4
{ Of course when given a chance we want to grab the centre. Now Black has no less than five different lines and every one of them has an independent flavour. The top players react with  3...e5  or  3...Nf6  most often , but the other moves can be seen from time to time here or there. }
3... c5
{ This line was quite popular around 15-20 years ago, but it gradually was replaced by the more popular lines. Black can't hope to achieve equality by playing this move. Ok, it strikes at our centre, but it doesn't contribute to the development of his pieces at all. }
4. d5 { This is the best move, as it gains space and avoids complications. }
4... Nf6 5. Nc3 b5
{ 5...e6  6.Bxc4  exd5  7.Nxd5  We reached the position from the 4... e6 5. Bxc4 line. }
6. Bf4
{ This is a key move which killed the whole variation for Black. Before people discovered the 6. Bf4 line they played 6. e5, but that led to messy positions. In practice these lines score pretty well for Black and an improvement was necessary. }
6... a6 7. e5
{ Now White gets an improved version of e5 lines, as ...a7-a6 is hardly useful for Black. }
7... b4 8. exf6 bxc3 9. bxc3 exf6 10. Qe2+
{ An annoying resource that spoils Black's coordination. } 10... Qe7 11. Nf3
Nd7 12. Rb1

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6
{ By playing this move Black wants to enter the cadillac of chess - the Queen's Gambit Declined. This is the opening that was played by all of the World Chess Champions, from Steinitz to Magnus Carlsen. This opening is very popular on every level and there is a good reason for that. Black can get a playable position by playing his opening moves on some kind of an autopilot. The negative side of Black's opening scheme is that his light-squared Bishop will have some trouble finding a route out of the pawn chain. In this chapter we will look at the main Queen's Gambit Declined positions. In the next chapter you can look at all of the Black's alternatives such as 3... Be7. }
4. cxd5
{ The highest scoring move which sets the biggest set of problems for our opponent. If Black recaptures with 4... exd5, we will have the so-called 'Carlsbad pawn structure'. We will develop our Bishops actively - our c1-Bishop will go to g5 followed by e2-e3 and Bd3. }
4... exd5
{ 4... Nxd5 is also possible and it will be analysed in the next chapter. I decided not to analyse it here, as the 4... Nxd5 line leads to quite different positions in comparison with the more classical Queen's Gambit Declined. }
5. Bg5
{ We want to play e2-e3, so it is obligatory to develop our c1-Bishop first, as otherwise it would be blocked by the f2-e3-d4 pawn chain. We go to g5, because 5. Bf4 allows 5... Bd6 with simplifications. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6
{ By playing this move Black wants to enter the cadillac of chess - the Queen's Gambit Declined. This is the opening that was played by all of the World Chess Champions, from Steinitz to Magnus Carlsen. This opening is very popular on every level and there is a good reason for that. Black can get a playable position by playing his opening moves on some kind of an autopilot. The negative side of Black's opening scheme is that his light-squared Bishop will have some trouble finding a route out of the pawn chain. In this chapter we will look at the main Queen's Gambit Declined positions. In the next chapter you can look at all of the Black's alternatives such as 3... Be7. }
4. cxd5
{ The highest scoring move which sets the biggest set of problems for our opponent. If Black recaptures with 4... exd5, we will have the so-called 'Carlsbad pawn structure'. We will develop our Bishops actively - our c1-Bishop will go to g5 followed by e2-e3 and Bd3. }
4... exd5
{ 4... Nxd5 is also possible and it will be analysed in the next chapter. I decided not to analyse it here, as the 4... Nxd5 line leads to quite different positions in comparison with the more classical Queen's Gambit Declined. }
5. Bg5
{ We want to play e2-e3, so it is obligatory to develop our c1-Bishop first, as otherwise it would be blocked by the f2-e3-d4 pawn chain. We go to g5, because 5. Bf4 allows 5... Bd6 with simplifications. }

10. Qc2

Note that  13...Bh3  fails to  14.Nf4.  The problem with this line is that Black is not obliged to take on b4 and can play 10... a6 or 10... Ne6 instead. It is not a bad position for White at all, but our main plan is to go for a quick f2-f3 followed by e2-e4. By playing 10. b4 we mix up our systems and would have to learn both plans rather than one. }

{ We want to play e2-e3, so it is obligatory to develop our c1-Bishop first, as otherwise it would be blocked by the f2-e3-d4 pawn chain. We go to g5, because 5. Bf4 allows 5... Bd6 with simplifications. }
5... c6 6. e3
{ This is a natural follow-up. Some sources claim that starting with 6. Qc2 is stronger, but in my opinion 6. e3 is better. The only disadvantage of 6. e3 is that it allows 6... Bf5, but I don't consider this line as a huge threat to us. On the other hand, if we go 6. Qc2, Black's lines connected with the future ...Nh5 jumps are much more logical for our opponent, because our Queen is very often misplaced on c2. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Nge2 Nh5
{ This idea is very common in the 6. Qc2 line, but with our Queen on d1 it is not as effective. What's the difference ? Imagine this position with our Knight on g1 and our Queen on c2 instead. Black's main idea is to go 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 followed by ...Nb6, ...g6, ... Ng7 and finally ...Bf5 exchanging his potentially bad Bishop. White's plan to stop this idea is to castle queenside followed by h2-h3 and g2-g4 claiming the f5-square. The problem is that the kingside has been weakened, and Black gets good play after a well-timed ...h7-h5, striking at our g4-pawn. I don't believe that White can fight for an opening advantage that way and whenever I got this type of position in my training games, I messed them up quite quickly, which indicates that in practice it is easy to go wrong - or that I am a bad player, but don't tell anyone. Now the difference with our Queen being on d1 is that whenever Black goes ...Bf5, we can just retreat our d3-Bishop avoiding exchanges, while with the Queen on c2 it would be impossible. }
9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Qd2 Nb6 11. f3
{ We continue in the style of the main line. We want to prepare the e3-e4 break. }
11... g6 12. O-O O-O 13. Rae1
{ All of our pieces support the e3-e4 break. I like White's chances. } 13...
Be6 14. e4 dxe4 15. fxe4
{ Our strong centre guarantees at least a slight advantage. I recommend looking at the game Ding - Inarkiev, Baku 2015 to see how to proceed. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6
{ By playing this move Black wants to enter the cadillac of chess - the Queen's Gambit Declined. This is the opening that was played by all of the World Chess Champions, from Steinitz to Magnus Carlsen. This opening is very popular on every level and there is a good reason for that. Black can get a playable position by playing his opening moves on some kind of an autopilot. The negative side of Black's opening scheme is that his light-squared Bishop will have some trouble finding a route out of the pawn chain. In this chapter we will look at the main Queen's Gambit Declined positions. In the next chapter you can look at all of the Black's alternatives such as 3... Be7. }
4. cxd5
{ The highest scoring move which sets the biggest set of problems for our opponent. If Black recaptures with 4... exd5, we will have the so-called 'Carlsbad pawn structure'. We will develop our Bishops actively - our c1-Bishop will go to g5 followed by e2-e3 and Bd3. }

Qc2, Black's lines connected with the future ...Nh5 jumps are much more logical for our opponent, because our Queen is very often misplaced on c2. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Nge2 h6
{ A recommendation of Ntirlis from his book about 1.d4 d5 for Black. I have a huge fondness for this author's books so it will be a tough nut to crack. Still, I will try to present you a line that guarantees White at least a more pleasant position from a practical point. Let me also mention, that White scores around 65% after 8...h6 so I wouldn't be too afraid of this line. }
9. Bh4 Nh5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Qd2
{ We have a similar position to the #255 line but Black has an extra ...h6 move included. We should play in a similar way to the previous variation. }
11... Nb6
{ This plan is Ntirlis's recommendation. Black will play ...Bd7 followed by ...O-O. }
12. f3 Bd7 13. O-O O-O 14. g4 { I like this aggressive move the most. } 14...
Nf6 15. Rae1
{ Bringing the last piece into the game. Black has to react actively to fight for equality. }
15... Rfe8 16. Nf4
{ 16. Ng3 was also possible but I prefer to put my Knight on the more aggressive position. }
16... c5
{ Seeking for counterplay. If Black sits and waits, we will play h2-h4 followed by g4-g5 with a big initiative on the kingside. }
17. h4 Rac8
{ Black brings the last piece into the game and will rely on a nice tactical trick to avoid a disaster on the kingside. }
18. g5 hxg5 19. hxg5 Nh5
{ This is the aforementioned trick. If not for this move, Black's whole concept would be dubious. }
20. Qg2 Nxf4 21. exf4 Qf8
{ Giving up the Queen for the two Rooks with 21...Qxe1?! would be incorrect due to a weak position of the Black King. On the other hand, it would take a lot of time for Black's Rooks to coordinate. Ntirlis ends his analysis here claiming that Black has a fair share of chances. I don't disagree but I still prefer White after the following sequence. }
22. Qh2 g6 23. dxc5 Qxc5+ 24. Kg2
{ For the moment White threatens Rh1. After Black defends against our threat we can strengthen our position with Kg3 - a perfect square for our King.   Now , for example ,  24...Qf8?!  would be inaccurate due to  25.a4!  and our pawn is untouchable due to the fact , that Black's minor pieces need to guard the kingside. Allowing our a-pawn to move forward isn't perfect but after  25...a5  we can play  26.Rxe8  Rxe8  27.Rh1  Qg7  28.Qg1  switching to the queenside.   The best move for Black is  24...Qd4  but after  25.Rd1  Qg7  26.Kg3  Re3  27.Rfe1  I like White's chances.  Even if all Rooks and Queens are exchanged White will retain good pressure by putting his Knight on d4 and trying to create a passed pawn on the kingside with f4-f5. To sum up, I think that in practical play Black will be under pressure. }

I can tell you one thing - playing this position from White's perspective is quite joyful if you familiarize yourself with the key strategical and tactical plans.

{ We want to play e2-e3, so it is obligatory to develop our c1-Bishop first, as otherwise it would be blocked by the f2-e3-d4 pawn chain. We go to g5, because 5. Bf4 allows 5... Bd6 with simplifications. }

I can tell you one thing - playing this position from White's perspective is quite joyful if you familiarize yourself with the key strategical and tactical plans. I can give you one practical hint which I use myself. DON'T PLAY E3-E4 TOO EARLY !!! Most of the time you can play e3-e4 if Black can't successfully play one of the two ideas: 1...dxe4 fxe4 followed by ...Ng4 or 2...dxe4 fxe4 followed by ..c6-c5. If neither of these moves is dangerous for you, then e3-e4 is usually a good idea. I am used to preparing it a little with moves such as: h2-h3, Rae1 and sometimes Kh1. }
11... Ng6
{ The 2nd most popular move. Black's ideas include ...h7-h6 or ...Nh5 exchanging dark-squared Bishops. The Knight on g6 takes away the f4 and h4 squares from our Bishop, so we will be forced to exchange it. On the positive side we get a nice lead in development which will start to tell when we open the centre. }

{ By playing this move Black wants to enter the cadillac of chess - the Queen's Gambit Declined. This is the opening that was played by all of the World Chess Champions, from Steinitz to Magnus Carlsen. This opening is very popular on every level and there is a good reason for that. Black can get a playable position by playing his opening moves on some kind of an autopilot. The negative side of Black's opening scheme is that his light-squared Bishop will have some trouble finding a route out of the pawn chain. In this chapter we will look at the main Queen's Gambit Declined positions. In the next chapter you can look at all of the Black's alternatives such as 3... Be7. }

It's quite sad that this line doesn't objectively work for White, but I want to tell you this - in practice I scored 3/3 from this position and the score increases if we count rapid and blitz games. Unfortunately Stockfish buried one of my favourite lines, which makes me kind of sad, because I can't recommend it to you. One of my rules when creating opening repertoires is that if I do it for White, I will never suggest any line that objectively leads to an advantage for Black. I have no problem with advocating a line that objectively doesn't guarantee any advantage, but =+ is not acceptable for me. The same rule states that for Black, I can suggest a line that leads to a slightly worse position, but never to a much worse one. So if you want to try 4. cxd5 followed by 5. e4 you never heard it from me ! It's like when Mr Ethan Hunt gets caught - we don't know each other and we've never met. }

{ This developing move is the best, as 12. O-O-O runs into 12... O-O-O 13. Qa3 Kb7 14. Bf3 Qf4+ 15. Rd2 Qc7 when Black has no problems. }
12... Ne7 { White can create a strong attack. } 13. O-O-O
{ Now if Black doesn't take on e2 we will play Rfe1. } 13... Qxe2 14. Qxd7+ Kf7
15. Rhe1 Qxc4 16. Re3
{ A key to understanding why this move is so strong is to know what Black's threats are. The first threat is to go ... Rad8/Rhd8 and if we take twice on d8, then ...Qxa2 or ...Nc5/...Nb4 and our queenside is dead. The second threat is to go ...Nc5 or ...Nb4 immediately. We need to react quickly, as Black's innocent pieces may turn into vicious attackers. So why is 16. Re3 so strong ? It creates counter threats starting with Ne5+ or Ng5+, when our Rook on e3 can switch to f3 and White would be completely winning. 16. Re3 is the only move for White, but it's insanely strong. }
16... Rhe8
{ The only move that doesn't lose on the spot. Why is it important to put the h8-Rook on e8 ? I will explain it in the comments to White's 19th move.   Note that the natural  16...Rhd8 ??  loses to  17.Ne5+  fxe5  18.Rf3+  winning for White.   I would also like to mention that moving the other Rook with  16...Rae8 ??  loses to  17.b3  Qg4  18.h3  Qf4  19.Rd4 ! }
17. b3 Qg4 18. h3 Qf4 19. Rd4
{ 19.Qxe6  ?+ wouldn't be too strong as after  19...Kf8  Black gets rid of the pin.  He also threatens some discovered attacks with his e7-Knight - especially ...Nd5. By playing 19. Rd4 ! first we expell Black's Queen and only then proceed with taking on e6. }
19... Qh6 20. Qxe6+ Kf8 21. Qd6
{ Now you see the difference - with Black's Queen on f4 this wouldn't be a strong move, but now it pins Black's e7-Knight and our Queen dominates the board. }
21... c5 22. Rd2
{ I am curious about possible moves for Black. I think that he is simply busted. One plan to improve our position is to go for g2-g4-g5, while Kb2 is a nice prophylactic move removing our King from the c1-h6 diagonal. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5
{ This is a starting point of the so-called Tarrasch Defence. For many years Black's plan was considered to be slightly dubious, because he will be left with an isolated pawn. On the other hand, he will try to open lines for his minor pieces and people started to take this opening seriously when Mr Garry Kasparov included the Tarrasch Defence in his repertoire. Years have passed and nowadays the verdict is between equalish with some suffering for Black or slightly better for White. }

{ 5.e4 ?!  would fit very well into our aggressive repertoire , but unfortunately it leads to worse positions for White.

Black's score from this position is two wins and two draws. Objectively this position should be equal , but I don't fancy playing it. }
7... Bxf3

{ This move scores a whopping 79.7% for White. Our point is crystal clear - force Black to recapture on d5 with a piece. As I mentioned, we can't wait with this capture, as if we play 3. Nc3, then 3... g6 welcomes us to the Grunfeld world, while 3. Nf3 would allow 3.. .e6, when we've been tricked into a line outside of our repertoire. }

{ Normally in the grunfeld Black would be able to capture on c3, but since we haven't developed our Knight, Black's horsey has to retreat. }
4... Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Nf3
{ Of course 6. d5 would be a mistake, as Black gets the c5-square for his Bishop and can proceed with ...c7-c6 attacking our centre. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Bf5
{ In this chapter we will take a look at various 2nd moves for Black. Some of them are dubious, but some are quite playable. Such tries as 2... Nc6 or 2... e5 have already been analysed, so our main focus will be on 2... Bf5, 2... c5 and 2... Nf6. I didn't analyse lines such as 2... a6 or 2... b6, because you don't need an opening book to combat these. This line starting with 2... Bf5 is known as the Baltic Defense. Black's main idea is to develop his Bishop and follow with ...e7-e6 with a solid position. One of his ideas is to respond 3. cxd5 with Bxb1 !? and I think White can only count on a very small advantage, but no more than that. }
3. Qb3
{ Almost every source claims that there are two good moves for White - either 3. Nc3 or 3. cxd5. There is one move that is always criticized - 3. Qb3. I recall seeing multiple times that 3. Qb3 e5 ! is 'what Black wants' or 'with an unclear position'. So here we change that statement ! From now 3. Qb3 ! e5 is what White wants ! It requires memorizing a few lines, but it will benefit from it. Our move 3. Qb3 is quite sharp and concrete, as it creates a double threat against the d5 and b7 pawns. }

1. d4 f5
{ One of the sharpest openings in chess - the Dutch Defence. This is a perfect choice for Black to play for a win, as pawn structures will be quite unstereotypical. The move 1... f5 creates imbalances right at the start of the game. Black will decide if he wants to go for the Leningrad System which is characterized by ...g6 followed by ...Bg7 and most often ...d6 and ...Qe8, for the Classical Dutch with ...e6, ...Nf6, ...Be7, ...d6 followed by castling and ...Qd8-Qe8-h5, or even the Stonewall Dutch trying to obtain strong central control with the c6-d5-e6-f5 pawn chain. }
2. g4
{ I couldn't stop myself from giving this move an exclamation mark. It's one of the highest scoring lines in chess for me. When I saw this line back in 2006 I immediately fell in love with it. I play this gambit even nowadays, because I think it offers White chances of obtaining a huge initiative. I think it's also strong from a psychological point of view, as Black is not able to enter one of his favourite setups and he is forced to find good moves at the board. As you will see from my subsequent comments, this line helped me score my first International Master norm when I faced IM Ihor Nester in the Vasylyshyn Memorial 2017. }

1. d4 e6
{ By playing this move, Black wants to lure us into 2. c4 lines and force us to abandon our repertoire. 1. d4 e6 2. c4 allows Black to play either 2. ..Nf6 transposing to the Nimzo Indian, 2... c5 transposing to the Modern Benoni, or 2... f5 transposing to the Dutch. In all cases Black avoids some annoying lines like the Trompowsky - ha ! - against 1... Nf6 and 2. g4 - another ha ! - or 2. Bg5 against the Dutch. The only disadvantage for Black is that he allows us to enter French Defence territory. }
2. e4
{ If you have no problems with transposing to the Nimzo, the Benoni or the Dutch, then 2. c4 or even 2. Nf3 is for you. For us it's not possible, as our pet line against 1. Nf6 is 2. Bg5 which was analysed in my first book for Chessable. 2. e4 is the only option for us to stay within the boundaries of our repertoire. Don't worry though, as the line that I suggest scores very well in practice and is known to be quite tricky to face. }
2... d5 { 2...c5  3.d5  enters Benoni territory. } 3. Bd3
{ We break some rules by developing a Bishop before Knights, but we've never cared about any rules. Of course we care, I just want it to sound rebellious ! 3. Bd3 doesn't promise White an easy advantage, but it leads to sharp positions which are untypical for the French Defence. }
3... c5
{ This is the 2nd most popular option. Black strikes at our centre in a typical French-style. }
4. exd5
{ We can transpose to a favourable version of the Exchange French. I don't blame you if you flinched hearing about the Exchange French, but this version is really really really good for us. }
4... Qxd5
{ What can be more natural then retaking with the Queen and attacking the d4 and g2 pawns at the same time ? 10-15% - that's the number of games that see this move ! White's idea is not obvious at all and many players on the Black side have been caught by surprise. }
5. Nc3
{ Normally Black's players start to knit their brows and contemplate what's going on here. After few seconds they realize that taking on d4 is very risky, while taking on g2 loses at once. So they know that they've lost time with 4... Qxd5. Good for us ! }
5... Qd8 { Most games see this retreat. } 6. Bf4
{ In my opinion this developing move is the best. Black has fallen behind in the development and he needs to play precisely to survive into the middlegame. Our plan is to take on c5 followed by Nf3, Qe2 and O-O-O with a harmonious position. One trick to remember is that if Black moves his queenside Knight to c6 or d7, then we can play Nb5 winning. Normally Black would be able to cover c7 with ...Na6. }
6... Nf6 7. dxc5
{ We want to open the d-file to increase pressure after we castle queenside. }
7... Bxc5 8. Nf3
{ With Qe2 and O-O-O to follow. White enjoys a dream position, because our pieces are very well placed and ready for an attack. }

{ We break some rules by developing a Bishop before Knights, but we've never cared about any rules. Of course we care, I just want it to sound rebellious ! 3. Bd3 doesn't promise White an easy advantage, but it leads to sharp positions which are untypical for the French Defence. }
3... dxe4
{ The most popular move that gives up the centre and speeds up Black's development with ...Nf6 coming next. }
4. Bxe4 Nf6 { 4...c5  5.Ne2  Nf6  6.Bf3  Transposes to the 4... Nf6 line. } 5.
Bf3
{ Note that after only 5 moves we have a very original position. There are no other lines in the French Defence where Black takes on e4 and we are able to keep our Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal. This may be slightly unpleasant to some Black players. }
5... c5 { The most popular move. Black has to strike at our centre. } 6. Ne2
{ Of course we want to defend the d4-pawn while developing. } 6... Nc6
{ By far the most popular move. } 7. Be3 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Ne5
{ The only move to fight for equality. } 9. Nc3
{ We want to play Ndb5 or Qe2 followed by O-O-O next. } 9... Bb4
{ This is the most popular move, pinning our Knight. } 10. Nb5
{ This is critical. We defend the c3-Knight simultanously threatening Qxd8. }
10... Nxf3+
{ 10...Qxd1+  wouldn't solve Black's problems due to  11.Bxd1 !  We managed to avoid ...Nxf3+, we threaten Nc7+ and it's not easy for Black to defend. }
11. Qxf3 O-O 12. a3 Bxc3+ 13. Nxc3
{ We would like to castle queenside and if Black plays ...Bd7 or ...Qc7 we will do so. Otherwise O-O or Rd1 should be strongly considered. The whole 3. Bd3 line doesn't guarantee White an opening advantage, but it leads to interesting positions where White will always be the one pressing. If you would like to familiarize youself with more details of this line, then I recommend games of three strong grandmasters: Vladimir Onischuk, Maksim Chigaev and Maxim Vavulin. }

Unfortunately we can't play  2.c4  , because  2...Nf6  leads to the King's Indian Defence.  If you want to be fancy you can try 2.

Nc3 g6
{ In this chapter we take a look at the Pirc Defence. This is the line that is usually used by players who play the King's Indian Defence. Black's setup is perfect for counterattacking strategy, because he gives up the centre and will try to put pressure on it later. }
4. Bg5
{ I would love to say that I like this move, I actually hate it. Why is that ? I've played the Pirc Defence since 2014, but then I suffered two very painful losses in this line and I abandoned 1... d6 completely. My losses didn't happen due to unfamiliarity of opening theory or some bad luck. In fact I was completely outplayed by two lower rated opponents without firing a single shot. So now I am very happy to be on the other side of the board waiting for my opponents to return 'my' points. I think that this may happen, because 4. Bg5 scores heavily over 60%. Also someone once told me that I try to put my Bishop on g5 whenever given a chance, so I have to be faithful to my beliefs. }

6. Bc1 e5
{ 6...Bg7  7.h3  Nf6  8.Be3  We've transposed to the 5... Bg7 6. h3 line but with both sides losing two tempos each. }

11... Kh7 12. g4
{ We know what comes next - h2-h4, Be2, g4-g5 and f3-f4 and Black's King will feel the heat. Sometimes h2-h4 followed by Ng1-e2-g3 and a slower attack can be considered. }

I've played the Pirc Defence since 2014, but then I suffered two very painful losses in this line and I abandoned 1... d6 completely. My losses didn't happen due to unfamiliarity of opening theory or some bad luck. In fact I was completely outplayed by two lower rated opponents without firing a single shot. So now I am very happy to be on the other side of the board waiting for my opponents to return 'my' points. I think that this may happen, because 4. Bg5 scores heavily over 60%. Also someone once told me that I try to put my Bishop on g5 whenever given a chance, so I have to be faithful to my beliefs. }

1. d4 Nc6
{ This opening is not very popular. It's mostly used by players who play 1... Nc6 against everything. }
2. d5
{ It's possible to play a different move, but every other option has some disadvantages. For example 2. e4 transposes to the 1. e4 world, while 2. c4 allows 2... e5 and 2... Nf3 allows 2... d6. I don't say that White can't fight for an opening advantage in these lines, but I think that 2. d5 is the strongest move for White. We will win several tempos on Black's Knight, which resembles the Alekhine Defence, but mirrored. }
2... Ne5 3. f4

{ A few weeks ago when I finished my work I decided to play some games on chess. com. I never do that but this day something told me to see if there are any top players online. When I was checking the list a pop-up with ' GM Hikaru is online' appeared. I decided that I will try to challenge the super-GM without any hopes for him to accept. I even forgot about it but after 2 minutes or so I heard a characteristic 'click' and my game against Hikaru Nakamura started ! In online chess, there is something called 'adoption'. If you win 10 in a row against someone - you adopt him, if you lose, you are the one that is adopted. I've never been adopted before but I thought that this is a perfect occasion ! Of course, I didn't give up and fought as hard as I could but he was superior in the first three games. This was the 4th one. }
1. d4
{ In game number 2 I got a good position in the 3... b5 line of the Queen's Gambit Accepted but I messed up in the middlegame. Hikaru decided to change openings. }
1... g6 2. e4 Bg7 3. Nc3 c6 4. Bc4
{ I followed by own recommendations from the Modern Chapter of this repertoire. }
4... b5 { But this was new. I was on my own from here. } 5. Bb3 a5 6. a4
{ It was preferable to keep the head lower and play  6.a3  but I wanted to play more aggressively. }
6... b4 7. Nce2 Ba6 8. Nf3 d5 9. exd5
{ 9.O-O !  dxe4  10.Ng5  attacking both e4 and f7 was stronger. } 9... cxd5 10.
O-O
{ Due to inaccuracies on moves 6 and 9 Black has a comfortable position now. }
10... Nc6
{ I think it was preferable to focus on safeguarding the King as fast as possible. Therefore, 10... Nf6 followed by ...e6 was probably better. }
11. Re1 e6 12. Nf4
{ Objectively this move is not correct but it allowed me to 'Go for The Throat'. }
12... Nge7
{ After 12... Nf6 Black was more than ready to castle short and he would have a superior position due to the activity of his minor pieces and an awkward position of both my light-squared Bishop and the d4-pawn. }
13. Rxe6
{ A shot out of the blue ! White is much better now because Black can't accept the sacrifice. Fortunately for me, my mighty opponent did ! }
13... fxe6
{ Castling was a lesser evil. Now Black goes for a long walk from which he will never be able to return. }
14. Nxe6 Qd7 15. Nxg7+
{ White has a Bishop, two pawns and an ongoing attack for a sacrificed Rook. }
15... Kf7 16. Bh6
{ I used around half a minute to make Ne6 work but finally I went for the only continuation that maintains a decisive advantage. }
16... Rhf8 17. Ng5+ Kg8 18. N7e6
{ The Knight has done its job on g7 so it returns to serve a better purpose. }
18... Rf6 19. Nc5
{ The strongest. White's position is so good that it is possible to just play Qd2 followed by Re1 with Nge4 ideas in the air. }
19... Qd6
{ This ends the game. 19... Qf5 was the best chance although White would be on a verge o victory anyway. }
20. Nge4
{ Now I knew I have it. It was important to choose the g-Knight because now Black doesn't have ... Qf4. Still focused and with my heart pumping, I knew that this is a chance once in a lifetime. }
20... Qd8 21. Nxf6+ Kh8 22. Ne6
{ With Nxd8 or Bg7 to come next Hikaru resigned. A dream came true. The first chance of facing a 2800+ player and a victory. I couldn't yell because it was around 2 AM and I didn't want to wake my fiance. So I did a few fist pumps in the air and clicked rematch. I fought really hard in the 5th game but I was beaten once more only to start the 6th and the last game of the mini-match. You can see it by clicking 'Next Game'. }

1. d4 d5
{ After the loss in the 4th game Hikaru decided to switch back to the Queen's Gambit Accepted. }
2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 b5 4. a4 c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Nc3 a6 7. Nxb5 axb5 8. Rxa8 Bb7 9.
Ra1 e6
{ In the 2nd game we played  9...Bxe4 ?!  10.f3  Bd5  11.b3 !  which was analysed in line #219 with a big advantage for White. }
10. Ne2 Bxe4 11. Nc3 Bc6 12. Be2 Nf6
{ This move isn't covered in my repertoire. I focused on 12... Bxg2 line #222 and 12... b4 line #223 . }
13. Bf3
{ White is hugely on top. Black doesn't have full compensation for a sacrificed Rook and White pieces are active. Also, Black needs to solve problems with the b5-pawn. }
13... Bb4 14. O-O Bxc3 15. bxc3 O-O 16. Bg5
{ A very strong move stopping ...Nd5 ideas. Note that the White dark-squared Bishop is kind of blocked by the c3-d4 pawn chain so it is useful to exchange it for the Black Knight. }
16... h6 17. Bxf6 Qxf6 18. Rb1
{ White is positionally dominating. A funny thing is that all these moves were quite natural for me due to the ideas from the Queen's Gambit Accepted chapter. Black still has problems with the b5-pawn and he can't easily finish his development. }
18... Qg5
{ Defending the b-pawn but allowing White to create another threat with a tempo. }
19. Re1 { Threatening Re5. } 19... Qf5 20. Bxc6
{ I rejected  20.Re5  due to  20...Bxf3  and I can't take with the Queen due to the b1-Rook ganging. My reasoning was good but the chosen move 20. Bxc6 lessens the pressure on Black's position. It was much better to play 20. Rb2 stepping away of the b1-h7 diagonal and renewing the Re5 threat. }
20... Nxc6 21. Qf3
{ It loses the whole advantage. The last chance to keep a much better position was  21.d5 !  with the point that  21...exd5  allows  22.Rxb5  due to a broken communication via the 5th rank. }
21... Qxf3 22. gxf3 Rb8
{ Black has good compensation now. If Hikaru managed to plant the Knight on d5 White can even be in trouble, at least from a practical point of view. }
23. f4 Ne7 24. f5
{ This was the idea of f4. White discourages ...Nd5 due to the e6-pawn hanging. }
24... Nd5
{ If  24...Nxf5  then  25.d5  exd5  26.Re5  with a dynamic equality. } 25. fxe6
Nxc3 { 25...fxe6  was the best move. Now Black is in trouble. } 26. e7 Re8
{ 26...Nxb1  27.d5 !!  with the idea d5-d6-d7 would be over. } 27. d5
{ Returning the favour.  27.Rbd1 !!  was an excellent resource but impossible to find in a 3 minute game for a poor FIDE Master. The point is that after  27...Nxd1   27...Nd5  doesn't help either after  28.Re5  Nxe7  29.Rde1  Kf8  30.d5  and the d-pawn will decide the game  28.d5  f6  29.d6  Kf7  30.d7  Rxe7  31.Rxd1 ! }
27... Nxd5 28. Rxb5 Rxe7 29. Rxe7 Nxe7 30. Rc5
{ 30.Rb8+  Kh7  31.Rb7  followed by Rxf7 would be more accurate. } 30... g5 31.
Rxc4 Ng6 32. Rc6
{ I knew that Hikaru will play this for a win because he has a Knight and almost 0 losing chances. Almost ! }
32... Kg7 33. Ra6 Ne5 34. Ra5 Nd3 35. Ra8 Nf4 36. Kf1 Kg6 37. Ra6+ f6 38. Ra5

Kg5 52. Rg8+ Kh4
{ This is the situation I wanted to provoke. Black is still fine but some unpleasant things will start to happen. }
53. fxg4 Nxg4+ { 53...Nf3 !!  54.Kxf3  stalemate  ! was the only chance. } 54.
Kf3 Nf6 55. Rh8+
{ A first step in the wrong direction.  55.Rg1  keeping the Black King shut was an easy way to win the game. But when you play against such a monster as Nakamura there are no easy ways. There are strange thoughts in your head and some moves that I would do routinely , here , they just don't show up in my mind. }
55... Kg5 56. Rxh3 Nd7 57. Rh8 Ne5+ 58. Ke4 Ng6 59. Ra8 Nh4 60. Rg8+ Ng6 61.
Ra8 Kg4 62. Ra1 Kh3 63. Kf5 Ne7+
{ 63...Kxh2  64.Kxg6  g4  and White can't stop the g-pawn with a draw   but there is  63...Kxh2  64.Kg4 !!  winning. Black can't save his Knight which is stuck behind enemy lines.  64...Kg2  65.Ra2+ !  Kf1  66.Ra6 !  Ne5+  67.Kxf4  Nd3+  68.Ke3  winning. }
64. Kxf4 Kxh2 65. Ra6
{ The Black Knight can't go back home. We both had like 30 seconds here so it will be a show of mutual mistakes. }
65... Nd5+ 66. Ke4 Nc3+ 67. Kf3 Kg1 68. Rc6 Nd5 69. Rd6 Ne7 70. Kf4 Kf2 71. Kg5

Kf3 72. Kf6 Nc8 73. Re6 Kf4 74. Kf7 Na7 75. Rb6 Ke4 76. Ke8 Nc8
{ Once again returning the favour. } 77. Ra6 Kd5 78. Kd7
{ Finally, the Knight is trapped. } 78... Nb6+ 79. Rxb6
{ Please, forgive me my technique here. We were around 10 seconds both so I just wanted to score a win. }

{ After this game Hikaru rejected my rematch. After the mini-match, I subscribed his Twitch channel to see the video from these games. I will keep it as a souvenir ! }
