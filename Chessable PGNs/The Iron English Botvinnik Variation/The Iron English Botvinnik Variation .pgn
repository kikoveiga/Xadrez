1. c4 {Welcome to the world of the English Opening! It's an opening which can
be traced right back to that great English player of the Victorian era, Howard
Staunton. Wherever possible we'll also be looking to put to good use a set-up
within the English favoured by the legendary fifth world champion, 'the
Patriarch', Mikhail Botvinnik. The world hasn't been an amazing place of late,
but lockdown allowed time for plenty of filming, streaming... and internet
blitz! Simon even did a spot of a chess work for himself, realising that while
some of his old favourites were in need of an overhaul, they were very much
still as dangerous as back when he first started playing them many years ago.
In recent years Simon has played a lot of 1. d4, but he shall certainly be
once again employing his old love, the English, a fair bit more from now on.
Let's see why!} e5 {Black's main move. Play transposes after 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 if
Black now pushes his e-pawn two squares, but a very popular alternative is 2...
g6 going for a King's Indian-style set-up. We too have our own favourite
set-up and the Botvinnik is very handy for countering the King's Indian, which
remains an extremely popular choice at club level: 3.g3 Bg7 3...d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5
would be Grünfeldy, but 5.Bg2 is quite dangerous - White can even deploy one
of our favourite early advances, pushing Harry! This is covered in Theory 3A.
4.Bg2 O-O 5.e4 d6 6.Nge2 e5 7.d3 This is the Botvinnik set-up, giving White a
firm central grip and control over d5. White will castle next and may then aim
to cramp Black with a quick f4-f5. These type of positions are covered
inTheory 1A andTheory 1B. An important and super-solid alternative for Black
is 1...c5 the Symmetrical English. Here too we can aim for our favourite
set-up: 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.e4 Nf6 6.Nge2 O-O 7.O-O d6 8.d3 This
position can come about via a great many move orders, including a King's
Indian one, but once again White's central grip is obvious to the eye. Key
pawn levers to bear in mind are: f4-f5, b4 and d4. This is all covered
inTheory 1C. Other 1... c5 lines for Black are covered inTheory 5AandTheory 5B.
After 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 Black can be a little annoying with 2...c5 2...e6 is
another important line, beloved by Nimzo-Indian players, but we don't have to
allow their fun and can go 3.e4 the dangerous Mikenas Attack. This is covered
inTheory 6AandTheory 6B. 3.g3 d5 which denies us a Botvinnik set-up, but after
4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 it's hard to complain about White's harmonious Bishop. Just
look at that bishop on g2 swooping down the long light-squared diagonal!
SeeTheory 5B. We'll also look at a few tricky initial moves, including Simon's
old favourite, 1...f5 which is covered inTheory 3B andTheory 3C. Other moves
that are covered are 1...b6 inTheory 3D, 1...c6 inTheory 7A and especially 1...
e6 inTheory 7B, all of which aim to deny us our Botvinnik formation, but do
little to prevent a quick e4 from White.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 {2...Bb4 is a creative
line and can lead to some very fun positions after 3.Nd5, but we can just go 3.
g3 Bxc3 4.bxc3 d6 5.Bg2 and, yes, you guessed it - a Botvinnik formation is
still on the cards. SeeTheory 4F. Instead, 2...Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.e4 sees
our ideal set-up once again in action. Black doesn't have to go King's Indian
style with 5...d6 6.Nge2 Nf6 here, but in any case White has his central grip
and may break with f4. This is a transposition toTheory 1A.} 3. g3 Bb4 {
A big alternative is 3...d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Nb6 when we're suggesting that
White avoids the main lines of the reversed Dragon with 6.e3 again bringing
the king's knight to its favourite English square, e2. The resulting positions
are relatively unexplored but certainly dynamic - and fun! Not only may White
break with d4, but also f4. SeeTheory 4C and Theory 4D.} 4. e4 {This idea
championed by the champ himself, Magnus Carlsen, is likely to surprise your
opponent and is actually a pretty decent choice. Once again, a Botvinnik
set-up is White's plan and} Bxc3 5. dxc3 Nxe4 {doesn't win a pawn due to} 6.
Qg4 {hitting the knight and g7. Before we get to tackle this line and all
Black's possibilities in detail, it's time to learn some of White's key ideas.}

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d6 3. g3 g6 {Black decides to go for a King's Indian set-up
after all. 3...e5 4.Bg2 Nbd7 5.d3 Be7 would resemble the Old Indian. After 6.
e4 Black does look a little cramped and our favourite f4 advance might well
occur.} 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. e4 {There are several different ways of handling the
English, but naturally, we advocate setting up that Botvinnik formation!} e5 6.
Nge2 Nc6 7. O-O O-O 8. f4 {8.d3 is our recommended move order, but the young
Simon liked the bold immediate advance of Freddie.} Be6 {Routine development,
just as you might expect at club level. 8...exf4 ! 9.gxf4 Nh5 is somewhat more
challenging. Black prepares to gain space of his own with ... f5 and 10.f5 ?
Qh4 would leave White looking rather overextended.} 9. Nd5 {White should still
go 9.d3 when Black might well elect to prevent f5 with 9...Qd7 Now 10.Nd5
looks sensible, but we also can't resist pointing out that 10.f5 !? gxf5 11.
Bg5 is a very interesting pawn sacrifice. If Black takes on e4, White wins a
piece, so 11...Ne8 seems necessary when 11...h6 ? 12.Bxf6 Bxf6 13.exf5 Bxf5 14.
g4 ! wins a piece - a tactical motif worth remembering 12.exf5 Bxf5 13.Nd5
leaves White with a certain grip and compensation for the pawn; Qd2 will
follow and quite possibly Ne2-c3-e4.} Ne8 {Far too meek. King's Indian players
always want to free their f-pawn to go ...f5, but Black won't be able to
because of our set-up. Much better was 9...Bg4 making good use of Black's grip
on the d4-square, which is the one downside to the Botvinnik formation.} 10. f5
{Put that in your pipe and smoke it!} Bd7 {10...Bxd5 11.cxd5 is almost never a
trade to worry about. After 11...Nd4 or 11...Ne7 12.d3 when 12...c6 is a break
for freedom, but after 13.dxc6 bxc6 14.g4 ! White is much better; Ng3 follows
and Black is in grave danger of being squashed to death on the kingside. 12.
Nxd4 exd4 13.d3 White has a pleasant advantage. Black's pawn on d4 is
something of a dead point, merely blunting his own bishop, in contrast to
which White has control, a space advantage, the two bishops and, yes, g4-g5
may follow.} 11. d3 {Having made such a gain of space, it's high time to
develop the remaining pieces.} f6 {This is ugly, but so is the best the
engines can suggest, 11...h6 12.Be3 g5 Just look at that bishop on g7! Indeed,
with Black devoid of counterplay and so cramped it might make sense for White
to switch operations and expand on the queenside with 13.b4 Note that while
our Botvinnik set-up does leave the f-pawn free to advance, we are by no means
committed to kingside play, but can also advance on the queenside and
sometimes even in the centre.} 12. Be3 Ne7 13. Nxe7+ {Simon remembers also
being tempted by 13.g4 and 13.d4 !? also looks very nice for White with Qb3
next up.} Qxe7 14. Qd2 g5 {Bla@k wrongly thinks that Bh6 is a threat. That is
often a plan to swap off one of Black's best pieces, but here the entombed
bishop on g7 cannot be seen as one. 14...c6 was a try for some counterplay,
but after 15.g4 Nc7 16.Ng3 White retains control and might even ready Harry,
while 14...c5 15.g4 a6 16.h4 ! b5 17.Ng3 Rb8 18.g5 is a very instructive line.
Naturally Black doesn't want to take on f5 or g5, but he is just in huge
trouble in any case, as shown by 18...Nc7 19.Rf2 Rb7 20.Raf1 The pressure
grows against f6 and 20...Ne8 21.fxg6 ! îîStartBracketîîonly now, with all
White's pieces perfectly alignedîîEndBracketîî 21...hxg6 22.h5 decisively rips
open lines: for example, 22...fxg5 or 22...gxh5 23.g6 followed by Nxh5 or even
Nf5 and Qe2 23.Rxf8+ Bxf8 24.hxg6 Qg7 25.Qf2 Be7 26.Nf5 Bxf5 27.Qxf5 and Black
collapses on the light squares.} 15. g4 {Preventing any notion of ...h5 while
freeing g3 for the knight.} Rf7 16. h4 {It was again possible to switch focus
with 16.b4 but with Black so tied up, Simon couldn't resist involving Harry.}
h6 {16...gxh4 ? 17.Rf3 will regain the pawn with a mighty attack after Rh3.}
17. hxg5 hxg5 {17...fxg5 might have been more obstinate but still looks great
for White after 18.Bf3 Nf6 19.Ng3 The bolder ones amongst you will no doubt be
looking at ideas of Kg2, Rh1, and sacrifice on g5 here; the calmer ones will
notice how tied up Black is, so why not open a second front on the queenside
as White?} 18. Kf2 {Centralising the king, not for the endgame, but to allow
the rooks access to the open h-file.} c6 19. Rh1 Nc7 20. Rh3 Rff8 21. Rah1 Kf7
22. Ng3 {This is a dream Botvinnik position. White has a handy space advantage
and just look at Black's lack of coordination and counterplay. Simon recalls
he was very happy here, and no wonder! Williams-Locatelli, Cappelle-la-Grande

Once again we see Simon's old favourite, but you should really prefer 8.d3} Nd4
{This leap is a fairly common reaction from Black in this structure, but White
should rarely mind it as Black will likely be hampered by his resulting dead
point on d4. Once again, Black should prefer 8...exf4 ! and if 9.gxf4 Nh5 to
free his position.} 9. d3 c6 10. Nxd4 {Creating the aforementioned dead point.
10.h3 is also reasonable enough, but after 10...Nxe2+ 11.Nxe2 exf4 12.Nxf4 12.
Bxf4 Nh5 is a bit annoying, Re8 Black may be OK.} exd4 11. Ne2 Nd7 {The wrong
way. Black needed to exploit the absence of one our favourite moves, h3, with
the brave 11...Ng4 ! and after 12.h3 Ne3 13.Bxe3 dxe3 14.d4 if 14.Qc1 Qb6 14...
c5 matters would have been extremely murky.} 12. f5 {Giving up control of e5
should never be done lightly, but here White is well placed to expand on the
kingside before Black can organise any real counterplay.} g5 {A bold but by no
means bad reaction. Black wants to keep lines closed and be able to exploit
his control of e5. The downside is that he's created a hook on g5 for White's
attack. Instead, 12...Ne5 13.h3 looks quite pleasant for White, and it's also
possible to be bold and grab: 13.Nxd4 !? Qb6 14.Be3 Qxb2 or 14...Ng4 ?! 15.
Qxg4 Bxd4 16.Bxd4 Qxd4+ 17.Kh1 Qxb2 18.Qh4 when Black's dark squares are
creaking badly. 15.Rb1 Qxa2 16.f6 Bh8 17.h3 and that's one unhappy bishop on
h8. The knight might also come out via 12...Nc5 but then White might simply
sound the charge: 13.h4 ! when 13...a5 13...d5 !? would classically counter
the flank attack in the centre; it is an improvement, although White is still
slightly for choice after 14.cxd5 cxd5 15.Bg5 14.Bg5 f6 14...Bf6 15.Qd2 looks
like a nice attacking set-up. 15.Bc1 ! leaves Black with not just one, but two
rather restricted bishops.} 13. b3 {Simon decides to remind Black that d4 can
become weak. 13.Kh1 !? is another very interesting idea, preparing to regroup
the Knight with Ng1-f3.} c5 14. g4 {Here we go...} h6 15. Ng3 Rb8 {A little
slow perhaps. Black should have preferred 15...Be5 !? or 15...Ne5 and if 16.h4
b5 ! 17.cxb5 a6 with Benko Gambit-like counterplay.} 16. h4 gxh4 {Far too
greedy. 16...b5 was still indicated when we slightly prefer White after 17.
hxg5 hxg5 18.cxb5 Rxb5 19.Nh5 but it is, of course, very much a case of game

f6 ! based on the point 18...Bxg4 19.Qd2 ! Bxh5 ? 20.fxg7 Kxg7 21.Qxh6+ and
wins. while after 17...b5 Simon was ready with 18.cxb5 Rxb5 19.g5 ! crashing
through in view of 19...hxg5 20.Nxg7 Kxg7 ? 21.f6+ Kg6 22.Qg4 with a winning

fatal pin. and 18...Nxh5 19.Qxh5 hxg5 20.Bxg5 is already all over in view of

The 2020 version of the Ginger GM would surely have spotted 21.Bxg5 ! , having

Bg5 would reveal White's main idea. Yes, Black can unpin easily enough, but
after 10...Qd7 11.Qd2 White has a fairly harmonious set-up and may play to
open the bishop on g2: for example, 11...Rae8 12.exf5 !? gxf5 ? 12...Bxf5 is

the white bishop is clearly superior to the knight. White might follow up with
Rac1 and b4 or look to double on the e-file. Before we return to the main game,
do note too that White should rarely worry about an exchange on d5 in such

all the pieces. Here Black isn't, of course, about to get rolled over by f4-f5,
but his position is still the harder one to handle. He can't easily break out
and free his pieces, and all the while must watch out for White making a
timely exf5 exchange.} Bxd5 {A big decision. You can't blame Black for wanting
to avoid 18...Nf6 ? 19.e5 ! dxe5 20.Nxf6 Rxf6 21.Rxe5 when White controls the
e-file and has much the more active Bishop, but a more dynamic response would
have been 18...fxe4 !? 19.dxe4 b5 , leaving the Knight on g8 and developing
counterplay.} 19. cxd5 Qc7 {A strange decision. Black needed to activate his
Knight with 19...Nf6 when spreading the play with 20.b4 !? was Simon's idea,

might have wondered about the Bishop on g2, but it is actually extremely well
placed here and more powerful than Black's Knight. Note how the Bishop defends
e4 and also indirectly d5, thereby supporting White's central play, as well as
that White now has the definite positional threat of bxc5 dxc5; e5 when his
pawns make for a very strong sight.} b6 {20...cxb4 ? 21.Qxd4+ would, of course,
not be wise, and 20...Nf6 ? 21.bxc5 dxc5 22.e5 would just allow White his
dream scenario.} 21. Re2 {A little routine. 21.exf5 ! gxf5 22.Re6 would have
been much more dynamic and again made use of the long-range support offered by
White's Bishop.} Rf7 22. Rfe1 Rfe7 {Now@it's Black's turn to be too routine,

with it due to his current lack of pawn breaks. Magnus now continued in

after 11...Nd7 ! 12.Bg2 f5 13.exf5 Bxf5 14.O-O the chances are about level in
a very rich and unbalanced position, where White should be looking to break
with f4 Bd7 11.Be3 Nc5 12.Ra2 !? and now 12...Qc8 13.Rd2 h6 14.h4 ! would have

main feature of the position. Now 8...d6 9.a3 Bxc3 10.Nxc3 bxc4 ?! 11.dxe5
dxe5 did leave Black a pawn ahead, but with a Queenside riddled with holes.
Here one simple and good route to a very pleasant advantage is 12.Qe2 !?
Magnus preferred 12.Na4 Be6 13.Qxd8 Rxd8 14.Be3 Nbd7 15.f3 and went on to
secure a very important victory a5 12...Qd3 13.Qxd3 cxd3 14.Rd1 Rd8 15.Na4 !

Black has managed to cling on to his extra c-pawn, but f5 is a large threat
and one not so easy to meet. Indeed, even 16...exf4 or 16...g6 17.f5 !? gxf5
18.exf5 Bxf5 19.Qxc4 when Black has weaknesses right across the board 17.gxf4
Rfe8 18.Qf2 ! is quite awkward for him, and if 18...Bf5 19.e5 It's rare that
White gets to take over the centre so, but our favourite e4 and f4 Botvinnik
pawns really can pack a powerful punch at many times, and here do also enjoy
the sight of two such powerful Bishops on e3 and g2!} 6. h3 {Prophylaxis
against ...Bg4. White simply wants to get his King to safety on the Kingside
and then expand with our f4 break.} Nc6 7. Bg2 a6 {One point of White's move
order is that he can, of course, recapture after 7...Bxc3 with the Knight, but
8.bxc3 !? is also quite tempting, especially if it leads to 8...Be6 8...a6 !?

d3 Qd7 ? 10.f4 ! Once again we see Black with a lead in development, but also
under heavy pressure already, with his Bishop proving something of a target on
e6. Now 10...Qe7 11.f5 Bd7 12.g4 ! would just be a dream and free attack for
White.} 8. O-O b5 9. d3 {Keeping control rather than allow Black far too much
activity for a pawn with 9.cxb5 axb5 10.Nxb5 ? Ba6 11.Nbc3 Bd3} bxc4 10. dxc4
Bc5 {Black reroutes his Bishop to a more active diagonal, but he won't be able
to tactically prevent f4 for ever.} 11. Kh2 {Freeing the f-pawn for action,
but it's important not to rush with f4 here.} Rb8 12. b3 {Magnus wants to
retain control of the position, not rush into 12.f4 exf4 13.gxf4 , which just
feels very unclear. He may also have been concerned about the possibility of
13...Ng4+ ? , which is a tactical motif we advise you to file away and never
allow - in a strong guise! Here White can, though, defend with 14.hxg4 Qh4+ 15.
Bh3 Bxg4 16.Qd3 ! when Black shouldn't have enough for his piece with Qg3 next
up.} a5 13. Nd5 {It's time to apply a spot of pressure and central play is, of

Na4 !? was also possible, though, and if 14...Ba7 15.f4 This position isn't so
easy to assess, but we must admit that we quite like White. After f5 followed
by g4 Black may simply find himself in huge danger on the Kingside before he's
obtained too much on the Queenside.} a4 14. Be3 {Naturally Magnus doesn't fall
for 14.Bg5 ?? Ng4+ 15.hxg4 Qxg5 when 16.f3 h5 ! would be horrific for White,
but as well as the creative text, 14.Bb2 was very much an option, getting
ready to go f4, which will place e5 and f6 under some pressure.} axb3 15. axb3
Bxe3 {It was also possible to retain the tension, but Aronian presumably
didn't fear any half-open f-file.} 16. fxe3 {A dynamic and important recapture,
in contrast to 16.Nxe3 Nd7 17.f4 Nc5 when Black certainly obtains some
counterplay.} Nd7 {Avoiding any structure-shattering exchange on f6 , but 16...
Nxd5 !? 17.exd5 Ne7 was also possible and would have been pretty unclear.
White might now go 18.Qd3 , intending Qc3, b4 and c5, aiming to make use of
his Queenside majority.} 17. Nec3 {Magnus must have been fairly happy at this
point. His clever recapture has bought White control of d4 and while Black may
not be worse, his position is the harder to play due to his ongoing slight
crampedness.} Nc5 {Even here Black probably should have tried 17...Nb6 18.Nb5
Nxd5 19.exd5 Ne7} 18. Nb5 {Seizing the initiative.} Ne6 19. h4 {Carlsen's play
in this game reminds us of Tigran Petrosian. Not only does White prepare to
activate his Bishop on h3, but he also gains space, all the while as he
continues to restrict Black in true Petrosianic boa constrictor style.} Bd7 20.
Bh3 Rb7 {20...Nc5 ! really needed to be tried, giving up c7, but
counterattacking against e4.} 21. b4 {This would have been strong too on the
previous move. Now there is no ...Nc5 and Black is fast becoming very passive.}
Ne7 22. Ra2 {White hints at switching the Rook to the Kingside and under some
pressure, Aronian now cracks.} Nc8 {Did you spot why the b-pawn wasn't
hanging? 22...Bxb5 23.cxb5 Rxb5 certainly feels rather risky for Black and it
actually loses: 24.Bxe6 ! fxe6 25.Rxf8+ Qxf8 or 25...Kxf8 26.Qf1+ Kg8 27.Nxe7+
Qxe7 28.Qxb5 26.Nxe7+ Qxe7 27.Ra8+ Kf7 28.Qh5+ Kf6 29.g4 ! and White's attack
is very much a mating one.} 23. Ra8 {A powerful pin and one which makes Black
even more tied down than he already was.} Kh8 {As good a try as anything. This
time 23...Bxb5 ? 24.cxb5 Rxb5 ? would have failed to 25.Bxe6 fxe6 26.Rxf8+
followed by Qf1+ or 26...Qxf8 27.Rxc8 ! Qxc8 28.Ne7+ and goodnight, Vienna!}
24. Qh5 {With total control over the position, Magnus goes for the throat. 24.
Qa1 was also extremely strong, intending to invade with Qa6.} Qe8 25. Bf5 {
Winning, as would have been 25.Nf6 ! gxf6 26.Bf5 . Black can cling on for now
with 26...Ng5 , but after 27.hxg5 Bxf5 28.exf5 Rg8 29.gxf6 his Kingside would
not have remained intact for long.} h6 26. Bh3 {Highly aesthetic play as the
Bishop returns, thereby clearing the f-file.} c6 {26...Bxb5 27.Rf6 ! reveals
White's deadly threat: 27...Kh7 if 27...gxf6 ? 28.Qxh6+ Kg8 29.Nxf6 28.Rxc8 !

Nxd6 28. Rxe8 Rxe8 29. Nf6 {Carlsen is merciless.} Re7 {29...gxf6 30.Rxf6

A very enjoyable move to play. Simon can still remember the excitement he felt
when first shown the idea by his dad, Doug. Even in the pre-engine era it
wasn't too hard to appreciate the strength of this blow, which overturned
theory's then assessment of 'playable for Black'. Amazingly only in 2004 did
the idea make it into Chess Informant and in Informant 91, Shariyazdanov won
an award for the novelty...even though it had been first played by Simon some
9 years earlier! We'll now follow that game, Williams-J.Howell, British
Championship, Swansea 1995:} g6 {GM James Howell (not to be confused by
leading current English GM David Howell) was unlikely to fall for 12...Nd7 ?
13.Bxg7 ! Qxg7 13...Bxg7 14.Bh5 pins and wins 14.Bh5+ when Black loses his
Queen to a fork wherever he moves his King. It's by no means impossible,
though, that Black would allow such a blow at club level, although there he
would surely spot 12...gxh6 ?? 13.Bh5 . The text move isn't forced, but 12...
Be7 13.Bh5 g6 14.Be2 is also unpleasant for Black, who is unable to castle and
behind in development.} 13. Bxf8 {Simple and strong, although so to be fair is
Shariyazdanov's 13.Qd2 Bxh6 14.Qxh6 Na6 15.O-O} Kxf8 {13...Qxf8 would preserve
castling rights, but after 14.O-O Qc5 15.Re1 O-O 16.Bf3 !? White has a dream
position: holes, especially on e6, to aim at and the possibility of swinging
the Queen into an attack via d2 and h6, not least in the event of the greedy
16...Qxc4 17.Re7 .} 14. h4 {Even in 1995 Simon very much understand the
importance of Harry!} h5 {Prudently blocking, albeit at the cost of further
weaknesses, rather than fall victim to a deadly attack with 14...Kg7 ? 15.h5

actually couldn't help himself here and 16.f4 ?! Nc6 16...c5 !? 17.Nb5 Nc6
also restricts White to an edge 17.Nxc6 bxc6 18.Qa4 was only a little better
for him. That said, impressively Simon ground out the win, and against the
author of the excellent 'Essential Chess Endings', to help him obtain his
first IM norm: 18...Qe7 ?! 19.Bf3 ?! White can get away with 19.Qxc6 ! , as if

{Our Botvinnik set-up is generally a sturdy one, but as we have seen, there
are a few common tactical motifs White should be aware of:} 1. c4 e5 {1..@Nf6
2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 d6 4.Bg2 c5 is a slightly sneaky move order from Black. Often
play will just transpose to a main line after 5.e4 Nc6 6.Nge2 Bg7 , but here
is a good time to remind you that accidents can occur on the light squares -
if White is careless: 6...h5 !? is direct and should not be met by 7.h4 White
should prefer 7. h3 - see the next line Ne5 8.d3 ?! White has to try 8.d4 cxd4
9.Nxd4 , but this is not very Botvinnik-like 8...Bg4 when the weakness of the
f3-square is a major problem for White and 9.O-O Nf3+ 10.Kh1 Nd7 ! leaves
Black in control of the position, not to mention looking to attack us. As such,
we recommended meeting 6...h5 !? with 7.h3 . We will even allow Black to
prevent us from castling with 7...Bd7 8.d3 !? 8.O-O Qc8 9.Kh2 is possible, if
you prefer, as 9...h4 10.g4 Bxg4 !? 11.hxg4 Nxg4+ 12.Kh1 doesn't seem to give
Black quite enough for a piece 8...Qc8 , as 9.Be3 should give White an edge:
for example, 9...Bg7 10.Qd2 O-O 11.f4 . White is now ready to sacrifice a pawn
to open attacking lines with f4-f5 and may well castle Queenside. The position
looks like an improved version of a Closed Sicilian îîStartBracketîîthe
stability added by having a pawn on c4!îîEndBracketîî, and one where we'd be
very happy to try the white position... Before moving on, we should note that
another extremely rare idea is 6...Nd4 !? , which also looks to strike on the
light squares. Black can do just that after 7.d3 Bg4 8.h3 ! , but 8...Bf3 8...
Nf3+ ? 9.Kf1 Bh5 10.g4 ! Nxg4 11.Bxf3 wins a piece 9.O-O Bg7 10.Bxf3 Nxf3+ 11.
Kg2 Nd4 12.Be3 leaves White slightly for choice; Qd2 will likely follow. We'd
again be looking to expand with f4, but in such a structure White can also
play for b2-b4. However, while on the subject of what to avoid, do note the
line 12...Nd7 13.a3 O-O 14.b4 ? 14.Rb1 ! Nxe2 15.Nxe2 Bxa1 16.Qxa1 when White
loses the exchange for insufficient compensation. Always watch out for tactics
down the long diagonal - both the h1-a8 one for us and the a1-h8 one for Black!
} 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. e4 {These moves should all be common place
by now and soon you'll be used to the following fairly common sequence:} d6 6.
Nge2 f5 7. d3 Nf6 8. O-O O-O {Don't forget about the f4-square in this and all
lines where Black has a pawn on f5. Indeed,} 9. h3 {thematic, but there's a
good reason why we advocate 9.Nd5} f4 10. gxf4 Nh5 {is just quite a strong
version of the typical pawn sacrifice for Black, largely due to that slow and
weakening h3 move. Richard was once able to catch Simon out with this line,
although after} 11. f5 {Playing to close the position. 11.fxe5 ? dxe5 12.Nd5
might even be met by 12...Qh4 , and if 13.Kh2 ? Nd4 - and ouch! Black
threatens to invade on f3 and 14.Nxd4 exd4 15.f4 fails to simply 15...c6 16.
Nb4 Nxf4 with too strong an attack on the dark squares.} gxf5 {11...Qh4 !? was
also very tempting} 12. exf5 Qh4 13. Ng3 {he failed to find} Rxf5 {13...Nf4 ?
14.Qg4 Qxg4 15.hxg4 Nxd3 16.Nd5 left the boot very much on the other foot and
Black soon gave up in Williams-Palliser, 4NCL 2002} 14. Nxf5 Bxf5 15. Kh2 Nd4 {
with an extremely strong attack for Black. The move h3 is often an integral
part of White's set-up, usefully taking control of the g4-square and so
preventing Be3 being met by ...Ng4, for instance, but do beware playing h3 too
early when Black has gone for an early ...f5.} *

home îîStartBracketîîf4 is on its way!îîEndBracketîî, and plenty of your

îîStartBracketîîi.e. below 2000 levelîîEndBracketîî, simply continuing to
develop. He has though tried a great many moves, as we have just examined.} 9.
Nd5 {A change of approach, but a move we like after ...Be6. Now that White no
longer needs to worry about ...Nxd5, he decides it's time to put Black under a
bit of pressure. White's most popular move has been 9.h3 , which is absolutely
fine too unsurprisingly, and, as we saw in the introductory games, 9.f4 Qd7 10.

10...Nh5 !? may again be a better square for the knight, as in Talla-Rasik,
Ostrava 2005, where 11.Qd2 f5 12.exf5 Bxf5 12...gxf5 ?! 13.f4 ! creates the
typical tension - and pressure; Black's knight isn't so happy on h5 here, but
13...Nf6 ?! 14.Nxf6+ Bxf6 15.Bxf6 Rxf6 16.b4 ! would only speed up the process
by which White obtains a strong initiative. 13.Rae1 Rae8 14.b4 a change of
approach, making good use of our English bishop, and as 14.f4 ? h6 15.Bh4 exf4
! is a little awkward, since White is going to have to recapture with the
g-pawn. 14...Nd8 15.Be3 before ...Ne6 attacks the bishop, and White can afford
the time to manoeuvre since Black isn't threatening too much; not though here
15.Bh6 ? on account of 15...Bxh6 16.Qxh6 Bxd3 15...c6 16.Ndc3 a6 17.a4 saw
White launching an attack on the queenside, while also enjoying decent central
control.} 11. Qd2 f6 12. Be3 {An unexpected choice perhaps, but White wants to
keep Black cramped so avoids an exchange with 12.Bh6} Nd8 {This is a fairly
common regrouping in this structure, but looks a little convoluted here.} 13.
f4 c6 {Black will pay for not reacting in approved fashion to f4.} 14. f5 gxf5
15. exf5 Bf7 16. Ndc3 Nc7 {16...d5 ? 17.cxd5 cxd5 would now even cost Black
material after 18.Bc5} 17. Rad1 d5 18. d4 {Naturally White ensures it is he,
and not Black, who will play the d4 advance.} e4 19. g4 dxc4 20. Nxe4 Bd5 21.

beat him to it and break first: 17.d4 ! exd4 17...Rad8 18.Rfe1 merely ramps up

suddenly become quite sharp, but it's important not to panic in such
situations, not least when you're material up in the capturing sequence.
Rather than capture on g2 and allow the draw, White can throw his own spanner
in the works with 22.f5 ! and after 22...Rxf5 22...Qxf5 23.Qh6 ! is a second
very handy resource; it's not only Black who can attack, and after 23...Rf7 24.

Paraguayan Grandmaster wastes no time going for our favourite set-up.} Nc6 7.
O-O e5 8. d3 Nh5 {Once again we see a strong black player and noted
theoretician, the Swedish GM Emanuel Berg, quickly freeing his f-pawn for duty
and the standard King's Indian counterplay.} 9. Be3 f5 10. exf5 {Refusing to
allow Black to boss the Kingside.} Bxf5 {By now we very much hope that it's
become second nature to meet 10...gxf5 with 11.f4 .} 11. d4 Qd7 {After 11...
exd4 12.Nxd4 the English Bishop on g2 really comes into its own and something
like 12...Nxd4 13.Bxd4 c6 14.Bxg7 Nxg7 and not 14...Kxg7 ? 15.g4 ! 15.Qd2
would leave White in control and the weakness of d6 the main feature of the
position.} 12. d5 {Not closing lines to engage in a typical King's Indian race
between Queenside and Kingside ambitions, but to retain control and a very
pleasant edge.} Ne7 13. f3 {Another useful move. Richard remembers once being
surprised to reach this position twice in a simul, but he certainly wasn't
going to complain when one of the opponents now failed to clock White's threat:
g4.} Bh3 14. Bxh3 {White has no fear of the black Queen on h3, and rightly so.}
Qxh3 15. Ne4 {This move is why White holds a pleasant advantage. Do observe
that despite his two pieces on the h-file, Black isn't actually threatening
anything and his Bishop on g7 is hardly the pride and joy of the King's Indian
player.} Qd7 {A prudent retreat. 15...Nf5 ? hurls another piece into the fray,
but after 16.Bd2 White has g3 securely protected. Not only is g4 a threat, but
Nf2, so Black has to go backwards: 16...Ne7 17.g4 ! Nf4 18.Nxf4 exf4 19.Ng5
Qh6 20.Ne6 with a dream outpost for White.} 16. g4 {Again this advance, and
again it's a strong one.} Nf6 17. N2c3 {Maintaining control. 17.Ng5 ? would be
premature and after 17...Bh6 17...b5 !? also exploits White's lack of control
18.Qd2 ? Nxg4 ! 19.fxg4 Qxg4+ 20.Kh1 Qxc4 Black would enjoy promising play for
his piece.} Nxe4 18. Nxe4 h6 {Black tires of having Ng5 issues hanging over
him. He is, though, now even more passive, but 18...c6 !? wouldn't really help
matters, in view of 19.dxc6 Nxc6 20.Qd5+ ! Kh8 21.Rad1 , retaining complete
control ahead of picking off d6.} 19. Qd3 {Not bad, but here and on the next
move we quite like 19.h4 !? . Only then will White go Kg2, Rf2, Qd3 and Raf1,
all the while having prevented ....g5, thereby keeping Black bottled up, and
not fearing 19...h5 20.Rc1 hxg4 21.fxg4 Rxf1+ 22.Kxf1 Rf8+ 23.Kg2 when White
remains in full control.} Rf7 20. Kg2 {A useful tidying move. Perhaps an
engine could hold tight and defend Black's position, but his cause is
miserable - and without having made an obvious mistake. Just compare the
difference in activity between the two sides' minor pieces!} Raf8 21. Rf2 g5
22. Kg3 {A bold move, but Bachmann is quickly rewarded for his bravery.
Instead, 22.Ng3 Rf6 was Black's idea when he has a pawn for the exchange and
chances to draw after 23.Qe4 Ng6 24.Nf5 Rxf5 ! 25.gxf5 Nh4+ 26.Kh1 Nxf5 .} Ng6
{This needed to be prepared with 22...Qe8 ! when 23.c5 Ng6 24.Raf1 is only
slightly better for White - unless Black rushes with 24...Nf4 ? 25.Bxf4 exf4+
26.Kg2 . Yes, the Bishop on g7 is now playing, but what else is in Black's
position? White will double on the e-file and retain control, with Queenside
pressure and the much safer King.} 23. Nxg5 {The blow his last move teed up.
Berg must have miscalculated something in the upcoming sequence.} e4 24. Qxe4

possibilities like 14.g4 Bd7 15.g5 f6 ! as such, Tony Kosten suggested 11.Na4 ,

is fine for Black, when White would find himself overextended in the event of
12.f4 ? exf4 ! 13.gxf4 Nh5 14.f5 Bd7 Nxd5 12.exd5 Bd7 Black should have
sufficient counterplay.} 11. Ne2 Ne8 12. b4 {A powerful advance, whereas 12.f4

because the Knight isn't so happy on e2 when it can't easily move to f4 or g3.}
cxb4 {This must be critical. Instead, 12...b6 ?! 13.f4 !? would see White
changing tack, as of course, 13...f5 ? 14.exf5 is no longer an option for
Black, so he must allow f4-f5.} 13. a3 {A Benko-like, logical and pretty
powerful follow-up.} bxa3 {13...b5 !? 14.cxb5 Qb6 attempts to disrupt, but

is a pawn down, but clearly d4 is weak and he has a certain initiative, which
16...f5 17.exf5 gxf5 18.Bd5 would but maintain. It's by no means impossible
that Qd2, Kh2 and a well-timed g4 could even follow, or just Qe1-f2.} Nc7 {

to set the board on fire with 14...b5 ! 15.e5 Bd7 ! when 16.Nxd4 16.Bxa8 ?

18.exf5 gxf5 19.Bd5 Kh8 20.Bxe6 Bxe6 21.Bxd4 Qc7 22.Rxa7 , which wins a pawn
for starters.} 17. Nxd4 Nc5 {17...Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bxd4 19.Qxd4 would just leave
White in charge, with far superior central control and pressure against

19.Nxg7 ! 19.Nxf8 Qxa1 20.Raxa1 Bxa1 21.Nxg6 Bf6 isn't so clear, in view of

certainly better than allowing 22.Rxa6 ? Nxf4 23.gxf4 Bxh3 ! , but 22.Nd5 !
would have been stronger, retaining piece to keep Black bottled up. There is
22...b5 , but after 23.e5 ! Black is badly levered open down the long diagonal
as White makes good use of that superb central Knight outpost on d5.} Bxe6 23.

might eventually obtain ideal central control with f4 and e5.} a5 {After 24...

correct response, 4...Be7.} Nf6 {Invariably played. Otherwise, play is likely
to transpose, as with 4...Nc6 5.d3 Nf6 6.e4.} 5. d3 Be7 {Natural development.}
6. e4 {Creating a Botvinnik formation after all. Another decent approach and
one with a fair pedigree is 6.f4 !? followed by 6...-- 7.Nf3.} c6 {Black's
most popular move, closing the long diagonal, but there are important
alternatives such as 6... Nc6 and 6... fxe4.} 7. Nge2 O-O {Logical and Black's
most common move by some margin. After 7...fxe4 8.dxe4 O-O 9.O-O play
transposes to lines previously covered.} 8. O-O Qe8 {Black heads for h5 in
typical Classical Dutch fashion.} 9. exf5 {A small switch of approach as White
reacts in true classical fashion to any upcoming 'attack' by preparing central
play. White has actually tried a few things in this little-explored position,
but once again 9.h3 is a decent move, although after Qh5 you need to know to
go 10.f3 , and if 10...fxe4 11.g4! , since played without support 10.exf5 Bxf5
11.g4 ? fails to 11...Bxg4 ! , and if 12.hxg4 ? Nxg4 13.Re1 Qh2+ 14.Kf1 Rxf2#.}
Bxf5 10. d4 {Clearly the point behind White's previous move.} Nbd7 11. b3 {
Simple development; White's dark-squared bishop will be quite happy on b2 or
a3, and this way c4 is also secure should Black ever drop back with ...Be6 or
go ...Qf7. As we'll now see there's no reason to fear Black's attempts to
attack and you might even view the position as a Classical Dutch, where White
has got in the key e4 break and also has a much more secure kingside without
his knight being on f3.} Qh5 12. f3 {This is why the Knight is much happier on
e2 than f3. There's no pin and White can safely take control of the g4-square.}
Qg6 {Dropping back. Black doesn't have to and after, say, 12...Rae8 White
should just develop with 13. Ba3 or 13.Be3 , eyeing a7 at some point in the
future. Of course, we'd like to go 13.g4 ? but after Nxg4 ! 14.fxg4 Bxg4 Black
has pretty dangerous compensation, largely because the rook on e8 greatly
helps him to pressure e2.} 13. Ba3 Rae8 14. Qd2 {We've followed the game E.
Lie-Rasmussen, Viby 2002, where White could be fairly happy with the outcome
of the opening. He hasn't come under an attack, is well coordinated and ready
to centralise with Rad1 or perhaps even dxe5 Nxe5; Nd4, angling to leave
Black's pieces and light squares looking a little loose.} *

Bg4 an only move; 18...Rad8 ? loses to 19.Rxg7+ ! Kxg7 20.Qxf6+ Kg8 21.Bh6 19.
Ng5+ Kg6 20.Qc3 . The position is extremely unclear, but White is set to go
Qc2+, as well as Be3 and Rd1. It's always important to remember in such
positions that Black has done extremely well to navigate the complications so
far, and even if he did reach this position over the board, he could easily
still quickly lose his way, with such a King position, if also a passed h-pawn.
Instead, 10...Nge7 11.exf5 Nxf5 keeps everything defended, but after 12.d3
White is ready to go Bg5! followed by Qd2, Qb3 or Qa4, while 10...Qf6 prepares
to drop back to f7 in the event of Nd5. Now 11 Qb3 is one tempting approach,
the simple 11.exf5 another, as 11...Bxf5 ?! 12.Qa4 ! is quite awkward for
Black, as we can see from 12...Nge7 or 12...Bd7 13.Nd5 Qd8 14.Be4 Nce7 15.Qb3
with a serious initiative, so 12...Kd7 !? might even be the best try, not that
White can be unhappy after 13.d3 followed by Bg5 or 13...Bxd3 14.c5 ! ,
threatening to swing the Queen over to g4, as well as to crash through in the
event of 14...Bf5 ? 15.cxd6 cxd6 16.Qb5 13.Nd5 , winning material.} 11. d4 {
A visually impressive and powerful advance.} Nge7 {Clearly Black's structure
would be a right mess after 11...exd4 ?! 12.Nd5 Nf6 13.Bxf4 , and even 11...
Nf6 !? 12.dxe5 dxe5 13.Nd5 looks quite pleasant for White, with Qb3 and Bd2-c3
on their way.} 12. Bf3 {Very direct and once again an exchange on e5 followed
by Nd5 was also promising.} Rg8 13. c5 {Really going for the jugular. Even

Allowing Black a chance. 14.Qb3 was the way to maintain White's initiative.}
Bh8 {Allowing White to get back on track. It's often easy to miss short,
stepping moves with the Rook, not least when it involves returning the Rook to
where it's just come from, but after 14...Rh8 ! 15.d5 dxc5 ! 15...Rxh5 16.Nxf4
Rh7 ? 17.Nh5 isn't so good 16.Nxf4 ! exf4 17.dxc6 Qxd1+ 18.Bxd1 Nxc6 Black
would have been holding his own in the complications.} 15. Qb3 {It's again not
so easy to prevent the threat of mate in one. Never underestimate the power of
the light-squared Bishop in the English!} Rxg1+ 16. Nxg1 d5 17. Nge2 {Finally
developing to meet the threat of ...Nxd4. At first sight you might think,
'This is just far too messy!', but look deeper and it should be possible to
understand why Black is in serious trouble: his King is misplaced, he can't
capture on e4 and f4 might easily drop off. The key to such a position as
White is to remain calm and pick your moment to make any exchanges.} exd4 {
Otherwise, 17...Nxd4 ? 18.Nxd4 exd4 19.Ne2 ! still leaves Black rather bottled
up, 17...Be6 fails to break free in view of the simple 18.dxe5 Qd7 19.Nxf4 ,
and 17...Bxh3 18.dxe5 Nxe5 19.Nxf4 is also very good for White. As such, the
silicon monster suggests that 17...a5 !? was Black's best move, but who would
find such a calm advance over the board and, in any case, 18.Nxd5 Be6 19.Bf3
retains a clear advantage for White.} 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Nxf4 {A nice tactic as
Romanov continues to make hay from the potential mate on f7.} Ne5 {
Alternatively, 19...Na5 20.Qxd5 Qxd5 21.exd5 when Black is a pawn down and
still in some trouble on the Kingside.} 20. Nxd5 c6 21. Nf4 Qa5+ {This doesn't
help, but matters were already very tough for Black, of course.} 22. Bd2 Qb5
23. Ng6+ Nxg6 24. Qf3+ {Andreikin may have overlooked this check or just
decided he had nothing better than to hope Romanov might somehow miss it.} Kg8

Bxg6 Be6 26. Qh5 {The attack pretty much plays itself.} Bg7 27. Qh7+ Kf8 28.
Bh6 Qa5+ 29. b4 {Everything continues to come with tempo.} Qc7 {White's King
is safe after 29...Qxb4+ 30.Kf1 Qc4+ 31.Kg1 , whereas its counterpart...
Following 31...Bxh6 32.Qxh6+ Ke7 33.Qxh4+ Kd7 34.Qh7+ Black is going to have
to shed material on his back rank.} 30. Qh8+ Bg8 31. Bh7 Qf7 32. Bxg8 {32.Bxg8

doubling Rooks, or 17...e4 ?! 18.Ne2 and Nf4-e6.} 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. exf5 {

favourable exchanges with Ne3.} 18. h4 {Prodding the slightly vulnerable black
Kingside. Another good possibility was 18.Nb5 , intending to invade down the

are hard to come by for Black, as we can see too from 18...h5 19.Ra1 cxb4 20.

fortress after 31...Rxe7 32.Ra8 Re8 33.Rxb8 Rxb8 34.Qc6 Bf8 35.Kf3 , since
White's King will wander in via the light squares.} 32. Nd5 Bg7 33. Ne7 Qc7 {

Queen and Knight versus Queen and bad Bishop scenario.} Rxa8 {After 35...Qf7

Black's other Dutch possibilities, the attempts to aim for a Classical or
Stonewall set-up after 3...e6 4.Bg2 . 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 can transpose back to
lines we've already looked at or lead to something independent, as we'll see
in Theory 3B. One other fianchetto is the English against the English, i.e. 1..

delay, but can still head for a Botvinnik set-up after 3.e4 , as we'll see in

1. c4 e5 {The reversed Sicilian, a fairly popular choice at all levels,

runs out of theory and sometimes even good plans with it at club level,

that there's no reason to vary from our favourite move order.} Nf6 {Black's
main move. By some margin his second most popular choice is 2...Nc6 when we'll

rare second moves, not least the reversed Grand Prix Attack, 2...f5 . Do note
that transpositions to lines we've already considered abound early in this
chapter: for instance, 2...d6 3.g3 was covered back inTheory 2C, and 2...g6 3.
g3 will take play back into the realm of Chapters One and Two. Finally, 2...

the Keres Variation, as a type of reversed c3 Sicilian when we're proposing 4.

very important approach is 3...Bb4 when we'll return to the champ's favourite
move, 4.e4 !? , in Theory 4F.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 {Once again the English
bishop enjoys a fine diagonal as White immediately puts the question to the

Vladimir Georgiev and Ferenc Berkes, this advance only really became known
when Magnus wheeled it out in the play-off to his nail-biting 2018 world
championship match against Fabi. White again goes for a big clamp on the
d5-square and avoids the older version 4.Bg2 O-O 5.e4 , as here 5...Bxc3 6.
bxc3 c6 7.Ne2 d5! has long been known to be quite comfortable for Black,
although if you were looking for a second string to your white bow, you could
do worse than look into 7.Nf3!? here.} Bxc3 {Black's most popular choice in
the relatively limited practice thus far, insisting on doubled pawns for White.

has also experimented with 5.bxc3 O-O 6.f3!? , thereby avoiding the 6. Bg2 c6
line.} d6 {Black's main choice. Of course, Black might also go 5...O-O when 6.
f3!? d6 7.Nh3 transposes to our main line.} 6. f3 {The champ's preference.
Rather than placing his bishop on g2, White wants to put it on d3 and also has
ideas of Nh3-f2, which maintains decent central control and might be followed
by a kingside pawn storm.} O-O {Very natural.} 7. Nh3 {Once again, we see this
unusual, but decent development of the knight and, lest it helps, ...f6 and ...
Nh6-f7 is by no means unknown in the Bxc6 dxc6 lines of the Rossolimo Sicilian.

return, or possibly worried by a timely Bg5.} 8. Nf2 Nbd7 9. Be3 Qe7 10. g4 {

sacrifice. 5...Nb4 ?! 6.d3 is clearly nothing to fear. And after 5...Be7 6.

into d3 and we now reach a little explored position where White will obtain
easy development as Black regains his pawn.} Be7 {Black's most common choice

try than the attempt to equalise with 10...Nbxd5 11.Nxd5 Nxd5 12.Nf4 as we've
just analysed in the previous lines.} 11. Nf4 {Keeping everything under

preferred to exchange knights in K. Petrosian-Nikonova, Uljanovsk 2010, but
the text move would have put the two bishops to good use. White is ready to go
Re1 and/or Qb3.} Nxc3 15. bxc3 Re8 16. Re1 Qxd3 17. Qxd3 Bxd3 18. Bxb7 Rad8 19.

Mikenas. White aggressively conquers space in the centre and threatens e5.} Bb4
{The@move Black would play had we gone 3 d4, but it's simply not good here.
Alternatively: The complex, but fun old main line is 3...c5 4.e5 , as we'll
cover in Line 6A. A somewhat more solid option is the modern GM preference, 3..
.d5 , when 4 cxd5 exd5 5 e5 Ne4 6 Nf3 is trendy, but we'll see in Line 6B that
the immediate 4.e5 still packs a certain punch. In practice, 3...d6 isn't that
far behind 3...c5 in the popularity stakes, largely because it is seen quite
often at lower levels. Indeed, based on when your authors have given simuls,
the Mikenas continues to catch out plenty of black players at club level. Here
you might very well be happy with 4 d4 and a very pleasant space advantage,
but 4.g3 is also possible when 4...Be7 5.Bg2 leaves Black with a slightly
sub-optimal choice. If he simply pushes his e-pawn, he'll be a tempo down on
an Old Indian and those positions we considered in 2C. As such, 5...c5 is a
better choice when 6.Nge2 Nc6 7.O-O transposing to lines we considered last
chapter in 5A. 3...Nc6 ?! isn't so ridiculous and has even been tried with
success by Ivanchuk, albeit in a blitz game. That said, 4.d4
îîStartBracketîîif you prefer something more restrained then 4 Nf3 is a decent
choice, intending 4...d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 e5 with a likely transposition to Line
6BîîEndBracketîî 4...Bb4 4...d5 is arguably less challenging and 5.cxd5 exd5 6.
e5 Ne4 7.Bb5 !? just a pleasant edge; White's space advantage should easily
outweigh the small hole on e4, with 7...Bb4 8.Nge2 O-O 9.O-O easy development,
after which 9...Nxc3 10.bxc3 Be7 11.Nf4 Bg5 12.Bd3 already left White eyeing
the black king and with a large advantage in Aronian-Wojtaszek, Dubai
îîStartBracketîîblitzîîEndBracketîî 2014 5.e5 ! îîStartBracketîîtaking up the
challenge, rather than allow Black to hit back with ...d5 or ...
e5îîEndBracketîî 5...Ne4 5...Ng8 6.Qg4 Kf8 7.Nf3 is also pretty pleasant for
White, who simply intends Be2 and 0-0, as well as a timely d5 or Ng5 and f4 6.
Qc2 d5 6...Qh4 is an idea sometimes seen in the English Defence, but here 7.
Be3 f5 8.exf6 Nxf6 9.Nf3 Qh5 10.Be2 leaves White with the better development,
and even 6...Nxc3 !? 7.bxc3 Be7 8.Nf3 b6 9.Qe4 !? Bb7 10.Qg4 shouldn't
equalise for Black, as he must now play a sub-optimal move to defend g7, not
permit 10...O-O ? 11.Bh6 7.Nf3 f6 8.Bd3 fxe5 9.dxe5 O-O didn't exactly
convince for Black in Soffer-Stocek, Plovdiv 2012, and here 10.Bxe4 ! dxe4 11.
Qxe4 Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 Qe8 13.Ba3 would have left White a pawn up for clearly
insufficient compensation, with 0-0 and Nd4 on the way. A better independent
try is 3...e5 !? , which has recently received a bit of attention. Black gives
up a tempo, but wants to target f2 and develop freely after 4 g3 Bc5. One
decent line for White is 4 Nf3 Nc6 5 a3, ruling out ...Bb4 while preparing b4,
but we prefer to put the extra tempo to immediate use with 4.f4 !? . Yes, this
is an English King's Gambit and we hope Howard Staunton would have approved,
or even will if the Twitter chess persona reads this course! In the limited
existing practice, Black has almost always declined the gambit, with 4...d6 4..
.exf4 isn't totally ridiculous, but will leave Black trailing in development
and 5.e5 Ng8 6.Qe2 ! is quite an important point, preventing ...d6; as such,
Black might develop with 6...Nc6 6...Be7 ? 7.d4 is certainly not to be feared
and here the engines even like 7...Bh4+ 8.g3 !? fxg3 9.hxg3 Bxg3+ before going
10.Kd1 , leaving Black's kingside somewhat vulnerable, and 6...Bb4 7.Nd5 Bc5 ?
8.d4 !? Bxd4 9.Bxf4 Bxg1 10.Rxg1 also leaves White with surely too great a
lead in development 7.Nf3 g5 ! likely the critical line when there are a few
tempting options for White, including the simple 8 Qe4, as well as 8.Nd5 -
with a certain threat - 8...Bg7 9.d4 !? g4 10.Ng5 ! Qxg5 11.Bxf4 Qd8 12.Qxg4
Kf8 13.Qh5 which offers a whole piece for quite some lead in development and
threatens both Bg5 and to target f7 5.Nf3 Nc6 5...exf4 ?! 6.d3 !? Nh5 7.Be2
feels rather suspicious for Black, and if 7...g5 ? 8.Nxg5 ! Qxg5 9.Bxh5 Qxg2
10.Bf3 Qg5 11.Nd5 Qh4+ 12.Ke2 Nc6 13.Qg1 ! with a position which would have
made Wilhelm Steinitz most envious, and 5...Bg4 6.Be2 Bxf3 7.Bxf3 Nc6 8.O-O
Be7 9.d3 Nd7 was pretty Botvinniky in Conquest-Kalevic, Hastings 1993/94,

Qxd7 12.f5 with serious attacking chances 6.d3 Be7 seen in Cheparinov-Rusev,

for instance, 2...d6 3.Nc3 g6 4.g3 Keeping play in Botvinnik territory. Bg7 5.
Bg2 Nf6 6.Nge2 e5 7.O-O O-O 8.d3 when we're back into a position we discussed
right back in Line 1B.} 3. cxd5 cxd5 {Play transposes after 3...Nf6 Hoping for
4.dxc6 Nxc6 5.Nc3 e5 with good compensation. 4.Nc3 cxd5 5.exd5.} 4. exd5 Nf6 {
Black's main move, preparing to recapture on d5 with the knight.} 5. Nc3 {
The two checks on the a4-e8 diagonal both have their fans, but we'll stick
with the straightforward text.} Nxd5 6. Bc4 {Continuing to force the pace and
a move which may make opponents ponder, as 6.Nf3 and 6.d4 are somewhat more
common and 6.Bc4 isn't even featured in Lakdawala's 'The Caro-Kann: Move by
Move'.} Nb6 {Black's most common response, retreating with gain of tempo.} 7.
Bb3 Nc6 {Natural development. Instead, 7...Bf5 can be met by 8.Qf3!? e6 9.Qxb7
if you want to grab a pawn, or by 8.d4 e6 9.Nf3 Nc6 10.O-O transposing to our
main line. Likewise, 7...e6 8.Nf3 Be7 9.d4 Nc6 10.O-O reaches a position we'll
see in the notes to Black's 8th move.} 8. Nf3 {Conventional development, as 8.
Qf3 e6 would leave White a little vulnerable to ideas of ...Ne5.} Bf5 {Sam
Shankland's recommendation in his excellent 'Lifetime Repertoires: Black
versus the English, Reti and Sidelines' course. Black develops his bishop as
actively as possible, while refusing to fall for 8...Bg4 ? 9.Bxf7+ ! Kxf7 10.
Ng5+ White should also welcome 8...Nd4 ?! 9.Nxd4 Qxd4 10.d3 Bg4 11.Qc2
followed by Be3 and O-O , with a4-a5 one way of destabilising Black's position.
} 9. d4 {Naturally White has no desire to see the bishop settle on d3.} e6 10.
O-O Be7 {Straightforward development too from Black who would now enjoy good
counterplay after 11.Qe2?! O-O 12.Be3 Na5!.} 11. a4 {Again we see this
destabilising idea.} Na5 {Black prevents a5.} 12. Ba2 {Maintaining the bishop
makes sense, although 12. d5!? also comes into the equation.} O-O 13. Qe2 Rc8

Deizisau 2003, where the future star îîStartBracketîîalready rated 2610 back

Nxd5 exd5 16. Bd2 Nc4 17. Bc3 Re8 18. Ne5 Bd6 {18...Bf6 19.Qf3 Be4 20.Qf4 Qd6

initiative after 21.Re1 and Qg3 , angling for a timely Ng4.} 19. Qf3 Nxe5 20.

1. c4 e6 {The choice of some Queen's Gambit players. You may well be happy
with 2.Nc3 d5 2...Bb4 3.Qb3 should lead to an edge 3.d4 , possibly because you
have experience with the fairly easy-to-play and pretty decent Exchange
variation, 3...Nf6 or 3...Be7 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bf4 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5. However, we
most certainly don't have to transpose to 1. d4 territory or even opt for a
Reti set-up with 2. Nf3 d5 3. g3 or 3. e3...} 2. e4 {This is likely to
surprise opponents, taking play not into the QGD, but the French Defence!} d5 {
Black's main choice, but not all 1... e6 players are also French fans. Those
who don't play 1. e4 e6 might well deviate at this point and 2... c5 has been
seen in just over a quarter of games to have reached this position. The good
news for White: 3. Nc3 takes us back into the realm of Line 6B and may well
result in a Botvinnik set-up after all.} 3. cxd5 exd5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bb5+ {
Just as in our last section there's nothing wrong with 5.Nc3 , but the text
move may wrong-foot even experienced French players and has been championed by
Maxime Vachier-Lagrave no less.} Nbd7 {The most ambitious and most common
response. Black simply wants to go ...Be7 , ...O-O and regain his pawn after ..
.Nb6. Instead, 5...c6 ?! 6.dxc6 Nxc6 7.Nf3 shouldn't offer quite enough
compensation: for example, Bg4 8.O-O Be7 9.h3 Bh5 10.Nc3 O-O 11.g4 ! Bg6 11...
Nxg4 ? 12.hxg4 Bxg4 13.d4 Bd6 14.Kg2 keeps control of the kingside, and if Qf6
15.Bxc6 bxc6 16.Ne4 Qg6 17.Nxd6 Bh5+ 18.Bg5 ! Qxd6 19.Rh1 12.d4 followed by
Re1 or Bf4.} 6. Nc3 Be7 {Black normally develops so, avoiding the forced queen
exchange after 6...Bd6.} 7. d4 {It's also possible to go 7.Nf3 and only then
O-O and d4.} O-O 8. Nf3 Nb6 {Regaining the pawn, but White should not be too
unhappy, with the use of e5 and fairly active pieces.} 9. h3 {MVL's patented
approach, playing to restrict Black's light-squared bishop.} Bf5 10. O-O a6 11.
Bd3 {Exchanging off Black's most active piece.} Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Nfxd5 13. Re1 Re8
14. Bd2 {Straightforward development from White, who might now centralise with
Rad1 and Ne4-c5 or consider ideas of Ne5 and Qf5. Once again, Black is OK from
an objective viewpoint, but his position is slightly the harder to play, as
quickly became apparent in Vachier-Lagrave - Bacrot, German Bundesliga 2012:}
Nxc3 15. bxc3 Bf6 16. c4 {Now White has excellent control over the central
squares.} Qd7 17. Bg5 Qc6 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. Qb3 {Black is under pressure with
c5 one threat, Ne5 another possibility and Bacrot lasted only another 13 moves.
