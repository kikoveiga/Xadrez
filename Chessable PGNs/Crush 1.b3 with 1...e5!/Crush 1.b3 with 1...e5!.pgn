1. b3
{ White prepares Bb2, aiming for pressure down the long diagonal. If Black occupies the center with pawns, White will pressure them with pieces in hypermodern style. If Black does not occupy the center with pawns, White will sidestep sharp theory and will be able to safely develop his pieces. White would likely have a greater familiarity of the resulting structures than Black, who generally faces 1.b3 less than the White player who consistently plays 1.b3. If White is not seizing the chance to occupy the center with pawns, Black should seize his chance to obtain the maximum that he can in the center. Therefore, 1...e5 ! }
1... e5 2. Bb2
{ There are various sidelines, but they are less critical because they don't pressure the Black center as much. Black can play with similar plans against those lines as well. }
2... Nc6
{ Black prefers 2...Nc6 over 2...d6 because Black would rather have his d-pawn on d5. }
3. e3 { White prepares Bb5, aiming to increase his pressure on the e5-point. }
3... d5 { Black fully occupies the center with pawns. } 4. Bb5
{ White increases the pressure on the e5-pawn. } 4... Bd6
{ Black develops and defends the e5-pawn. If White fails to obtain sufficient piece pressure against the center, Black will consolidate and have a better position due to his superior center control, and the Black pawn center can later advance to gain space. The critical moves are 5.f4 and 5.Nf3. }

Black plans to play ...Qg5 followed by ...Be6 and ...O-O-O with excellent chances to obtain the initiative in the resulting middlegame.   It makes sense to play  ...Nd5  before  Be6  because  9.Be2  Qg5  10.O-O ?!  loses to  10...Bxe3 !  11.fxe3 ?  Nxe3.   9.Bxg7?!  Rg8  Black has more than enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn.

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. f4
{ The sharpest continuation, and one which was recommended by IM Ahmad Alkhatib's 'Fight like Nakamura: Play 1.b3 !'. White increases the pressure on the Black e5-pawn. The tactical justification of 5.f4 is that 5...exf4 loses to 6.Bxg7. }
5... f6
{ Black protects his e5-pawn and is now threatening ...exf4. The consequence of 5...f6 is that White can play 6.Qh5+, which is the main line.   5...Qh4+  6.g3  Qe7  The drawback of this line is that White can play Nf3 without worrying about ...exf4.  7.Nf3  f6   7...Bg4  8.fxe5  Bxe5  9.Bxe5  Bxf3  10.Qxf3  Qxe5  11.Nc3  White has a lead in development. Black is close to equality, but White is pressing and the position is dry.  8.Nc3  Be6  I played a series of blitz games with FM Anish Vivekananthan who was armed with Chessable's 'Fight like Nakamura: Play 1.b3 !'. We would prepare between games/matches and in this line, White generally was pressing. White has the sort of hypermodern position that he wants when playing 1.b3, as well as a game with little theory. I believe White is fighting for the advantage here  (though Black can probably equalize)  as White's pressure on the center seems to be as valuable as the occupation of the center with pawns in this case  (Black's pawns can't advance without making holes and advancing doesn't gain much anyways)  and White has a lead in development. Therefore, I'd like to avoid this line and fight 1.b3 with sharper options.   5...Qe7  is somewhat passive and White's pressure on the center is significant after  6.Nf3  Bg4   6...f6  5... f6 avoids this line because 6. Nf3 loses a pawn to 6... exf4.  7.Nc3  Black's center is under a lot of pressure and the center is not mobile. White also has a lead in development and scores highly in this line.  7.h3   7.fxe5  Bxe5  8.Bxe5  Bxf3  9.Qxf3  Qxe5  10.Nc3  White is pressing due to his lead in development.  7...Bxf3  8.Qxf3  White is fighting for the advantage in this position due to his bishop pair. The pressure on the Black center is at least as important as the Black occupation of the center. }

{ I didn't recommend 10... Nf5 because I believe that White is pressing in the endgame with correct play. }
11. Qxd8 Rxd8 12. Nc3
{ Black's main problems are that he is behind in development and is at risk of losing the bishop pair after Nb5. I don't see any way for Black to use his central space to fight for a win. The onus is on Black to prove that his position is equal, not White. }
12... e4
{ 12...d4 ?!  13.Bc4+  Kg7  14.Ne4  dxe3  15.O-O-O  gives White more than enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn. }
13. Ng5 h6 { To prepare ...Be6. } 14. Nh3 Nfe7
{ There are alternatives, but they don't solve the problem of Black being behind in development. Like in the following variation, they tend to lead to 'engine equal/0.00' positions that aren't actually equal and White is pressing.   14...Be5  15.O-O-O  Nfe7   15...Nh4  16.g3  Bxh3  17.gxh4  With another engine 0.00 position that favors White due to his initiative.  16.Nf4  Bxf4   16...g5  17.Nh5  17.exf4  White is pressing due to his bishop pair and lead in development.   14...Nh4  15.O-O-O  Taking on h3 opens lines for the White rooks and gives up the bishop pair.   15.Nf2  Nxg2+  16.Kf1  Nh4  17.Nxd5  Be5  18.Bxe5  Nxe5  19.Nf6+  White is at least equal in these complications.  15...Nxg2  If concrete ideas don't solve Black's problems, then White will be pressing for sure due to his bishop pair and lead in development.   15...Bxh3  16.gxh3  another '0.00' which favors White. Even stockfish realizes that it favors White as it reaches high depths.  16.Nf2  White's initiative is worth more than the sacrificed pawn. }
15. Nb5 Bxh3 16. gxh3
{ At a very high depth, Stockfish 10 64 thinks the position is approximately equal, especially if guided for a couple moves. '0.00' a common evaluation here. Unless there is a forced draw by perpetual check, I generally consider 0.00 positions to not always be equal, but are more like one side has dynamic chances that are sufficient for at least a draw and the engine isn't sure if more is possible. Read the 'ZeroZeroZero' section in the book 'Game Changer: AlphaZero's Groundbreaking Chess Strategies and the Promise of AI' for more information. In my opinion, Black is on the wrong side of a '0.00' position as White has the dynamics. Black has nothing to play for, despite the engine's confidence. White is pressing due to his superior piece activity, bishop pair, and kingside open files. }

{ Black offers an equal endgame or a repetition of moves. There are alternatives, but they lead to crazy/unclear positions and I don't want to recommend them against a position that you are only going to face if your opponent is extremely well prepared. The alternatives are 12... h5  (this one is my preference - preparing for g4 and preparing ...Qg7)  and 12... Nb4, feel free to pause this variation and prepare one or both of these alternatives if you would rather avoid the draw.   13.Qh4  Nf5   13.Qxd7  Bxd7   IM Al Khatib claimed that White was better after  12...h5  13.Nxd5.  I looked into it and concluded that he is right, after the insane complications White gets a slightly better endgame.

7... Ne7
{ Actually, Black can play ...Ne7, sacrificing the f6-pawn for open lines and time. White can't take the f6-pawn without losing the f4-pawn in return. 7... Ne7 is nowhere near the most popular move, but just as critical as 7... exf4.   7...exf4  is the mainline, but I don't like how White sacrifices material for the initiative with  8.Nf3  fxe3  9.O-O  where Black is behind in development in an open position. }
8. fxe5
{ The most critical move, despite being rare. There is only one master game with 8. fxe5 as of 6/30/2019. 8. fxe5 is overshadowed by 8. Qxf6 in amateur chess as well according to the lichess database. }

{ Black unpins the c6-knight, renewing the defense to his e5-pawn. } 10. Be2
{ Recommended by IM Ahmad Alkhatib in the Chessable course 'Fight like Nakamura: Play 1.b3 !'. White prepares for ...Nf5 by moving his bishop out of the way of possible forks.   10.Nc3  Nf5  11.Qxd8  allows  11...Nxd8 !  where  12.Nxd5  loses to  12...c6.  This is why White plays  10.Be2  , which is also a useful move now that the bishop is no longer preforming any useful function on  c6  as the c6-knight has been unpinned. }
10... Qd7
{ Black prepares to play ...e4 followed by ...Nf5. White's reply of 11. Nc3 is forced.   10...e4 ?  loses to  11.Ng5.  If Black's queen were already on  d7  , then  ...Nf5  would attack the White queen and defend the h7-pawn.   I was convinced by analyzing with the engine and checking the lines in IM Ahmad_Alkhatib's  1.b3  Chessable repertoire that White is pressing in the endgame after  10...Nf5  11.Qxd8  Rxd8  12.Nc3  e4  13.Ng5  h6  14.Nh3  , despite the engine's insistence that Black was doing fine. For more information, check the why not 10...Nf5 section. }
11. Nc3
{ Forced, White has a lost game otherwise. The idea is to meet 11... e4 ? with 12. Nxe4 ! where Black can't recapture due to Bxc4 with a decisive attack. }
11... Nf5
{ 11...e4 ?  loses to  12.Nxe4  dxe4  13.Bc4+   White is pressing in the endgame after  11...Qg4  12.Qxg4  Bxg4  13.Nb5 !  because after  Nxd6  he will have the bishop pair. }
12. Qa4 Nb4
{ 12...d4?!  13.Ne4  dxe3  14.O-O-O  gives White a powerful initiative.  White can also press in this endgame if he is well prepared, but the benefit of this over 10... Nf5 is the possibility that White will not find 11. Nc3 or 12. Qa4. }
13. Qxd7 Bxd7
{ Black is well developed and has a pawn center, giving Black reasonable chances in this complex endgame. However, due to extremely concrete resources, White is able to fight for a small advantage. This is only relevant if White is very accurate, but for those of you who want to know how Black will equalize against this concrete plan should go to the endgame theory section. }

Black also has reasonable play after   16...Rae8  17.a3  Nc6  18.Nxd6  cxd6  although White can press due to his bishop pair, fighting for the initiative with 19. e4 followed by c3.  15...Nxa2  16.Ra1  Nb4  Black is likely at least equal in the unclear complications that follow.  17.Bc4+   17.O-O  Bc6   17...Nxc2   17...b5  17...Kg7  18.O-O  Nxc2   18...Bc6  is a solid alternative.  19.Rac1  Ncxe3  20.dxe3  Nxe3  21.Rfe1  Rae8  22.Bd3  Bc6   22...Nd5   22...Kg8  23.Nxd4  Nxg2  24.Kxg2  exd4  25.Bxd4+  Be5  26.Bxa7  Rd8  is a crazy variation where Black is probably fine.

Ne7 because e4 can be met with ...d4.   14...e4 ?  15.Nxe4  dxe4  16.Bc4+  Rf7  17.Ng5  if Black had already played ...c6 or ...Ne7, Bc4+ could have been met with ...Nbd5. This is why Black needs to prepare ...e4. }
15. a3
{ White needs to play in a forcing way or else Black will take over the initiative with ...e4...a6 is also an idea to consolidate if Black is given time because after a3 and ...Nc6, White can't target the Black bishop pair with Nb5.   15.Rdf1  e4   15...h6  first is also possible, avoiding the Ng5-xe4 lines, but allowing White another chance to fight for the initiative with a3 and e4/Nb5.   15...a6  16.Ng5  Be5  these complications might favor White, 15... a6 is a safer option.   16...Rf5   16...h6  17.Ngxe4  dxe4  18.Nxe4  Nf5  19.Nf6+  Rxf6  20.Bxf6  Bc6  21.a3  Na6  22.Bb2  Nc5  is somewhat unclear but probably favoring White. So Black should prepare this with 15... h6, consolidate with 15... a6, or deviate on move 16.   15.Kb1 ?!  e4  gives Black the initiative. The sac's on e4 after Ng5 aren't dangerous if White doesn't have a rook on the f-file.   15.Nb5!  is IM Ahmad Alkhatib's suggestion. The critical line is  15...e4   15...Nxa2+?!  16.Kb1  Nb4  17.Nxe5  White won the pawn back and has the initiative.  16.Ne5  Bxe5  17.Bxe5  Rf2  18.Nc3  Nxa2+  19.Nxa2  Rxe2  20.Rhg1  Rf2  21.Bxc7  a5  White is slightly better in this endgame due to his more active bishop, but this advantage is insignificant. This endgame is objectively drawn and is relatively easy to draw in practice due to the opposite colored bishops. All of the rooks will likely be traded on the f-file soon, bringing Black closer to complete equality. At depth 43, Stockfish 10 64 evaluates this endgame as +0.21, suggesting the following variation as best.  22.Rdf1  Rxf1+  23.Rxf1  Black has many alternatives in this variation, of course. This is just a sample variation  (as given by Stockfish)  to show that Black is doing fine.  23...a4  24.Kb2  Rc8  25.Bg3  axb3  26.cxb3  Nf5  27.Be5  Re8  28.Bf4  h5  29.Rc1  d4  30.exd4  Nxd4  31.Be3  Nf5  32.Rc7  Bc6  33.Nb4  Re7  34.Rxe7  Nxe7  35.Kc3  Nd5+  36.Nxd5  Bxd5  37.b4  Kf7  38.Kd4  Ke6  39.g3  Bc6  40.Kc5  Kf6  41.Kb6  Ke5  42.b5  Bd7  43.Kc5  Be6  with a drawn opposite colored bishop endgame. }
15... Nbc6 16. e4
{ Unless White plays aggressively, then Black will take over the initiative with ...e4 or consolidate the bishop pair with ...a6  (preventing Nb5)  . The engine thinks that White is slightly better but here are some deeper lines to show that Black is fine. As usual, if White doesn't play really aggressively then Black will be at least fine, but even in the critical line Black is doing okay. }

If you prefer this option, I suggest analyzing with Stockfish to get a feel for Black's resources.   10...Bf5  is also strong.   10...Bxf4  isn't as strong as the alternatives, despite scoring well in practice. White will rapidly develop his pieces with at least equality due to his excellent harmony. It would have been more aggressive for Black to take on  f4  with his rook. }

{ Black has the initiative and most likely an objective advantage. } 12. Nbc3
{ Stockfish suggests   12.Qf2  likely as a flexible way of avoiding ...Nf5 from coming with tempo. Another benefit is that Black sometimes plays ...a6, provoking Bxc6 and ...Nxc6, and White will have to move his queen if he wants to avoid the worse endgame  (Black is better due to his bishop pair)  .  12...Qd7  Black still has a powerful initiative due to his superior piece activity and will castle queenside next. Stockfish's evaluation fluctuates between approximate equality and a significant Black advantage, so Black is the one pressing objective as well as practically. }

{ Black dominates the center. } 17. Kd1
{ While there was no clear way to defuse Black's initiative, there was no need to make such a major concession. White will never be able to castle.   17.Rf1  Re4  18.Rf2  gives White better defending chances, but Black will still have a powerful initiative after  18...Nf5  followed by ...O-O-O. }
17... Qg5
{ While Black still has the initiative, it seems rather commital to decentralize the queen when it is not clear what is gained.   17...Nf5  It seems more logical to me to include all of the pieces into the attack without making a major commitment, because Black will be able to improve his pieces faster than White and the White king isn't going to be able to find safety while Black prepares. Black will castle queenside next and then can try some commitment. Stockfish evaluates Black's initiative as decisive. }
18. Re1 Rd8
{ 18...Rf2  offers more of a justification for Qg5. Black will either win the g2-pawn or force a concession. White is unable to defend his g2-pawn with Bf3 or Bf1 because of ...Qxd2#. }

{ Black is pressing in this endgame, but his initiative is nowhere near as strong as it would have been if he brought all of his pieces into the attack before making a major commitment with 17... Qg5 ?!. Black won the endgame, but this is not relevant to the opening so I won't comment much on it. }
