1. Nf3 {The Reti Opening's initial moves are 1. Nf3 followed by 2. c4. It is a 
positionally interesting opening for White full of hidden bite. Thanks to its 
flexibility and many ways to play for a win, the Reti has slowly become more and more 
popular among players of all levels. In 1987, when Kasparov was fighting Karpov in 
the 24th round of the World Championship, Kasparov had to win or Karpov would be 
crowned champion. So Kasparov chose the Reti Opening, saying that it is the opening 
that can hold the winning chances untill the last breath, and Kasparov won thanks to 
our opening. The opening is called the Reti Opening because it was introduced and 
regularly played by the Czechoslovakian Grandmaster Richard Reti in the 1920s. This 
opening is not only one that has been discovered and played in the past, but even now 
it is considered to be one of the main weapons for White. Today the greatest player 
and expert in this opening is the one who replaced Kasparov as World Champion, 
Vladimir Kramnik, and watching his games is what inspired me to focus on this 
opening. Why should we play 1. Nf3: - We avoid many theoretical lines that appear 
from 1. e4 and 1. d4. - We surprise your opponent, as most Black players will be 
ready to play against 1. e4 and 1. d4, but not 1. Nf3! - We avoid the early contact 
between the pieces, which means we avoid any simplification early on. This gives 
White the best conditions to play for a win. - The Reti opening is known to be a 
strategical one with many poisonous bites that are killing.} *

{In this game I am going to give the mic to Kasparov to tell us about a very exciting 
journey.} 1. c4 {I can look back at my chess career and pick out more than a few 
crisis points, but only one Mount Everest. I would like to share the tale to 
investigate the means I used in winning the most important game of my life. ... After 
a tough, prolonged defense I suffered one of the worst hallucinations of my career 
and blundered to a loss in game 23. Suddenly, Karpov was up by a point and was only a 
draw away from taking back the crown he had lost to me two years earlier. The very 
next day after this catastrophe, I had to take the White pieces into a must-win game 
24. Caissa, the goddess of chess, had punished me for my conservative play, for 
betraying my nature. I would not be allowed to hold on to my title without winning a 
game in the second half of the match. Only once before in chess history had the 
champion won a final game to retain his title. With his back against the wall, 
Emanuel Lasker beat Carl Schlechter in the last game of their match in 1910. The win 
allowed Lasker to draw the match and keep his title for a further eleven years. The 
Austrian Schlechter had, like Karpov, a reputation as a defensive wizard. In fact, 
his uncharacteristically aggressive play in the final game against Lasker has led 
some historians to believe that the rules of that particular match required him to 
win by two points. When preparing for my turn on the other side of this situation, I 
recalled that critical encounter. What strategy should I employ with the White pieces 
in this must-win final game? There was more to think about than game 23 and game 24, 
of course. These were also games 119 and 120 between us, an extraordinary number of 
top-level encounters between the same two players, all played in a span of 
thirty-nine months. It felt like one long match, with this final game in December, 
1987, the climax of what we had started in September 1984. My plan for the final game 
had to consider not only what I would like best but what my opponent would like 
least. And what could be more annoying for Karpov than my turning the tables and 
playing like Karpov?' -- Garry Kasparov, excerpt from 'How Life Imitates Chess',

chance to play for an attack, I moved my Knight to the central e5 square, offering a 
pawn. Karpov took the bait and grabbed the pawn, a temptation that could have led to 
disaster. And he had to play quickly now, as it was still a long way to move 40, 
when, by the rules then in force, the game would be adjourned and more time added 
before continuation the next day. -- Kasparov, 'How Life Imitates Chess'} Nxa4 32. 
Rxc8+ {I exchanged Rooks, leaving me with Queen, Knight, and Bishop against his Queen 
and two Knights. He had an extra pawn, but I had seen a tactical possibility that 
would give me a powerful attack. His pieces were dangerously uncoordinated, and his 
King was vulnerable. If I could penetrate into his position with my Queen, I could 
exploit both of these factors at the same time. The question was where to move my 
Queen on move 33. Karpov could only wait, knowing he would have to reply almost 
immediately or he wouldn't have enough time to make the next eight moves without 
losing on time. -- Kasparov, 'How Life Imitates Chess'} Nxc8 33. Qd1 {[%cal 
Bd1d8,Gd1a4][%csl Rc8,Rg8] Lost in thought, I was startled by a tap on my shoulder. 
The Dutch arbiter leaned over and said, 'Mr. Kasparov, you have to write the moves.' 
I had become so wrapped up in the game that I had forgotten to make note of the last 
two moves on my score sheet as required by the rules. The arbiter was of course 
correct to remind me of the regulations, but what a moment to be strict! Distracted, 
I played my Queen to the wrong square. I missed a subtlety and failed to see why a 
different move with the same idea would have been stronger. My move gave Karpov a 
clever defense, and suddenly he was one move from reclaiming his title. But under 
pressure from the clock, he missed the best move (though our exchange of errors would 
not be discovered until well after the game), and the momentum was still with me. --

surrounded the Black King. I regained my sacrificed pawn with interest, and by the 
time we reached move 40, ending the time scramble, my position was clearly superior. 
The game was adjourned until the next day with the title still up in the air. It was 
going to be a long night. Getting a good night's sleep before the game had been wise, 
but now there was work to do. Thirteen pieces were still on the board, including 
Queens, too much material for definitive endgame analysis. I had an extra pawn, but 
with such limited material, Karpov had definite chances of a draw. A lot of chess was 
still ahead. -- Kasparov, 'How Life Imitates Chess'} Qf6 41. Qb5 Qe7 42. Kg2 {The 
best news was that I could play this position forever, manoeuvring around to provoke 
a mistake by my opponent. Black would be tied down on defense the entire time, and 
Karpov knew it. The prospect of such prolonged torture took its toll; I could see it 
in his eyes when he walked on the stage a few minutes after I did. His fatalistic 
expression told me that he had already lost the game psychologically, which boosted 
my confidence. -- Kasparov, 'How Life Imitates Chess'} g6 {The manoeuvring began. I 
remember being surprised when early on Karpov made a pawn push that my team and I had 
established as bad for Black's defensive chances. Apparently Karpov and his team 
disagreed with our analysis, or perhaps it was a psychological error. Sometimes the 
hardest thing to do in a pressure situation is to allow the tension to persist. The 
temptation is to make a decision, any decision, even if it is an inferior choice. And 
Karpov's move made the position more concrete, reducing the level of uncertainty. But 
in my favor, his structure was now fixed, presenting me with clearer targets. 
Convinced of the quality of our analysis, I took Karpov's significant deviation from 
it as a mistake, not a potential improvement, further increasing my confidence. --

64. Kg2 {After another ten moves of steady squeezing, I began to feel the win was in 
the bag. Karpov's pieces were pinned up against the wall, and a little more 
manoeuvring would lead to decisive material gain. Later I heard that FIDE President 
Florencio Campomanes was busy calling a special meeting in another room to decide how 
to handle the closing ceremony, which was scheduled to be held on the same day. But 
it still looked as if this game could last forever; what was to be done? Two crises 
were averted at once when someone ran into the meeting room to announce, 'Karpov 
resigned!' It was without question the loudest and longest standing ovation I had 
ever received outside my native country. The theater thundered as Spanish television 
cut from futbol to broadcast the conclusion of the match. I had done what Karpov had 
failed to do in 1985: won the final game and drawn the match to retain my title. This 
time I would have a good, long time to enjoy it. -- Garry Kasparov, excerpt from 'How

{*General Plan:* Black aims to improve all pieces without creating weaknesses in the 
pawn structure. Once the development has been finished, Black will strike at the 
center by pushing either c5 or e5. In the meantime, White has to maintain tension in 
the center by not exchanging any unnecessary pawns and moving forward by finishing 
the development of all pieces. Then it is time to start the fight for the center by 
exchanging some pawns. *Ideas* • At the proper time, you play cxd5 to create an 
isolated d-pawn for Black. • After Black captures ... exd5, remember that the 
f5-square will be weak, with Nh4 going to f5 becoming an idea. • Opening up the 
diagonal for the b2-Bishop with dxc5 is another typical idea. • If Black recaptures 
with bxc5 in response to dxc5, White will be playing against hanging pawns on c5 and

{*General Plan:* In the Catalan Black tries to consolidate the center by keeping up 
the tension and supporting the d5-pawn as much as possible until finishing the 
development. The general plan for White is to open up the center before Black 
finished the mentioned plan! *Ideas:* • Preparing for e4 and playing it as quickly 
as possible. • Black's light-squared Bishop is Black's worst piece, so White tries 
to prevent ...c5 and ...e5! • Rd1 is a nice move to prevent Black from playing 
...c5 or ...e5 because White can respond with dxc5 or dxe5. This opens up the d-file 
and might create some tactics with Black's Queen on d8.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 d5

{*General Plan:* In the Slav Black tries to consolidate the center and keep 
everything under control. White has to keep as much tension in the center as possible 
and can try to attack on the Queenside. *Ideas:* • b3 is an important move to avoid 
dxc4 variations. • Rc1-Rc2!? creates space for Qa1, Rfc1, Bc3, b4, b5 to fight on 
the Queenside. • If Black doesn't improve the light-squared Bishop and instead 
plays ...e6, we will gain a Catalan-like structure.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 c6 3. b3 $5 {A

{*General Plan:* Black intends is to make it an easy game by giving up the central 
tension early in the game. However, White will regain the pawn and slowly gain a 
space advantage and better development. *Ideas:* • Na3 is an important move to 
regain the pawn before Black can support it. • Fianchettoed Bishops work best when 
the center is open. • White has good control over the e5-square, which will be 
increased after ♗b2.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 {In order to take the pawn back!}

{*General Plan:* White has to play actively and might need to sacrifice a pawn to 
gain development, where Black seeks a space advantage by pushing the d-pawn. 
Exchanging pieces is good for the side with less space, so exchanges will be 
favourable for White. White usually aims for the Queenside, although sometimes it 
might also aim for the center. *Ideas:* • 3. b4 is the main move to fight on the 
Queenside. • White can fight in the center by pushing the e3-pawn if play on the 
Queenside stagnates. • a3, Ra2, Rae2 is a nice idea when play on the Queenside 
finishes. • c5!? is an interesting move for White to support the d6-square for the 
Knight or to create a chance to place the light-squared Bishop (Bc4) on a powerful 
diagonal.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 d4 3. b4 $1 {This looks like a Reversed Benko.} f6 
{Preparing for ...e5 to support the d4-pawn.} (3... g6 4. g3 {with Black's d-pawn 
being pushed to d4, it means the f1-Bishop will be perfectly placed along the h1-a8 
diagonal.} Bg7 {Threatening ...d3 to attack the a1-Rook!} 5. d3 e5 6. Bg2 Ne7 7. O-O 
O-O 8. a4 $5 {White has more space on the Queenside and prepares for Ra2-e2 idea 
later on. See the game Duda-Kuzubov.}) (3... a5 4. Qa4+ {the point of this move is to 
stop Black playing a4 and to force Black to play ...Bd7 which is the only move in 
order not to lose the d4-pawn.} Bd7 5. b5 {and now the b8-Knight is facing some 
problems in the way of development! The d4-pawn is threatened.} 5... Bg4 6. Ne5

Black's pawns (f6-e5) are located on the dark squares the light squares are very

d3-pawn will be captured as well!} 9. b5 {Keeping the a-file closed, and preventing 
...Nc6. Question: Why does white give up on the c5-pawn ? Answer: Because the c-pawn 
will be captured anyway, Black is going to play axb4 then White will no longer have 
enough protectors of the pawn. Also, after axb4 the a8-rook will be activated. So b5 
gives up on the c-pawn (which is very hard to protect) but it keeps the a8-rook 
locked in because b5 attacks the a6 and c6-squares, making it impossible for Black to 
develop his rook to safely.} Bxc5 (9... Nd7 {in order to take with the Knight!} 10.

{*General Plan:* Black will have a focus on the Kingside, so White has to counter it 
by focussing on the Queenside and possibly in the center. The position will be 
comparable to a Reversed Sicilian where White is playing a Black setup with a tempo 
up. *Ideas:* • Black will start on the Kingside by moving the f6-Knight away, 
followed by pushing the f-pawn forward. • White has to counter on the Queenside, 
having more space there by continuing to push the pawn which started moving forward 
on moves 2 & 3. • c5!? is an interesting idea, especially when Black has 
insufficient protectors of the e5-pawn. As a result, the center will be open and 
Black's attack on the Kingside will just be a weakness. • d4 is another of White's 
weapons to play against Black's attack. White needs to make sure that the e4-square 
is controlled. • a4, a5, b5, b6 is another way to attack on the Queenside.} 1. Nf3 
Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. b4 $5 {I do like and prefer this setup because it is a simple one 
although it is unknown as well. The setup follows the right strategy in terms of 
facing the King's Indian and Grunfeld, which is to expand on the Queenside! 
(Especially against the King's Indian). White will have a space advantage in an 
earlier stage of the game!} Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O (4... d5 {Makes no sense here because

will gain a permanent space advantage there!} 10. Na3 $5 {keeping the diagonal for 
the b2-Bishop open and the Knight can be rerouted to c2 and then to (d4 or b4). The 
problem for Black in this position is that the light-squared Bishop has no good

important piece for Black in the Grunfeld defense which is the g7-Bishop! White will 
have a massive center and Black lacks any counterplay!}) 6. Bg2 e5 {This is the setup 
that you will be facing if you are playing against a King's Indian player. If you 
have a deeper thought to this position you will be seeing that it resembles an 
English opening but White has already played b4, which means that there will be no 
restriction for what White normally faces like a5, Nc6. Another deeper look and you 
will be seeing a reversed Sicilian kind of position and White is already expanding on 
the Queenside as well!} 7. O-O (7. d3 {you can do O-O first, it is just kind of a

putting lots of pressure on the d6-weak pawn which cannot move forward!}) Nc6 (7...

counter that you are going to be fighting against if you are playing a King's Indian 
player. Black wants to start expanding on the King's side as soon as possible in

and in order to create some sort of attack there as well!} (9... h6 {Black wants to 
play Be6 but is afraid of Ng5.} 10. Nbd2 $5 {With the idea of playing Qc2 
(controlling the e4-square) and then push d4! So why d4? Because White will improve 
the b2-Bishop by opening the diagonal of it. One more idea is that psychologically, 
the King's Indian Players like to play in a kind of position with a closed nature, so 
if White manages to open up the game then he psychologically will be superior!} 10... 
Be6 11. Qc2 {Yes the idea is playing d4. However, this setup is very flexible for 
White and he can choose between d4 or even play c5 in order to open the c-file and 
start the play on the Queenside. Note: c5 works because the e-pawn will not be 
protected if Black takes on c5 or even pushes d5.} Nd7 12. d4 f5 {Starting the

that here it isn't a good idea for Black to play a6, because White can take on c6 
first, creating a weakness on c6, and then go back to d4 with the b5-Knight. In the

{*General Plan:* Black is closing the center by choosing this structure, aiming for 
good control over the d4-square and a main focus on the Kingside. White will be 
working on the Queenside. *Ideas:* • Black will start expanding on the Kingside, 
moving the f-pawn forward after finishing the development. White has to manage to 
play the b4-push as quick as possible, sometimes costing a pawn sacrifice to be on 
time.} 1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O e5 6. Nc3 Nge7 7. a3 {White is

{*General Plan:* In this structure, Black is like an athlete who always runs behind 
the champion. If Black tries to have a step up it will risk the position. *Ideas:* 
• White's main idea is pushing d2-d4 after finishing the development. It will be 
risky for Black to try d7-d5 earlier, because this gives White the initiative.} 1.

to this with a counter in the center or on the Queenside. *Ideas:* • An e4

{*General Plans:* Black improves the Queen's Knight first and one of the ideas is to 
castle long. White will be waiting to see where Black's King will go, if it goes to 
the Queenside the attack will be starting there, if it goes to the Kingside then the 
attack will be in the center. *Ideas:* • If Black castles long the attack will be 
starting with c3 followed by b4, building a pawn storm on the Queenside. • If Black 
castles short the attack will be mainly aimed at the d5-square by pushing the c4-pawn 
followed by Ne5 to open up the diagonal for the light-squared Bishop.} 1. Nf3 Nc6

{*General Plan:* If Black chooses a setup with d6 & g6 then I recommend going for the 
Pirc defense. In the Pirc defense Black usually goes for a quick Kingside castling 
and tries to start fighting in the center, while White will enjoy a space advantage 
and control over the center. *Ideas:* • The e5 push is White's main and most 
dangerous weapon. • If Black pushes c6 or a6 White has to respond with an early a4 
in order to stop b5, which is going to prevent Black from having a space advantage on 
the Queenside. • If Black manages to safely play e5, White has the idea of dxe5 
followed by Bc4 and the Bishop will be having a decent diagonal.} 1. Nf3 g6 2. e4 $5

be the right decision and a good protector because the e4-pawn might get attacked.

{*General Plan:* Black is going to play the game around the center, keeping the d&e 
pawns on the 7th and 6th ranks. White will be placing the pieces in the best places 
around the center and then open it up. *Ideas:* • After finishing the development 
White has the idea to attack the center by pushing d4, which is going to open the 
d-file for White. • Black can't stand without making any weaknesses. For example, 
to stop Nb5 Black has to play a6 which is going to weaken the b6 pawn. • By moving 
the b&d pawns the c6-square is weak.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Bg2 c5 5. O-O

{*General Plan:* Black selects a somewhat strange opening to confuse White, where b5 
does gain a space advantage on the Queenside. However, it delays Black's development, 
which is why White is going to make use of that fact by developing the pieces as 
quickly as possible. *Ideas:* • A quick e4 and exchanging the b-pawn for the 
e4-pawn is a good idea because it gives White a much better development. • If Black 
defends b5 and rejects the exchange, then after finishing the development of all 
pieces White's dynamic center will start moving with either e5 or d5.} 1. Nf3 b5
