{ Welcome to the 'The Mighty Makogonov' course.   My username is InfiniteFlash and I am the author of this course. I'm a chess player aspiring to be a National Master and anticipate achieving the title in the next few years.  This course is my own repertoire against the King's Indian defense. Every single line here is one I would play in my own games. The repertoire is complete, but I am very open to adding more lines to the study. Future lines added would only further bolster alternatives the reader can select from.  _______________________________________  This course reminds me of school:  The first four chapters are analogous to the first week of school: the one week where you have freedom and creativity. The one week where there's no homework and you're watching cat videos & listening to stories the professor loves to tell before the rest of the course gets underway.   You'll remember the stories I tell in these chapters.  Once that first week passes though, the ball gets rolling and class is in session. The rest of the chapters contain a setup position and a gentle  introduction variation to help readers get acclimated to rest of the material.   You'll think of Chapters 5-15 as weekly class lessons to explore and learn about.  Chapter 1: Introduction  I think of the introduction like the first week of school for students. It helps students get acclimated with the material for the upcoming school term.  Chapter 2: Pawn Structures  This chapter contains discussions over common pawn structures  (PS)  that you will most commonly come across in the course.  Chapter 3: Themes  This chapter contains ideas that are commonplace throughout the course.  Chapter 4: Sacrifices/Breakthroughs to know!  This chapter contains sacrificial ideas and breaks that are commonplace throughout the course.  Chapter 5: Weird sidelines  This chapter is a discussion about 6..Nc6, the best of the  bad  alternatives for Black against the Makogonov. It's not really all that bad of a move for Black, surprisingly.  Chapter 6: Pirc setup with 6..c6  This chapter is the same as chapter 5, but contains discussions over 6..c6. Usually, c6 signals the Pirc defense setup.  Chapter 7: Benoni setup with 6..c5  This chapter is the same as chapter 5, but contains discussions over 6..c5. Usually, c5 signals the Benoni defense setup.  Chapter 8: 6..Na6, 6..Nbd7  The sixth move knight moves, Na6 & Nbd7, are transpositional tools that are designed to confuse the White player. Fear not, the petty waiting game, that Black tries to pose you, is no worry.  Chapter 9: 6..e5 7.d5 sidelines  This chapter is mostly discussion over all sidelines within the 6..e5 complex. Generally, 7.d5 followed by 8.g4 is a good way of handling it.  Chapter 10: 6..e5 7.d5 a5: Plan #1  This chapter contains plans where Black plays with an early Na6-Nc5. I often recommend an early Qf3 in this section.   Chapter 11: 6..e5 7.d5 a5: Plan #2  This chapter contains ideas and plans where Black plays Nfd7 early on. Black also angles for an early f5 and ideas related to Bg7-Bf6.  Chapter 12: 7..Nh5 8.g3 sidelines  This chapter is an introduction to the most complex pawn structure in the course  (PS#6)  .  Chapter 13, 14, 15: 7..Nh5 8.g3 f5 9.exf5 gxf5 10.Nh4 Qe8/Nf4/Nf6  These 3 chapters appear intimidating  (the variations start at move 10)  at first, but they really aren't. They're a thorough discussion about positions regarding PS #6.  __________________________________________________________  Lastly, there are 50+ games  (reference lines)  in this course that the user can consult. I feel that one can skim through the games and get a feel for what White usually angles for. However, the ambitious reader is encouraged to read through every game and to be able to understand the subtleties between move orders.   For example, the discrepancy between Chapters 12 and 13  (with respect to lines related to an early Qe8, delayed Qe8, and much-delayed Qe8)  is a good example of how some move orders are tricky.  Another example is the discrepancy between Chapters 7 and 8  (with regards to the Benoni setups within each)  deserves serious attention. It could be very well the case that an early Na6, anticipating an early Nb4 thereafter, is something White should put attention towards.  I wish you good luck in your games and hopefully, you'll be able to finally slay the beast that is the King's Indian Defense! I've put blood, sweat and tears into making this course and will go to the mat with anyone to have a discussion about anything in this course.   
Best,  InfiniteFlash }

[Black "Forward: Why was this course made?"]
[Result "*"]

{ I've been asked numerous times about why did I create this course the first place ?   My attitude towards the King's Indian Defense  (KID)  has more or less been the same over the years. On principle alone, White should be better in the opening. The space advantage White acquires in almost all variations should have beaten the Black side into a pulp by now.   Practice has shown over the years, however, that White has many difficulties trying to prove that the space advantage actually matters. What's even more strange to me is that White has dozens of legitimate setups vs the KID and nothing has led to its demise. With that in mind, I've more or less accepted the KID as the cockroach of all defenses: It survives anything thrown at it, no matter how ugly it looks !   The purpose of this section is to discuss what led me to write this course. Why did I settle on the Makogonov? Let's take a look. My goal here is to tell a story about my journey in this opening. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ The starting position of the King's Indian. Generally, the most testing move has been 4. e4, gaining space in the center. White has tried everything under the sun and there is much room for originality waiting to be discovered from the white side. }
4. e4
{ I encourage the reader to take a snapshot of this position for White and to understand I'm writing the following from a traditionalist point.   I often wonder if there are good setups vs the Grunfeld defense & KID that haven't been discovered. The idea is that once they would be discovered, they would give White an easy, moderate advantage to play with. The answer is probably, no.   The hard truth about chess is that it is a complex game with a plethora of different factors to understand and value. Boiling down an opening  (a subset of chess positions)  to a single factor such as space, is a disservice to all hyper modern openings. One's space, piece development, piece activity, king safety, weaknesses and coordination are several factors that should be incorporated into our minds.   Over the years, the KID has grown on me. I have grown to respect the Black side so much more and appreciate that chess is a hard game to understand. I can thank the KID for teaching me humility in my evaluating skills. }
4... d6
{ Black usually plays d6 to establish space in the center with either c5 or e5. Here is the main parting of the ways. When I was growing up, much of the appeal of playing against the KID laid in playing what was fashionable. Over a decade ago, the most topical variation, across all playing levels was the Classical variation, which is the main reason why I wrote this course. Most, if not all of my experience in the KID orbits the various structures you get in the Classical. }
5. Nf3
{ The most natural move, developing the knight out to an active square. White has tried many moves instead of Nf3. For simplicity sake, I will only show why the Makogonov has its benefits versus what I will show here. }
5... O-O
{ Castling and getting to safety. Over the years, I've mostly played Be2 since it develops a piece and leaves White one move away from castling. What move could be more natural than it ? }
6. Be2
{ The focus of our course will revolve around the Makogonov   6.h3  , but the goal is show my struggles with the Classical instead.   6.h3  The Makogonov variation. }
6... e5
{ The mainline of the classical variation. Every player I have ever talked with has, at some point, played either side of this position. I've tried all 4 of the main moves in this position and have a few personal thoughts that are not factual, but are experience based opinions. }
7. O-O
{ The main move by far. White has also tried the Petrosian, Gligoric and Exchange variations. The latter is by far the least enterprising and I encourage the reader to read the notes I've made regarding the alternatives  (to O-O)  for white.   7.dxe5  dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Bg5  The mainline of the exchange variation. My impression of this position is that it is very easy to be worse, not because the variation is bad, but because you have to be unambitious to play this variation in the first place. My playing philosophy has always been to play for a win or at least play ambitiously in my games. If I was to play the exchange variation, I've always felt that Black would be already better since they have already equalized. The point of playing the White pieces should be not to make a draw or get a drawish position early on. This variation is the antithesis of fighting chess.   7.Be3 !?  I used to play the White side of this position with interesting results. White delays castling in hopes of playing a waiting game with Black. The waiting game entails that White sees where Black commits their minor pieces. By waiting to see where Black commits their pieces, White will thereby choose which side to castle. The Makogonov has this same exact trait, but keeps more life in the position than the Gligoric, in my opinion.  7...exd4  Is a simple line that looks better for White, but in my experience, it is difficult to prove better for White.  8.Nxd4  Re8  9.f3  c6  10.Bf2  d5  11.exd5  cxd5  Is a topical subvariation of the Gligoric variation. On principle alone, I think Black is doing well. Black has no noticeable weaknesses, doesn't lack space, and is a couple of moves from completing development. Even though the database shows that White is scoring a nice 58% clip, my view is that Black has accomplished everything they wanted out of the opening. White even has played the weakening f3 move which can not be something White appreciates in the long run. Hence, I stopped playing the variation in favor of the classical variation.   7.d5  The Petrosian system is the most interesting of the sidelines and resembles the Makogonov variation in a few ways. Essentially, you are replacing h3  (Makogonov)  with Be2  (Classical variation)  instead. On a superficial level, it doesn't look like h3 is useful at all. A casual chess player will reasonably ask: why would you forgo a useful developing move like Be2, in favor of h3 ? Well, there's a few reasons: often by playing Be2, you are limiting yourself to plans involving castling kingside, whereas in the Makogonov you are flexible always in the side you castle.  7...a5  8.Bg5  One of the mainlines of the Makogonov proceeds like this as well.  8...h6  And unfortunately now we come to realize why h3 is arguably a more useful move than Be2. In this position, White is encouraged to play Bh4 to avoid placing the bishop on e3  (where it gets hit with tempo after Ng4)  , on d2  (where it downright looks ugly on)  , or on c1  (which shows that Bg5 was ultimately waste of a tempo)  .  9.Bh4  Na6  10.Nd2  Qe8  Is a far different type of position than the Makogonov . I can't say I'm all too familiar with this position type, so my default belief has always been this is a complex position with chances for both sides. When compared with the Makogonov, you'll learn to appreciate that this setup allows Black far more counterplay on the kingside since Black is likely to play the typical pawn advances  (f5, g5 & h5)  here. }
7... Nc6
{ The mainline and leads to the Mar Del Plata variation. My beef with this position for White is that, at some point in this line, the game isn't about maneuvering, positional understanding or outplaying the opponent. The position types become one of pure calculation.   I'll be frank: I'm not great at calculating in my games. Much of my strength, as a player, is in my strategic play and positional play. The entire Mar Del Plata variation stands in opposition to what kind of player I am, at this time. Hence, I have abandoned playing the White side. One might ask, why were you playing the Mar Del Plata a lot in the first place then ?   The answer is straightforward: I played it because it was cool looking and popular among the community of chess players I grew up spending time with. If you wanted to have fun, you would play the Mar Del Plata. Often, when I talk to friends of mine, they refer to this position as the King's Indian. It's as if there was nothing else worth exploring for White in the King's Indian other than this variation. Why was that, you might ask ? Well, it's because, in my youth, young players were attracted to sharp attacking play. It is difficult and boring to be nuanced in chess. It all boiled down to one word in my social circle: Attack. }
8. d5
{ Closing the center and the only move I've ever played in this position. }
8... Ne7
{ Retreating the knight and other squares make less sense. I've tried mostly two moves in this position in my career, both of which haven't netted me great results. My main issue with both, the Bayonet variation   9.b4  and the traditional Mar Del Plata mainline   9.Ne1  , is that the variations have very little margin for error. It could be that I'm not well-prepared for these variations, but my view stands that these moves don't suit my play well. Yes, 9. Nd2 is also a fine choice, but this is besides the point. }
9. Ne1
{ White prepares to play Be3-f3 to maintain a clean pawn chain.   9.b4  The Bayonet variation.  9...Ne8  10.c5  f5  Would often lead to sharp positions where I would be uncomfortable playing White  (king safety)  . Black will send a pawn roller through quickly on the kingside and White places all of their bets on the kingside. Objectively, White is doing well, maybe even winning, but the objective evaluation doesn't mean much to me because I am not an engine. The margin of error is so little in many of these variations that I feel that this is not so much about playing a game of chess, more so a battle of hoping your head doesn't get chopped off in 10 moves. }
9... Nd7 { Black retreats their knight to prepare f5. } 10. Be3
{ In recent years, I'd seen Nd3 being played more. This is just the move that everyone influential in my upbringing played.   10.Nd3  f5  11.Bd2  With positions I am not familiar with. }
10... f5 11. f3 f4 12. Bf2 g5
{ Leads to sharp, attacking play on opposite sides of the board. While White might be winning objectively, it is a tough position to navigate through and figure out. The practical component matters more than the objective evaluation in chess. The Makogonov is far less risky, in my opinion, than this line.   One might ask, so why settle on the Makogonov instead of other White variations like the Saemisch or Averbakh variations ? The answer can be found in the themes I will showcase in this course that are unique to the Makogonov.   Truth be told, I genuinely like playing the White side of the Makogonov and feel that my knowledge is strong enough for me to like playing against the KID. Also, I've never played the Saemisch and Averbakh variations in serious games, so I can not speak on the viability and strengths of each, in detail. }

{ This course centers on a universal setup vs the KID. This means that you can play it with 1.d4, 1.c4 & 1.Nf3. Therefore, the h3 move seen in this course is always played after white has played d4, c4, and Nf3.  
The King's Indian defense can arise via many different move orders. It can arise from the English & Reti openings. For simplicity sake, in this study, I chose 1. d4 as the default move and all subsequent variations in this study will begin with d4. }
1. d4
{ White chooses d4 on their first move to take part in the center.   1.Nf3  The Reti opening move order.  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.e4  d6  5.d4  O-O  6.h3   1.c4  The English opening move order.  Nf6  2.Nc3  g6  3.e4  d6  4.d4  Bg7  5.Nf3  O-O  6.h3 }
1... Nf6
{ Black develops their knight to the f6 square to gain some presence in the center. }
2. c4 { White grabs a bit more space in the center with pushing his c-pawn. }
2... g6
{ This is move that signals your opponent might play the King's Indian. Watch out!   2...e6  Black can play the Nimzo-Indian and Queen's Gambit Declined variation with  e6.  These openings are out of the scope of this course }
3. Nc3
{ White grabs a bit more space in the center. The knight on c3 controls the key e4 & d5 squares. }
3... Bg7
{ Black commits to fianchettoing their bishop and prepares to castle thereby ensuring their king's safety. The Grunfeld opening, 3..d5, is a viable opening that is outside the scope of this course. }
4. e4
{ White gains even more space in the center with the e-pawn advance. The knight on c3 does a good job of supporting e4. }
4... d6
{ Black aims to control e5 by playing d6.   4...O-O  Black can also castle here of course. e5 isn't really helping White's position, so there's nothing inherently wrong with castling immediately.  5.e5 ?!  Ne8  White hasn't gained anything here as d6 will chip away at our center. }
5. Nf3
{ White develops a knight to gain a firmer control over the center. You can argue that the Averbakh and the Saemisch variations are good in their own right, but I prefer the text move. }
5... O-O { Black gets their king to safety and can decide on the setup. } 6. h3
{ The Makogonov variation of the King's Indian is what I advocate in this course. I will explain my reasoning on why I avoided the Classical variation, 6. Be2, another time.   6.Be2 }

{ There are 6 pawn structures that comprise most of this course. This is the least interesting and dynamic of the bunch.   The e5 square is taken away from Black to use potentially for any of their pieces and certainly, the g7 bishop does not appreciate staring at a wall on e5. As a result, what you'll often see Black players do is to chip away at the center  (most notably the d5 pawn)  with moves like c6 & e6 in order to make sense of the pawn structure. }

{ Our fourth pawn structure is exclusive to the Makagonov variation within Chapters 9, 10 & 11 of the course.  Black often likes to play the f5 pawn break, so White often plays pawns to e4 & g4 to deter it. Also, expect that Black will utilize the c5 square for a knight to help bolster the queenside. Lastly, White can think about advancing further on the kingside in many variations with h4-h5 to further poke and prod at Black's structure. }

Black has options to advance e4 and f4 at any moment. White should be prepared to blockade if black plays e4. e3 & f4 would be weakened then and a dark-squared blockade is advisable on e3 & f4.  Vice-versa if black plays f4 where e4 & f3 would be weakened. Thereby, a light-squared blockade is advisable on e4 & f3. }

{ Often, you'll have a position like this one. White has good central control with the closed center  (pawns on c4, d5, e4)  . Take notice that we haven't committed to castling kingside yet. Often, we will delay castling on either flank to see what Black wants to commit to in their position. }
1. g4
{ White gains space on the kingside and gains a solid grip on the f5 square. Since f5 is a move Black highly desires in the King's Indian, the Makaganov is a good option in deterring f5. You should remember that g4 will be a commonplace move in the Makogonov and that it is natural to play since White has already played the move h3. }

{ I won't lie: it can be hard to decide where to castle in the Makaganov. In some variations, it's useful to castle Queenside, In others, kingside is better. The harsh reality of this opening is that practice and intuition help greatly in deciding where your king should go. The current position is white to play, but which side should we castle on ? }
1. O-O-O
{ Many good players prefer the queenside in this position. Queenside castling here is preferred because our pieces are better equipped to support a kingside pawn advance with our king on the queenside.   15.O-O ?  f4 !

{ White attacks the g7 bishop and will take it if given the chance. The g7 bishop is the most important piece in Black's position. Often, it's a good idea to get rid of it as it is a great defender and attacker for Black. }

{ Black avoids the trade of course, but now since the g-file line is exposed, it only makes sense now to try and open it up. }

{ In this section, I would like to expand on something I view as problematic for White to handle, generally.   Whenever White opts for setups involving long castles, I've often wondered: why Black doesn't often go for queenside play? For example, why doesn't Black angle for a6-b5, which is a relative of the Benko-gambit after White has castled ?   To be frank, I don't think there is a particular reason why Black doesn't go a6-b5: it's just the position is rarely played among players and whenever Black gets to this position, they usually opt for whatever the engine tells them to play. Rest assured, what I'm about to suggest is heavily disliked by the engine, but visually looks ugly for White to play. }
14... e4
{ As we will see in Chapter 13, Bd7 is the mainline move of the Qe8 variation. One wonders though, is Bd7 forced there? Of course it's not ! Black has many different ways of playing and I went with the most played move in my database  (Bd7 was the most common)  to fill in that gap. The model games, one would hope, would explain everything necessary, but they do miss some details like this section will illustrate.   14...Bd7  15.Bxc5  Was previously discussed. }
15. Ng2
{ Against e4, a space gaining move that aims to open the a1-h8 diagonal, I think it makes sense to reroute the knight as soon as possible. I offer O-O-O as an alternative, but it all transposes, I suppose.   15.O-O-O  Getting to 'safety'  15...a6  And this is generally my issue with this section: Black will play b5 next move and what's White's idea against it ? To grab it, willingly open the queenside and make a3 & b2 tender ? I think what White is best off doing is make all necessary waiting moves before castling queenside. O-O-O is Black's signal to play b4 anyways, so why not prepare a bit for it ?   15...b5 !?  Is also an interesting sacrifice.  16.Nxb5  My computer says this line is entirely junk for Black, but if one bothers to look a bit further, you can't help, but feel that Black has interesting compensation. For example, after:  16...Rb8  When my engine gives the cringey b4 move, opening the queenside.  17.b4  Which I view as inherently risky given the queenside is opening up !   17.Nxc7  Qe7  18.Nb5  Bd7  =∞  I would think Black has very decent Benko-gambit like compensation by sacrificing the entire queenside.  17...Nd3+  18.Bxd3  exd3  19.Qxd3  a5  Makes feel uncomfortable to play for White, despite the computer claiming White is totally winning. }
15... Nfd7
{ 15...a6  Black could start with a6 now, but since White has not committed to castling queenside, I would think this would encourage White to kingside castle  (as we will see through Chapter 15)  .  16.Nf4  b5 only makes sense in view of long castles: what if White doesn't long castles here ?   16.O-O-O  b5  →  16...Nfd7  17.Kf1 !?  I think this is an interesting try for White.   17.O-O  Ne5  Is discussed thoroughly in Chapter 15. A quick summary of this setup for White: the queen is poorly placed on c2 and the light squares on f3 and d3 are sensitive.  17...Ne5  18.Kg2  ±  This is an interesting idea for White to play. White simply castles by hand and formulates a plan afterwards. }
16. Nf4 { White secures the kingside. } 16... Ne5
{ and here, I would highly recommend playing the sane Kf1-Kg2 instead of long castles. If you're up for a challenge, then by all means long castles. }
17. O-O-O
{ White finally castles since all of the regular waiting moves have been exhuasted.   17.Kf1  +=  Followed by Kg2, as previously mentioned, looks safer to my eye. }
17... a6
{ Prepares b5.   17...b5  18.Nxb5  Rb8  19.b4  Ncd3+  20.Nxd3  exd3  21.Bxd3  Bd7  22.Nxc7  Qf7  +-  The queenside feels airy, in my opinion, but the engine thinks this is straight up winning for White. A sharp, messy fight certainly lays ahead. }
18. Kb1
{ 18.g4  White could try to ignore all of the queenside play, but it's hard to.  18...b5  c4 hangs and it's hard to figure out a reliable move.  19.Nh5  bxc4  20.Kb1  ∓  Is given by my engine here, but frankly speak, this looks grim with the open b-file and monster knight landing on d3 soon. }
18... b5 19. cxb5 axb5 20. Nxb5
{ Looks like the Benko-gambit and Black should have very reasonable position compensation. I won't lie: this position looks like it should be tough for White to play in the long run. Be wary of grabbing too much material on the queenside here. I offer one reasonable sample line for both sides to play.   20.Bxb5 ?  Bd7  Would already feel awkward for White as Bxd7 weakens d3 enormously. Why else would you play Bxb5 and then avoid trades afterwards ?   20.Bxc5  dxc5  21.Nxb5  ±  Transposes to the mainline. }
20... Rb8 { Avoiding Nxc7 winning the exchange. } 21. Bxc5
{ I think it's reasonable to chop and hope the position holds.   21.Nxc7  Would only give time for Black to organize his pieces.  21...Qf7  22.Nb5  Ned3  →  and the b-file already is feeling serious heat. }
21... dxc5 22. Qxc5
{ Look, maybe this position is completely winning like the engine claims, but I've got my doubts that this is AT ALL easy to play for White. The weakened queenside and monster bishop on g7 should give Black very reasonable play.   Finally, I think this is a good place to stop. There are so many ways for both sides to deviate that I don't think we're going to get much from this position from now. Just remember: when you castle queenside, you are bound to subject yourself to a queenside assault if Black wants to sacrifice the kitchen sink. }

{ White prepares b3/b4 and anticipates any queenside shenanigans. The real question is why did White forgo queenside castling ? Isn't that the safest place for the king ?   13.O-O-O ?  The natural long castles already gets punished hard by  13...a3  14.b3  Qa5  ∓  When White has no pleasant response. Bxc5 is relatively best, but would leave White strategically busted on the dark squares.   13.O-O  White could reasonably castle kingside here as well.  13...Ne8  Angling for f5.  14.Qg3  f5  15.gxf5  gxf5  16.exf5  Bxf5  17.b4  +=  is a reasonable line for both sides that should leave White slightly better  (more space)  . }

2. cxd5
{ Capturing back with the c-pawn to keep the pawn structure symmetrical and clean. }
2... Rb8
{ Black prepares b5 and wants to gain some space on the queenside. There are many different alternatives and all of them are reasonable. I offer Ne8   14...Ne8  Ne8 has the motive to advance f5.  15.h4  Without having castled, White reasonably advances on the kingside.  15...f5  16.gxf5  gxf5  17.h5  ±  Would leave White preferable. Both sides are flexible on the flanks they will play on and a tough struggle with ensuse with chances for both sides. }
3. b4 { White advances, likewise. } 3... axb3
{ It doesn't make sense for Black to not en passant. } 4. Nxb3
{ axb3 was reasonable as well. I like knight takes more because there's definite chances to pressure the b-pawn in the long run and our a-pawn isn't so easily targeted.   16.axb3  ∞  With a tough fight ahead. }
4... b6
{ 16...Na4  Black has many options, but offers for a simple trade.  17.Nxa4  Bxa4  18.O-O  Should leave White slightly better with the weak b-pawn and two active bishops point towards the queenside. It's debatable how large White's advantage really is.   16...Nxb3  17.Rxb3  +=  Should leave White slightly better with the weak b-pawn as a target in the long run and control over the kingside for now. }
5. Nxc5 { White could also kingside castle here as well. } 5... bxc5 6. Rxb8
Qxb8 7. O-O
{ The a-pawn is dangerous and the kingside is, for now, under control. I think White is easier to play, but that is debatable. }

11. Be2
{ White's idea with Be2 is to immediately push & support h4-h5-g5. That's pretty straightforward and caveman-like right ? However, there's one particular continuation, by Black, that disuades me from liking this line.   11.Qf3  What we discussed previously.  11...Bd7  12.Be2  a4  13.O-O  Ne8  14.Qg2 !?  A very reasonable move to keep in mind, in view of f5-f4. Perhaps this is why the Queen on g2 is sometimes preferable to the queen on g3.   14.Qg3  The queen on g2 may be better because f5-f4 doesn't hit as hard.  14...f5  15.gxf5  gxf5  How does White deal with f5-f4 other than with exf5 ?  16.exf5  Bxf5  The same position types with the queen on d1 make the White king feel more airy, in my opinion.  14...f5  Aggressive as always.  15.gxf5  gxf5  16.Kh2  ±  With rather quick play on the g-file & good central control. Notice that Black's f4 is met by Bxc5 and is good for White. Hence why Qg2 may be better than Qg3 sometimes.   16.Kh1  The same ideas apply. It's debatable whether Kh2 or Kh1 is better. }
11... a4 { Just like in the previous line, Black grabs space. } 12. g5
{ The most played move and rather obvious since it stays consistent with kingside space grabbing. I cover many alternatives & their ideas below.   12.b4  Similar to g5, but resolves the queenside instead.  12...axb3  13.axb3  Rxa1  14.Qxa1  Na6  15.Qa3  c5  ∞  Has been played 10 times with rather mixed results. I'm not sure if White is better or not.   12.a3  Qa5  Has been played 11 times before in my database and the most played move here is the interesting side step maneuver:  13.Kf1 !?  Trying to castle by hand with Kg2.  13...Bd7   13...Ne8  Angling for f5.  14.h4  →  With a promising position, as after:  14...f5  15.h5 !  f4  16.Bxc5  Looks strategically dubious, but White has a clever way to keep the balance on the dark squares with:  16...dxc5  17.hxg6  hxg6  18.g5 !  ±  I believe White is much better, if not strategically winning here after Bg4. Black's dark-squared bishop is entirely useless here.  14.h4  cxd5  15.cxd5  b5  16.h5  ±  Has been played with pretty good results. Honestly, I'd rather have the same type of position with the Queen on f3, rather than on d1: Wouldn't you ? I feel as if when the Queen is on f3, it can be utilized better on the kingside than standing pat on d1. Perhaps this is a minor detail worth ignoring, but I've grown accustomed to developing the queen out early in situations like this one.   12.O-O  A move suggested by my engine here, but honestly, I'm hesitant to play this because of:  12...Ne8  when f5 comes   12.Bxc5  I do not like this from a strategic point of view.  12...dxc5  13.Nxa4  Bh6  I think is more consistent from a principled point of view.   13...b5 !?  The space grab is an interesting idea.  14.Nxc5 ?  bxc4  15.dxc6  Qa5  →  I would think Black is completely lost after Rd8, Bh6. It's very hard to play this position for White.  14.Nxc5  Qe7  15.Ncb3  Bf4  =∞  With great dark squared control.   12.Kf1 !?  Is similar to lines shown previously. }
12... Nfd7 { Black will thrust f5 ASAP. } 13. h4
{ White proceeds in caveman like fashion. } 13... Qa5 { a3 is the threat. } 14.
a3
{ White has to prevent it.   14.Rb1  f5  Only limits White's options even further because of the rook being committed to b1 without White having castled yet. Yes, believe it or not, maybe White could have considered, at some point castling queenside, despite it looking dangerous. As a result, my argument is that Rb1 is inflexible as a move here. }
14... f5 { What else ? } 15. f3
{ This move keeps the structure intact, but makes me feel queezy about the kingside. White's king will hardly have any pawn shelter given all of the kingside pawns have been and the queenside is well in Black's control. This position is not to my taste and I conclude this section by asking the reader to reflect on this section after completing Chapter 10. Does this section make sense in view of that chapter?   15.h5  f4  16.Bxc5  Nxc5  ∓  Looks great for Black, in view of weak queenside and strong knight. }

{ One question the reader might be interested in, is knowing why did I not recommend, in Chapter 10 & 11, 8. Bg5 ? Why choose 8. Be3 over 8. Bg5 ? Isn't the bishop more annoying on g5 for Black to deal with ? Well, everything is not so simple. One thing to consider is that, on g5, the bishop will interfere with a kingside pawn advance whenever White plays g4-h4. The g5 bishop will inevitably have to move again and thereby White will have lost a tempo. This is well-shown in the following line: }
8. Bg5
{ 8.g4  Na6  9.Be3  Nd7  A possibility not available in the 8. Bg5 lines. The knight is pinned. }
8... Na6
{ 8...Qe8  9.g4  Nfd7  10.a3  Nc5  11.Nd2  a4  12.Rg1  Is similar to the lines we will see later in the chapter. }
9. g4
{ So far, both sides have played standard moves for this chapter. Compared to the 8. Be3 variation, it looks like White is avoiding a lot of hassle pinning the knight on f6. It prevents any Nfd7 related ideas and encourages Black to play h6, a weakening move. Despite all of this, I believe Black has a strong response to play around White's concept. }
9... Qe8
{ I think this is one point White inevitably can not escape: the bishop on g5 does nothing if Black side steps it with Qe8. In fact, it only stands in the way of the kingside pawns from advancing. White would like to play g5-h4-h5, but the bishop is in the way.   9...Nc5  10.Nd2  c6  11.Qf3  Is what White has been arguing in favor of the Bg5 line. Now f6 is under intense pressure. Black can't avoid, but to play h6 eventually if they want to play with Qb6. Black could play Qb6 to break the pin  (b2 hangs)  , but it would lead to a nice position for White after:  11...Qb6 ?!  12.Rb1  Nfd7  13.h4  Yes, this position is great for White, but one wonders: Wouldn't it have been nicer if the bishop was on e3 ? It would make it far easier to advance the kingside pawns if it wasn't in the way. Hence, I favor 8. Be3 for reasons like this. }
10. Nd2 Nd7
{ Is a comparable position to the 8. g4 Na6 9. g4 Nd7 variation that we will look at in depth. I believe the bishop will eventually have to drop back from g5 to e3 and serves no point. White can argue that the queen being misplaced from d8 to e8 is an achievement. I'm unconvinced if White has really gained all that much from the insertion of these two moves. On the other hand, White already does have a knight on d2, which is a luxury that White never does in the 8. Be39..Nd7 lines. With the knight on d2, it is viable to play with b4 in the following example line. }
11. a3 Nb6
{ 11...Nac5 ?!  Not a good move. Perhaps Nb6, f5 or some other related move makes more sense.  12.b4  axb4  13.axb4  Rxa1  14.Qxa1  And usually Black would be able to play Nb3 here and reroute to d4. The knight on d2 serves a nice role in preventing this rerouting. }
12. h4 Nc5 13. h5
{ Is very comparable to lines we will look at. White will have to play Be3 soon in order to take more space on the kingside with g5-h6. Perhaps, this is worth exploring more, if you have spare time to investigate. }

{ This section is more or less devoted to discussing why I chose to expand on lines involving 10.Nh4 versus lines with 10.Ng5 and other related moves on move 8 and 10. All lines correspond with those in Chapters 12-15.  I don't think one informational variation will do this section justice, since there are numerous nuances to the position on moves 8 & 10. What I can say though, is that I liked that Nh4 was easy to remember in terms of planning.  What you will often see in the remaining chapters is the theme of the h4 knight being re-routed to g2 or being an enabler of Black's weak light-squares on f5, g6 & h7.  Meanwhile, let's contrast the Nh4 line vs the Ng5 line outline here. Black has two playable moves, Nf6 and Qe8. I'll do my best to cover each as reasonably as I can.   10.Nh4  The prescribed move I offer throughout the remaining chapters. I won't lie: some of the reason why I advocate for 10. Nh4 is because of how well it scores for White, on the whole, vs other moves. I know this can be a misrepresentative statistic, but 10. Nh4  (64 games)  scores about 10% more in total wins than 10. Ng5  (67 games)  . That turned me off from the line a bit and perhaps I should give 10. Ng5 a fair, honest analysis in the future. Looking at the database scores should only be one of many factors that are taken into consideration.  10...Nf6   10...Nf4  This line was rather unintuitive to remember when I first studied it, but White has interesting choices at his disposal that can lead to quick wins especially with 11. gxf4 Qxh4 12. fxe5 besides the mainline  (offered as an alternative in Chapter 14)  .  11.Bd2  The mainline. I give 11. gxf4 as a viable, interesting line White should consider.   10...Qe8  11.Be2  Nf6  12.Qc2  Is one of the most theoretical lines in this course. What appealed to me was the logical nature of White's play: the goal is to castle queenside in this setup and White will play Be3 followed by long castles, if given the chance.  11.Bd3  e4  12.Be2  Is one line where I could easily remember because it's obvious White will play Ng2-Nf4 soon and thereby play on the weakened dark squares. }

I find Nf6 to be more natural, but the former isn't to be underestimated.   10...Qe8  11.Be2  Not the only move White has against Qe8, but let's stick to it for now.  11...Nf6  I have not taken a deep look at this position. White seems to have mainly played Be3 & g4. To my eye, Be3 looks more sound in nature, but 12. g4 is more consistent with 10..Nf6 11. g4 for ease of memorization.  12.g4   12.Be3  The most played move. We will follow what's typically played here, but the line I provide does not paint the entire story of this line.  12...Na6  13.Qd2  Nc5  14.O-O-O  h6  15.Bxc5   15.Nf3  Nfe4  16.Nxe4  Nxe4  17.Qc2  c6  ∞  Is how this line generally proceeds, with sharp, opposite sided attacking positions ahead.  15...hxg5  16.Ba3  Qg6  ±  Is a wacky, but probably good variation for White to play.  12...Na6   12...h6  13.Ne6  Bxe6  14.dxe6  Qxe6  15.gxf5  Qxf5  ∞  Also isn't clear.  13.Rg1  ∞  Looks natural to my eye and should lead to sharp play. }
11. g4 Qe7
{ The most played move.   By now you must have realized the dirty work I have done to select lines. None of the work is very particularly clear and I more or less chose 10. Nh4 based off of 5 criteria:   1. Database scores   2. What is the probability for the reader to remember plans described?  3. What is the number of diverging branching moves?  4. How frequently branching moves are played versus one another, when comparing them?  5. How deep are the diverging branch moves?  Much of this methodology can be critiqued and I am open to criticism over my thought process. However, one thing that I urge the reader, if they have such criticisms, is to think about what they would have done differently from me, the author. What would you have done ? I feel that 10.Nh4 better meets those 5 criteria than does 10.Ng5, but I am open to being proved wrong. }
12. Qc2
{ The queen on c2 does a nice job at poking at the f5 pawn and poking h7.   12.gxf5  Bxf5  13.Be3  Na6  14.Rg1  ∞  Seems to have been played in a few games. This looks far more open, in nature, than any of the 10. Nh4 I advocate for. }
12... h6
{ 12...e4  13.gxf5  Bxf5  14.Be3  ±  has seen some play before. To my eye, it looks like White is doing pretty well here. }
13. Ne6
{ Brace yourselves for the rather lengthy, but somewhat forced continuation: }
13... Bxe6 14. dxe6 f4 15. h4 Nc6 16. g5 Nd4 17. Qg6
{ I have my doubts about this position being found over the board, and not being prepared beforehand at home. }
17... Qe8 18. Bd3 Qxg6 19. Bxg6 hxg5 20. hxg5 Nf3+ 21. Ke2 Nxg5 22. e7 Rf7 23.
Bxf7+ Kxf7 24. Bd2
{ Has been played in a few games and I must say: this position doesn't look clear to me at all. e7 will drop soon and Black will have a knight a couple of pawns for the exchange. This line looks heavily reliant on memorization and when compared to 10. Nh4, the lines I have chosen will be less theoretical and more oriented towards planning. This is not to say 10. Ng5 doesn't involve planning, but I feel that 10. Nh4 and its plans are easy to remember. }

{ This section will cover all Nh2 related ideas and when they are feasible to play. All lines correspond with those in Chapters 12-15.  Let's follow a logical chain of questions attached with Nh2:   1. Why on earth would anyone want to play a weird move like Nh2 ?   Answer: The main reason why they would would to be to combat the knight on h5.   2. So why not move the knight to other squares like d2, g5, or g1 ? Why h2 in particular ? It looks weird there.  On d2: The knight would block the dark-squared bishop.   On g5: The knight would get kicked very quickly by h6. Ng5 is generally advised when the h5 knight is undefended or e6 is weak because of some f5 related move.   On g1: The knight has less utility than on h2 and the knight probably will go back to f3 anyways.   On h2: has options of going to g4 down the line, as we will see in some lines. }
8. g3
{ The mainline I recommend, but Nh2 is the other mainline. It's not related to the Nh2 setups we will see on the next move, but there are some some related ideas. Here is the parting of the ways. Black has tried several logical moves in this position: f5, Na6, Qe8, a5, c6, Qe7, c5. Against which moves has White tried Nh2 against and can we derive a logical reason for why that is ? The answer for Nh2 is good versus some moves, rather than others will be mentioned on the next move.   8.Nh2  A strange move upon first glance.  8...Qe8 !?  As we will see in 8. g3 related lines involving Nh2, the queen surprisingly does a good job in deterring White from playing Nh2. I'll explain more about this in detail later.  9.Be2  Nf4  10.Bf3  f5  11.g3  Nxh3  12.Bg2  fxe4  13.Be3  Na6  14.Nxe4  ∞  I would further look at the database for explaining why White players like this line. }
8... Qe7
{ 8...f5  9.Nh2 ?  Nf6  What has White accomplished with the knight on h2 ? Nothing is the point. The point of Nh2 is to deter Black from playing f5. It's meant to be used against 8th moves that don't support the criteria mentioned above. Try to see if the repetitive comments I've ascribed to other 9th move alternatives here make sense to you.   8...Na6  This and Nd7 are special exceptions to the rule we've laid out about Nh2 because of Black's idea to land immediate pressure on e4.  9.Nh2  Nc5  and White is advised not to go Be2 here because of Nf6 and it is awkward to defend e4.   8...Qe8  9.Nh2 ?  f5  Now we can see that f5 exf5 gxf5 is okay for black here because of the knight being defended on h5 via the queen on e8.   8...a5  9.Nh2  Now we see that f5 is no good because h5 being loose. White will follow up with Be2 with a good position.   8...c6  9.Nh2  Now we see that f5 is no good because h5 being loose. White will follow up with Be2 with a good position.   8...c5  9.Nh2  Now we see that f5 is no good because h5 being loose.Now we see that f5 is no good because h5 being loose. White will follow up with Be2 with a good position.   8...Nd7  See note about 8..Na6.  9.Nh2  Nc5  and White is advised not to go Be2 here because of Nf6 and it is awkward to defend e4. }
9. Nh2
{ Now we see that f5 is no good because h5 being loose. White will follow up with exf5 gxf5 Be2 forcing a concession by Black to good effect. I hope this was helpful to know and be aware of, moving forward. Note: I cover this 8..Qe7 line very much in depth, in the game:    Tomashevsky, E. - Grischuk, A., 1/2-1/2, KM FIDE GP 2015 }

{ This section is devoted to discussing when can White manage to play Qd2 versus Qc2. All lines correspond with those in Chapters 12-15 here.  Chapters 12 & 13 heavily rely on White placing the queen on either square, at some point, and my goal here is to explain when you should play it to either square. The answer, in short, is intertwined with whether the c1 bishop can go to e3 early enough. Obviously, if White plays Qd2 right now, the c1 bishop will be blocked in by the d2 queen. What you'll see in the remaining chapters is White's struggle to figure out where to place the bishop. }
8... f5
{ The mainline, which we will cover in the last 3 chapters. Against both a5 & Nc5  (sidelines)  , White has the opportunity to play Be3 and must think carefully whether Qd2 is a good follow up or not. If you're an attention to detail reader, I highly encourage you to understand the nuances of whether Black should play an early f5 or not. Does Black really gain anything by delaying f5 ? I will do my best to explain it below, but it might be a bit messy to navigate through.   8...Na6  9.Be3  f5   9...Qe8  Note that Black can never play Qe7 here because the knight on h5 requires attention after f5. Hence, why Qe8 is preferred.  10.Be2  f5  11.exf5  gxf5  12.Nh4  Nf6  13.Qd2  Looks very similar to lines that we've seen before, but now that the bishop is on e2, the f4 strike looks far less potent.  13...f4  14.gxf4  exf4  15.Bd4  ±  The queen is far less ideally placed on e8 and the knight  (being committed to a6 and not on b8)  makes it so that after, if Black chooses to play, c5 dxc6, Black can not recapture with Nxc6. It's important to notice that the queen not being on the d8-h4 diagonal makes it so that previous discoveries  (Qd8 on Nh4)  are now not possible. Moves like Ne4 aren't making sense to play.  10.exf5  gxf5  11.Nh4  Nf6  In Chapter 12, I recommend that White should play Bd3 and transpose to Chapter 15 structures.  12.Bd3  e4 here enters Chapter 15 structures, while f4 enters messy waters I expand on in depth in Chapter 12.   12.Qd2  f4  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Bd4  Looks far less potent  (for Black)  because the knight is on a6.  14...c5  15.dxc6  ±  Would normally be nice to play for Black, but since the knight is on a6 and not b8, Black can not play Nxc6 at any point here.  12...f4  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Bd4  ⇆  With an extremely sharp, tense fight ahead. I cover this in depth in the Alonso Rossell vs Pablo Marin game.   8...a5  9.Be3  The move I recommend in this chapter. By placing the dark-squared bishop on its best post, White keeps d2 square open for both the knight  (on f3)  and queen to go onto it.  9...f5   9...Na6  10.Nd2  ±  Is a very favorable version of lines we had see in Chapters 9, 10 & 11.  10.exf5  gxf5  As we will see, this is a luxurious version of lines in the last chapter. With the insertion of the bishop on e3 and pawn on a5, White has gained a useful tempo by comparison.  11.Nh4  The move I generally prescribe against the e5-f5 pawn duo.  11...Nf6   11...Nf4  12.Qd2  The queen is well-posted here because the bishop is already posted on e3 and Black does not have time to harass the battery with f4 business here.  12.Bd3  It's very important to understand why Qd2 is frowned upon here.   12.Qd2  f4 !  White should feel apprehensive about dealing with the f4 pawn break whenever the Qd2-Be3 battery is set.  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Bd4   14.Bxf4 ??  Ne4  15.Nxe4  Qxh4  -+  and White loses a piece.  14...c5  15.dxc6  Qe7+  Seems to be one argument against White's Qd2-Be3 setup. White probably has to play Qe2 and trade queens. Obviously, when you plan to castle queenside, this isn't what you intend.  16.Qe2   16.Be2 ?  Nxc6  and White is left struggling castle queenside because:  17.O-O-O ?!  Ne4  18.Nxe4  Nxd4  -+  Is obviously nice for Black.  16...Qxe2+  17.Bxe2  Nxc6 = }
9. exf5
{ Realistically, White's only move.   9.Be3 ?  f4  10.gxf4  Nxf4  ∓  Looks bad for White on the f-file }
9... gxf5 10. Nh4
{ Note that Be3, instead, here makes no sense because Black is prime to play f4 and destroy the kingside.   10.Be3  Qe8  Qd2 f4 loses right away, so White has to block the e-file.  11.Be2  f4  12.gxf4  Nxf4  ∞  Looks like a non-standard position for White, to my eye. Maybe it's good for White ?   12...exf4 ?  13.Bd4  →  Closing the position on f4 with exf4 was a poor decision on Black's end. Rg1-Qd2 and long castles are White's next 3 developing moves. }
10... Nf6
{ 10...Nf4  In Chapter 14, I recommend that White is best off playing Bd2-Qc2 and not Be3-Qd2 because Black has sacrificial ideas with f4.  11.Be3 ?!   11.Bd2  The mainline of Chapter 14.  11...Ng6  12.Nxg6  hxg6  13.Qd2  f4  ∞   10...Qe8  11.Be2  Nf6  12.Qc2  Given the queen's placement on e8, you can imagine my trepedation if White plays Be3.   12.Be3  f4  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Bd4  c5  15.dxc6  Nxc6  ∞  Is similar to lines we had seen previously, but this clearly a favorable version for Black with the knight not being on a6.  12...Na6  13.a3  And so on and so forth, White will get in Bd2/Be3 and castle queenside. }
11. Bd3
{ The mainline of Chapter 15.   11.Be3  One might ask, why not Be3 ?  11...f4  When taking on f4 looks like you're waving a red flag in front of a bull.  12.gxf4 ?  exf4  13.Bd4  c5  14.dxc6  Nxc6  ∓  Is an even more favorable version of positions we had previously seen, for Black. }
11... e4 12. Be2
{ And so on and so forth, the line goes on in Chapter 15. White usually places the queen on d2 here, after many prepatory moves. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. h3
{ This variation section is mostly focused on figuring out how we should develop our light-squared bishop on f1: where should it go ? Long story short, it depends on Black's setup. Sometimes it goes to e2, sometimes d3, and sometimes it even goes to g2. I will try to write a general guide below:   1. If Black plays an early e5, then the bishop belongs:      a.  On e2 if Black opts for non-Nh5 setups      b.  On either e2, d3 or g2 if Black plays Nh5 setups   2. If Black plays an early c5, then the bishop belongs on d3 most of the time   3. If Black does not commit in the center and waits, you wait to commit by making a useful waiting/developing move. It is often unhelpful to commit your f1 bishop to developing anywhere.   Please also be wary that the Bd3-Bc2 maneuver is generally frowned upon in the opening because the bishop will often find its role limited on c2. }
6... Na6
{ This is not the only waiting move Black has, but I think it is the best one. White has a really difficult time deciding how to develop both bishops  (particularly the f1 bishop)  , as we will see later on in the course.   6...e5  Black's objective is completely close off the center & split the board in two.  7.d5  The center will not be mobile after this move is played.  7...a5   7...Nh5  8.g3  f5  9.exf5  gxf5  10.Nh4  This position is the point of the last 3 chapters. White can choose to place the f1 bishop on d3, e2 and even g2 at many junctures in these chapters. The fact that you need to be flexible in your square choice means that you should not be dogmatic in your approach to this course.   6...c5  Black's objective to open the long diagonal for the g7 bishop.  7.d5  Grabbing space.  7...e6  8.Bd3  The bishop is well placed on d3 here because it prevents Black's Bf5. Please see the Benoni chapter for more information on this position. }
7. Be3
{ I think this is developing move makes the most sense in view of the course lines chosen. Be3 is ubiquitously played across all chapters, so why not here ?   7.Bg5  Clearly, a serious move worth considering.   7.Bd3 ?!  e5  Leaves White's position in a bit of confusion as after:  8.d5  Nc5  9.Bc2  a5  I'm left wondering what is the c2 bishop actually doing ? It is far more active on e2 since it can help control both sides of the board  (e2-g4 & e2-b5)  rather than bite on the e4 pawn.   7.Be2  While this is a natural move, it is inconsistent with what we are angling for since we are not able to play Qf3 with the bishop in the way.  7...e5  8.d5  Nc5  Leaves White having to have to defend e4 rather awkwardly.  9.Qc2  A move that I detest to play. This is why I prefer Be3 over Be2. If Be3 was played, then Nd2 wouldn't impede the path of the c1 bishop. }
7... c6
{ 7...c5  Another standard space gainer.  8.d5  e6  9.Bd3  exd5  10.exd5  Nb4  11.Be2  Bf5  12.Rc1  ∞  Leads to very forcing, complicated play.   7...Qe8  A very reasonable waiting move for Black to play. I think there's 2 consistent ways of playing this position for White without ending up in a goofy position: a3 & g4. Note that Be2 e5 d5 doesn't let us get our queen to f3. I recommend both ideas in the course whenever Black plays an extreme waiting game.  8.a3  Is the move I recommend in the course, but g4 deserves some attention.   8.g4  c5  9.Bg2 !  cxd4  10.Nxd4  ±  This looks likes it should be flat out better for white. It's a nice Hedgehog setup for White.  8...e5  9.d5  Nc5  10.Nd2  a5  11.g4   11.b4  Ncxe4 !?  12.Ncxe4  Nxe4  13.Nxe4  f5  14.Be2  axb4  15.axb4  Rxa1  16.Qxa1  fxe4  17.O-O  leaves White doing very well. Black lacks substantive counterplay.  17...Rf4 ?  Looks aggressive, but really White can ignore it with the queenside thrust  18.c5 !  And Black is left wondering what to do if White doesn't take the exchange.  11...a4  12.Qf3  Not the only move, but is consistent with what I prescribe in Chapter 10. }
8. a3 { We play the waiting game for as long Black wants to. } 8... Qe8
{ 8...e5  9.d5  Nc5  10.Nd2  Nfd7  11.g4  ±  Leaves White comfortably ahead.   8...d5  9.cxd5  cxd5  10.e5  Ne4  11.Rc1  ±  Leaves White comfortably better. }
9. b4
{ Both b4 & g4 make some great deal of sense here. White has no reason to commit anything in the center yet nor develop their light-squared bishop. Therefore, the answer to where White should develop the light-squared bishop is multi-faceted and comes after the central tension is resolved. Sometimes, g4-Bg2 is viable as a choice. Sometimes, Nd2-Qf3-Be2 is a good choice. Sometimes Bd3 directly is best. This is something you have to judge on your own and figure out, but I hope this guide helped a bit in this respect.   9.g4  ±  A reasonable alternative where White can develop the light-squared bishop to g2 or e2. }

The f-file waiting to used since the rooks are ready to fire, but it doesn't look like the rest of White's army does much.

{ Many times in Chapter 11, we will see that Black will have an open f-file for his rook to use. The f4 square is often a soft spot for White to handle and Black usually exploits it with the following idea. }
1... Rf4
{ A strong move that closes down the kingside. White should be extremely cautious about taking the rook since the dark squares along the a1-h8 diagonal would be open for the dragon-like g7 bishop. }
2. h6
{ It's important that White pushes the bishop back and then makes an intelligent decision if they should take the rook.   16.Bxf4 ?  exf4  17.Ncxe4  Nxe4  18.Nxe4  Qe7  19.Qe2  f3  ∞ →  Is a sharp & tough position to handle for White. }
2... Bf8 3. Qc2
{ In the game between Postny vs Kotronias, White played Qc2 to try and keep a stable center. Probably it was better to bite the bullet and grab on f4. With the bishop passively sitting on f8, it won't be a major factor White will have to worry about for a long time.   Postny, E. - Kotronias, V., 1-0, 4th Isthmia Open 2014   17.Bxf4  exf4  18.Ncxe4  Nxe4  19.Nxe4  Ne5  20.Qd4  ±  Would be a reasonable example line both sides could follow and White should be favored. }

{ Often, in the latter half of Chapter 11, we will get structures like this one where white has gained space in the center and kingside, while black is trying to generate queen play related to b5. Sure, white could play the position slowly with Be2, but they had a more aggressive & interesting move in mind. }
1. h4
{ An interesting pawn sacrifice that angles to use the h-file as compensation if taken. }
1... Qxh4
{ Black grabs h4 since white will play the standard h5, if given the chance.   13...cxd5  Both pawn recaptures are pretty decent for white.  14.cxd5  Keeping the kingside tidy.   14.exd5  Aims to keep black's kingside play at bay.  14...Nc5  15.Bg5  f6  16.Be3  f5  17.h5  ∞  Would lead to a messy position where both sides are boxing in the center of the ring and neither side has their guard up.  14...b5  15.h5  →  Is a standard type of position for Chapter 11. }
2. g5
{ Closing the kingside down a bit and trapping the queen on h5. We will cover this position more in Koshmak vs Haugen.    Koshmak, Iurii - Haugen, Arild, 1-0, CCO21/S4, 2016 }

{ This variation was derived from: Tomashevsky vs Hauge.  White has opened the g-file for the g1 rook and black has notoriously weak light squares on e6, f5 and h5. It shouldn't be surprising what white's next move is then, as a result. }
1. Ng5
{ A strong move that gives white flexibility in playing Ne6 or Nge4 if the e4/f5 pawn tension is resolved. }
1... h6 { Understandably, black wants to get rid of the knight. } 2. exf5
{ Ne6 already was much better for white surprisingly. White instead plays the solid exf5 to maintain good control over the center for a long term positional advantage.   16.Ne6  →  Bxe6  17.dxe6  Qxh4  18.exf5  Rxf5  =∞  When black's light squares are swiss cheese. }
2... Bxf5
{ Black dares not accept the poisoned knight.   16...hxg5  Would be risky, to say the least.  17.Qh5+  Kg8  When white has more than one good move  (Ne4, Rxg5, Bh3 are all reasonable moves)  .  18.Bh3  →  Would be a devilishly strong move since Bxf5 loses straight away to  18...Bxf5 ?   18...Be8  19.Qf3  +-  Is a powerful setup for white with Ne4 & hxg5 insight.  19...e4 ?  20.Nxe4 !

3. Qh5
{ Tomashevy opts to enter a much an eternally better queenless middlegame, but Ne6 & Nce4 weren't bad either with the same ideas as previously mentioned.   17.Nce4  ±   17.Ne6 !?  ± }

{ In this variation, we will explore a line, structure, and position type that is seen commonly in Chapters 12 through 15. The variation continuation follows a game I played vs a friend of mine, PushedPawn..   Black has a fluid pawn duo on e5 and f5, but if either pawn moves, then black will have numerous weaknesses in the aftermath. Let's see what happens if black plays the hyper-aggressive f4 }
1... f4
{ While totally understandable, black's light-squares are embarrassingly weak. Now is not the time to back down: white should take the bull by the horns and accept the challenge. }
2. Qxh5
{ Since f4 was played, the light-square complex is what white should about. The next few moves, while commital, are rather natural.   12.Bd2 ?  Qe8 !  13.Be2  Nf6 =  Leaves white with two anemic bishops and the position is quite uncomfortable. White seems to be okay though. }
2... fxe3 3. Bd3
{ Again, using the light-squares to full-effect and now h7 is under serious pressure. }
3... h6
{ My friend played exf2+ first, then play h6 to defend h7. It transposes nonetheless.   13...e4  This is probably black's most interesting move and the underlying complications are difficult to figure out.  14.Nxe4  Nb4 !  15.Nf6+  Rxf6  16.Bxh7+  Kf8  17.Ng6+  Rxg6   17...Ke8  18.Nf4+  Kf8  19.O-O  Rh6  20.Ne6+  Bxe6  21.fxe3+  Rf6  22.Rxf6+  Qxf6  23.Rf1  Bf7  24.Rxf6  Bxf6  25.Bg6  +-  Should be winning as the queen and pawns are far more active that black's pieces conglomerate.  18.Bxg6  e2  19.a4 !!  Ra3-Rf3 is pretty much terminal.  19...Qf6  20.Ra3  +-  Black has no great response to Rf3.   13...exf2+  14.Kf1  Leaves black without a really great plan here. You're only encouraging white to play Rh2-Rxf2  14...h6  15.Qg6  Rf6  16.Qh7+  Kf8  17.Ne4  +-  Black's prospects for survival are abysmal. }
4. Qg6
{ Making full use of the light-squares. I guess black's argument for play h6 first is that after Qg6, Rxf2 is playable. }
4... exf2+
{ 14...Rxf2  Black could evacuate the f8 square to allow the king to run.  15.Ne4  Nb4  16.Qh7+ !!  Kxh7   16...Kf8  17.Nxf2  exf2+  18.Kxf2  +-  wins  17.Nf6+  Kh8  18.Ng6#  A fantastic mate. }
5. Kf1 e4
{ 15...Rf6  16.Qh7+  Kf8  17.Kg2  +-  White plays Raf1, Ng6/Bg6, Ne4 and black's king isnot long for this world. }
6. Nxe4
{ The strongest move as it sets up a dirty mate.   16.Bxe4 ?  +-  I played this in my game, had a winning position, but went on to lose in style. Pushedpawn makes fun of me to this day about the game, but he knows I will get my revenge. }
6... Rf6
{ Probably the most human move, but alas, it fails because of a bolt from the blue: }
7. Qh7+ { Who doesn't love queen sacrifices ? } 7... Kf7
{ Clearly black.   17...Kxh7  18.Nxf6+  Kh8  19.Ng6#  That mate is hype. } 8.
Kg2
{ Leaves black in despair as Nxf6 comes and either rook comes to f1. I'll conclude the variation here as the point was to show how easily exploitable, black's light-squares were. If black ever plays f4, you should look to pounce the weak e4 and h7 squares ASAP. Sometimes, you won't be able to attack as quickly, shown here, but the ideas are still the same long-term. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. h3 Nc6 7. d5 Nb4
{ An interesting move which Black argues enters favorable Benoni/KID like structures. Objectively, it can not be a great move, but after analysis, there is no immediate refutation. }
8. Be2 { Developing normally. } 8... e6
{ Black attempts to open the e-file and break down the center. } 9. Be3
{ In our next game, we will cover a setup with the bishop on g5. Aronian has a more conservative approach in mind. }
9... Re8 { Maybe Black will open the e-file to make use of the rook. } 10. Nd2
{ I like Aronian's setup in this game. The knight helps bolster e4 and aims to restrict Black's central play. }
10... a5
{ Natural, supporting the b4 square and perhaps planning Na6-Nc5.   10...c6  if Black ever breaks the center open like s, one idea I like for White is the following:  11.a3  Kicking the knight  11...Na6  12.dxc6 !   12.O-O  exd5  13.exd5  cxd5  14.cxd5  +=  Is also a bit better for White, but it's hard to imagine White getting much here.  12...bxc6  13.O-O  ±  When Black's queenside is rather vulnerable with a quick Rc1-b4-c5. }
11. O-O Bd7
{ Carlsen develops his final minor piece. In the press conference of the game, Carlsen is noted to have said that this position he got eventually was sketchy and that he didn't like it all that much. A french grandmaster has also noted that Nd7 might be interesting for Black to play, playing on a dark-squared strategy.   11...Nd7  12.a3  Bxc3  13.bxc3  Na6  ±  Is given as 'Interesting' to play for black. I'll be frank: this position type looks dubious for Black in view of the weak kingside dark squares. I would think White is better in the run. Some kingside advance with Bd3-f4 will comes, but I remain unsure how good it is for White. The queenside pawn structure will plague white long-term, similar to the Saemisch variation of the Nimzo-Indian defense. }
12. Re1 { Aronian is no rush and completes his development. } 12... b6
{ Carlsen reinforces the c5 square. } 13. Rc1
{ Getting the final piece in play. } 13... Kh8
{ A bit of a mysterious move, but Carlsen's idea is to allow the f6 knight to retreat to g8 so f5 could be a follow up. }
14. a3
{ Aronian finally kicks the knight so that he can place his queen on c2. }
14... Na6 15. Qc2 e5
{ An interesting decision considering that Black already had a rook on e8. Why close the center ? Well, Carlsen wanted to play the normal f5, SMOrcing on the kingside. I don't blame him since White has the simple Rb1-b4 idea in mind. }
16. Rb1
{ Aronian prepares b4 with a more traditional plan of pawn storming on the queenside. With Black's next move, he does the same on the kingside with f5. }
16... Ng8 17. b4 f5
{ Advancing on the kingside.   17...Bh6  There are various tradeoffs for exchanging off the bishop and certainly Black could have gone for this. I think a reasonable continuation could have been:  18.Bxh6  Nxh6  19.c5 !  White will chop on a6 and open the queenside.  19...bxc5  20.Bxa6  axb4  21.axb4  Rxa6  22.bxc5  ±  Leaves White clearly better with the queenside already ripped apart. Any Mar Del Plata player would tell you this position is great for White because Black is several tempi behind getting the typical f5-f4-g5 kingside pawn storm that Black would usually get. }
18. Nb5
{ I like Aronian's move in view of the game. Other moves are less impressive.   18.b5 ??  A gross strategic error, closing the queenside down and Black will have all of the fun on the kingside.   18.f3  f4  19.Bf2  ∞  I'm genuinely unsure if this position is a good version of the Mar Del Plata. Black's pieces are placed far less actively here than there.   18.Nf3  I'm not convinced this helps white at all.  18...f4  19.Bd2  g5  → }
18... Bh6
{ 18...f4 ?  The natural f4 would have begged aronian to piece sacrifice with serious compensation since the kingside is closed.  19.Bxb6  cxb6  20.Nxd6  Rf8  21.c5  ±  White has extremely strong central pawns rolling through.   18...Bxb5 ?  19.cxb5  Nxb4  20.axb4  f4  21.Bxb6  cxb6  22.bxa5  Rxa5  ±  Should leave White much better on the queenside. }
19. Bxh6
{ White can't avoid the trade.   19.Bxb6  cxb6  20.Nxd6  Rf8  =∞  Would have been interesting for White to play, but probably not good for White objectively. }
19... Nxh6 20. exf5
{ Maybe it's just me, but I would think c5 is more on point. Aronian has something else in mind with taking on f5.   20.c5  bxc5  21.bxa5  ∞  Looks messy, but interesting for both sides to play. }
20... gxf5 { 20...Nxf5  21.Ne4  ±  Would leave black worse eternally. } 21. f4
{ Aronian's idea to justify exf5 was to block and stifle the kingside with this move. }
21... exf4
{ It looks risky, but opening the kingside up seems to be the best choice for Black.   21...e4  22.Nf1  +-  Would be positionally depressing for Black to play  (knights going to d4 & e3/g3 make Black's minors look like they do zilch)  .   21...Qh4  22.fxe5  dxe5  23.c5  ±  Would lead to a sharp fight where White should be better. Black's pawn duo  (e5 & f5)  is quite formidable. }
22. Qc3+ Kg8 23. Bh5
{ A nice move to force Black to concede the e-file or play into an awkward pin. }
23... Nf7
{ Black really wants to keep onto the e-file, so Black blocks the bishop's path. I offer a few couple of sample alternatives, but they aren't extensive in analysis.   23...Rf8  Keeping the rook on, but allows White to coordinate after  24.Nf3  Ng4 !?  25.Nbd4  ±  Qf6  26.hxg4  fxg4  27.Re4  gxf3  28.Qxf3  ±  f4 will drop eventually and the queenside space should give White the edge.   23...Rxe1+  Trading the rooks off looks like it leads to a double attack in tandem with Qh4.  24.Rxe1  Qh4  25.Nf3 !  Fortunately for White, this move is a game-saver and is easy to miss.  25...Qxh5  26.Re7  ±  Winning back d7  (mate on g7)  with a good position for White. }
24. Rxe8+ { A simple move that has a simple followup. } 24... Qxe8
{ Bxe8 is no better.   24...Bxe8  25.Bxf7+  Bxf7  26.Rf1  ±  Would be a pleasant position for White to play. }
25. Qf6
{ A nice restrictive move that Carlsen has to play against. In hindsight, Kh1 is apparently a strong move as well. I think most people's instincts would be to play Qf6 and think later here. I don't fault Aronian for his play.   25.Kh1  Apparently a good move that makes it so that White doesn't have to move the queen again after the following line  25...Qe5   25...Qf8 ?  26.Bxf7+  Qxf7  27.bxa5  ±  a5 hangs here, while in the game, the White queen had to move when it was on f6  26.Bxf7+  Kxf7  27.Nd4  From the far, one would think the game is more promising than this line.  27...Qe3  28.Qb2  ±  When White is apparently better in view of Rf1 and N2f3. }
25... Qf8
{ 25...Qe3+  26.Kh1  and Black has nothing better than to retreat back to e8 with the queen since Rf8, Nf3 is surprisingly strong.  26...Rf8 ?  Qe8 is better, but theres a nice line here I wanted to show.  27.Nf3 !  Ne5  28.Qg5+  Kh8  29.Qe7  Threatening f8 and also angling for Ng5-Qxh7#  29...Rg8  30.Ng5  +-  Is hard to meet for Black. }
26. Bxf7+
{ White really has no better move since Ne5 would only further help black. }
26... Qxf7 27. Qg5+
{ Where else should the queen go ? The queen trade doesn't help either. } 27...
Qg7 28. Qxf4
{ One would think White should be a tag better with the superior structure and space, but Carlsen, being one of the best players ever, never makes things easy. }
28... axb4 29. axb4 Re8
{ Re2 is a substantial threat that needs to be dealt with swiftly. } 30. Nd4
{ Logically repositioning and preventing Re2.   30.Rb3  Also logical, threatening Rg3. I think Black would play like in the game with Qe5 and ask if White has any way to break through.  30...Qe5  31.Qg5+  Qg7  32.Qh4  Qe7  The Black queen can simply chase around their counterpart and the entire point of this queen dance is to avoid trades.  33.Qg3+  Qg7  34.Qf2  ±  And finally, White is not in danger of queen trading. At least, in this line, more pieces are on the board. }
30... Qe5 31. Qg5+ Qg7 32. N2f3
{ If White was feeling more ambitious, Qh4 kept the game from entering an inevitably drawn ending. Due to the lack of relevance this endgame has towards the opening, I will not cover much else here. White is slightly better in the game, but Carlsen managed to hold on and draw.   32.Qh4  Qe7  33.Qg3+  Qg7  34.Qf2  Just like we saw before, White can avoid a queen trade and the game keeps going. }
32... Qxg5 33. Nxg5 Kg7 34. Nge6+ Kf6 35. Rf1 Bxe6 36. Nxe6 h5 37. g4
{ b5 was the last chance to keep winning chances alive.   37.b5  Nc5  38.Rxf5+  Kxf5  39.Ng7+  ±  Followed by Nxe8-Nxc7 would give White very good winning chances. }
37... hxg4 38. hxg4 Nxb4 39. Rxf5+ Kg6 40. Nf4+ Kg7 41. g5 c6 42. Kf2
{ 42.Rf6  cxd5  43.cxd5  Nxd5 !  44.Nxd5  Re5  45.Rxd6  Rxg5+ =  Leads to a well-known drawn theoretical ending. }
42... cxd5 43. cxd5 Re5 44. Ne6+ Kg6 45. Rf6+ Kh5 46. Kf3
{ It looks like White is winning  (Rh6# looks unstoppable)  , but Carlsen has a nice trick up his sleeve. }
46... Re3+
{ And the game was drawn here in view of Kxe3-Nxd5+. Aronian was pressing the entire game and Carlsen is well-known for showing displeasure for his position throughout the game based off the press conference. My opinion on this variation is that, if White is a competent positional player, Black should be statically worse for most of the opening & middlegame. Make sure not to do anything crazy in the opening: completing your development and angling for a queenside space advantage afterwards looks standard. }

9... Re8
{ Black plans to open the e-file and utilize the rook. It's debatable of how Black should handle the pawn structure in these positions.   9...e5  Closing the position makes a good deal of sense.  10.a3  Na6  11.b4  Nh5  ±  Would essentially be a Bayonet variation with a3 and Na6 inserted.   9...exd5  Opening the position like so would transpose to the game.  10.exd5  ±  Which is similar to the game after Re8. }
10. Bg5 { Developing the bishop to an active square in order to bait h6. }
10... exd5
{ Black wants to utiilize the open e-file. How else would you justfiy Re8 ?   10...h6  11.Be3  Would be essentially the Aronian-Carlsen game we'd seen previously, but with h6 inserted. }
11. exd5 h6
{ Black might want to play Ne4 in the near future. Hence, Libiszewski gets rid of the pin. }
12. Be3 { No other square is as harmonious. } 12... Na6
{ Black retreats to reposition the knight to c5.   12...Ne4 ?  13.Nxe4  Rxe4  14.Qd2  Would already win material for white  (b4 & h6 hanging)  . Na6 Bd3 doesn't help things and apparently Black's best option is to play with  14...a5  15.a3  Rxe3  16.fxe3  Na6  +- =∞  And I doubt Black has anywhere close to enough compensation for the exchange. }
13. Qd2
{ A solid developing move.   13.Nd2  A understandable alternative, trying to cover e4 ardently.  13...Nc5  14.b4  What else should White do ?  14...Nce4  15.Ncxe4  Nxe4  16.Nxe4  Rxe4  17.Bd3 =  and it's debatable if White is better at all. I don't think White has much, if anything at all. }
13... Kh7 { Covering h6. } 14. Rfe1
{ Completing development as what else ?   14.Bd3  White could start out with Bd3 and transpose to the game after  14...Nc5  15.Bxc5  dxc5  16.Rfe1  += }
14... Nc5 15. Bxc5
{ The trades kills a lot of the dynamism White has in the position.   15.Bd4  May be a better way of playing for white. The position becomes rather dull quickly after Bxc5.  15...Bd7   15...Nfe4  16.Nxe4  Nxe4  17.Qf4  +=  should be a bit better for White with nagging pressure on Black's kingside and space advantage. Black is limited on the useful moves they can play here.  16.Bd3  Nxd3  17.Qxd3  Bf5  18.Qd2  +=  I have a hard time believing White can muster up much of an edge here, but the space and nice minor pieces probably give them a little something. Besides, what is Black's plan anyways ? }
15... dxc5 16. Bd3
{ Should net White some edge because of the space and slight lead in development  (a8 rook is not playing)  . }
16... Bd7 17. Ne5
{ It's very difficult to judge White for this move, but it seems to be that Black can equalize with Nh5 straight away. I doubt White had much of an advantage before this anyways though.   17.Bc2  +=  Should keep a nice, tiny advantage based on space and easier piece movement. }
17... Re7
{ Apparently a slight mistake, but given the static nature of the pawn structure, it's understandable. that Black thought they should have played the position slowly.   17...Nh5 !  18.Nxd7   18.f4 !?  Leads to a sacrifice with rather unclear consequences after the following sample line  (not necessarily forced at a few moments)  .  18...Bxh3  19.gxh3  Qh4  20.Rf1  Holding onto f4.  20...Qg3+  21.Qg2  Qe3+  22.Qf2  Qxh3  23.Rae1  Bxe5  24.fxe5  Qxd3  25.Qxf7+ =  Is apparently okay for Black, although judging it as okay for Black is hard from the far because the central pawn duo looks strong.  18...Qxd7 =  Would not have promised White anything, in my opinion. }
18. Re3
{ White has the simple Rae1 move next in line.   18.f4  ±  Expanding on the kingside with Qf2-g4 seems to be better than the the game. }
18... Ne8 19. Rae1 { f4, once again wasn't bad either. } 19... Rxe5 20. Rxe5
Bxe5 21. Rxe5
{ Should be a tiny bit better for White on piece activity alone. } 21... Nd6

22... b6
{ 22...Qf6  Allowing Qf6 isn't a big deal. White should be slightly more comfortable is all  (space and better major pieces)  . The Black queen does, however, do a good job of defending f7, unlike in the game.  23.f4  += }
23. Re7 { Leaves Black under serious pressure and lacking moves. } 23... Kg8
{ Getting out of the line of fire. White had the simple idea of going Qe5, followed by Ne4 to undermine f7 & the Black king. The king defends f7 and is a useful defender of his own position.   23...a5 ??  24.Qe5 !  When black has no good defense against Ne4 other than Bf5. Unfortunately, the simple  24...Bf5  25.Bxf5  gxf5  26.Nb5  Qh8  27.Qxh8+  Kxh8  28.Nxd6  cxd6  29.a4  +-  Would be an extremely one sided endgame. All of Black's pawns are weak. }
24. g4
{ 24.Qe5 ?  Nc8  And f7 is defended by the king now.  25.Rxd7  Qxd7  26.Ne4  This seems to hold for Black despite it looking scary.  26...Qe7  27.Nf6+  Kf8  28.Qc3  Nd6  29.Nh7+ =  And White has nothing better than to make a draw. }
24... a6 25. f4
{ White plays the position slowly by expanding on the kingside. The risky Bxg6 is hard to calculate for any mortal. I provide a couple of sample lines, but they don't do the position justice.   25.Bxg6  fxg6  26.Qe5  Mate on g7 threatened.  26...Qf8 !  Willingly hanging d7, but allowing the a8 rook to enter the game   26...Nf7  The more natural response, trying to cover everything on the kingside.  27.Qf6  Be8  28.Qxg6+  Kf8  29.d6 !?  Qxd6  30.Re6  ∞  Is very tricky for both sides to play.  27.Rxd7  Re8 !  The key to Black's idea  28.Qg3  Nxc4  ∞  Is a rather unclear position, in my opinion. }
25... Nc8
{ 25...b5  26.b3  Rb8  +=  Followed by the opening of the b-file seems to be quite okay for Black. }
26. Re5
{ The players, for some reason, agreed to a draw here. White could have played, but I'm sure that outside factors entered White's mind, thus the reason why the game ended prematurely here.   26.d6 !?  Also is interesting. The example line given by  26...cxd6  27.Rxd7  Qxd7  28.f5  h6 hangs.  28...Kg7   28...Qe7  29.Qxh6 !  Qf6 !   29...Qe1+  30.Kg2  Black is out of checks.  30.Ne4  Qd4+  31.Kg2  Qxb2+  32.Kg3  Qe5+  33.Kf3  →  Keeps the game gong and chances for black to screw up. One can't, but help feel that Black's loose kingside should lead to trouble for them.  29.Nd5 !  Would have been difficult for Black to play, in my opinion. }
26... Nd6 { This is an example line of how things could continue. } 27. b3 Qh4

{ I want to take a moment to highlight the strengths and weaknesses White has in this position.   Strengths: More space, free development, central control   Weaknesses: h3 softens up the g3 square, Any further central pawn advance leaves weak squares behind.   Black's plan is often to play a6-b5 in this position to gain space on the queenside. White has a couple of plans I like in this chapter and it up to you to decide what you like best.    Plan 1:  Play against the a6-b5 expansion with pushing the pawn to c5.    Plan 2:  Ignore the queenside expansion with normal development.  I will cover both setups and leave it up to you to decide what you like best as both are nice for White. }

11... Nh5 12. Qd2
{ White is obviously for choice as Black has no play on the queenside. Black thereby relies on e5 followed by f5 for counterplay, in a much worse position.   Although there aren't games to base my opinions of this position off of, I trust the reader to competently play this position. White's queenside space advantage and arguably better pieces give White a moderate edge. Black probably should play for e5-Nf4, but Rfd1 followed by Bf1 looks reasonable to counter the Nf4 threat. }

Bh6 { Black takes up white's offer on the sacrifice. } 11. O-O

Most strong players prefer castling short for what the game continuation provides.   11.Qd2  Qe7  12.O-O-O  Bxe3  13.fxe3  a6  Black will prepare b5 and even if this is a good position for White, I believe the mainline is far more appealing.   13...Qxe3 ?  A natural move, but Black is already close to lost.  14.Qxe3  Rxe3  15.Nb5  c7 & d6 are threatened  Ne8 ?  Attempting to defend both weak squares.  16.Rhe1  Rxe1  17.Rxe1  Kf8  Rxe8 wins a piece, but likely the knight will be trapped when Nc7-Nxa8 will be played. Apparently, Ng5 is good for White here.  18.Ng5  +-  You can look at this position on your own, if you so choose.  14.e4  b5  ±  Even if this an objectively bad move, I think it makes more sense, for White, to have castled kingside from a principled point of view. You can play this position if you so choose, but I recommend the mainline as White faces less issues. }

Funnily enough, Black can't move the knight  (rook on e8 is undefended)  and White threatens to win a piece on the square in front of her.

Also, the a-pawn is a passer, so why not push it? }

21. dxe6 Bxb5 22. c4 Ba4 23. exd7 Qxd7

Whenever black angles for b5 with Nc7, I recommend playing Qb3 to shut it down and wait to play a4 until black has played a6.  10.Qb3 !?  A move that my engine recommends and aims to fully top any threats of b5 ideas. Without b5, black's setup lacks purpose. Instead of Qb3, white could play a4, but that weakens the b4 square enormously  (Na6-Nb4 is coming soon)  .  10...b5  The only move to challenge white's setup.  11.cxb5  exd5  12.exd5  Bb7  13.Bc4  White holds onto everything without conceding material. The following is a reasonable line that both sides could play.  13...Nd7  14.O-O  Nb6  15.a4  Not white's only move, but is consistent with trying to restrict black's queenside shenanigans.  15...Nxc4  16.Qxc4  Bxc3  17.bxc3  Bxd5  Would allow black to recover their pawn, but at a high price: white's queenside pawns are mobile and dark squares make the kingside an easy target.  18.Qg4  Should leave white strategically on top, given the: 1. Weak dark squares on the kingside  (opposite colored bishops)  2. Fragile center and backwards pawn n d6 3. Potential outside passed pawn on the queenside. }
10. exd5
{ exd5 is consistent with the Benoni setup chapter. The reader can opt for cxd5 if they so choose, but I like the resulting positions after exd5. }
10... Nb4
{ Gaining a tempo on our bishop and we have to decide where it should go. b1 looks perfectly natural, but is a rather serious mistake despite numerous games played by white. }
11. Be2
{ Moving to the less active square doesn't look like it makes much sense since black will be able to play Bf5, but Bb1 allows powerful play with b5.   11.Bb1 ?  b5 !  Is surprisingly a strong !  12.Nxb5   12.cxb5  Bb7  ∓  and d5 drops when black is on top.  12...Ba6  ∓  Is surprisingly hard to meet for white. Nfxd5 looms as well. }
11... Bf5
{ 11...b5  If black is insistent with the b5, just grab it and never let go.  12.a3 !  Na6  13.cxb5  Nc7  14.O-O  Bb7  15.Bc4  ±  When white is up a pawn with firm control over the position. }
12. Rc1 { Protecting c2 since Nc2 was threatened. } 12... Re8
{ I think this is objectively black's best move. For some reason, black has never played this move since the alternatives  (Qa5 & Ne4)  look worse by comparison. The sidelines are rather deep, but once you've seen them once, it won't be hard to remember how they work.   12...Qa5  Nxa2 is threatened. This entire line looks shaky for white, but it seems to hold for white.  13.Qd2  Holding onto a2.  13...Ne4  Black has no choice, but to go all in with Ne4 since any other move lets white play a3 and kicks back all of black's pieces. Nxa2 Ra1 would also be embarrassing to run into for black.  14.Nxe4  What else ?  14...Bxe4  15.a3  It looks as if black is losing a piece, but they a nice desperado to save the position.  15...Bxb2  16.axb4  Qxb4  17.Qxb4  cxb4  18.Rd1  Looks like it's completely winning for white, but black can recover some material after Bc2.  18...Bc2  a5 is what the computer recommends, but leads to positions where black will have, at best, 3 pawns for a piece.  19.Rd2  Ugly, but seems to work.  19...Bc3  20.Bd4  Simplifying down everything.  20...Bxd2+  21.Kxd2  +-  When white's fully mobilized and ready to pick off the queenside pawns. White is much better even though it looks like black is doing okay materially.   12...Ne4  Another reasonable move to try and exploit white's poor development. White has to play energetically to come out on top.  13.g4 !  A move that angles to sharpen things up  (e4 is tender)  . There's a couple of ideas to remember: 1. Black can capture on c3 first or 2. Play Qa5 to create havoc.  13...Nxc3  Leads to an advantageous position for white after:  14.bxc3  Nxa2  15.gxf5  Bxc3 Kf1 Nxc1 Qxc1 seems to only waste time for black.  15...Nxc1  16.Qxc1  ±  Should leave white with the better chances, but the position looks quite complicated. From what I can tell, it's probably best off that white plays Kd2  (not castles since the missing g-pawn makes the kingside feel naked)  to bolster the center and thereafter can play on both flanks. }
13. a3 { Simply kicking the knight away is good enough. } 13... Na6
{ Black backs off finally.   13...Rxe3 !?  Is a somewhat thematic exchange sacrifice.  14.fxe3  Qe7  Other moves are not consistent with Rxe3, in my opinion.  15.g4 !  A move my silicon friend here recommends and is apparently the best move all things considered. O-O Qxe3 Kh1 Bh6 leaves white hard pressed to move so white has to play quick and aggressively. Knowing this move in advance should greatly assist the reader already.  15...Qxe3  Other moves allow white to consolidate with Qd2 & O-O.  16.axb4  Re8  17.Rf1 !  Qxf3 is what black was hoping to get in.  17...cxb4  18.gxf5  bxc3  19.Rxc3  +-  Should be outright winning for white, but given white's poor king position may not be a quick conversion. }
14. Bd3
{ Contesting the diagonal immediately. White has a specific idea in mind if black plays the most natural Ne4. Bxd3 was also reasonable. }
14... Ne4
{ Black does not wait anymore since their development is already complete.   14...Bxd3  Trades off bishops  15.Qxd3  ±  I think should leave white statically better and likely both pairs of rooks will get traded off on the e-file. Don't be surprised to see yourself grind black down for the next 100+ moves in minor piece endgames.   14...Qd7  Keeping the tension is reasonable.  15.O-O  ±  White should follow up with Re1-Qd2 and develop a plan from there. It's very likely both pairs of rooks will come off the board because of the symmetrical nature of the position. White has flexibility to play for b4 to grab more space on the queenside, but I think it makes more sense }
15. Bxe4 { I like this simple minor piece trade. Nxe4 is fine as well. } 15...
Bxe4 { 15...Bxc3+  16.Rxc3  Bxe4 } 16. O-O
{ It looks like black has the bishop pair and a sound structure for no particular compensation, but it is difficult make use of their advantages because white's space advantage and horrid a6 knight are difficult to work with. }
16... Qd7
{ Is the most normal move I could think of for black to play. Bf5 Qd2 is pleasant for white and it's not like black has appealing alternatives. }
17. Ng5
{ White could reasonably play Bf4, Re1, b3, etc to maintain a nice position. My intention here is only to show the most forcing line. }
17... Bf5 18. g4 { Forcing black to to counterattack with } 18... h6
{ and leads to some a change of pawn structure after } 19. gxf5 hxg5 20. Qg4

Also black has to contend with Nb5 when both a7 & d6 attacked and the knight on a6 can't retreat to c7. Yes, 21. Qxf5 was reasonable as well.   21.Qxf5  gxf5  22.Bxg5  ± }

12. Rc1 { Protecting c2 since Nc2 was threatened. } 12... Ne4 13. g4
{ Another reasonable move to try and exploit white's poor development. White has to play energetically to come out on top.   A move that angles to sharpen things up  (e4 is tender)  . There's a couple of ideas to remember: 1. Black can capture on c3 first or 2. Play Qa5 to create havoc. }

{ Should leave white with the better chances, but the position looks quite complicated. From what I can tell, it's probably best off that white plays Kd2  (not castles since the missing g-pawn makes the kingside feel naked)  to bolster the center and thereafter can play on both flanks. }

9... c6 10. b4 { White expands on the queenside and gains space. } 10... c5
{ I'm sure this isn't black's only move, but the idea is to prevent white from ever playing c5 himself.   10...Nc7  11.Rc1  Would be typical for white.  11...f5  12.Bd3  ± }
11. Nd2
{ An interesting move by Li Chao, especially considering that Rb1 was a totally reasonable move. I would have preferred Rb1 instead to avoid cxb4.   11.Rb1  b6  12.Nd2  Bd7  Would transpose to the game, for example. }
11... b6
{ 11...cxb4  A totally normal pawn grab  12.axb4  Nxb4  13.c5  f5  14.cxd6  Nf4  =∞  I'm skeptical if white actually has sufficient compensation for the pawn  (d6 will drop)  . }
12. Rb1
{ Supporting b4. and is something that should have been played before. } 12...
Bd7 13. g3
{ Now that the queenside has stabilized, white angles for a typical motif we will see through the last 4 chapters of this course.   13.b5  Might make more sense to immediately play. }
13... Be8
{ Qe8 is far more natural, in my opinion, in view of the last parts of this course.   13...Qe8  14.b5  Nc7  15.Be2  ±  Would be akin to the game. }
14. b5
{ Although the queenside becomes closed, white has thankfully not castled kingside yet. This means that white is rather flexible in opening the kingside and can decide where his king will go in the long-term. }
14... Nc7 15. Be2
{ Attacking the knight and putting pressure on black to decide where the h5 knight should go. }
15... f5
{ This is black's all-in move essentially. I think this is the most principled move considering moving the knight elsewhere looks meek in comparison.   15...Nf4  16.Bf3  f5  ∓  Looks nice for white, in my opinion, but there is much left to be hashed out. Note that Nd3+ is a waste of time.   16...Nd3+  17.Ke2  Nf4+  18.Kf1  f5  ±  19.exf5  gxf5  20.gxf4  exf4  21.Bxf4  Bxc3  ±  Seems to be better for white, but I remain open minded about how good this position really is. It's the famous "clamp" structure, but flipped around on the queenside.   15...Nf6  16.g4  ±  Would be ostensibly better for white in view of the Chapters 10 and onward. }
16. exf5
{ As usual with black playing f5, it's most reasonable to take on f5 to soften up the structure. }
16... Nf4
{ Black didn't have another move.   16...Rxf5  17.g4  +-   16...gxf5  17.Bxh5  f4  18.Bxe8  fxe3  19.Bh5  exd2+  20.Qxd2  +- }
17. gxf4
{ Taking makes the most sense in view of Ng2+ and resolving the tension.   17.fxg6 ??  Ng2+  18.Kf1  Nxe3+  -+ }
17... exf4 18. Bxf4 Rxf5
{ 18...Bxc3  19.O-O  Rxf5  20.Bg3  ±  Would be a much better position for white because of the poor black minor pieces }
19. Bg3 Bxc3
{ After all of the trades, it becomes apparent that white is on top because of the illogically places pieces on c7, e8 , c3 and f5. None of them coordinate and unsurprisingly, white is prime to gain tempi and time off them. White's king is also surprisingly safe on the kingside and Li Chao wastes no time. }
20. O-O
{ White will play Bg4 & Ne4 to further improve his pieces and gain time. Black's minor pieces are a sad trio to watch. }
20... a6 21. Bg4
{ A nice tempo-gaining move.   21.Ne4  Bd4  22.Bg4  ±  Transposes to the game. }
21... axb5
{ Rapport sacks the exchange in an effort to break up the center. Unfortunately, Li Chao found a simple in between move to kill off black's threats.. }
22. Ne4
{ Now Bxf5 followed by Nxd6 is a winning threat that can't be parried. Whereas, with Bxf5 first, the e4 square is taken away after gxf5.   22.Bxf5  gxf5  23.Rb3  Bg7  =∞  Gives black some compensation compared to the game, based on the poor d2 knight here. }
22... Bd4
{ Keeps the bishop on the most stable square.   22...Be5  23.Bxf5  gxf5  24.Bxe5  ±  And either minor piece black takes back with, white should be considerably better after. }
23. Bxf5 gxf5 24. Nxd6
{ Nets white a clean exchange and the game, in my opinion. The rest of the game is a bit of a technical task. }
24... Bg6
{ Black obviously had the best intentions by defending f5, but Qg5 was a more active way of defending f5.   24...Qg5  A clearly more testing option, but should ultimately be losing.  25.Qf3  Preventing f4.  25...Bh5  26.Qf4  Qxf4  27.Bxf4  Leads to mass exchanges after.  27...bxc4  28.Nxc4  Nxd5  29.Nxb6  Nxf4   29...Nxb6  30.Rxb6  Rxa3  +-  30.Nxa8  Nxh3+  31.Kg2  Nf4+  +-  Should be winning for white with enough care, but still is tricky for white to handle. }
25. Nxb5 Nxb5 26. Rxb5 Rxa3 27. Rb3
{ Pretty much kills off all play. It looks like white is giving up the exchange after black's next move, but white has it all worked out. }
27... Bh5 { Winning back the exchange, but at a high price.... } 28. Qxh5 Rxb3
29. Kh2 { Avoiding Rxg3 and threatening Rg`1 perhaps. } 29... Qf6
{ It looks like black can maybe hold on, but the g-file is decisive after } 30.
Qe8+ Qf8 31. Qe6+ Qf7 32. Rg1 Qxe6 33. dxe6
{ And in view of Bd6+/Be5+ black resigned. Mate will come soon. I think white played a nice clinic of a game here and much debate should be had about how should white react on the kingside against black's nefarious intentions with f5. I believe the game here is a model example of how to play the white side of this sideline. }

{ This is the defining structure of Chapter 9, 10 and 11. Black angles to play to control the b4 square and better support a knight soon to come to c5. Much of Black's counterplay in this chapter revolves around the queenside  (moves such as c6-b5-Rb8-Qb6 are all common place. Meanwhile, much if not all of White's play revolves around the kingside with advancing the kingside pawns, while developing with Rg1, Be3 and Nd2 to help reposition White's pieces.) }

Qc2 has to be played, which is not a move  9...Nc5  The normal Nd2 move would hem in the dark squared bishop so White is forced to play Qc2, which is awkward.  10.Qc2  A tame setup for White, compared to the mainline that we will investigate. }

This is only possible because the center is closed and the play is slow enough where a kingside pawn storm will not backfire.  11...f5  Hence, since the position is closed, Black wants to open things up as soon as they can manage. If Black doesn't play f5, it's very difficult to figure out a constructive plan.  12.gxf5  According to my database here, White scores an incredible 78% with g5, but gxf5 is far more natural in my opinion.   12.g5  You can explore more about this position if you so choose.  12...gxf5  Here, White has tried 8 different moves and I am not sure which is objectively best. I suggest playing Qe2 followed by long castles since it is the most natural thing White can do.  13.Qe2  We will discuss this position more at length in the future.  11...c6   11...f5  One might ask: why not f5 ? Well, it is White is obvious better after  12.gxf5  gxf5  13.h4  fxe4  14.Qg3  ±  Nd3+ isn't an issue and after long castles, Ndxe4 will be played with a nice position for White.  12.Be2  a4  13.Qg3  →   10...Bd7  Black can certainly play slowly with Bd7, but there's one particular plan I like for White to get on with. The most played move here is Be2 and it's obvious why it is: White plans to play with g5-h4-h5 and storm the kingside. However, I would argue that you can get the same type of positions with the bishop on e2, but improved in the continuation I suggest.  11.Qf3 !  c6  12.Be2  The same setup as in the mainline.   10...Nfd7  11.Qf3 !?

Unfortunately, there hasn't been too many games in this line or type of position at all, so I've had to theorycraft it on my own. A sample line will be given here, with a few ideas to help guide us.   11.Be2  I've gone to great lengths to analyze Be2 here and feel more comfortable recommending Qf3 instead. }

14. O-O
{ White gets out of the center and gets away from the queen a5 pin. Unfortunately, there have been no games played in this position so there is nothing to base my views off of.

16. Qg2
{ There's a strong argument here that the queen is better on g3 because it can support h4 and perhaps go to h4 as well. The argument in favor of Qg2 is that f5-f4 would not work the queen on g3 and bishop on e3 because the queen is on  g2 instead of g3.   16.Qg3 }

23. Nd2
{ White misses the chance to crush black on the kingside with the deceptively strong g5 mortar move.   23.g5  White will take on h6 next move, so black could reasonably play h5 to close the kingside.  23...h5  24.Nh4 !  Now it becomes fairly clear that white is not a nice play. No matter what black will play next move, Bxh5 will be played  (with the idea of gxh5-g6+)  to smash open the kingside.  24...Rg8  25.Bxh5  ↑  gxh5 ??  26.g6+  fxg6  27.Qg5 !  +-  The threats of Qe7+ and Nxg6+ followed by Qh5+ leave black with no defense. }

Kd3 Ra6 58. Rh7 Rb6 59. Kc2

13. Be3 Qa5 14. Rc1 Bd7 15. O-O
{ I consider this to be more or less the a mainline tabiya position of Plan #1. Both sides, as mentioned before, have plans to play on both sides of the board. Black has ideas to advance on the queenside with b5 and kingside with f5. Meanwhile, white angles to advance on the kingside with Qg3-h4, possibly f4, and can even play on the queenside with ample time. }
15... Rfc8 { Black, naturally, aims to play on the queenside. } 16. Qg3
{ There's a reasonable argument for white inserting a3 first before anything else.   16.a3  Useful in controlling b4 so that a knight or queen can't go there.  16...cxd5  When white can take on d5 with either pawn. There's a strong argument for both.  17.cxd5   17.exd5 !?  ±  Looks sharper, but promising, in nature to my eye.  17...b5  18.Na2  ±  Should give white a stable advantage with the knight coming to b4. }
16... cxd5

17. exd5
{ Recapturing with the e-pawn looks risky, but it's what must be done.   17.cxd5 ?!  Qb4  And all of a sudden it is difficult to defend b2 & e4 properly. Hence, the earlier point about a3 being a useful move. Qb4 wouldn't be possible if a3 had been inserted.   17.Nxd5  Nxd5  18.exd5  Only black has benefited from the knight exchanges as it is easier to play for f5 with the f6 knight out of the way. }

18. Rc2 { A uncomfortable, but necessary move to cover b2. } 18... a3

20... bxc4 { Opening the queenside. } 21. Bxc4

21... e4
{ 21...exf4 ?  22.Qxf4  ±  d6 is extremely weak and it is hard for black to even meet Bd4.   21...Nd3 !

31. Bxd3
{ A blunder in time pressure, perhaps ? Now the light-squared bishop loose on d3.   31.d6  Would have endded the game instantly.  31...Nxd6  32.Nf6+  Kh8  33.Qxg6  Qe1+  34.Kh2  +- }

40. Rc3
{ 40.Rf6  +-  Excavates the queen and prepares Rf7-g5 to further break down black's defense. }
40... Rf8 41. Qd6 Be5
{ White resigned as after Qg6+ Kh8, white is out of checks and will be mated shortly. A very unfortunate loss for white as most of the game was under his grip and one can feel Johannessen's pain. I encourage the user to gauge when it is okay to recapture on d5 early on with either the c or e-pawns, as well as acquire a feel for what side of the board they should focus on. }

11. Rg1
{ In hindsight, I don't think this move is particularly great, but it accomplishes the goal of preventing black's f5. The more straightforward f5 is better. White also better prepares h4-h5-g5 with this rook move.   11.h4 !  where  11...f5 ?  is not good because of the rather strong   11...Nc5  12.g5 !  f5  13.h5  ±  Gives white a large advantage, perhaps a winning one on the kingside.  12.gxf5  gxf5  13.exf5  Bxf5  14.h5  Nc5   14...h6  15.Nde4  ±  Looks very ugly for black to play.  15.h6  Bf6  16.Qf3 !

13. Be2 { Developing. } 13... a4 { Grabbing space on the queenside. } 14. Kf1
{ Since white doesn't have the option of castling, it is very wise to dodge Qa5 by manually castling kingside. f1 will be a safe square where white can tuck his king away to.   14.O-O-O ??  Castling queenside is a horrible idea in view of  14...a3  15.b3  Qa5  16.Kc2   16.Bxc5  Qxc5  ∓  Is obviously better for black in view of the weak dark squares & queenside.  16...cxd5  17.Nxd5  Ne6 !  ∓  Black has obvious ideas of Rb8, b5, Nd4+ all in play. }
14... Nc7

{ In our game here, black decided to break open the kingside. It was a bit premature to do so. White's best option is to swipe everything off on f5.   13...Qe7  Black could have played slower and prepared f5, but it is still nice for white.  14.c5  ±   14.Nd2  ± }

16... axb4 17. axb4 Bxf5 18. Bd3 e4
{ The only move that doesn't capitulate to white's positional grip. Both e4 & e6 should be carefully guarded by black and this is the only move that challenges white in the center. }
19. Ncxe4
{ It's important to leave the knight on g5 because it gives white opportunities to play with both Qh5 and Ne6.   19.Ngxe4  Nd7  20.Rg1  Ne5  21.Be2  ±  Would leave white with a nice position, just as in the game. }

20. Bxe4 { 20.Nxe4  ±  Was also fine for white. } 20... Bxe4 21. Nxe4 Qe7
{ Qh4 was better as it allows black to queen trade and enter a hard to play endgame for white.   21...Qh4  By far a better move and leads to an endgame where black has far more active play.  22.Qg4  Qxg4  23.hxg4  Rbe8  24.Ng3  It's difficult to discern between all of the knight moves.

It's not easy to find all of these moves and I think this line would have been more challenging. }
22. Qg4 { The queen now prepares to lead the assault on the kingside. } 22...
Rbe8 23. Ng5
{ 23.Rg1  +-  Was probably stronger, but the game is obviously good in view of the control white gets along the g-file. }
23... Rxf2 24. Ne6

25. Bd4
{ A natural, but bad move. It's hard to see why this move is a mistake though and black understandably missed their chance to strike back.   25.Kd2  Threatening Bh6, Rhf1 with decisive effect.  25...Kh8  26.Rhf1 !  Softening up g7 is a key difference between this and the game. }
25... Nxb4
{ 25...c5 !  Apparently, this move is black's best chance to stay in the game.  26.bxc5  Nxc5  Nxe6 is threatened so white is forced to grab on c5.   26...dxc5 ?  27.Be5  +-  It's important for black to trade off pieces here instead of this.  27.Bxc5  dxc5  28.Rf1 !  Softening up g7 and preventing black from playing Qf6 which would threaten Qc3+ & Qe5+  28...Kh8  29.Kd2  ∞  When, in my opinion, the position isn't clear at all. }
26. Kd2
{ Getting out of the e-file and g7 is now gone. Black was hoping for Rxb4, but missed this simple idea.   26.Rxb4 ??  c5  Not what white wanted. }
26... c5

Kh5 33. Rxd6

Nd2 { White reorganizes the knight to a better square on d2. } 12... Nc7
{ Black looks as though they want to prepare b5 with the last couple of moves.   12...Ndc5  We will go over the Tomashevsky-Grischuk in the next game. It featured this move. }
13. h4
{ I'm not sure if I would have had the guts to play this move without prior experience, but given Koshmak credit for this creative pawn sacrifice. Honestly, h4 wasn't necessary as white had other useful moves instead.   13.Rb1  ±  Would more or less align ourselves with the Tomashevsky-Grischuk game more.   13.b4  Is an interesting move that white can play any time basically.  13...cxd5   13...Qe7  delaying things doesn't help nor hurt black.  14.b5  c5  You should not be   14...cxd5  15.cxd5  b6  16.Nc4  ±  Is also looking nice for white.  15.g5 !

13... Qxh4
{ 13...Nc5  14.h5  ±  Would lead to typical play, in general under plan #2. }
14. g5
{ Now white has various queen trap ideas in mind. For example, if black plays some nonsensical moves like Ra8-Rb8, white will be able to trap the queen in the sideline here. }
14... cxd5
{ Black in the meantime taims to rely on his piece play to escape being trapped.   14...Ra8 ?  15.Nf3  Qh5  16.Rg2 !  Rb8 ?  17.Rh2  Qg4  18.Bh3  +-  Would be a nice queen trap.   14...h6 ?  Wouldn't help black at all in view of another nice queen trap idea that leads to a long forced line Also, hxg5 Bxg5 wouldn't help black at all either.  15.Rg2 !  Nc5   15...hxg5  16.Nf3  Qh8  Would be hilarious to see on the board.  17.Rh2  Bh6  18.Bxg5  +-  16.Nf3  Qh5  17.Rh2  Qg4  18.Bh3  Nd3+  19.Kd2  Nxb2  20.Qh1  Nxc4+  21.Kd3  Nxe3  22.fxe3  Qg3  23.Rg1  +-  Would finally trap the queen. }
15. cxd5 { The most natural move. } 15... Nc5
{ Black makes the most natural move they can as well.   15...f5  Moving the f-pawn wouldn't help.  16.Rg3 !  f4  17.Nf3  Qh5  18.Rh3  Qg4  19.Rh4  ∓ }
16. b4
{ White gains a nice bit of space on the queenside as there is no rush get material back at all. The same queen trap ideas don't work since d7 is freed as a retreating square.   16.Rg2 ?  h3 is now covered by the bishop so Rg3-Rh3 makes no sense.  16...b5  17.Nf3  Qh3  ∓  and the queen retreats to d7.   16.Qf3 !?  I think this is an interesting alternative, but the game is more natural. }
16... axb4 17. axb4 N5a6 18. b5
{ The most natural & human move. Apparently, white had the somewhat computerish Nc4, but it's unrealistic to play the line.   18.Nc4  Nxb4  19.Rb1  Nca6  20.Rg3  f6  21.Nxd6  =∞  Where white has pretty good compensation for the missing pawn  (central d-pawn is powerful)  . }
18... Nc5 19. Qf3
{ Transferring the queen to help on the kingside makes a great deal of sense. White wants to eventually play Qg2-Be2-Rh1 to trap the queen.   19.Nf3  Qh5  Makes no sense for white to play  20.Be2  Qh3  ∓ }
19... Rd8
{ 19...f5  I think this is the most normal move black can play  20.Rh1  Qg4  21.Qxg4  fxg4  22.Nc4  ±  White will win back a pawn via Nxd6 with a nice position.   19...Bd7  20.Be2  Qh3  21.Qxh3  Bxh3  22.Nc4  ±  When d6 will be regains with a pretty nice position. }
20. Qg2
{ Koshmak's idea is quite remarkable in this position. If I was black, I would be starting at white's Be2 Rh1 threat and think that would be the only thing to worry about. Koshmak shows that everything is not all that it seems. }
20... Bd7 21. Kd1
{ I think this is a very ambitious idea, but largely unnecessary. White wants to play f3-Bf2 to trap the queen.   21.Rh1  Was far more normal when  21...Qg4  22.Qh2  ±  When white wins back a pawn. }
21... Ra8 22. Rc1
{ Rxa8 wasn't bad either, exchanging followed Kc2. It's leads to a lengthy line that's not easy to gauge from the far.   22.Rxa8  Rxa8  23.Kc2  Na4  Black might as well exchange knights.  24.Rh1  Qg4  25.Qxg4  Bxg4  26.Nxa4  Rxa4  27.b6  Na6  28.Bb5  Ra5  29.Rb1  +-  When white would be much better  (Nc4 incoming)  and black's extra kingside pawn being meaningless. Black has no great move here. }
22... f5
{ 22...Ra3  23.f3  +-  When black already has to concede some material since Rh1 traps the queen. }
23. b6
{ White first tidies up the queensidd before proceeding with Be2-Rh1 winning the queen.   23.Be2  +-  Followed by Rh1 wins the queen. }

Ke1 Rdc8 27. Ra1 Nf6
{ Saves the queen, but not the game.   27...Bd7  28.Rb1  +-  Would have done the trick  (Rh1 next)  . }
28. gxf6

28... Bd7
{ 28...Qxf6  +-  Was probably better in comparison, but still completely losing. }
29. Rxa8 Rxa8 30. Bg5 Ra1+ { No choice since the queen is otherwise trapped. }
31. Bd1 Qh5 { Black is walking a tightwire. } 32. Qf3

{ Black managed to simplify the position a bit, but it's a hopeless endgame. }
43... Ke7 44. Kd1
{ Black resigned as there is nothing left to play for. I believe white's h4 move was clever and deserves more attention. Black's position was pretty much bad after grabbing h4. Hence, always remember to look out for these kinds of sacrifices. }

However, by move 20, the game enters a completely difference phase than what he must have expected. The rook also acts a safeguard on the kingside against moves like f5. Staying on the g-file acts as a good deterrent against it since f5 gxf5 is like staring down the barrel of a gun.   16.b4  ± }

9. Be3 Na6 10. a3 Nb6 11. Rg1 Kh8
{ I'm fairly sure Kh8 and Bd7 are interchangeable moves that black can play at any moment. }
12. Nd2
{ White repositions the knight so that the white queen better supports the pawn advances on the kingside  (h4-h5 especially)  . Also, on d2, the knight will nicely control b3. Generally, the knight is not well positions on f3 and should move eventually. Just like we saw in plan #1, white can certainly think about playing Qf3 as well.   12.h4  Was played in Melkumyan vs Anderson and let to a nice position for white after  12...Bd7  13.g5  f6  14.h5  gxh5  15.Nd2  fxg5  16.Qxh5  Qf6  17.O-O-O  Qg6  18.Qxg6  hxg6  19.Be2  ±  This is a nice example of how white plays often in the 10..Nb6 lines: Advance the kingside pawns, induce weakenesses, play on the weak light squares. }
12... Bd7 { Developing. } 13. g5
{ White avoids all pretenses and advances right away. The main idea of playing g4 is to meet f5 with gxf6 and fracture black's kingside.   13.h4  Qxh4  14.Qf3 !?  Was an interesting pawn sacrifice that's reminiscent of the Koshmak vs Haugen game we'd seen before. }
13... Nc5
{ Black improves their knight to a reasonable square. Black has numerous alternative moves and I don't think it's productive to cover every single one in detail.   13...f5  14.h4  ±  We'll take a look at this line in Schlosser vs Henrichs.   13...f6  14.h4  ± }
14. b3
{ h4 was already possible, but white wanted to tidy up the queenside beforehand.   14.h4  h5 will come next and black really has no great way of preventing it.  14...Nba4  Trading off one of the superfluous knights.   14...f5  15.h5  Is a direct transpositon to Schlosser vs Henrichs.  15.Nxa4  Nxa4  16.h5  → }
14... f5
{ In my opinion, black has hardly any other move to consider. At some point, black has to break out and try to give life to his bishops and f8 rook. }
15. h4 { White continues to advance without much care. } 15... Nxe4
{ I think this is a positional mistake and black should have been more patient. In the game, white acquires great central light squared control.   15...Qe8  Qe8 had been tried in a few games, sitting pretty.  16.Rh1  fxe4  Is how a few games have proceeded and the position is largely unclear.  17.Ncxe4  Nxe4  18.Nxe4  +=  White does have nice central control, but both sides have chances to drum up play on opposing flanks  (White on the kingside, black on the queenside & f-file) }
16. Ndxe4 fxe4 17. h5
{ Gets right to the point and threatens h6.   17.Nxe4  ⇆  Was very natural, but the game is far more aggressive and appealing. }
17... gxh5
{ 17...Rf7  18.hxg6  hxg6  19.Nxe4  ±  Would have been obviously good for white and no fun for black, but at least the position semi-closed. }
18. Qxh5 Kg8
{ It's very difficult to give black advice. Playing good defensive moves is the hardest thing to execute in chess.   18...Rf4 !?  Would have been a nice way to try and keep white's activity at bay, but probably wouldn't help as  19.Rh1  Bf5  20.O-O-O  ↑  Looks pretty good for white. }
19. Nxe4
{ Recapturing is the most natural move.   19.g6  ↑  Would have already led to an opening of the kingside. Lysyj probably felt that there was no rush to open things and that many moves were good here. Black, in the game, is given the chance to play Be8-Bg6 to close the kingside a bit, but is left with a passive position with nothing fun to play for. }
19... Be8 20. Qh3 Bg6 21. Bd3
{ White is in no rush and calmly develops all of the pieces. } 21... Nd7 22.
Kd2
{ You can argue where the king is best placed  (on b1, d2 or e2)  , but it really doesn't matter since it's safe regardless. }
22... Qe7 23. Rg3
{ White prepares to play Nf6+ by doubling on the g-file. Once Nf6+ hits, the kingside will be miserable to sit behind and hold onto. }
23... Rf7 24. Rag1 Raf8
{ 24...Kf8  +-  Apparently, sidestepping with Kf8 was best, but it's unrealistic for anyone to play this move. Everything looks miserable and it's all probably lost for black anyways. }
25. Nf6+ { The breakthrough is powerful. } 25... Nxf6 26. Bxg6
{ It matters not whether white takes on f6 or not.   26.gxf6  Rxf6  27.Bxg6  hxg6  28.Rxg6  Rxg6  29.Rxg6  Transposes. }
26... hxg6 27. gxf6 Rxf6 28. Rxg6 Rxg6 29. Rxg6
{ Not much needs to be said other than that white will be pressing for the next 50 moves in this position. Black has no productive play. }
29... Rf6 { 29...e4  Moves like e4 only concede d4.  30.Bd4  +- } 30. Rg2 Qf7
31. Ke2
{ Apparently Qc8 was better, angling for some kind of zugzwang, but it's hard to understand.   31.Qc8+  Kh7  32.Rh2+  Bh6   32...Kg6  33.Qg4#  33.Kc3  b6  Apparently this is better than the game. Black is stuck in a rut of a pin and it's difficult to get out of. This is hard to evaluate and I don't blame white for "missing" it. }
31... Rg6 32. Qc8+ Bf8 33. Rg4 c6
{ Swapping off rooks would have left white much better, but you've got to think that the more trades there are, the better black is off. Black's idea was to break down the center and infiltrate with the queen of course, but objectively it's not good.   33...Rxg4  34.Qxg4+  ± }
34. dxc6 bxc6 35. Rxg6+
{ 35.Bh6  I think this is a better version of the game since black's queen is so active in the game.  35...Rxg4  36.Qxg4+  Kh8  37.Bxf8  Qxf8  38.Qh3+  Kg8  39.Qg2+  Kh7  40.Qxc6  ±  When for the next 200+ moves, white will be pressing for a win. }
35... Qxg6 36. Qxc6 Qc2+ 37. Kf3 Qxb3 38. a4
{ While the position is still nice for white, it's not an extra pawn like in the previous sideline. }
38... Qd1+ 39. Kg2
{ Allowing an immediate draw.   39.Kg3  Qg1+  40.Qg2  +=  Would have kept life in the game. }
39... Qg4+ 40. Kh2 Kf7
{ I think allowing the game to go on any further was completely unnecessary   40...Qh5+  41.Kg2  Qg4+  42.Kf1  Qd1+  43.Kg2  Qg4+  44.Kh1  Qd1+ =  Will be a draw by perpetual. }
41. Qd5+ Kf6 42. f3
{ The game keeps going and if white somehow manages a queen trade the bishop ending would be highly unpleasant. }
42... Qh5+ 43. Kg2 Qg6+ 44. Kh3 Qh7+ 45. Kg3 Qg6+ 46. Kh3 Qb1
{ A totally unncessary move. Black should just take the draw by checking the h & g files. }
47. Qg8 Qf5+
{ Black has a highly unplesant position after white's next move. It's hard to give black good advice other than hope to not queen trade.   47...Qf1+  Black probably rejected this line since they drop the bishop. I suspect both players were low on time because it's easy to gloss over the sideline here when low on time.  48.Kg3  Be7 !  49.Bg5+  Kf5 =  When white can't take on e7 for free because of Qg1+ }
48. Kg3 Ke7 49. Qg4 Qe6 50. Qxe6+
{ Apparently, this is not the best move, but it looks natural to queen trade and grab a5.   50.Bd2  Keeping queens on is better apparently and one possible continuation  (although not forced at many points)  is  50...d5  51.Bxa5  Bh6  52.Bd8+  Kd7  53.Qxe6+  Kxe6  54.cxd5+  Kxd5  55.a5  +-  When white is winning. I think it's hard to foresee something like this given the low time, so I don't blame white for playing the game. }
50... Kxe6 51. Bb6 d5 52. cxd5+ Kxd5 53. Bxa5
{ Has the same idea as in the 50. Bd2 sideline, but white's bishop was on d8 and had just played a5. Due to the scope of this course, I will not extensively cover this endgame, but it's interesting to look at it if you have free time. }
53... Bc5
{ Now black can't sacrifice the bishop for the pawn.   53...Bd6  Keeping an eye on f4.  54.Kg4  e4  55.f4  Bxf4 !  An easy to miss sacrifice. Now black just has to run to the a8 corner and get a well known draw.  56.Kxf4 }
54. Kg4 e4 { Any other move would be met by Bc7/Bd8-a5. } 55. f4 Kc4 56. Be1
Kd3 57. a5
{ White has a simple idea of sacrificing their bishop for the e-pawn and the c5 bishop will not be able to stop both the a & f pawns. }
57... Ke2 58. Bh4 Kd3 59. f5 Kc4 60. Kf4 Kd5 61. f6 Bd6+ 62. Kf5 e3 63. f7 e2
64. a6 Kc6 65. Ke4 Kb6 66. Kd3 Kxa6 67. Kxe2
{ It looks like black might be able to draw, but after a bit of maneuvering to kick the bishop off of the a3-f8 diagonal, it will be more obvious that white is winning. }
67... Kb5 68. Kf3 Kc6 69. Ke4 Kd7 70. Kf5 { Black's king can't penetrate. }
70... Bf8 { 70...Be7  71.Kg6 !  Wouldn't help black at all. } 71. Bg5 Kd6 72.
Kf6 Kd7 73. Bh4 Ba3
{ 73...Kd6  74.Be1  Forcing the king back  74...Kd7  75.Bd2  Kd8  Any bishop move allows Kg7.  76.Ke6  Bg7  77.Bb4  Bh6  78.Kf6  Kd7  79.Kg6  Ke6  80.Ba3  When finally black is in zugzwang and can't stop the pawn any longer. }
74. Kg7 Ke6 75. Be1 Bc5 76. Bc3 Ba3 77. Kg8 Bc5 78. Bg7 Ba3 79. Bf8 Bc1 80. Bb4
Bh6 81. Bd2 { 81.Bc3  Was less fancy and did the job as well. } 81... Bf8
{ Black resigned after playing Bf8. I think what's important to remember about this game is white's SMOrc ideas on the kingside from move 15 to 30. }

9. g4 Nd7 10. a3 Nb6 11. Rg1 Bd7
{ The most natural move, developing the final minor piece. } 12. b3
{ Tomashevsky decided in this game to tidy up the queenside first before journeying on the kingside. In the rest of the games in the 10..Nb6 lines, we will look at games where white played 12. h4 immediately.   12.h4  → }
12... Kh8
{ We've seen this countless times before. By sidestepping the g-file, black prepares f5 potentially. }
13. h4
{ White cares not for what black goes for and advances on the kingside. } 13...
f5
{ I will give black credit for having the courage to play this move, despite it being a risky positional decision in view of the game. If black doesn't play f5 right now then h5 will be ugly to face. It also turns out Nc5 transposes to the next few games we will look at and probably is a better try than f5.   13...Nc5  ± ⇆ }
14. gxf5 gxf5 15. Ng5
{ Tomashevsky plans to take on f5 and bring the knight back to e4 for a nice light-squared blockade. He also allows for Qh5 as well. Note that Nd2 only traps in the dark squared bishop needlessly.   15.Nd2  Nxd5 !  f4 comes next. Womp, womp, womp.  16.cxd5  f4  ∓  Is far less appealing than the game. }
15... h6
{ 15...Qe8  16.Bh3  ±  is a neat idea anticipating a trade of lightsquared bishops with a good game for white.   15...Qe7  16.Qh5  ±  Leads to similar ideas as in the game. }
16. exf5
{ Tomashevsky prefers to keep the structure clean if he can. Grabbing on g5 is a death sentence so black recaptures on f5.   16.Ne6  Bxe6  17.dxe6  Qxh4  18.exf5  Rxf5  19.Qc2  ±  Would have been a nice position to play for white. }
16... Bxf5
{ 16...hxg5  One might ask why didn't black take on g5 ? Well, it's a slaughter if black does.  17.Qh5+   17.Ne4 !?  Also an interesting try to get the knight in play. A very long, forced line could be  17...Bxf5  18.Qh5+  Kg8  19.Bxg5  Qe8  Where else would the queen go ?  20.Nf6+ !  Rxf6  21.Qxe8+  Rxe8  22.Bxf6  Kf7  23.Bxg7  Rg8  24.Rg5 !  Bc8  25.f4 !  Rxg7  26.fxe5  dxe5  27.Rxe5  ±  With a tense position for both sides  (Rook & 2 pawns for 2 knights)  . White is probably a bit better because of black's poor minor pieces and ideas of Ra2-Rf2, but it's easier said than done proving it. Especially since Rg3 looks like a top candidate move for black.  17...Kg8  18.Rxg5  ↑  When white has tremendous attacking attacking chances on the kingside after a further O-O-O, Qg4-h5-h6. }
17. Qh5
{ Not the only move, but white is clearly better with the game continuation. White threatens the simple Nf7+ so black stops all shenanigans on the kingside with a queen trade.   17.Nce4  ±  Would be similar to previously mentioned sidelines. }
17... Qe8 18. Qxe8 Raxe8 19. Nge4
{ It should be obvious that white is better. The strong knight blockade on e4, more central space and more active pieces should give white a nice advantage. }
19... Nd7 { The knight was wretched on b6 so it was moved back. } 20. Bd3
{ It's important to get Bd3 in before Nac5 is played.   20.O-O-O ?  Nac5  b3 & e4 are under attack. }
20... b6
{ 20...Nac5  I'm sure tomashevsky prepared against this move by having the following line in mind.  21.Bc2  Nxc5 leads to a nice position as well.   21.Nxc5  Nxc5  22.Bxf5  Rxf5  23.Bxc5  dxc5  24.Ne4  b6  25.Ke2  ±  would have been a promising endgame with the beautiful blockading knight on e4. It's debatable where the king should go  (d2 or e2 or just long castles)  21...a4  22.b4  Nxe4  23.Nxe4  ± }
21. Ke2 { Tomashesvsky bolsters his center a bit. } 21... Nac5 22. Nxc5
{ Although this is the most human move, simplifying the position, it could be that Bc2 was better.   22.Bc2  Nf6   22...Nxe4  23.Nxe4  Nc5  24.f3  ±  Is similar.  23.Nxf6  Rxf6  24.Bxf5   24.Kd2  ±  White will be eternally better.  24...Rxf5  25.Bxc5 ?!  bxc5 !  Proving why b6 was useful and now the open b-file and e4 are annoying to deal with as white. }
22... Nxc5 23. Bxf5 Rxf5 24. Rab1
{ Tomashevsky smartly lays off of the c5 knight.   24.Bxc5 ?!  bxc5  ∓  We've seen this line before. }
24... e4
{ Black got his bishop active and it looks like the knight will be annoying on d3, but white plays cooly and calmly. From here, white executes a series of maneuvering moves that ask black: "What's your plan if I double on the g-file and bring my knight to d4 ?" }
25. Nb5 { White has both Nxc7 and the simple Nd4 planned. } 25... Rf7
{ c7 had to be protected. } 26. Rg4 Kh7 27. Nd4
{ The knight hugs the d4 square too well. } 27... a4 28. b4
{ It's important to keep the position closed.   28.bxa4 ?  Ra8  ⇆ } 28... Bxd4
29. Bxd4 Nd3
{ All white has to do is deal with the one trick pony threat on f2. } 30. Rbg1
{ Doubling on the g-file as mentioned before. Rg7 is a huge threat. } 30...
Ree7 31. Rg8 { It's hard to suggest anything else for white. } 31... Ne5
{ Rh8# was threatened. } 32. Rc8
{ Not a bad move, but I think Ra8 was more natural and better.   32.Ra8  I think it was tempting to grab on a4 soon instead. Probably black would have tried to attack f2 in response.  32...Rf3  33.Rg3  Rxg3  34.fxg3  Nxc4  35.h5  Ne5  36.Rxa4  ±  Would have been a nice position  (weak pawn on e4 and outside passer on the a-file incoming) }
32... Rf4
{ 32...Rf5  Apparently this was better as it covers e5 cleanly. Now if Bxe5, at least black has Rfxe5 to keep a clean structure.  33.Bxe5  Rfxe5  ∆ }
33. Bxe5 dxe5 { Ugly, but necessary.   33...Rxe5  34.Rxc7+  Kh8  35.Rg6  +- }
34. c5 bxc5 35. bxc5 Ref7
{ Although this ending is interesting in its own right, due to the scope of this course, I will focus less on it due to the irrelevance it has on the course. It's more important to remember the ideas from move 15 to 32. }
36. d6
{ Apparently this rook endgame leads to a forced draw. It just shows you how tough it can be to find the right continuation.   36.Ke3 !  Rxf2  37.c6 !  Was what Tomashevsky missed arguably. White now threatens Rxc7 Rxc7 Kxf2 so black has to move the f2 rook.  37...R2f3+   37...Rc2  Would do nothing, while in the game, c5 was weak.  38.Rd8 !  38.Kxe4  Rxa3  39.Rd8  ±  Rd7+ is quite hard for black to deal with and white has very good winning chances with d6 incoming. }
36... Rxf2+ 37. Ke3 Rc2 { Now the pawn chain crumbles. } 38. Re8 cxd6 39. cxd6
Rc4
{ Tomashevsky must not have appreciated black's chances in this ending. It looks great for white, but the resulting position is drawish. }
40. Re7 Rxe7 41. dxe7 Rc8 42. Rc1 Re8 43. Kxe4
{ 43.Rc7  Left more fight in the position, but really it's all the same.  43...Kg7  44.Kxe4  Kf6  45.h5  Rxe7 !  46.Rxe7  Kxe7  47.Kxe5  Kf7  48.Kf5  Ke7  49.Kg6  Ke6  50.Kxh6  Kf6  51.Kh7  Kf7  52.h6  Kf8  53.Kg6  Kg8  54.Kf5  Kh7  55.Ke5  Kxh6  56.Kd4  Kg7  57.Kc4  Kf8  58.Kb4  Ke8  59.Kxa4  Kd8  60.Kb5  Kc8  61.a4  Kb8  62.a5  Ka8 = }
43... Rxe7 44. Rc4 Kg6 45. Rxa4 { Draw incoming. } 45... Re6 46. Ra8 Rf6 47.
Kxe5 Rf5+ 48. Kd6 Rf4
{ Both sides will sack their rook for the advancing passed pawns soon. } 49. a4
Rxh4 50. Kc5 h5 51. a5 Ra4 52. Kb5 Ra1 53. Rd8 h4 54. a6 Kg5 55. Rd5+ Kg4 56.
Rd4+ Kg3 57. Ra4 Rb1+ 58. Kc5 Rb8 59. a7 Ra8 60. Kb6 h3 61. Ra3+
{ The game was unfortunately a draw for Tomashevsky, who played a great positional middlegame, but couldn't press for more in the resulting endgame. I would take note about how elegant white's central light-squared play was in this game before anything else. A blockading knight on e4 was the real reason why black's pieces were, in large part, stymied and couldn't move much until move 36. }

Nc5 15. a4
{ White fixes the structure up before proceeding. I consider this to be an interesting and good decision before proceeding on the kingside. It's important to limit black's pawn play on the queenside with b5. White also prevents black from trading off a pair of knights of Nca4/Nba4 as well.   15.Nd2  Nba4 !?  Is an interesting idea prevented by 15. a4, for example   15.Bxc5 !?  ∞  Would be a positionally risky decision worth exploring.

38. Rxd2

38... Bxd2

h1=Q 42. d8=Q+ Kh7 43. Qd5

{ White doesn't have much choice.   18.Nf5  axb3  ∓  when white is down a pawn for some sketchy kingside activity based compensation. }

{ The rook will swing over to h2 now. This is an unusual & specifically good idea allowed by 17. f3.   19.Rb1  ∞  Probably also okay for white, but why would you like this over Ra2-Rh2 ? }
19... f5 { 19...Nd4  20.Bd3  ±  Would have been similar to the game. } 20. Rh2
{ White calmly shifts focus over to the h-pawn. Maybe this wasn't the best move, but it's hard to blame white for such a natural move. The point is white should aim to keep the position open with exf5.   20.exf5  Bxf5  21.Ne4  Nd4  22.Rh2  ±  Would have kept the position open and good for white. }
20... f4
{ Now the position closes down and white's light squared bishop and c3 knight largely have no role on the kingside anymore. }
21. Bf2 c5
{ Black plays energetically and further tries to play on the queenside. I mean, what else is black suppose to do ?   21...c6  Probably the more natural move, planning to play cxd5 and hope to use the c-file in a few moves also made sense.  22.Rgh1 !

I will hold off on spouting long variations as it isn't a good use of your time.  23...dxc5  Probably is a more sane, stable move than Nf5.  24.Nf5  ±  Nxc4 ?  25.Bxc4  Qa5  26.Qd2 }
23. Qd3
{ The game is pretty much killed off after black's next move, which was very easy to miss.   23.Bd3 !  The queen is not in harms way as it is in the mainline. At least, this way, Nxc4 isn't an issue.  23...Nxc4 ?  24.Bxc4  Qa5  25.Qd3  ±  When b5 is far harder to get in now. }

It's hard to move anything, in general.   27.Kd1  An engine move that is mostly suggested because white wants to play Na2-Nb4 to stabilize the queenside.  27...b4  ∞  Would have posed serious problems for white to deal with.   27.g6  h6  is not helping white much. }
27... Bxh3 28. Rxh3 Nd4
{ And players prematurely agreed to a draw here. The game still could have gone on for a bit and white would have had to find some annoying moves to keep themselves afloat. For example, one line might look like: }
29. Qd2 b4 30. axb4 Qxb4 31. Nf5 { Rxh5 incoming. } 31... Nb3 32. Qc2 a3

21. Rd2 Nb8 { Finally, black sees the light and jumps on the Nc6-d4 } 22. Nd5

11. Rg1
{ As we've seen in the 10..Nb6 and 10..c6 lines, Rg1 is a common move to discourage f5 and prepare a kingside advance with h4-h5 & g5. The main reason Rg1 is played before Nd2 usually is because white wants to meet Bf6 with g5. If Nd2 was played instead of Rg1, then Bf6 g5 would drop a pawn.   11.Nd2  White can also play this the natural retreating Nd2, but I will not cover it in this course.

16. Nxa4 { Yoink. } 16... cxd5 17. exd5
{ Understandably, white didn't want to see the c8 rook make contact with the queen and didn't want to exchange bishops. It's very difficult to recommend a move for black here. Ordinarily, I would recommend trying to get in f5, but it only weakens the kingside. Besides, white would like to play on the kingside anyways with the typical h4-h5-hxg6/h6: why help white in accomplishing that ?   17.cxd5 ?!  Bxf1  18.Rdxf1  Ne6  When white has to deal with an annoying knight coming to d4.  19.Qd3  Nd4  20.Nb3 ??  b5 !  Already wins for black.   17.Nxc5  Nxc5  18.cxd5  Was also possible, but still the knight comes to d4. Thankfully, there's no knight stuck on a4 so it's bearable   compared to the  17.cxd5  sideline   18.exd5  ±  Likewise, a reasonable move.  18...Bxf1  19.Rdxf1  Ne6  20.Qd3  Nd4 }
17... Nb7
{ I think the point of this strange move is to free the d7 square for the queen: By retreating to b7, black allows the d7 knight to jump to c5 and the queen to go to d7. It looks very slow from my view point.   17...f5 ?  18.gxf5  Rxf5  19.Nc3  +-  White has great control over the center and this looks like a strategically winning position with a knight hopping to e4 soon. }
18. Qb3
{ White entire point of Qb3 is to bait trades on c5. Since b6 can not be defended properly, black obligues.   18.Nc3  ±  Angling for Nce4 made some sense. Note that f5 isn't a real threat since gxf5 gxf5 Bh6 utilizes the pin on the g-file. }
18... Ndc5 { Leads to a few trades that don't help or hurt either side. } 19.
Nxc5 Nxc5 20. Qc2 Qd7 { Black completes their development. } 21. Bxc5
{ Apparently, this is a serious mistake, but I doubt many people would intentionally close the c-file: a point of counterplay for black. g5 was more natural and probably would be my move.   21.g5  →  Followed by the typical h4-h5 with nefarious intentions on the kingside. }
21... Rxc5
{ 21...bxc5  22.Ne4  ±  After white plays g5-h4, the kingside is secure and white will be considerably better. Still, black has benko like compensation with the open a & b files and the position is far from conclusive. }
22. Ne4 { There's no more natural move than this. } 22... Rc7
{ White, in my opinion, already missed a flat out win  (but plays it on the next move anyways)  . }
23. Qb3
{ Missing the chance to play c5 has to hurt a bit.   23.c5  Bxf1   23...bxc5  24.Bxa6  +-  24.c6  +-  Is curtains for black. The c6 pawn wins the game itself, being protected and all. }
23... Rfc8
{ 23...Qd8  Would at least avoid c5-c6 since it doesn't come with tempo on the queen on d7.  24.c5   24.Be2  ±  White is better with many different moves. Black's queenside pawns are weak and the kingside is prime for playing on in view of h4-h5 eventuallly.  24...Bxf1  25.c6 ??  Is not a tempo like the game. }
24. c5 { Now white sees the light and the game becomes a conversion task. }
24... Bxf1 25. c6
{ The point of white's play and will cost black serious material. The rest of this game is a conversion task and nothing requires serious attention at all. }

{ And black resigned because the pawns are too quick. I think this was a nice game for showing a few key ideas: Often an early Qc2 and long castles is essential to play before doing anything else. Also, don't be afraid to play with exd5. While it makes the structure non-symmetric, it also kept more pieces on the board, as in the game. }

17. Be2 { A simple developing move is the calm before the storm. } 17... Rd8
{ The only purpose of moving the rook to d8 is to free up the f8 square for a minor piece. }
18. Nf3
{ A fine developing move. It turns out white already had a brilliancy waiting that is very easy to avoid playing in g5. There is no shame in playing like white did in the game.   18.g5  Already would be super powerful in view of white's brilliant follow up.  18...h5  Anything else opens the kingside needlessly for black.  19.Bxh5 !!  An absolutely brilliant sacrificial move that is hard to play from the far. I don't blame white for not playing like this.  19...gxh5  20.g6 !  Is the point. Black has to close the g-file to avoid getting the kitchen sink thrown at them, so either f5 or f6 have to be played.  20...f5   20...f6  21.Qf3 !  ↑  Followed by Qh5 with a nice attack on the kingside for white.  21.exf5  Nf6  Positions like this show why engines are so powerful. I would think white has decent compensation for a piece with Qg5, but stockfish points out Qf3 is even better:  22.Qf3  Protecting f5 and also leaving the g5 square vacant.  22...Rf8  23.Rg5 !  Threatening Rxh5  23...Bh6   23...e4  Probably a better try to give counterplay.  24.Qg3  ∞ ↑  With a largely messy position that is hard to understand. Probably white will sacrifice on h5 and voluntarily be down a rook for massive attacking chances on the kingside.  24.Rxh5  Bxe3  25.fxe3  Nxh5  26.Qxh5  Yes, despite being down a rook, white has huge long term advantages with the passers.  26...Qc7  Mate on h7 was threatened.  27.e4  +-  With a fantastic position for white on the kingside. I love lines like this. }
18... cxd5
{ Understandably, Ohtake captures to help prepare Rb8-b5, but is rudely awakened whe white uncorks a beauty on his position. }
19. Nxd5
{ It doesn't look obvious what capturing with the knight does and Ohtake surely missed his opponent's idea.   19.cxd5 ?  Rb8  20.Nd2  b5  21.Na2  Na6  ∓  Makes it difficult for white to play b5.   19.exd5  ±  Was reasonable and would have left with a fine game. }

{ Was the point to take on c8 ?   20...Kh8  21.Qg3  +-  Followed by Qh4 and the kingside is falling apart.   21.h4  +-  Also strong, of course with the idea of supporting Ng5.  21...Be6  22.Ng5  ↑   20...Kh7  21.h4  ↑  Ng5 looms and black should be on edge. }
21. Nf5 { Nope, it was brutally open the kingside with Kasparov-like knight. }
21... gxf5
{ Black could decline to take, but it's not like white is out of ideas to suddenly improve their own position.   21...Be6  Trying to act like the knight is not there.  22.Nd2 !  Defends c4 and waits for black to to anything on the queenside.  22...Nb3  23.Qf1  White is no rush to do anything and Qf1 is a quiet and strong waiting move. It's all about restricting black's play in this position. By reinforcing c4, black's queenside expansion is ineffective and thereby they lack a constructive plan. Also note the silly position of the knight on b6: it blocks the needed b5 break and stares at the c4 wall.  23...Rd7  Black has a hard time stopping Nxd6. Rd7 is a token line.  24.Nxb3  axb3  25.Nxd6  +- }

24. Nh2
{ A super strong move that I'm certain black did not feel until impact. Also, e4 hangs, so moving the knight somewhere was forced.   24.Ng5  Rg8  25.Qf3  Rxg5 !  Is a key difference between the game and this line: black is able to capture on g5 when white is able to not recapture with hxg5. Having the h-pawn involved is why Ng2-Ng4 in the game is so strong. }

Overall, I believe Tauber's concept with Nxd6-Ne7-Nf5 was a neat one to keep in mind going further since white heavily relies on the g-file to be used in this variation anyways. }

{ 14...f4  Closing the position might look like it might help black, but white has a clear plan of playing on the kingside with Qf3-h5 to open the floodgates.  15.Bxc5  The position will be closed so the loss of the dark squared bishop will not feel as large as it usually would.  15...Nxc5  Has been reached in a couple of games and white has won a couple of one-sided games in Arnaudov vs Kzakos & Riazantsev vs Belyakov. I encourage the reader to look at both games for ideas. Qf3-h5-Rh1-Bh3 are reasonable moves white can play moving further. }

16... Bf8 17. Qc2
{ I know the engine heavily criticizes Qc2, but it's the most understandable move. White wants to queenside castle, take on e4 and shift all of the focus to the kingside. Taking on f4 feels like its handing over the initiative.   17.Bxf4  exf4  18.Ncxe4  ±  Seems to be better for white, but I would still be anxious gifting the e5 square away. At least the f8 bishop will be dead for the foreseeable future  (it can only shuffle between d8, f8 & e7)  . Qc2 followed by long castles would lead to a tough fight with chances for both sides. }

{ b3 is weak in the long run and largely unnecessary to grab right now. Still, the resulting positions aren't clear at all.

{ On a sidenote, has there ever been as weird and as offside of a piece as the rook on h4 ? It's in no man's land serving one purpose  (protecting e4)  . }
20. O-O-O { White finally castles after a long wait. } 20... Nb6
{ Black moves the knight so that they can complete their development  (Bf5 specifically)  .   20...Nc5  Was arguably more natural.  21.Bxc5  dxc5  22.Qe3  Bf5  ∞  Would have a reasonable continuation for both sides and would have given chances for both sides. }
21. Be2 { Developing. } 21... Bf5
{ The most natural square for the bishop and helps protect e4. } 22. Rg3
{ White wants to over protect g5 so that black's dark-squared bishop never sees the light of day.   22.Rh1  Was an interesting move that white could have considered. While the h4 rook does nothing, it's nice to remove it, similar to how it's nice to use mosquito spray on an outdoor camping trip. It's a lingering pest of a piece.  22...Rxh1  23.Rxh1  ±  Would have been similar to the game, but without a pair of rooks on the board. }
22... Be7 23. Rdg1
{ Further reinforcement of g5 makes it difficult for black to use any of their minor pieces effectively. }
23... Nd7
{ Rerouting to c5, the square that the knight should have gone in the first place.   23...c6  Also was a reasonable move, angle to open the c-file. }
24. Bd1
{ Planning to take on b3 and also free up the c2 square for the bishop to come back and pressure the e4 pawn. }
24... Nc5
{ I'll be frank, while Nc5 is the most natural move for black, is a strategic mistake. White fractures black's pawn center up and it is hard to put together any constructive plan for black in the resulting position. c6-Qa5 followed by Nc5 is probably a better choice in hindsight because of the deformed pawn structure in the game.   24...c6  25.Bxb3  Qa5  This is better than the game since now black can play Nc5 and recapture on c5 with the queen, thereby keeping a clean pawn structure. }
25. Bxc5 dxc5 26. Qe3 { Black's pawns are all weak and drop off quickly. }
26... c6
{ 26...Qd6  27.Bxb3  ±  Followed by Bc2 and Nxe4 would not help black at all. }
27. Bxb3 Qf8
{ It's difficult to give black constructive advice. The h4 rook is a spectator and both bishops are clogged behind pawn wall. One would think b5 would be a source of play, but black never goes for it.   27...Rb8  28.Bc2  cxd5  29.Nxd5  b5  Would have been atrocious, structurally speaking, but at least black has some open lines to work with. }
28. Bc2 Rd8 29. Bxe4 Bxe4 30. Nxe4
{ It's easy to understand white's knight is day and night compared to the e7 bishop. }
30... Qf5
{ 30...cxd5  31.cxd5  Rxd5  32.Nc3  +-  Would have left black in ruins since e5 is weak. }
31. Nc3 { 31.Re1  +-  Kept everything stable and solid. } 31... Rxc4
{ Seems to be a mistake, but not taking probably didn't cross black's mind.   31...Rf4 !  Preventing Rf3 as in the game.  32.Qd3  Rxf2  ∞  Would have been still a fight with chances for both sides. }
32. Rf3
{ Oops, all of a sudden it's difficult to move the queen because e5 hangs with mate on g7  (Qxe5-Qg7#)  . A rook trade is not what black wanted and it leads to a super one sided endgame. }
32... Rf4 33. Rxf4 Qxf4 { 33...exf4  34.Qxe7  +- } 34. Qxf4 exf4 35. dxc6 bxc6
{ Black's structure is horrific and white will establish a tyrant knight on e4 that will squeeze black's bishop down. }
36. Ne4 Rd4 37. f3 { The knight is unchallenged and too strong. } 37... Kg8 38.
Rd1 Rc4+
{ Rd5+ while more natural, loses the game due to simplifications.   38...Rd5  39.Nf6+ !  Bxf6  40.Rxd5  cxd5  41.gxf6  and white wins the K+P endgame.  41...Kf7   41...g5  42.a4  g4  43.fxg4  f3  44.Kd2  d4  45.b3 !  Kf7  46.a5  +-  42.a4  Kxf6  43.a5  And the a-pawn promotes. }
39. Kb1 Kf7 40. b3
{ Simple and strong, white trades off the rooks to force an extremely one-sided B v N endgame }
40... Rd4 41. Rxd4 cxd4 42. a4
{ There's no time to go Ke6-Kf5-Bxf5 beacuse of the a-pawn. The rest is trivial. }
42... Bb4 43. Kc2 Ke7 44. Nf6 Be1 45. Nxh7
{ And black resigned because all of the pawns will drop. Overall, I think the main takeaways from this game relate to how white should react to an early Rf4, sacrificing an exchange. I encourage the reader to understand how to keep black's dark-squared bishop at bay if they ever take with Bxf4 early on. Otherwise, you'll likely get closed, static structures. }

{ The main idea black aims for in the 7..Nh5 setups are related with pushing for an early f5 or use the f4 square to pester white's kingside. }
8. g3
{ In my experience with playing & researching this line for white, there's a few reasons for why g3 is a beneficial move. The point isn't to fianchetto the light-squared bishop to g2. In almost every single line we will see in this chapter, white will never play the bishop to g2.  It looks natural to play Bg2 followed by castling kingside though. Why doesn't white opt for this ?   Well, white could opt for Bg2, but it doesn't make sense to play for Bg2 in view of that white could have played the fianchetto variation:   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  g6  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.Nf3  O-O  5.g3  and gotten to the similar structures. Also, it's not consistent with any line in the repertoire. While it's important to be flexible in the opening lines we play, I believe it's more important to be principled and consistent in the lines we play.  The main reason for white plays for 8. g3 is that it controls the f4 and h4 squares. h4 can be utilized for the knight on f3 and you should not be surprised to see white playing Nh4 in many lines. Also, deterring black from playing Nf4 is nice. If you're unsure why moves like 8. Be2 aren't played, it's because Nf4 is annoying to deal with.  Instead of g3, White has tried Nh2 as a serious alternative. If you're interested in exploring it, you may do so. I will not cover it in this course.   8.Nh2 }

{ c5, while looking like a reasonable move because it grabs space in the center, only makes white's job easy compared to lines in Chapter 7 with 8..f5. }
9. Be3
{ As we will see in this chapter and chapter 8, white always has an inner struggle of deciding is it okay to play Be3 in view of f5-f4 ? Here it makes sense. }
9... f5
{ Striking in the center. Do not be afraid or panic when your opponent plays f5 in these structures with a bishop on e3. f5 isn't black's only idea, but what else is black going to do in order to justify why the knight is on h5 ? All other moves don't help their position and only encourage white to play Nd2 to keep an eye on the knight on h5.   9...Na6  10.Nd2  ±  When black can't play f5 anytime soon  (f5 exf5 loses material for black)  . }
10. exf5
{ I've discussed, at length, the counterintuitive nature of f5 exf5 for white in Chapter 7, but the main point is to open up the center quickly to exploit loose pieces and weaknesses in black's camp. }
10... gxf5
{ Black opts for the natural pawn duo in the center.   10...Bxf5  11.g4  +-   10...Rxf5  11.g4  +- }
11. Nh4
{ Essentially, this position is an improved version of lines given in Chapter 7. White usually never gets in Be3, under good terms, in the 8..f5 lines. }
11... Nf6
{ 11...Nf4  12.Qd2  ±  With an improved version of the Nf4 lines given in Chapter 8. White will castle queenside and c5 is not a move usually advised for black to play as it closes the position a bit and takes away a square that could be used for the knight on b8.   11...Qe8 ?  Also a common move in Chapter 7, but can be with Nb5 and black has no way of defending both c7 & d6  12.Nb5  f4  13.Nxd6  Qd8  14.Qxh5  +-  No matter which way black recaptures, you play Bd3 and have a massive attack on the light squares. }
12. Bd3
{ As we will seen in many variations in this chapter, Bd3 is more or less an intentional tempo-losing move with one idea in mind: bait black to play e4 and weaken the central structure. Once black advances with e4, the e3 & f4 squares will be holes for our pieces to play on. Black should tread carefully from here. }
12... e4
{ f5 is attacked and its not like black has better ways of defending it. I've noted in Chapter 8, in positions without c5, that Ne8 & f4 are interesting ideas to look at, but aren't that good. }
13. Be2
{ I'll stop here and say that this position is a better version of related Nf6 lines in the mainline listed within Chapter 7. White will play Ng2-Nf4-O-O and be better as I explain there. It's essential to read Chapter 7 to get a good grasp of these positions. }

I'd hold off on playing a4 as it is a bit unnecessary to make such a committal move when queenside castling should not be ruled out.  b5  11.a3  ±  White could also play Be2 with a great position.

14... c5
{ The most forcing move.As noted in 'Sacrifices/Breakthroughs #11: The messy f4' in the Introduction chapter, white is not afraid of checks along the e-file because of Kd2 and is often safe enough on d2. }

17. Qxe5 Bxe5 18. O-O-O
{ The reality hits hard as soon as white plays Ne4-Ng5-Rhg1: Black's light-squares are swiss cheese and white is dominating. Also, black has almost nothing developed which helps a lot justify the evaluation. }

{ The good news about 8..Qe8 is that it most often transposes to a related Qe8 line in Chapter 7. The main reason why black plays Qe8 is to protect h5 after f5 exf5. The knight protected via the queen on e8. }
9. Be2
{ Unfortunately for us, it is best advised to avoid setups with Be3. You have to understand a few nuances in these lines on where you should place both bishops. We will still play with the typical exf5 gxf5 Nh4 idea we've seen before. The main idea of playing Be2 is to poke at h5 so that black has some difficulties to solve. This is somewhat akin to the 8..Nd7 line   9.Be3 ?!  f5  10.exf5  gxf5  11.Nh4 ??  f4  -+  Usually, we would be able to play Qxh5, but now that the queen is on e8, h5 is defended. }

In this variation, however, it is inadvisable to play Be3 without some preparation first. The main reason is that Be3 gets hit with f4. It's important to be more nuanced in your play than to play Be3 blindly. }
12. Qc2
{ White prepares to play Be3 next move followed by long castling. I cover this line in Chapter 7 under the 'Sideline: 10.Nh4 Qe8' variation.   12.Be3 ?!  is like a bull waving a red flag in front of a bull by baiting  f4  Note that with the queen on  e8  ,  f4  makes some sense as the  13.gxf4  exf4  would open the e-file while our king is still stuck in the center and incur big risk after, say  14.Bd4  c5  15.dxc6  Nxc6  Generally, if you want to play  Be3  , it's important to be one move away from long castles if black has a major piece on the e-file. }

9. Nh2
{ Nh2 is generally a good waiting move in case black wants to delay f5, while not protecting the knight on h5. We could have considered play Nh2 against moves like 8..c5, 8..c6, etc. The main idea of playing Nh2 is that you want to prophylactically prevent f5 and also prepare Be2. Be3 and Be2 are very reasonable alternatives, but aren't as good for specific reasons.   9.Be3  f5  10.exf5  gxf5  11.Nh4  Nf6  It's interesting that with the 8..Qe8 mainline, instead of Be3 being played, Be2 is played instead. The difference in bishop positions makes a noticeable difference as the normal Qc2 here runs into f4.  12.Qc2 ?!  f4 !  f4  wouldn't have made sense if  Be2  was played instead of  Be3.  Hence,  Nh2  is a good waiting move.   9.Be2  Na6  10.Nh2  f5  11.exf5  Rxf5  with a quite an okay position for black surprisingly. Note that the natural  12.g4  Rxf2  runs into a perpetual after  13.Kxf2  Qh4+  14.Kg1  Qg3+  For this specific line, I prefer delaying the light-squared bishop as a way of saving a tempo in various lines involving  Rxf2  related ideas. }
9... Na6
{ As natural as it gets since black wants to delay f5 for a bit   9...f5 ?  Now  f5  doesn't work at all since the bishop can help shelter the king in  Rxf2  related lines like the following  10.exf5  Rxf5  11.g4  Rxf2  Any other move would give white a great position  12.Kxf2  Qh4+  13.Kg1  Qg3+  14.Bg2  and white is completely winning }

{ 10.Be2  has been tried in a couple of games, but as we've seen before  f5  11.exf5  Rxf5  is considered to be an acceptable position for black. Besides,  Be3  is a good defensive piece since it protects  f2  nullifying the sacrificial idea we've seen before with  f5  exf5  Rxf5  g4. }
10... Nc5
{ A natural developing move. I will cover a couple of games here to help guide us on how white should play these positions. I encourage you to review this sideline a few more times to get a grasp on the slight differences between each of the natural choices white had been presented with on move 9 and 10.   10...f5 ?  11.exf5  loses material for black. Black should be more cautious. }

Despite my earlier advice about never playing the light squared bishop to g2, I am not that dogmatic about it's best spot. If white intends to short castle  (which looks better than long castles at the moment.)  , it makes the most sense to have a bishop on g2 rather than on d3 or e2. Generally, a good rule of thumb is that if the pawn structure is fixed, blockaded or closed enough, you can safely castle kingside in many of the variations in the last chapter. If not, then you have to make an intelligent decision regarding where your king should go.   13.Qd2  Also was possible.  13...Nc5  14.O-O-O  ± }

This is the type of position I would love to play for fun regardless of who wins.   27...a4  ±  Apparently, this simple move  (found by the engine, not me)  keeps black in the game.

{ In my view, Na6 is a less flexible version of setups listed in the last few chapters. Nevertheless, it poses challenges for white that can not be ignored. }
9. Be3
{ The simple developing move takes advantage of the fact black has not yet played f5 and aims to quickly castle queenside after Qc2/Qd2. I'll note that Nh2 and Be2 are both interesting tries, but both have slight downsides.   9.Nh2 !?  White's goal is to deter f5 as much as possible. The downside of this variation is that, compared to the Tomashevsky-Grischuk game, black has not yet committed themself to playing the queen to e7. It's a wasted move often. Meanwhile, Nc5 will be played soon and it is a far more useful move for black to play with as Nc5 is ubiquitously played in all lines later in the course. With the queen on d8, it is also reasonable to think that black could play with c6-Qb6/Qa5 as well.  9...Nc5   9...c6 !?  Very reasonable for black to play.  10.Be3  a5  We've arrive at a problem point for white to solve. If white plays the natural Be2, then after Nf6 Qc2, black will have arguably gained a valuable tempo compared to the Tomashevsky-Grischuk game.  11.Be2  Nf6  If we had both h4 and Qe7 inserted in this position, then we would have had the Tomashevsky-Grischuk game. However, without these two moves, white has some issues as h3 is hanging and black has not wasted moving his queen to e7.  12.Qc2  Bxh3  =∞  Is a downside of this reasonable variation. I'm not saying that white doesn't have compensation for the pawn, but the real question is: Why would you play for an inferior version of the previously mentioned game ?   9.Be2  A natural move as it anticipates f5.  9...f5  10.exf5  gxf5  11.Nh4   11.Bg5 !?  Some strong players, from both colors, have played Bg5, but the move is not consistent with the themes I've outlined in this course.  11...Nf4  Leads to worse version, for white, of the Nf4 lines in Chapter 14. The main reason is in the mainline I have listed in Chapter 14, instead of Be2, we have Bd2 instead played, which is a far more useful move as it prepares queenside castling quickly. Be2 does nothing in this position other than poke at thin air. gxf4 is mostly played here, but it's easy to see why having a bishop on d2 instead of e2 is better.  12.gxf4  Qxh4  13.fxe5  For the purposes of demonstrating an idea within Chapter 14, I've chosen fxe5 as white's move.  13...Bxe5  14.Rg1+  Kh8  15.Bg5  =∞  Normally this variation would be good for white. Since the bishop is on e2 however, h3 is unguarded and can be taken. White has good compensation for the pawn, but I believe this shows that Be2 is an inferior move in nature compared to keeping the bishop on f1. We do not want to give black additional options by playing Be2. If the bishop was on f1, then Qd4 would be forced after Bg5 and would lead to a nice game for white. I discuss this structure in extensive detail in Chapter 14. }
9... f5
{ 9...Nc5 ?  A natural move by black, but wastes time.  10.Nd2 !  White improves the knight position, overprotects e4, and prepares Be2-g4 for a quick kingside pawnstorm.  10...a5  If black tries to transpose to lines in chapter 10 & 11 then they will be down a tempo compared to lines there  (Note that the insertion of g2-g3 vs Nh5)  will have only benefited white ultimately as we will see here.  11.Be2  Black is forced to retreat.  11...Nf6  12.g4  ±  With a great version of lines discussed in chapter 10 & 11 . White's already up a tempo compraed to various lines there. }
10. exf5
{ A commonplace move that we've seen in many previous sidelines. Please also note that Nc5 is a complete waste of time after Nd2. }
10... gxf5 { Other recaptures lose a piece. } 11. Nh4
{ I like sticking to our tried and trusty Nh4 maneuver to gain a tempo on h5. Certainly Qd2 and Ng5 are worth exploring.   11.Qd2  Nc5  12.O-O-O  a5  ∞  I can't say I'm all too familiar with the current position and piece placements. Usually, black's knight has moved away from the h5 square or has moved to e8 to defend it. Here, black has not wasted any time on thinking about it. Meanwhile, white has quickly castled queenside and appears prime for some brutal g4 pawn sacrifice. I leave it to the reader to explore this position.  13.g4 !?   11.Ng5  The most popular move and has seen much play in many similar positions. I heavily encourage the reader to look in depth at pros and cons of committing to Nh4 versus Ng5.  11...Nf6  12.Qd2  ±  Leads to a nice position for white with queenside castling in sight. }
11... Nf6
{ 11...f4 ?  12.Qxh5  fxe3  13.Bd3  ↑  We will cover a game of mine that I had in this line.   11...Qe8  Leads to a worse version of Chapter 13's Qe8 lines. The main argument white has here is that they get a nice Queen+bishop battery on d2-e3. Normally, white has to commit the queen to c2 or some unnatural square.  12.Be2  Nf6  White can transpose to the 10..Qe8 mainline we will see next chapter with a3 here. There's no need to play a3 here though and we can get a slightly better version of those positions here.   12...Nf4  Note that this just drops a piece as the e-file is defended twice by the bishops.  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Bd4  +-  13.Qd2 !  With the insertion of the bishop on e3 and knight on a6, It is safe to play Qd2 without worry of black playing f4.   13.a3  Followed by Qc2 and long castles leads to a nice position for white. This line will transpose to the Qe8 mainline outlined in Chapter 13.   13.Qc2  Usually white is advised not to play Qc2 because black can Nb4 or f4 and gain time on our queen.  13...f4   13...Nb4   11...Nf4  Also is possible, but a worse version of the Nf4 variations outline in Chapter 14 as the moves, Na6 and Be3 have been played. Yes, the insertion of these moves makes a big difference since after Qd2, white is one move away from castling and black does not have ideas of Ng6 followed by f4.  12.Qd2  ±  Ng6  13.Nxg6  hxg6  ±  When it is obvious that black would rather have f4 as a move here than Na6 inserted. Whie is just clearly better after long castles. }
12. Bd3
{ A move we have seen time and time again. The aim is to induce weaknesses. I stress to you that Qd2, in this specific position, might be better. I recommend Bd3 primarily because it lines up so well with previous lines listed in the chapter.   12.Qd2 !?  You can argue that in this specific position, Qd2 is better than Bd3.  If you're interested in exploring it, you can look at the game: Neumeier vs Kessler- 2015.  Neumeier, K. - Kessler, L., 0-1, Vienna Open 2015, @@LinkStart@@https://lichess.org/ObxvHCO7@@LinkEnd@@ }
12... f4
{ 12...e4  13.Be2  Transposes to the mainline of the Nf6 related lines in Chapter 15.   12...Ne8  White has many ways of proceeding. I generally like f4 as a move whenever black retreats with Ne8. f4 might not be good here though because black can respond with Nc5 and immediately ask questions about the light squared bishop. Qh5 is also very reasonable. Compared to lines in Chapter 15, we have once again the moves, Be3 and Na6 inserted. I'm not sure which side has benefitted more.  13.f4   13.Qh5 !?  13...Nc5  14.O-O  Nxd3  15.Qxd3  ∞  When white's light squares are very weak, but for now the position is closed and white's space shouldn't be underestimated despite the funky looking pieces on d3 & h4. }

{ 15...c5  We will cover this move in the next game.   15...Nc5  A natural move like Nc5 deserves some attention.  16.Rg1  Qe7+  Probably not best, but illistrates a nice idea white always has in mind in case black checks on the e-file.  17.Kd2 !  The king walk looks risky, but is perfectly safe on d2. Don't be afraid to play Kd2 in positions like this whenever checks are given along the e-file.  17...Nxd3  What else should black play ?   17...Bd7  18.Qf3  +-  When white is fully coordinated.  18.Kxd3  +-  Despite the ridiculous king position, white will play Qf3, Kc2 and retreat the king safely with a great position. }
16. Rg1
{ Alonso plays the most aggressive option and anticipates knight jumps from f6. Rxg7+ is always an idea to keep an eye on. }
16... Nxd3+
{ 16...c5  Probably a better move than the game and leads to super sharp play as shown in the following line.  17.dxc6  Nxc6  18.Bxh7+  Probably white can force a draw with this move, but Be4 keeps more pieces on the board.   18.Be4  Guarding d4 unusually and keeping the bishop en prise on e4.  18...Nxd4   18...Qe8 ?  It's natural to try and take advantage of the pin.  19.Bxf6  Rxf6  20.Qd2  ↑  Followed by long castles leaves white with good chances to attack on the light squares.   18...Qe7 ?  19.Bxf6  Rxf6  20.Qh5  ↑  When black is toast on the light squares and white will castle queenside with a strong attack.  19.Qxd4  Qe7  20.O-O-O  Nxe4  21.Nxe4  Kh8  22.Qd3  ∞ ⇆  With an ultra-sharp position that can go either way. I suspect many players wouldn't mind playing this position as black. Still, white is doing quite well and has their own attacking chances on the kingside as well. I consider this to be the critical lines of all of the f4 related lines in this chapter.  22...Bd7  23.Ng5  Be5  18...Kxh7  19.Qd3+  Kg8  20.Rxg7+  Kxg7  21.Qg6+  Kh8  22.Qh6+  Kg8  23.Kd2  Nxd4  24.Rg1+  Ng4  25.Rxg4+  Bxg4  26.Qg6+ =   16...Re8+  17.Kd2 !   16...Qe7+  17.Kd2 ! }
17. Qxd3
{ White threatens to queenside castle followed by Ne4 to open up all lines. }
17... Nh5
{ Black resolves the tension right away and it's hard to recommend any other move anyways.   17...Qe7+  18.Kd2 !   17...Ne8  18.Bxg7  Transposes to the game. }
18. Bxg7
{ 18.Nf3  Funnily enough this is playable.  18...Bf5  19.Bxg7 !  Bxd3  20.Bf6+  Bg6  21.Bxd8  Raxd8  22.O-O-O  ± }
18... Nxg7 19. Nf3 { h4 was attacked so it had to move. } 19... Bf5
{ Gaining time on the queen.   19...Bxh3  Grabbing the pawn is possible, but would only help white because it opens the h-file.  20.Nd4  Attacking h3 & preventing Bf5. One sample line that might follow could be the following:  20...f3  21.O-O-O  Qf6  22.Rg3  Bf5  23.Nxf5  Qxf5  24.Ne4  →  When black should be concerned about Rdg1/Rh1 & Qc3 to hone in on g7. White can also get the pawn back easily with Re1-Re3 and take on f3, if nothing else. }
20. Qd4 { The queen makes the most sense on this aggresively posted square. }
20... Qf6
{ Black obviously is feeling the heat on g7 so a queen trade makes some sense to offer.   20...Rf7  21.O-O-O  ↑  Would leave white with a straightforward kingside play.   20...Re8+  21.Kd2 !  The king is perfectly safe on d2. }
21. h4
{ h3 was hanging and its generally useful to prepare moves like Ng5, Rg5. White can also think about further advancing the h-pawn down the line as well.   21.Qxf6  Rxf6  22.h4  ±  Would have also been similar to the game. }
21... Bg6
{ Black prevents h5 and maybe wants to use the f5 square to his advantage. }
22. Qxf6
{ I like the queen trade Alonso goes for. The bishop will be a superfluous piece in this position and thereby have little to no impact.   22.O-O-O  Qf5  Looks really annoying to deal with since  23.Rd2  Rae8  leaves white with an awkward position to play with. }
22... Rxf6 23. Kd2
{ Protecting both d3 and e2, and connects the rooks. White's space advantage, better minor pieces and rooks prime for action on the e and g files should net them a serious advantage. Also, please pay attention to the f4 pawn in this position. It will be a weak target for white to play against as more pieces are traded in this endgame. }

26. Ne4
{ I'm not a big fan of this move, but it doesn't spoil white's position at all.   26.Nd4  Starting with Nd4-b4-c5 looks like a normal plan to me. }
26... Rg6 27. Re1
{ White wanted to avoid rook trades and use the e-file to their advantage, but allowing Rg2 is something I would have prevented, on principle. I like exchanging rooks and would rather aim to apply pressure on f4 instead.   27.Rxg6  Bxg6  28.Nc3  ∓  When white is much better in this endgame. }
27... h6
{ 27...Rg2  28.Ke2  This must have been alonso's idea as with Kf1 coming white will excavate the rook on g2.   28.Nf6+ ?  Kf7  Gives white nothing. }
28. Nd4 { I'm not a fan of the positions of the knights with the rook on g6. }
28... Kf7
{ Black misses their chance to get on the boat and the structure changes quickly.   28...Rg2  Was a better defense in tandem with Bg6. Black also threatens the simple Rh2-Rxh4.  29.Kc3  Bg6  30.f3  Is still nice for white, but was it necessary to allow the rook to g2 ? The rook feels like dirty laundry that hasn't been addressed for a while. }

34. Nxb7 Rxd5 35. Rxd5 cxd5 36. Nc5
{ Hence, why black is down a pawn, There is no way to keep onto the a-pawn. }
36... Nf5
{ Black could try to hold onto a5, but it would only serve as a lever for white's queenside pawns to run.   36...a5  37.b4 !?  White goes all in and plans to advance the a-pawn.  37...axb4+  38.Kxb4  The a-pawn runs quickly and it's tough to see how black copes with it. }

{ Castling queenside is pretty automatic with the queen on c2. In Chapter 13, I recommend castling kingside in the same exact same structure, but the piece placement is slightly different there. Usually, a queen on c2 signals that white should castle queenside.   15.Ng2  Nfd7  16.Nf4  Ne5  Is similar to what I recommend in Chapter 15, but kingside castling is unreasonable in view of  17.O-O ?

It's important to be aware of the relationship between piece placement and which side of the board you want to castle on.  17...Ncd3 !

Rxh3  37.Qe4  Rh4  Otherwise f4 will be taken.  38.Nxc5 !  +-  And black is getting picked apart limb by limb. Soon the knight will retreat and the c & d pawns will run. Black can't take on c5 because the rook drops due to its poor placement on h4.  38...Qxc5 ?  39.Qe5+  Kg8  40.Qg5+  would win the exchange.   34...Rf6  Apparently, this was the best move and white should tread carefully to grab on e4. Probably Qg2-Qf1 followed by f3  (kicking the e4 rook)  would help make progress. Note that white never gets f4 in these lines.  35.Qg2   35.Rxe4  fxe4  36.Qxe4  Bxh3  Would probably help black activate their pieces more than just keeping the tension with 35. Qg2  37.f4 ?!  Bg4  Tickling the d1 rook.  38.Rd2  Bf5  ∓  is annoying to deal with as white, but still interesting even after Qe8+  35...Rg6  36.Qf1  ±  followed by f3 with a sizable edge.   34...Rxc4 ??  35.Ne5  +- }

49. Kc2 Rf1 50. Ne6 Kf7
{ 50...Bxe6  Taking probably is a better drawing attempt.  51.Rxe6  Rxf4  52.Kb3  With good winning chances for white. }
51. Nxc7 Rxf4 52. b3
{ The pawns roll through and in a practical game, white will win this every time. }
52... Bf5+ 53. Kd2 h5 54. Nb5 h4 55. c6 h3 56. Re1
{ Black resigned as there was no way to prevent the pawns from advancing anymore. Overall, I would say it's important to concentrate on the details up until move 34 of this game. A quick opening of the g-file and accurate play helped guide white to a moderately better position that was tough for black to navigate through. }

26. b3
{ A perfectly natural and understandable move, but white misses his chance to win on the spot.   26.Nf6+ !  I suspect both players were in time trouble because it can be easy to be distrustful of the 26..Bxf6 line here.  26...Bxf6   26...Rxf6  27.Qxh7+  Kf8  28.Qxh8+  +-   26...Kf8  27.Qxh7  +-  Bxf6  +-  Transposes to 26..Bxf6  27.Qxh7+  Kf8  28.Rdf1 !

31... Rxd2 32. Qxd2 Qxc3 33. Qxc3 Bxc3 34. Kc2 Bd4 35. Bxh7+
{ And the players agreed to a draw as it is opposite colored bishops with very little chances for either side to win. This game was a firework show that shows the position type is explosive and ripe with tactics for both sides. In my opinion, white's position & plan is easier to concoct, but difficult to play for both sides regardless. }

10... Qe8
{ I think this is the most combative move for black. Black will mindlessly look to play either e4, opening the long-diagonal, or f4 followed by e4 to disrupt White's center. I think White's next move helps keep everything together.   10...Nf6  The knight on h5 wasn't doing much is black's argument for retreating it.  11.Nh4  Transposes to a very common position after:  11...Na6  Has been played in many, many games. White has mostly played Qc2 or Bd3 here with most the games ending in draws. I still think the position is sharp and dynamic.  12.Bd3  I like this move makes more sense than Qc2   12.Qc2  Nb4  13.Qd2  h6  14.Be3  f4  15.gxf4  Nh5  16.Nf3  This position looks very tense to me. Apparently, white is better here, but it does not look easy to play this position. The good news is that White's moves are easy: O-O-O, Rg1, a3 followed by Bd3  12...h6   12...e4  13.Be2  One key benefit of playing Bg5 is that Black would love to play Nd7 followed by Bxc3+ to damage white's queenside structure: now Nd7 hangs the queen.  13...Nc5  Black shouldn't be brash and play h6 yet.   13...h6 ?  14.Be3  Nd7  The same idea with Bxc3+ makes little sense now as after:  15.Qd2  h6 now hangs.  15...Kh7  ±  White can castle on either side here and the position is complicated. I'll take White though.  14.Rc1  a5  15.Ng2  Bd7  16.O-O  ±  Left white doing quite well in Cumming vs Gonzaga.  13.Be3  This position has been played twice by Evgeny Tomashevsky.

The knight belongs on f6  11.Qd2  The most straightforward, aggressive move: O-O-O is on the way.  11...Na6   11...Bxg5  12.Nxg5  Na6  13.O-O-O  →  Is not really an improvement over 11..Na6  12.O-O-O  Nc5  13.Be3  →  The bishop retreats and black's kingside minor pieces are weirdly position. I'm not sure how much better white is, but the plan here is straightforward: blow up the kingside with g4. }
11. Qd2
{ White has played other moves in this position, but I think Qd2 is the only move to justify why the bishop is on g5. It allows queenside castling and pokes h6.   11.Be2  Has been played in a ton of games.  11...Nf6   11...Na6  12.Nh4  Nf6  Transposes to the accompanying sideline.  12.Nh4  Na6  Has been played in over 80 games.   11.Nh4  Na6  12.Be2  Nf6  Transposes to the corollary sideline. }

{ 11...Na6  12.O-O-O  Nc5  13.Nh4  a5  Basically, the game continuation, but black has not committed to Nc5 yet.  14.Rg1  a4  15.Re1  Qf7  16.Be2  Nf6  17.f3  ∞  is an extremely complicated position. Tread cautiously as both kings are bound to come under fire. }
12. O-O-O { Getting to 'safety' } 12... Na6
{ Developing, but this position like Transformers: there's more than meets the eye. It's hard to properly calculate everything. I'd try to do your best to absorb a few ideas from the sidelines.   12...a4  I actually think this move may be better than Na6 as Na6-Nc5 is not necessarily helpful.  13.Rg1  a3  14.b3  Na6  15.g4  None of these are particularly difficult to make.  15...fxg4  16.hxg4  Nf6  17.Nh4  White's attack is powerful, but the position looks crazy sharp to me.  17...Nc5   17...Nxg4  This is way too bold as white gets a strong attack after the aesthetically pleasing  18.Be2  Qh5  19.f3  h6  20.Be7  Rf4  21.fxg4  Qe8  22.g5  h5  23.Bf6  Rxh4  24.Bd3  Nc5  25.Bc2  ±  White seems to be doing well, but the position remains extremely sharp. No one would find this in a game.  18.f3  e4  19.Re1  Nfd7  20.Bh6  Qe5  21.Kc2  ±  Is apparently okay for white, but you can't help but feel that white's king is airy. }
13. Nh4
{ 13.Re1  Is pretty similar to sidelines we've seen already.  13...Nf6  14.Nh4  Ne4  15.Nxe4  fxe4  16.g4  Nc5  17.Be3  ∞  Looks terribly sharp to me and I am a bit afraid to play either side. }
13... a4
{ A natural thrust. What else should black do to gain counterplay ?   13...f4  This is the most obvious try for black: How does white deal with the threat of h6 ?  14.g4  Bd3 seems to be strong as well, but there's one line I want to show  14...h6  White has many good moves here, but the one I like is:  15.Bxh6  Bxh6  16.Rg1 !  ↑  Followed by g5 or gxh5 and the floodgates open. }
14. g4 { Blows up the kingside. } 14... fxg4
{ Thankfully black accepts the pawn and allows white to pour gasoline on the flames. The position lights up now.   14...Nf4  The more sane approach was this move, but the position is not clear at all.  15.Re1  Qf7  16.Bxf4  exf4  17.Nxa4  ∞  Your guess is as good as mine on what is actually going on here. My engine says white is doing well, but I have no faith in white's queenside holding together. }
15. hxg4 Bxg4 { The most greedy of pawn grabs. } 16. f3
{ 16.Re1  My engine gives, with not much certainty, the following line as better for white.  16...Nc5  17.f3  Bd7  I would think black's pieces are placed better here, but white  18.Be2  +=  This is a gross oversimplification, but the position is complicated and white seems to be doing okay. }
16... Rxf3 { The next few moves are why I chose to show this game. } 17. Be2
{ 17.Nxf3  Bxf3  Is quite okay for black, but still tense for both sides. }
17... Rf2
{ 17...Rg3  In hindsight this might be a better move. The game is awesome though.  18.Ne4  The rook is trapped.  18...Bxe2  19.Qxe2  Nc5  20.Nxg3  Nxg3  21.Qg2  a3  22.b3  +-  Both Nxb3+ and Nxh1 lead to messy complications. White seems to be on top, but it is surely difficult to figure everything out. }
18. Bxg4
{ I love this queen sacrifice and the resulting position.   18.Rdg1  Allows black to keep a somewhat okay position after:  18...Bxe2  19.Ne4  Rf1+  20.Rxf1  Bxf1  21.Nf5  Bh3  22.Rxh3  Qf7  23.Qf2  Kh8  +=  Apparently the position is okay for black, but it's definitely scary.   18.Be3  Rxe2  19.Nxe2  a3  20.b3  Nf4  ∞  Seems to hold for black, but the position is sharp still. }
18... Rxd2 19. Kxd2
{ Now every single one of white's remaining pieces will move to the kingside and assault black. }
19... Nc5 { What else ? } 20. Rdg1 Nf4 21. Nf5
{ My favorite position in the game. White has all of the pieces on the kingside. }
21... Ng6 { The g-file needs to be kept closed. } 22. Nxg7
{ Bh5 is also annoying. } 22... Kxg7 23. Bf5 e4 24. Be3
{ I like white's coordination here. Rg5-Rgh5 is a pretty serious threat in tandem with Bd4. }
24... Qe5 { Bd4+ is a killer idea black needs to prevent. } 25. Rg5
{ Preparing Bxg6 } 25... Qf6 26. Rgh5 { But now h7 can't be saved. } 26... Ne5
{ 26...Rh8  27.Bxg6  Kxg6   27...Qxg6  28.Rg1  +-  28.Rh6+  +- } 27. Kc2
{ Black resigned here, but I don't understand why he did so. The position is still worth playing on. Yes, it's somewhat bad as shown in the sidelines, but is it worth resigning ? I don't think so. I offer a couple of lines to show how play could continue with best play. }
27... Kf8
{ 27...Rg8  Is still very much worth playing on for black.  28.Bxc5  dxc5  29.Nxe4  Qa6  A very hard move to see from the far and put faith into.  30.Rxh7+  Kf8  31.Rxc7  Qxc4+  32.Kb1  Qxd5  33.Rc8+  Ke7  34.Rxc5  ∞  I can't tell if this is winning for white and the position could either way if either side gets reckless. Black may get mated and white has many loose pieces that can drop off quickly. }
28. Bd4 e3 29. Rf1
{ This position seems to be pretty good for white. Black's king is like a chicken with its head cut off. It's moving around aimlessly, hoping for escape. I'll stop here and just say that White's play was visually appealing to me and the queen sacrifice made the game worth sharing. The sidelines were rich in complications that only engines could figure out. }

1. --
{ We will see this structure for the next few chapters. White relies on piece play to play around black's central pawn mass. White's aim to is to often play f4 or g4 to bait black into moving one either the e5 or f5 pawn and blockade accordingly. It's important to stifle black's play so that the pawns do not rush down the board. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. h3 e5 7. d5
{ 7.dxe5  The exchange Makaganov is something I feel is not interesting to play, even if it is somehow leading to a tiny edge for White.  7...dxe5  8.Qxd8  Rxd8  9.Bg5  This line has received quite some consideration over the years. White scores pretty decently, so this is a sideline that you can look at if you feel like the mainline is too theoretical. }
7... Nh5
{ The mainline awaits us. Black plays his knight to the rim and white controls the key f4 square with g3. This line gets very sharp quickly. }
8. g3
{ This is the most logical move to prevent Nf4. White can also play Nh2, but the mainline is the most normal one.   8.Nh2  The other 'mainline' You can explore this line if you so choose. I will mark this as a line I should cover in the future. }
8... f5
{ Black plays the most natural move in the position with advancing his f-pawn. }
9. exf5
{ White countertuitively surrenders the center and opens up the position and has concrete reasons for why it is played. White wants to bait black into advancing his central pawns and thereby blockade them. Note that Bxf5 ? g4 and Rxf5 ? g4 win for White, so gxf5 is forced.   9.Bg2  The more natural move of course. I suppose you could play this as a sideline, but one has to wonder: why not play the fianchetto variation of the King's Indian instead of this ? }
9... gxf5
{ Black re-captures of course with the g-pawn as any other recapture loses a piece. }
10. Nh4
{ This position has seen plenty of play and one can argue that Ng5, Nh4 and Bg5 are are all viable options. I chose Nh4 because I like how we have the option of retreating the Knight back to g2 to help guard the f4 square more. We will look at many games in this line: especially those by Evgeny Tomashevsky, the world's leading expert on the Makaganov variation.   10.Ng5  Arguably the most popular move in this position. I chose Nh4 because of the natural plan it offers, but this move is valid too, of course.   10.Bg5  A move popularized by Abhijeet Gupta, an Indian grandmaster. I would look at his games in this line for further guidance.   10.Be2  A basically unexplored move that deserves some attention.   10.Bg2  Like Be2, this move is rather unexplored. }

12. Qc2

Thereby, transpositions often happen and I wouldn't be too concerned about if White should play Bg5 or Qc2 first. Needless to say, many other moves other than these 3 have been tried. The jury is out on this position. }

{ Black has also tried advancing with e4 before as well.   12...a5  You might wonder, why isn't a5 played as well ? Well, I think it is played, but at a later juncture. For example, the sample line:  13.Be3  Na6  White will transpose to the similar looking positions after either a3 or O-O-O   13...f4  Leads to sharp play after  14.gxf4  What else ?  14...exf4  15.Bd4  At least d4 is freed up.  15...c5  16.dxc6  Nxc6  17.O-O-O  →  With dangerous play for Black to handle after Rhg1 and ideas on the kingside.  14.a3  Nc5  15.O-O-O  With a sharp struggle ahead. The goal of this chapter is to help us get affiliated with the position types ahead of us. I'll be frank: White's position looks quite fine  (especially after g4)  , but this is a sharp struggle that Black has chances in. Even though Stockfish gives this position as much better for White, Black has practical chances with the dynamic pawn center.   12...e4  Advancing in the center. I'll provide a few model games involving these types of lines.  13.Be3  The most natural square for the dark squared bishop.

13. a3
{ Preventing Nb4 outright makes a lot of sense for White. Also, it's important to wait and see what Black does before committing to Be3 or Bg5. Be3 is usually advisable when there is a knight on c5. At least if there is a knight on c5, if Black continues on with f4, then Bxc5 is available.   For the purposes of this course, I will exclude analysis of Be3 f4.   13.Be3  f4  14.gxf4  exf4  15.Bd4  f3  ∞  Leads to risky positions that I am not comfortable recommending the reader to play. }
13... Nc5
{ 13...c6  ∞  White has tried dxc6  (conceding the center)  , Be3/Bg5  (developing)  , and can also consider playing the risky looking g4 as well. This position is rich with the different options available for White. I will do my best to theory-craft positions to help guide us.  14.g4  I think this is the most aggressive move and aims to expose Black's weak light squares. There's so many options for Black to consider so I offer one sample line.  14...cxd5  How else would you justify playing c6 ?  15.cxd5  Keeping the strong d5 pawn on the board.  15...Kh8  Note that if Black ever moves the f-pawn, e4 would be incredibly weak. f4 is asking for e4 to exploited and fxg4 hxg4 only leads to SMOrc ideas on the kingside. Still though, f4 is interesting.   15...f4  Weakens the light squares enormously.  16.Bd2  Qe7  17.O-O-O  Nxd5  18.Bc4  Qxh4  19.Bxd5+  Kh8  20.Ne4  =∞  is a token line that leaves White with great light-squared play despite the pawn deficit.  16.Bg5  Bd7  17.Nxf5  Bxf5  18.gxf5  Rc8  19.O-O-O  ±  Looks like it will lead to a sharp game. }
14. Be3
{ White develops the bishop to its most natural square. What else would you play other than this move ?   14.g4 !?  An interesting move that aims to try and exploit Black's weak light squares. Unfortunately, there are no recorded moves of this in the database. }
14... Bd7
{ Black develops their last undeveloped piece into the game and can choose how to proceed from here. I'll be frank: only experience can guide us from here. There's really no fixed system that will always do the trick here. It's a tough and hard struggle from here. I'll cover a few model games that elicit and teach us a few ideas from here.   14...f4  Black has also tried f4 in a few games with the idea of opening the e-file after gxf4 exf4  15.gxf4  exf4  16.Bxc5  dxc5  17.O-O-O  ±   14...e4  15.Ng2  ±   14...a5  15.O-O-O  ±  Cramling, Pia - Harika, Dronavalli, 1-0, Beijing Sportaccord rap  (Women)  , 2012 }

Thereby, transpositions often happen and I wouldn't be too concerned about if white should play Bg5 or Qc2 first. Needless to say, many other moves other than these 3 have been tried. The jury is out on this one. }

{ Preventing Nb4 outright makes a lot of sense for white. Also, it's important to wait and see what black should do before committing to Be3 or Bg5. Be3 f4 enters sharp waters that I would not be comfortable playing, even if stockfish gives the resulting positions as being good for white. }
13... c6 14. g4
{ White has tried dxc6  (conceding the center)  , Be3/Bg5  (developing)  , and can also consider playing the risky looking g4 as well. This position is rich with the different options available for white. I will do my best to theory-craft positions to help guide us.   I think this is the most aggressive move and aims to expose black's weak light squares. There's so many options for black to consider so I offer one sample line. }

Absolutely astonishing. What an amazing find by the engine here. }

25. Rhb1
{ White can't afford to let black's rook enter in on b2 or b3. It's also interesting to note that b7 is suddenly hard to defend }
25... Rd8

My database gives 21 games being played in the position after Nf4. 11 games: Bd2, 3 games went to each Qc2, gxf4, and Be3 and 1 game to Rg1. It's not surprising that strong players such as Tomashevsky have played this line and went with Bd2. Mihail Marin recommends in his Makaganov course Bd2 as well. @@LinkStart@@https://www.modern-chess.com/en/chess-databases/database=60&theme=1#article@@LinkEnd@@ I do have to say, however, that Bd2 has been played mostly because of one reason: By placing the bishop on d2, white will avoid any f4 shenanigans that black will have if white will have played Be3, for example. f4 would gain a tempo on the bishop on e3. Hence Bd2 is preferable because white can castle queenside easily after Qc2, O-O-O. I also offer an alternative with the unnatural gxf4 as well. }
11. Bd2
{ The most played move in the position and for good reason. White specifically puts the bishop on d2 to dodge f4 ideas. The natural Be3 runs into the sacrificial ideas after Be3 Ng6 ! Nxg6 hxg6 Qd2 f4 ! with very decent compensation for black. I recommend avoiding this entirely. White can also try gxf4 and we will cover several games discussing them.   11.gxf4  Qxh4  12.fxe5 !?  Is a fun way to cut down on the amount of theory one must know. Honestly, I don't know why more people haven't played this move more. Black's best response   Nd7  requires many moves of guess work  (from the black side)  to work through. It's a strenuous line to endure and makes 11. gxf4 a great surprise weapon.

Ne4  22.Nxe4  fxe4  23.Be3  c6  ⇆  This is a complicated position with chances for both sides. As long as the position stays closed, white will be better. If not, then both sides have chances. }

For example, after:  19.f4  Qe4  Ng6 is also reasonable, but Qe4 is more natural to my eye.  20.Kf2  Ng6  ∞  I am not sure what is going on. My engine gives this position as 0.00, but it's not clear to me how a draw is made nor why this position is =. I leave it to the reader if they want to figure it out. }

Angling for the rook.  16.Kd2  Qxh1  17.Qh5  +-  15.dxe6  Rxe6  16.Ne2  Be2 allows Bd4 with uncomfortable pressure.   16.Be2  Bd4  =∞  Bxb2  17.Rb1  Nc5  18.Qc2  Bg7  =∞  White is probably doing well here, but it will be tedious to convert.

I think its unclear and either side can sill win. I leave it to the reader to investigate this line further. }

9. exf5 gxf5 10. Nh4 Nf6 { Nf6 is the no nonsense approach by black. } 11. Bd3
{ At first, it doesn't look like Bd3 is a good idea for white. Why would you want to invite e4, a move that opens the long diagonal and one black wants to play anyways? }
11... e4 12. Be2
{ It's important to understand why white baits e4. The main reasons is that white wants to play the on the weaknesses now on e3 & f4. White can now organize his pieces around these two squares. }
12... Nfd7
{ A reasonable move as it prepares Ne5 and opens the diagonal for the bishop on g7. }
13. Ng2
{ Unless you want to somehow play f3 early on, the knight's role on h4 is limited. It should be rerouted to f4 where it exerts far more influence. More importantly, on f4 it would blockade the pawn chain and keep the center semi-closed. It's important to not let the center pawns roll because if black manages to play f4, then c8 bishop will come to life. Likewise, if black manages to ever the push e-pawn or trade it for white's f-pawn  (via f3)  , then the e-file would be open for black's use. }
13... Ne5 { What else is black going to do? } 14. Nf4
{ Plugging in the hole on f4. } 14... Na6
{ Black wants to bring their other knight to c5.   14...Nf3 ?  I think this knight jump is an interesting idea for black to consider. If white captures twice, the e-file will be open and white's light squares on f3 & g2 are tender. Without a light-squared bishop on board, white could face issues long-term with an unopposed bishop on c8.  15.Bxf3  exf3  16.O-O  While Qxf3 was natural, it's important to get our king to safety first. f3 can be taken anytime.  Na6  17.Qxf3  +-  I'll stop here and say that, yes the light squares are weak, but white has a solid extra pawn with superb knight on f4 that holds everything together. White should be winning with good play. }
15. Be3 Nc5
{ Standard moves by both sides. There's a couple of things that bug me about the position here. White is at a crossroads about where to commit his king. There's good arguments to be made about castling kingside and queenside. Also, white can play the reasonable king sidestep with Kf1-Kg2 to keep the rook on h1. }
16. O-O
{ 16.Qd2 ??  While it is tempting to castle here, it allows a nice tactical shot.  Ncd3 !  Nxc4 will be black's next move if you do not take it.  17.Nxd3  Bxd3 Nf3 loses the queen.  Nxc4  18.Qc2  Nxe3  19.fxe3  exd3  20.Bxd3  Qg5  21.O-O-O  ∓  I like black's position since both bishops and play with Bd7-a6-b5 is easy to work with.   16.Qc2  Now Ncd3 doesn't work here because Nxc4 would not gain a tempo on the queen, compared to the Qd2 line.  Bd7  17.O-O-O  It requires guts to play this position for white. It looks risky to play like this, but it has been done before. To see an example game, please view Jinshi - Krush, I., 1-0, Gibraltar Masters 2016   16.Kf1  Bd7  17.Kg2  Was also reasonable. }
16... Ng6
{ Black knows that white's knight on f4 is the anchor of the position and aims to trade it off. On e5, it was poking at the d3/f3 squares, squares that will hardly be of any use.   16...Bd7  I prefer Bd7-a5, but black has to ask the tough question of what is the long-term plan afterwards? }
17. Qd2
{ Completing development finally and both sides have to formulate their plans. }
17... Nxf4 { A natural move as the knight was strong on f4. } 18. gxf4
{ I like this move a lot, if you're given a chance to play it. Although white wrecks the kingside pawn structure, white argues the e5 square is theirs' and the enter is completely locked. Also, the g-file is open for white to play on.   18.Bxf4  The automatic recapture that most players would consider. I won't lie, the decision between the gxf4 & Bxf4 is not an easy one to make. Whether one is better than the other, depends on a case by case basis.  a5  Bd7 & a5 are the most natural moves black can make. It's important to improve the worst pieces in our position. For example, the knight on c3 is biting on the e4 & d5 pawns. If we could somehow bring it to f4, that would be nice. However, it would take 3 moves, at minimum, to get there. Also the moves needed to play Ne2-Nf4 would be Bd1-Be3-Ne2-Nf4. That looks like a waste of time, especially for the bishop on d1. The knight also doesn't look bad on d4, which is probably what I'd aim for if I was white.  19.Nb5  Bd7  20.Nd4  =+  White should probably prepare Nd4 as tricks related with Nd3 are present after Qf6 Rad1/Rfd1 Nd3.   20.Rab1  ∞  Any rook move is probably a better move. White can play slowly with b3-a3-b4, but even this might not be good to get in as a3-b3 can met with a4 when b3 is a hole for the knight on c4. None of this is very clear. }
18... a5
{ 18...Qh4  One might ask, what if black played caveman like with Qh4-Rf6-Rh6 ?  19.Kh2  Rf6  The benefits of an open g-file come through in a clutch way here.  20.Rg1 !  Rh6  21.Rg3  ±  White can double on the g-file and should be able to advance on the queenside eventually with b4 somehow. It's not that white has a direct attack or anything. It's just white has a firm lock over the center and black has no clear plan. }
19. Kh2 { Defends h3 and moves the king out of the g-file. } 19... Kh8 20. Rg1
Bf6
{ I'm not sure what this move accomplishes. It does avoid potential Rxg7 exchange sacrifices and allows black to content the g-file, but it feels off to me. }

{ Nisipeanu has a different idea that the one I like here. f3, breaking up the center, does make sense. I guess black has no clear objective so white can dance around doing nothing for a while and play f3 eventually anyways.   21.f3  Bd7  Black can take on f3, but its not like anything huge changes.  22.fxe4  fxe4  23.Bg4  ±  Is an example line that looks reasonable for white to play with. }

{ In our previous game with Nisipeanu, black played Nfd7. We get the same position via a different move order. }
13. Be3
{ I think this is an inaccuracy in view of black having the opportunity to play Bxc3. We should develop the dark-squared bishop last.   13.Ng2  Nd7  14.O-O  It's important we have not wasted a tempo with Be3 here.  Nac5  The engine recommends Na4, but its a bit of ridiculous move to play here considering the typical Nf4-Be3 play I've been advocating here.   14...Bxc3  15.bxc3  Instead of just Be3, white has options of playing Bh6.  Ne5  16.Bh6  Re8  17.h4  +=  I'm skeptical if white is better here, but regardless, a long fight will ensue and both sides have chances here. White's dark-square control is great, but the nimzo like structural on c3/c4 is always going to be an issue.  15.Nf4   15.Na4 !?  Avoiding Bxc3 entirely could be the best choice for white. White will take on c5, if permitted.  Bxc3  16.bxc3  Ne5  Normally, we'd have Be3 played here, but maybe we can make use of the tempo we've been graced with.  17.Nh5  ∞  With the same idea as before, Bh6. }
13... Nd7 14. Ng2
{ 14.Qd2  The natural Qd2 runs into issues on the light squares as  Nac5  15.Ng2  Ne5  can't be met normally with O-O because Ncd3 is a serious issue for white. I'm not enthusiastic about long castling here either. }
14... Nac5
{ Apparently, Bxc3 has been tried in a few games here. Structurally, white isn't doing that well. Positionally speaking, the dark squares look horrid to play with as black.   14...Bxc3  15.bxc3  Ne5  16.Nf4  Nc5  17.O-O  ∞  With an unclear position where both sides have chances: White with the bishop pair, Black with the structural advantage. }

15... a5 16. O-O Ne5
{ In the previous game with Nisipeanu as white, we saw black playing with Ng6. Here, we see black playing less forcing and allowing white to play slowly on the queenside. }
17. Rc1 Bd7 18. b3 Qe7
{ Both sides in the last few moves have improved their positions a bit: white fortified the queenside a bit while black has completed their development. White has been careful not to play Qd2 because of Ncd3 tricks, but now has to decide how to proceed. }
19. Nb5
{ I think this is interesting idea as it threatens on c7 and also gives white the option to play Nd4. The knight on c3 was also just a poor piece, so why not improve it? }

{ White had a couple of good moves, but this is the most principled decision  (maintaining the bishop pair)  .   21.Bxd6  cxd6  22.cxb5  ±  When white has an extra pawn and a knight that can jump to e6.   21.cxb5  dxc5  22.Ne6  b6  23.f3  ±  White's considerably better as the position breaks open and the knight on e6 controls almost every meaningful square. }

{ White doesn't waste any time and opens the position. } 22... Ng6 23. Kh2
{ I suspect white was preparing Nxf4 gxf4, a normal idea, as shown in the Nisipeanu game. White could have played Ne6 or Nh5 with a fine game.   23.Nh5   23.Ne6 !? }

Be3 is because 6. Be2 reaches a small branch of lines that are easier to remember: There is no point to study 6. Be3 because 6. Be2 has fewer deviations like this one. }
