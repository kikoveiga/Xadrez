1. e4 c5 2. c3 {Hello! My name is Johan-Sebastian Christiansen and I'm a 22
year old Grandmaster from Norway. I'm currently the 3rd highest rated player
in Norway with a rating of 2612. My most notable result is my 2-0 win against
super GM Radoslaw Wojtaszek in the 2019 World Cup in Khanty Mansiysk. Other
than that, some of you might recognize me as the second of super strong GM
Jorden Van Foreest from the Netherlands. I've worked with him for many years
now, and I've traveled with him to the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in 2019 and
2020. Both years with great results! The reason why I chose to write in-depth
about this solid opening is because this was our main weapon towards the Tata
Steel Chess Tournament of 2020. We expected Jorden to get many Sicilians as
'he was the guy to beat'. Therefore, we decided to go highly in-depth in this
very interesting line. And during our many weeks of analysis, we realized that
this opening is not as boring as its reputation. There are many aggressive and
tactical lines that I want to show to you! Also, I'm showing some ideas by
Jorden and me, so it's definitely worth a look! Obviously I can't find deadly
lines in every variation, as chess doesn't work like that 😊 However, I
tried to make this course as interesting as possible! The idea of the Alapin
is very simple: to gain huge control over the center. So therefore Black must
react quickly. I hope you enjoy my course and that you get many interesting
fights from it!} *

1. e4 c5 2. c3 {Now we enter the Alapin variation versus the Sicilian defence.
The Alapin is often associated with solid play and very often a bit drawish
and dry games. However, I don't think the Alapin deserves such a drawish
reputation. There are many interesting attacking ideas and exciting lines. The
idea behind c3 is quite simple: you want to go d2-d4 on the next move and get
a strong center by capturing back with your c-pawn. If White gets such a
center, then White is very happy! Therefore, Black wants to challenge the
center immediately. The two main moves are the logical 2...d5 and 2...Nf6.
Both moves are aimed at attacking the white center. There are other
subvariations that I will also cover, the main one being 2...e5 , which also
tries to prevent d4 and is covered in a separate chapter.} d6 {Black plays
like he perhaps would against the normal 2. Nf3. However, this is just bad in
this case.} (2... g6 {A possible set-up, but it leads to a better position for
White.} 3. d4 {We just push in the center of course.} cxd4 4. cxd4 {White has
a fantastic center, and Black must counter quickly to not fall way behind in
development.} d5 5. e5 {Closing down Black's dark-squared bishop.} Nc6 {
Putting slight pressure on our d4 pawn, perhaps aiming to continue with a plan
like Nh6-f5.} 6. Bb5 {Eliminating Black's strong knight. It may look strange
to exchange our bishop against the knight, but in this position Black's knight
is very disturbing, putting pressure on d4. Besides that, our light-squared
bishop doesn't really have too much potential in this position anyway, so this
is a great trade. Later, it might also be possible to plant a knight on the
c5-square and control a lot of squares in Black's camp.} Bg7 7. Nf3 Nh6 {
In the theory I also mention what to do against 7... Bg4.} 8. O-O {We can wait
as long as we want with taking on c6.} O-O 9. h3 {Watching out for any Bg4
ideas. Black is quite stuck, and must try to open up the center. The reason
why we haven't played h3 earlier is that it hasn't been necessary because we
have had other important developing moves to make. We could always react with
Nbd2 after Bg4 early in the game and then go h3 at some point, collecting that
bishop (see line at move 7) . However, now that we have developed and gotten
our king in safety, we would really like to put our knight on c3 and not on d2.
But by going to c3 now, it would be a bit annoying after Bg4 as we cannot take
back on f3 with our knight to keep defending the d4 pawn. 9.Nc3?! Bg4 10.Bxc6
bxc6 11.h3 Bxf3 12.Qxf3 Nf5 Now we would wish that our knight on c3 was on f3.
9.Nbd2 Going Nbd2 now is just pointless as it doesn't really do anything:
Black is not opting for Bg4-Bxf3 and can now go for other plans like f6, Qb6
or Bd7.9...Bd7} f6 10. Nc3 fxe5 11. dxe5 e6 12. Bxc6 bxc6 13. b3 {Getting
ready to control the important c5-square. The next moves for White will be Ba3
followed by Na4 and Rc1 with a very nice advantage. Quickstarter Guide-2... g6}
) (2... Nc6 {Putting pressure on the d4 square, but that doesn't stop us from
pushing in the center.} 3. d4 {A strong center!} cxd4 4. cxd4 {White has a
powerful center.} d5 {A 'needed' move from Black. Black can't allow White to
maintain such a strong center. Unfortunately, it is already a bit too late for
Black.} 5. exd5 Qxd5 6. Nf3 {Nc3 with tempo followed by d5 is a huge threat
now.} e5 {The most popular move in this position. 6... Bg4 is covered in the
theory chapter.} 7. Nc3 Bb4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 {Now we have the bishop pair
and are threatening to take on e5.} e4 10. Ne5 Nxe5 11. dxe5 {White has the
bishop pair and a very comfortable advantage. A normal follow-up will be Be2
followed by O-O. Quickstarter Guide-2... Nc6}) (2... e5 {This move has a very
simple idea behind it: to prevent d4. If White still goes for it, Black
responds by taking off everything and gain a tempo on the white queen with Nc6.
} 3. Nf3 {Developing while attacking the pawn on e5, and perhaps also getting
ready for d4 in the future. 3.d4 exd4 4.cxd4 cxd4 5.Qxd4 Nc6 Now Black is in
the driver's seat when it comes to development. So, 2...e5 has stopped our
main idea with d4. But it weakens the light squares a lot, so we have to try
to exploit that instead.} Nc6 {A natural move, protecting the pawn on e5 and
also controlling the d4-square.} 4. Bc4 {Exploiting the fact that the bishop
can't be chased away with the typical e6 - d5 push, now that the pawn has
already moved to e5. We can see that there are some pretty weak light squares
in Black's camp. There are also some ideas against the f7-pawn now.} Qc7 {
The most played move. However, it doesn't really do anything: it just frees a
spot for the knight on d8 so it can protect f7.} (4... Nf6 {Both threatening
our e4-pawn and preparing the d5 pawn break in the center.} 5. Ng5 {
Immediately putting pressure on Black's position. 5.d3? This has also been
played, but what's the point of 2.c3 if we're just going to put our pawn on d3
in the end? We need to be direct! Be7 6.O-O O-O= Black has very easy play, and
can go either d6 followed by Be6, or just d5.} d5 {The only move to protect
against the threat on f7.} 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Qh5 g6 {The only move.} 8. Qf3 Qxg5
9. Bxd5 Nd8 10. O-O {Both d4 and Re1 are huge threats.} Qf5 {Black wants to
exchange queens, perhaps just to get out of the worst problems. 10...Qe7 is
covered here.} 11. Re1 Bg7 12. d4 {Black doesn't have any good way to save the
pawn on e5 and White is better. Quickstarter Guide-2... e5 #2}) 5. d4 {This
seems strong now. 5.Ng5 Nd8 6.O-O Be7 7.Nf3 We didn't really earn much with
this manoeuver.} cxd4 6. Qb3 d6 7. cxd4 exd4 8. O-O {Now that the king is safe,
all of White's pieces can be activated.} Bg4 9. Na3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {White has a
huge development advantage and can easily win back the pawn on d4 with Rd1
followed by Nb5/c2 if White wants to. Quickstarter Guide-2... e5 #1}) (2... d5
{This is one of the two most challenging set-ups against the Alapin. The idea
is simple: Black wants to break in the center before White gets enough time to
consolidate there with d2-d4. So, White needs to do something immediately.} 3.
exd5 {The only sensible move. All other moves would leave Black, instead of
White, with a strong pawn center.} Nf6 {A tricky line. Black's idea is to take
back on d5 with the knight and not let White into known territory. However,
Black gives us the chance to keep our pawn.} (3... Qxd5 4. d4 {It is time to
take control of the center before Black does it by playing e5. Sometimes we
might be able to take on c5 if Black is not careful.} Nc6 (4... Nf6 {
Protecting the queen and also protecting some important central squares.} 5.
Nf3 {We are still in the main line, and this is where Black has three
different options. Either go solid with ... e6, or play more aggressive moves
like Bg4 and Nc6. Nc6 usually leads to the same positions as e6 though,
because there are many transpositions. We are still in the main line, and this
is where Black has three different options. Either go solid with ...e6, or
play more aggressive moves like Bg4 and Nc6. Nc6 usually leads to the same
positions as e6 though, because there are many transpositions.} Nc6 {Putting
pressure on the d4-pawn while developing a piece.} (5... Bg4 6. Nbd2 {I give
this very interesting move as our main move! It's not the most played and is
kinda rare. Be2 is for sure the main line. However this move has some nice
ideas behind it. It both threatens easy development with Bc4 and also has a
threat of dxc5 avoiding any queen exchange! And avoiding queen trades is music
to my ears.} Nc6 7. dxc5 {Now we go for the other idea I mentioned. We are
clearing the situation in the center and are opting for some tempos on the
black queen.} Qxc5 {Other tries are covered in the theory chapter. See for
example here.} 8. h3 Bh5 {Obviously Black won't trade the bishop against the
knight here, as we can capture back with the knight.} 9. Qa4 {A typical move
in these structures. We get out of the pin by the black bishop, and also get
ready for Nb3 followed by Bb5 or just the solid Be2 and O-O.} e6 10. Nb3 {
Making room for the bishop on c1.} Qd5 11. Be2 Be7 12. O-O {White has a very
comfortable advantage due to the well-placed pieces and an active queen on a4.
Black's queen might also look active, but it will just be chased away after
White's next move: Rd1. Quickstarter Guide-2... d5 with 4... Nf6 and 5...}) (
5... e6 6. Na3 {Not the main line, but this is what I analyzed for Jorden Van
Foreest when I was his second during the Tata Steel Masters 2020. The Alapin
was one of our best prepared weapons for the tournament. The idea is to wait
and see how Black reacts to the threats of Nb5 and Bc4. If he reacts with a6,
there is a great square on b6 ready for our knight that can get there via c4.}
Qd8 {Stepping out of any attacks on the queen.} (6... Nc6 {This is the
position Jorden Van Foreest had twice during this year's Tata Steel tournament.
One of the games ended in a victory against the very strong GM Yu Yangyi, the
other game was a draw against GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda. I also had this exact
position in February during the Swedish League against GM Kulaots. All 3 games
are added to this course in the model games chapter.} 7. Be3 {Threatening to
take on c5.} cxd4 8. Nb5 Qd8 {The main move, yet both of Van Foreest's
opponents went for the more 'rare' move Qd7 that you can find analysis on here.
My opponent Kulaots went for the standard Qd8.} 9. Nbxd4 Nd5 10. Nxc6 {I saw
this as the most challenging move, and it is also what I opted for against GM
Kulaots.} bxc6 11. Bd2 {Now c4 is in the air, followed by Qc2, Bc3 and Bd3.
That's our dream set-up. Find more details here. Quickstarter Guide-2... d5

takes our bishop on e3 as after fxe3 we just strenghten our center.} Be7 10.
dxc5 {Now it is time to take the pawn on c5 and clarify the position.} Nxe3 11.
Nxe3 Bxc5 {Black takes the pawn before White gets the time to defend it with
b4.} 12. Qe2 {Now White's idea is to play against the bad light-squared bishop
that Black has. White has a very easy position to play with natural moves to
follow. For example, playing O-O-O and trying to create a mating attack with
h4 and g4. Find more details here. Quickstarter Guide-2... d5 with 4... Nf6
and 5...}) 6. dxc5 {A very interesting try to exploit the fact that Black
can't take back with the bishop on c5 after the queen trade. I do think this
leads to a nice advantage for White.} Qxc5 {Black takes back and keeps the
queens on the board, but this is in White's favour, as Black's queen might end
up in some trouble. The other option is covered in the theory section: 6...
Qxd1+.} 7. Na3 {Threatening a big jump to b5, making a new threat to jump to
c7. Already here Black is in serious trouble.} e5 {An obvious move, taking
control over the center.} 8. Nb5 Qe7 9. Be3 {If White now gets 2 moves with
Qa4 and O-O-O, Black will be crushed.} a6 10. Qa4 Bf5 11. O-O-O {With a strong
attack. Quickstarter Guide-2... d5 with 4... Nf6 and 5...}) 5. Nf3 Bf5 (5...

Maintaining the extra pawn.} a5 9. b5 Nd8 10. c6 bxc6 11. h3 {Another great
move, trying to claim the bishop pair advantage.} Bxf3+ 12. gxf3 Bc5 13. Kc2

compensation for the pawn we have sacrificed on c6. Quickstarter Guide-2... d5

for example here.} 7. Nxd4 {Better than taking with the pawn, as after 7.cxd4
Black could play Bxb1 avoiding any Nc3 ideas.} Nxd4 8. cxd4 {White gets easy
development, and will gain a good position due to Black's lack of development.

gets a lot of compensation. Not a position I would like to have with White.

are still a pawn up. Quickstarter Guide-2... d5 with 3... Nf6}) (2... Nf6 {
The most challenging move against the Alapin in my opinion. It stops our idea
of playing d4 while also developing a piece. However, we can gain some tempos
on the knight now.} 3. e5 {Other moves are way too passive.} Nd5 4. Nf3 {
With this move we await the situation and wait with d4, as we might go into
other lines with Bc4 if possible. We will cover the replies 4... e6 and 4...
d6 in one chapter, while the final chapter will cover Black's main move, 4...
Nc6.4.d4 is the main line here. It often transposes, but here Black has more
possibilities, so I'm only focusing on first playing Nf3.} e6 {A solid line
where Black awaits the situation in the center and will later break with d6,
and perhaps continuing with b6 and Bb7 after developing on the kingside.} (4...

more complicated than others. Here I will offer a solid line with strategical
play.} 5. exd6 {Not really played too much, but I found a very interesting
line I would like to offer.} e6 6. g3 {A very rare move in this position and
in the Alapin in general. However, it was much more challenging than I thought
when I first analyzed it. The whole idea is to play against the light-squared
bishop. If we are able to open up in the center and point towards the b7-pawn
with our bishop, then it will be quite difficult for the c8-bishop to develop
itself to a useful square.} Bxd6 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. O-O O-O 9. d4 {We could do this
on move 6 before going g3, but Black had many more options there. As usual, we
really wanna take on c5 and open up the d-file for our rook. If it was our
move now, then we would go dxc5 and Qe2 followed by Rd1. Also notice that c4
followed by d5 might be a threat here.} cxd4 {A smart decision from Black, as
we really want to open the d-file, BUT we want to keep the knight on f3 alive.
The black knight on c6 is in fact quite stupidly placed and is blocking
Black's development.} 10. Nxd4 {Taking with the c pawn would just give us a
huge weakness. Here there are two main options to prevent us from ruining
Black's pawn structure with Nxc6. Either take on d4, or develop with Bd7.

keep our knight on the board, which we are very happy to keep.} (10... Nxd4 11.
Qxd4 {Black now changed off the most annoying piece, on the other side we got
a very active queen in the middle of the board. Rd1 followed by c4 is a huge
threat, so Black should move the queen out of the line.} Qc7 {Funnily enough,
this position is played quite some times. Around 200 times with players like
Svidler and Karjakin defending the black side. However my next move is a big
surprise as it is only played 9 times! The main move is Nd2.} 12. c4 {Kicking
the knight away while opening up for our own knight.} Nb6 13. Nc3 {It looks
like we are giving a pawn.} Nxc4 {13...Qxc4 14.Qxd6} 14. Rd1 {Now we got lots
of compensation. See here. Quickstarter Guide-2... Nf6 with 4... d6 #2}) 11. c4

like d6 and b6. It also makes room for our knight on a3 to jump to c4 where it
will be very central and also puts pressure on the bishop on e5. At some point
it can even jump to b6 or d6. I go a bit deeper here. Quickstarter Guide-2...

the most popular line in the Alapin these days. Usually we have seen people go

line.} c4 (6... d5 7. exd6 Qxd6 8. O-O {Still following the most critical line
these days. Here Black mainly has two options: to play solidly with Be6 or go
for a bit more madness with c4. Also worth mentioning is the move Bf5, as that
is what was played against me not so long ago by a 2180 player. You can find
that game here.} Be6 (8... c4 {The most interesting line I think.} 9. Bc2 {
Obviously our pawns are a bit shut down due to the pawn on c4, but when we get
to open quickly with b3 followed by Na3 and even Ba3 in some cases, then Black
will have problems.} g6 {Thi@ is the move Dubov made against J. Van Foreest.
It's a more solid move, as he was probably scared of some long analysis in the
Bg4 line. We will use this game as a model game for this line :îîEndBracketîî}

to threaten Ne5 to ruin our pawn structure.} 10. h3 {The main line is to go
Re1, but there is nothing wrong with adding some 'luft' for the king before
going Re1.} Bh5 11. Re1 O-O-O {Now we're currently following one of my last
games before the Covid-19 took over the world. An important game in the Prague

otherwise be strong.} 14. Qh5 {We are a pawn down, however we are having the
initiative and Black has difficulties with castling. We do also have a strong
bishop pair and Black's pieces are very misplaced. White is better and has the
initiative! d3 will follow, to open up even more lines and diagonals.

plan: bring our queen to e4, rook to d1 and at the right time, go Bd3 and
threaten a checkmate. Worth mentioning is that going Bd3 too soon will cause
some problems after Nb4, as we would have to go back to c4 again. A very nice
idea is to go a3 to prevent Black's knights from going to b4.} Nc6 {The main
move and the most critical one. The idea is to catch our bishop with Na5

main line, but this is what I analyzed for GM Jorden Van Foreest in this
year's Tata Steel Chess tournament. The idea is as simple as explained before.

goes Bd7 to develop the last piece, but also Ndb4 deserves some attention as
it stops Bd3 and threatens d5.} Bd7 11. Bb3 {A highly unusual move, but a move
I recommended to Jorden Van Foreest in Tata Steel Chess. The idea is to go Nc3

1. e4 c5 2. c3 {Now we enter the Alapin variation versus the Sicilian defence.
The Alapin is often associated with solid play and very often a bit drawish
and dry games. However, I don't think the Alapin deserves such a drawish
reputation. There are many interesting attacking ideas and exciting lines. The
idea behind c3 is quite simple: you want to go d2-d4 on the next move and get
a strong center by capturing back with your c-pawn. If White gets such a
center, then White is very happy! Therefore, Black wants to challenge the
center immediately. The two main moves are the logical 2...d5 and 2...Nf6.

better position for White.} 3. d4 {We just push in the center of course.} d5 {
The reason why Black usually takes on d4 in this line before playing d5 is
because otherwise, White has an extra option to go for a pleasant endgame.} (

quickly to not fall way behind in development.} Bg7 (4... d5 5. e5 {Closing
down Black's dark-squared bishop.} Nc6 {Putting slight pressure on our d4 pawn,
perhaps aiming to continue with a plan like Nh6-f5.} 6. Bb5 {Eliminating
Black's strong knight. It may look strange to exchange our bishop against the
knight, but in this position Black's knight is very disturbing, putting
pressure on d4. Besides that, our light-squared bishop doesn't really have too
much potential in this position anyway, so this is a great trade. Later, it
might also be possible to plant a knight on the c5-square and control a lot of
squares in Black's camp.} Nh6 (6... Bg7 7. Nf3 Nh6 {7...Bg4 This line

long as we want with taking on c6.} O-O 9. h3 {Watching out for any Bg4 ideas.
Black is quite stuck, and must try to open up the center. The reason why we
haven't played h3 earlier is that it hasn't been necessary because we have had
other important developing moves to make. We could always react with Nbd2
after Bg4 early in the game and then go h3 at some point, collecting that
bishop (see line at move 7) . However, now that we have developed and gotten
our king in safety, we would really like to put our knight on c3 and not on d2.
But by going to c3 now, it would be a bit annoying after Bg4 as we cannot take
back on f3 with our knight to keep defending the d4 pawn. 9.Nc3?! Bg4 10.Bxc6

White is a pawn up AND has a much better position as all Black's pieces are

and Rad1. Conclusion on the e5 lines: Black must be extremely precise to even
come out of it alive. As we saw, the best Black can hope for is some kind of
line where they must sacrifice a pawn and try to equalize the entire game. We
saw this in one of the lines that the engine gives. But that's certainly not a

Black is not to exchange the bishops, especially the dark-squared one. Because
if that happens, it's much much easier for us to attack the d5 pawn and
coordinate our pieces. Therefore whenever we can exchange the bishops, we
should be really really happy. That would be a big strategical victory.} 8. O-O

8. Nb3 {Trying to hold on to our extra pawn. 8.b4?! In some lines we go b4 to
protect our pawn on c5, however now is not the time for this move. The reason
is that Black has played Nf6 and we have gone Nbd2. Usually, we would like to
consolidate our pawn advantage before developing our pieces, and I don't think
Nbd2 really helps protecting our pawn. The knight on f6 will create more
attack to our pawn chain as it can arrive on d5 after a queen exchange and our
knight on d2 can't really help protecting the b4–pawn. Remember that on b1
it was actually doing a good job defending our pawn on c3 before we could
start consolidating. And worth to mention is that with the queens still on the
board, I would be more careful to open up the position with moves like b4 as
it weakens a lot of squares and pawns. 8...a5 9.Bb5 Bxf3 10.Qxf3 10.Nxf3 axb4

is what I analyzed for Jorden Van Foreest when I was his second during the
Tata Steel Masters 2020. The Alapin was one of our best prepared weapons for
the tournament. The idea is to wait and see how Black reacts to the threats of
Nb5 and Bc4. If he reacts with a6, there is a great square on b6 ready for our
knight that can get there via c4.} Nc6 {This is the position Jorden Van
Foreest had twice during this year's Tata Steel tournament. One of the games
ended in a victory against the very strong GM Yu Yangyi, the other game was a

playing against the light-squared bishop, as it is kinda stuck behind the
e6-pawn. Also we can create some attacking possibillities with these nasty
looking bishops pointing towards Black's lonely king. We would like to destroy
the pawn structure in front of Black's king with Bxf6. Moves like Qe2 look
natural. Even a rook lift with Re1-e4-g4/h4 looks interesting. Taking more

much better. 4. 2...d5-7. Be3 cxd4 8. Nb5 Qd7 with 9.}) 13. Qd2 {Planning to

immediate action.} cxd4 6. cxd4 d6 7. Bc4 {White's idea is to develop the
queen to e2 and at some point reroute the bishop to d3 or b3 to c2, followed
by Qe4 and a mating attack. However, going Bd3 too early might fall into Nb4
moves coming.} Be7 {A normal developing move.} 8. O-O O-O {Very natural moves
from both sides. Any other move order would basically lead to the same
position. However, here both sides still have yet to decide where to put their
minor pieces.} 9. Qe2 {This is basically our main plan: bring our queen to e4,
rook to d1 and at the right time, go Bd3 and threaten a checkmate. Worth
mentioning is that going Bd3 too soon will cause some problems after Nb4, as
we would have to go back to c4 again. A very nice idea is to go a3 to prevent
Black's knights from going to b4.} dxe5 {We are never afraid of this move as
it just worsens the black center even more. We just get an open line on the
d-file where we can bring our rook and ask awkward questions to Black's queen.}

towards our king.} 10. Rd1 {Continuing to develop while always making dxe5 an
awkward move for Black to play. In some lines, the rook can even swing around
from d1-d3-g3/h3.} Bb7 11. Bxd5 {This looks like a very strange move as it
goes against everything I just said, but it has its points! One of the main
reasons is that Black will have a hard time taking back with the e-pawn now
that the black bishop is on b7, letting us destroy Black's position with e6!}

vulnerable.} dxe5 14. dxe5 {Now that we've gotten our plan fulfilled, we have

Nc3@is the main line, but this is what I analyzed for GM Jorden Van Foreest in
this year's Tata Steel Chess tournament. The idea is as simple as explained
before. We wanna go Bd3 at the correct moment and give mate on h7 :

idea that started with Bb3.} Nxc3 13. bxc3 {Now our pawn structure is pretty

Conclusion: Even though the e6 line is considered quite solid and looks pretty
solid as well, there are lots of aggressive ideas that I showed in this line.
If Black is not careful, then Qe2-e4 followed by Bd3 will be unbearable. There
were some lines where White could be a little bit more careful, and I did

a devastating attack. This one line I analyzed extremely deeply before Tata

but the position is so difficult to play for Black, and the strong engines
understand this after some moves. Protecting against both Bxg6 and h4 is very
hard.} Qc7 {If Black tries this natural move that all the engines give, then

would like to offer.} e6 6. g3 {A very rare move in this position and in the
Alapin in general. However, it was much more challenging than I thought when I
first analyzed it. The whole idea is to play against the light-squared bishop.
If we are able to open up in the center and point towards the b7-pawn with our
bishop, then it will be quite difficult for the c8-bishop to develop itself to
a useful square.} Bxd6 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. O-O O-O 9. d4 {We could do this on move 6
before going g3, but Black had many more options there. As usual, we really
wanna take on c5 and open up the d-file for our rook. If it was our move now,
then we would go dxc5 and Qe2 followed by Rd1. Also notice that c4 followed by
d5 might be a threat here.} cxd4 {A smart decision from Black, as we really
want to open the d-file, BUT we want to keep the knight on f3 alive. The black
knight on c6 is in fact quite stupidly placed and is blocking Black's
development.} 10. Nxd4 {Taking with the c pawn would just give us a huge
weakness. Here there are two main options to prevent us from ruining Black's
pawn structure with Nxc6. Either take on d4, or develop with Bd7. Taking with
the c-pawn would just give us a huge weakness. Here there are two main options

the board, which we are very happy to keep.} (10... Nxd4 11. Qxd4 {Black now
changed off the most annoying piece, on the other side we got a very active
queen in the middle of the board. Rd1 followed by c4 is a huge threat, so
Black should move the queen out of the line.} Qb6 (11... Qc7 {Funnily enough,
this position is played quite some times. Around 200 times with players like
Svidler and Karjakin defending the black side. However my next move is a big

the most challenging lines against the Alapin. Unfortunately chess is not
winning for any side, so there aren't always completely winning lines for
White. But I tried to find a solid line against this d6 system, and I find it
quite comfortable. The good thing is that we are not risking anything at all.

to do while we just keep on improving our pieces. Our biggest mistake will be
to lose our patience and push something.} 15. Qe2 {I do find this position
quite attractive even though the engine gives only a very very small advantage.
Unfortunately, that's chess and Black will always be fine if they play the
best moves. However, I considered this to be a bit tricky for a human to play
as Black can't move many of the pieces while we can slowly improve even more.}

The Alapin is often associated with solid play and very often a bit drawish
and dry games. However, I don't think the Alapin deserves such a drawish
reputation. There are many interesting attacking ideas and exciting lines. The
idea behind c3 is quite simple: you want to go d2-d4 on the next move and get
a strong center by capturing back with your c-pawn. If White gets such a
center, then White is very happy! Therefore, Black wants to challenge the
center immediately. The two main moves are the logical 2...d5 and 2...Nf6.
Both moves are aimed at attacking the white center. There are other
subvariations that I will also cover, the main one being 2...e5 , which also
tries to prevent d4.2... e5 is covered in the next chapter, while this chapter

really help protecting the b4–pawn. Remember that on b1 it was actually
doing a good job defending our pawn on c3 before we could start consolidating.
