{ Hello and welcome to my Lifetime Repertoires course on the English, Reti, and others! With this course, my goal is to give you a black repertoire that covers any and all moves that White can open with apart from 1. d4 and 1. e4. I have already covered 1. d4 in my Lifetime Repertoires: Semi-Slav course  (see @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/lifetime-repertoires-semi-slav/course/31529/@@LinkEnd@@)  , and this course's goal is to offer a bulletproof repertoire for Semi-Slav players who have to face alternative opening moves where they must have a good system ready against the English and Reti, but where they also must be able to transpose comfortably to a 1. d4 opening if White advances d2-d4 at some other point in the game. Broadly speaking, White has two ways of avoiding 1. e4 or 1. d4. He can open with 1. c4 or 1. Nf3, both of which are close cousins of 1. d4 and are serious attempts to fight for the advantage, both as their own moves and as move order tricks to transpose to 1. d4 lines and forcing Black into a position he might not have otherwise wanted to play. Other first moves, such as 1. b3, 1. b4, 1. a3, 1. g3, 1. g4, etc are utter nonsense that make no attempt to fight for an edge, but rather to avoid theory. Regardless of how I may feel about such moves, it is important to be ready for them as they are a favorite of players who wish to avoid any kind of theory and can't be troubled to try to play correct or challenging chess.   Against 1. c4 and 1. Nf3, the repertoire I have presented requires that Black be willing to enter a very specific subsection of the Caro-Kann or Grunfeld, but one that is clearly in his favor and avoids all of the most challenging tries. Against all other first moves, I have presented a solid repertoire, but it is very important to have the right attitude. It may be tempting to be looking for an advantage as early as move one if White makes some non-challenging move, but I think this is mistaken. According to the present state of theory, Black is fine in more or less every mainline within both 1. e4 and 1. d4, and when you play Black against a move like 1. a3 or 1. b3, you should not be looking to fight for an edge already or transpose to a normal mainline a tempo down. Instead, content yourself with comfortable equality and a chance to play for more in the middlegame. }
1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Bf5
{ In the Semi-Slav course, I clearly showed that against any setup White tried to play involving g2-g3, I either wished to take on c4 quickly, or to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain before playing e6, as I believe the triangle setup with e6 and c6 and the bishop still on c8 fails to equalize against g3/Bg2 setups. I stand by this conclusion. But, this begs the question: What to do against 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 ? Black cannot take on c4 and try to hold onto it, as White has not even played c2-c4 yet. The only other option is to try to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain, but as we will see, that fails to equalize as well. }
3. Bg2 Nf6 4. c4 e6 5. Qb3
{ Already Black will struggle to defend b7. For instance, after } 5... Qc8 6.
Nc3 c6 7. d4
{ We reach a version of the Sielecki repertoire where Black has been forced to play Qd8-c8, when I strongly believe that the queen should have gone to b6 instead, as stated in the Semi-Slav course. White looks better to me. }

6. d3 e6
{ White has multiple good options to fight for an edge, all of which are contingent upon the d-pawn only advancing a single square. The most obvious example is Bc1-e3, forcing Black to take on b3 and open the a-file. }
7. Be3 Qxb3 8. axb3 a6 9. Nh4
{ White looks better to me. He is very happy that his d-pawn has advanced to d3 instead of d4, both because the Bc1-e3 resource forced Black to take on b3, and because it is good prophylaxis against any kind of Bf5-e4 resource that Black may have otherwise had. Black should be careful not to reach a position like this one, where White will win the bishop pair and have good central control and development with no compensation, and I believe that he should deviate on the second move. }

1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. Bg2 c6
{ With our move order, we avoid Nf6 in favor of c6- a luxury Black doesn't have in the Grunfeld proper since he is required to play Nf6 on the first move of the game. As such, since Black is ready to take on c4 here as soon as the pawn shows up, we have avoided all of the cxd5 tries as well as Qb3 and Qa4. So, not only has White lost his options of playing into a mainline Grunfeld, but even within the Fianchetto system itself, he lost his best options there as well. }

{ The advance variation is surely the most testing line against the Caro-Kann, and the one I have played almost exclusively from the white side in my professional career, and with excellent results. The position is playable for Black, but he needs to be extremely well prepared in a lot of complicated variations, variations that we do not have to deal with given our move order against 1. c4. }

{ This move is very rare, for obvious reasons. But, it is seen now and then, most often between two players who have had a lot of experience against each other in the past and have generally seen Black prevail. Black is absolutely fine here in more ways than one, but my number one caution would be not to try to look for an advantage just yet and imagine the game has started and you are playing White. There are lots of easy routes to equality, but ending up in a reverse Najdorf a tempo down is probably not the best idea. Nor is getting into a reverse Queen's Gambit Accepted where White is more ready to support the c5-pawn by means of b2-b4. My recommendation, much like I want against b3 systems is to play a reverse London System- a pretty quiet opening where a2-a3 is not going to be wildly useful. The lost tempo means you will never be better, but Black is very comfortably equalizing. }

I find it hard to believe that anyone would be stupid enough to do this in 2020, and if White wanted to get the pawn to e4 at all costs, he certainly could have done so by playing e2-e4 on the first move of the game. Ridiculous as I find the move, it is still important to have some idea of how to handle it. }

Black can easily complete his development with a solid move like e7-e6 or g7-g6, when White would have nothing better than taking on e4 and being a bit worse with less space and a clumsily placed queen, but after the more ambitious }

{ A general piece of opening wisdom anyone should know is that any opening that shares its name with an animal is going to be bad, and the Bird is no exception. White is hoping to get some kind of reverse Dutch. While this is more provocative than a move like b3 or a3, I would again caution you not to be too ambitious with Black on the first move of the game. White is certainly better in the Dutch normally, but a tempo can mean a lot. The one thing you absolutely need to remember is to fight tooth and nail to make sure White cannot ever get the advance e2-e4 in. If he can pull that off, the extra space he has gained in the center with f2-f4 may very well pay off. It is important to develop your pieces in a manner that disallows the e2-e4 advance, particularly with respect to the c8-bishop. }
1... d5 2. Nf3 Nf6
{ At this point, White has to make a choice on how he will develop the f1-bishop, and commit to either putting it on g2 or playing e2-e3. Depending on which direction he chooses, Black should react differently. }
3. e3
{ Here I see no reason not to follow my general plan of playing a reverse London System. }
3... Bf5
{ As mentioned, this is a very controversial move. Black has placed all of his eggs in one basket, as he really must prevent the e3-e4 advance. If White gets e3-e4 in, it will come with a gain of tempo against the f5-bishop, and White will probably end up with a nice position. But, I don't think it will come, and it is very important to note the difference between 3. e3 and 3. g3. If White had put the bishop on g2, it would have been clearly fighting for the e2-e4 break. But, if White plays e2-e3, the bishop must come to a square where it does not support the e4 thrust, and White has already moved his e-pawn once. So, it is not surprising that Black can prevent this break. }

4... Bxd3 5. cxd3 e6
{ Black is already a bit better, as I can't see a great justification for White's doubled pawns. The main point is that in these stonewall-like structures, White really depends on getting his bishop to d3 where it can be an unopposed attacker while Black's light-squared bishop languishes away on a useless square like b7. Given that Black has already exchanged off White's potentially dangerous King's Bishop, he has nothing to fear. For example, after }
6. O-O c5 7. b3 Nc6 8. Bb2 Be7

4. d4
{ White can also try a stonewall setup, but this really makes no sense as Black's bishop is already on f5. As we saw in the Semi-Slav course when I recommended a stonewall setup for Black against Avrukh's 5. b3 line, the Stonewall player has a strategically dubious position and absolutely must get kingside counterplay to justify it. The best way to do this is to land an unopposed bishop on either d3 or d6, and here, this will obviously not happen as Black's bishop on f5 is already contesting the all-important diagonal. }
4... e6 5. Bd3 Be7
{ Black does not fear the capture on f5, as he will simply take back with good control of the e4-square and a nice semi-open e-file. A position like this one with Black's bishop back on c8 could potentially be dangerous, as White would have an easy attacking scheme with Nb1-d2, Nf3-e5, Qd1-f3, and Qf3-h3. But all of this is contingent on the bishop on d3 being unopposed, which is obviously not the case here. Black can comfortably castle kingside and his king will be totally safe as the d3-bishop poses no threat, and then he can easily complete his development with c7-c5 and Nb8-c6. White looks worse to me. }

{ It is very important that Black should avoid developing the bishop to f5. Putting the bishop on f5 is a somewhat controversial decision, as Black really needs to stop e2-e4. If he manages, fantastic ! But if he does not manage, he will lose time as the bishop will be hit with a gain of tempo, and White does a much better job of fighting for the e2-e4 break with the bishop on g2 as opposed to a square like e2, as it will then clearly be fighting for the e4 square. }
4. Bg2 b5
{ I like this idea, pointing out that the bishop committing to g2 so early means White can never hope to gain a tempo on the b5-pawn. By controlling the c4-square and preparing for Bb7 to prevent e4, I can't really see a great plan for White. For example, after }

8. d4 { Of course White could push d4 with a gain of tempo, but after } 8...
Be7
{ We end up in a strange stonewall-like position where White's bishop is weird on g2. Normally, the player playing the stonewall accepts that he has a strategically dubious position, but looks for attacking chances, largely connected with an unopposed bishop on either d3 or d6 to pressure the opposing kingside. In fact, I recommended such a setup in the Semi-Slav course against Avrukh's 5. b3. But here, the bishop is not on d3, but rather on g2. As such, Black will be totally safe castling kingside and looks to have a nice position with the extra space without worrying about any kingside attacks. }

White is certainly better in the Dutch normally, but a tempo can mean a lot. The one thing you absolutely need to remember is to fight tooth and nail to make sure White cannot ever get the advance e2-e4 in. If he can pull that off, the extra space he has gained in the center with f2-f4 may very well pay off.

1. b3
{ 1. b3 has become a reasonably popular choice nowadays, and I even faced it in a classical game against Nakamura a couple of years back. The move is not wildly dangerous but it can have some bite to it if Black is unprepared. I think the biggest mistake Black can make is to immediately try to punish White and fight tooth and nail for an advantage as early as move 1. White has played b3. This doesn't help him fight for the center or develop his pieces as well as some other first moves, but it is not 1. h4 - it has some sense to it. Black should content himself with comfortable equality, and not push too hard.   If you end up in some kind of reverse Queen's Indian a tempo down, it's very easy to get into massive trouble. My recommendation is to play a London System setup, where Black is very solid and comfortably equal, and he should not be thinking about an advantage or taking the entire center just yet. This is not his only good option, but I think it is quite sufficient and reasonably consistent with my general Semi-Slav setups. }
1... d5 2. Bb2
{ It's hard for me to imagine White playing something other than this. } 2...
Bf5
{ Playing a reverse London System seems totally acceptable. One of the main points is that Black has an easier time playing Bf5 than he would in the 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 lines because b3 and Bb2 are out of place - instead White would want to play c4 and harass the b7-pawn with Qb3, which is now a non-starter, or he would want to fight for d3+e4, which b3 and Bb2 do not help to achieve. So, I think Black can get away with Bf5 here.   2...c5?!  3.e3  This is the exact kind of thing that Black should avoid, and he can quickly get into trouble. For example, after  3...Nc6  4.Nf3  Nf6  5.Bb5  He is playing a reverse  Nf3  Nimzo with a tempo less. White is already threatening to compromise the pawn structure with  Bxc6+  ,  Ne5  could be in the air, and even  c4  could come. Black is really suffering thanks to being too ambitious early on and finding himself down a critical tempo in an otherwise normal looking mainline. Stick to solid, and be content with equality. }
3. e3
{ 3.d3  White can play d2-d3 as well, but this will have no independent value. It makes no sense to block in the f1-bishop if it was planning on developing along the f1-b5 diagonal, and White will all but certainly continue with g2-g3 next. Black plays his typical London System and it will transpose to the  g3  setup in short order. }
3... e6
{ White should play Nf3 here, transposing to the mainline, but he has a couple of fringe attempts. }
4. Nc3
{ This ridiculous-looking move gained a little bit of traction some years back. The idea is to play d4, Qd2, and O-O-O, but obviously it doesn't look too intimidating. }

c5
{ I was not in preparation at the time of the game, but I did find the best move. Black has easy play with Nc6 coming next to pressure White's center. }
6. Nf3 a6 7. Bd3 Bg4
{ This was not the only move and may not even have been best, but it was certainly good enough for an edge. White's pawn on d4 is coming under serious fire and my opponent even felt the need to take on c5 immediately, which is an obvious concession. The position is similar to the Veresov in my Semi-Slav course where White is only feeling the pain of the knight on c3 blocking the c2-pawn without the benefit of being able to push e4 through. I won a quick game. }

The move is not wildly dangerous but it can have some bite to it if Black is unprepared. I think the biggest mistake Black can make is to immediately try to punish White and fight tooth and nail for an advantage as early as move 1. White has played b3. This doesn't help him fight for the center or develop his pieces as well as some other first moves, but it is not 1. h4 - it has some sense to it. Black should content himself with comfortable equality, and not push too hard.   If you end up in some kind of reverse Queen's Indian a tempo down, it's very easy to get into massive trouble. My recommendation is to play a London System setup, where Black is very solid and comfortably equal, and he should not be thinking about an advantage or taking the entire center just yet. This is not his only good option, but I think it is quite sufficient and reasonably consistent with my general Semi-Slav setups. }

So, I think Black can get away with Bf5 here.   2...c5?!  3.e3  This is the exact kind of thing that Black should avoid, and he can quickly get into trouble. For example, after  3...Nc6  4.Nf3  Nf6  5.Bb5  He is playing a reverse  Nf3  Nimzo with a tempo less. White is already threatening to compromise the pawn structure with  Bxc6+  ,  Ne5  could be in the air, and even  c4  could come. Black is really suffering thanks to being too ambitious early on and finding himself down a critical tempo in an otherwise normal-looking mainline. Stick to solid, and be content with equality. }

{ Normally Black does not want to take the pawn on e4, as I explained in the e4 line. But this position is very different because White has played c2-c4 himself. As a result, not only is the d3-square beckoning to be abused by Nd7-c5, but also the plan of e4-e5 is no longer sensible  (even if it didn't hang the queen)  because the bishop on h7 would suddenly spring to life and fight for control of the d3-square, the c2-pawn is no longer there to restrict it, and White no longer has the plan of Nd2-c4 available to abuse d6. So, the situation is very different from when the pawn is back on c2. Black will follow up with a quick Nc5, and the weak e4 pawn and d3 square will be a serious issue for White. }

White is already threatening to compromise the pawn structure with  Bxc6+  ,  Ne5  could be in the air, and even  c4  could come. Black is really suffering thanks to being too ambitious early on and finding himself down a critical tempo in an otherwise normal-looking mainline. Stick to solid, and be content with equality. }

4. g3
{ I think it is more challenging for White to develop his bishop to g2 than e2. Once he completes his development with Bg2 and O-O, he has a potential plan of playing d3, Nbd2, and eventually fighting for the e4 break to maroon the bishop on h7. I never thought much of this plan but I lost a tough game to Fedoseev in Tata Steel 2019, where he played extremely well and I only made a couple of misjudgments. So, it is important to be ready. }

5. Bg2 Nf6 6. O-O Be7
{ This is the first key difference Black should know when facing the g3 setup. The bishop should come to e7. The point is twofold- first off, the bishop on d6 is much less active than it would be had White chosen to develop with e3 and Be2, as now it would be biting on granite on d6. Second, White will likely get e4 in, and then the bishop on d6 would be vulnerable to e5 tactics. }

11. a3 a5
{ 11...c5?!  This move should only be played once White has committed to  Bb2-c3  , where it can become a target. Here, after  12.cxd5  exd5  13.Rfe1  White is ready for  e4  at some point, and can also look for activity with  Rac1  and  Bh3.

12. Bc3
{ White does not have to play this move, but I don't really see another way for him to improve his position, and the plan of Bb2-c3, Qc2-b2, and then b2-b4 has been well known to be a little dangerous for Black. But, this is the moment for him to change the character of the game. }

{ 1. b3 has become a reasonably popular choice nowadays, and I even faced it in a classical game against Nakamura a couple of years back. The move is not wildly dangerous but it can have some bite to it if Black is unprepared. I think the biggest mistake Black can make is to immediately try to punish White and fight tooth and nail for an advantage as early as move 1. White has played b3. This doesn't help him fight for the center or develop his pieces as well as some other first moves, but it is not 1. h4 - it has some sense to it. Black should content himself with comfortable equality, and not push too hard.   If you end up in some kind of reverse Queen's Indian a tempo down, it's very easy to get into massive trouble. My recommendation is to play a London System setup, where Black is very solid and comfortably equal, and he should not be thinking about an advantage or taking the entire center just yet. This is not his only good option, but I think it is quite sufficient and reasonably consistent with my general Semi-Slav setups. }

{ This position is definitely fine for Black, but he should be careful to put his pieces on the right squares. The bishop on h7 looks passive and out of play, but the same can be said of the bishop on g2. A good rule of thumb is neither side wants to do anything with the e4 and d5 pawns. If Black ever takes on e4, White will then take back with the pawn, be able to play e5 next, and then since the d3 and d5 pawns are off the board, Nc4-d6 can become a massive issue. Conversely, if White ever plays e5, he shuts down the b2-bishop, opens the h7-bishop, and Black will immediately be better. And of course, exd5 is always well met by cxd5, capturing towards the center, and then Black can look to put pressure on the c-file. The one exception is that if White plays c2-c4, which I think is almost always bad. Then Black can comfortably take on e4 because of the aforementioned plan of e5 followed by Nc4-d6 no longer is possible due to the pawn on c4 blocking the knight's route, and the d3 square has become weakened. }
11... Nbd7
{ This is the way. Black should not fear e5 because even after the less than glorious retreat Nf6-e8, he will still have a very good position for all the aforementioned reasons.    11...Na6?  This move felt very natural to me as I was worried that if I put the knight on  d7  , then  e5  would come and my f6-knight would not have a good retreat, but in fact, the knight is seriously misplaced here as White now can plant the f3-knight on  e5  unmolested. Fedoseev played a great game and I lost pretty badly. Upon further study, I concluded Black should have played a more traditional London system setup. }
12. e5 Ne8
{ I already prefer Black. I don't think his king will ever come under any kind of fire, and his position plays itself on the queenside - Nc7, c5, then a4, etc, etc. }

{ This is the first key difference Black should know when facing the g3 setup. The bishop should come to e7. The point is twofold- first off, the bishop on d6 is much less active than it would be had White chosen to develop with e3 and Be2, as now it would be biting on granite on d6. Second, White will likely get e4 in, and then the bishop on d6 would be vulnerable to e5 tactics. }
7. d3 O-O 8. Nbd2 c6 9. Re1
{ White will get e4 in, but it's not the end of the world. } 9... Bh7 10. e4 a5
11. a3
{ This position is definitely fine for Black, but he should be careful to put his pieces on the right squares. The bishop on h7 looks passive and out of play, but the same can be said of the bishop on g2. A good rule of thumb is neither side wants to do anything with the e4 and d5 pawns. If Black ever takes on e4, White will then take back with the pawn, be able to play e5 next, and then since the d3 and d5 pawns are off the board, Nc4-d6 can become a massive issue. Conversely, if White ever plays e5, he shuts down the b2-bishop, opens the h7-bishop, and Black will immediately be better. And of course, exd5 is always well met by cxd5, capturing towards the center, and then Black can look to put pressure on the c-file. The one exception is that if White plays c2-c4, which I think is almost always bad, then Black can comfortably take on e4 because of the aforementioned plan of e5 followed by Nc4-d6 no longer is possible, and the d3 square has become weakened. }
11... Nbd7
{ This is the way. Black should not fear e5 because even after the less than glorious retreat Nf6-e8, he will still have a very good position for all the aforementioned reasons. }
12. Qe2
{ White should prefer a normal developing move, and this looks like the most natural way to me. He overprotects the d3 pawn and now could theoretically think about playing Rad1 and c4 without fear of Nc5-d3. }
12... b5
{ I like this move, gaining more space on the queenside. Black can complete his development with Qd8-b6, Rfd8, and Rac8, and I don't see any issue with his position. }

1. b3
{ 1. b3 has become a reasonably popular choice nowadays, and I even faced it in a classical game against Nakamura a couple of years back. The move is not wildly dangerous but it can have some bite to it if Black is unprepared. I think the biggest mistake Black can make is to immediately try to punish White and fight tooth and nail for an advantage as early as move 1. White has played b3. This doesn't help him fight for the center or develop his pieces as well as some other first moves, but it is not 1. h4 - it has some sense to it. Black should content himself with comfortable equality, and not push too hard.   If you end up in some kind of reverse Queen's Indian a tempo down, it's very easy to get into massive trouble. My recommendation is to play a London System setup, where Black is very solid and comfortably equal, and he should not be thinking about an advantage or taking the entire center just yet. This is not his only good option, but I think it is quite sufficient and reasonably consistent with my general Semi-Slav setups. }

Now we are in a Caro-Kann, but specifically, a Caro-Kann where White has already committed to playing the Panov, which is almost completely unseen nowadays and is something like his 10th best option. So, even if you are not a Caro-Kann player, it shouldn't be troublesome to transpose back into this specific line while avoiding 3.Nc3, the Advance, the exchange without c4, or the 2 knights.

2... d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6
{ Classically speaking, this is a very ambitious move. Black wants to complete his development with Bg7 and O-O when his bishop on g7 is well placed to pressure the soon-to-be isolated pawn on d4, while the kingside fianchetto ensures a safe king position that Black often does not get when he develops with e6 and Be7 instead. In addition, the pawn remaining back on e7 means the c8-bishop's freedom is not restricted. If White proceeds along with normal looking moves and doesn't pressure Black immediately, he could become worse without much of a fight. In general, making moves that guarantee you a good position against simple development is a good way to force your opponent to sharpen the play. }

8. Nf3 Bg7
{ 8...Nc6?  This would reach the position I was discussing on the previous move where both  Nf3  and  Nc6  had been included. Black is immediately busted after  9.d5!  When his knight is forced to move again, and then  Bb5+  will come, gaining another tempo, and White's initiative is out of control. Omitting  Nc6  , as we see in the mainline, is key. }
9. Bb5+ Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7
{ Black is ready to castle next, with an obviously fine position. He need not fear any knight jumps to e5, as he then can either take the knight or put the queen on e6, as the doubled pawns should not be problematic. I would already prefer his chances, though the machine insists on equal. }

{ This is definitely White's best try. He attacks the d5-pawn, which cannot comfortably move because dxc4 would lead to immediate problems. Black is best advised to just let White take it, when he will have a strategically fantastic position with a pawn less, and should be ready to fight to regain the pawn in the coming moves. }

This position is no exception, and after Black's position falls apart before he can get castled. }

White has to be very careful, since Black has a very straightforward plan of Nbd7-b6-xd5, equalizing material and leaving him with a nice strategic edge. }
8. Nge2
{ This move has some sense to it. White can hope to complete his development with either g3 and Bg2, or with Nf4 and Be2, in both cases lending extra added support to the d5-pawn. But, it is also inflexible, and Black has a surprising and very strong respite. }
8... a5
{ Black threatens a5-a4, questioning the stability of the queenside pieces lending support to the d5-pawn. Surprisingly, White is already almost worse. }
9. Nf4
{ This move is very natural, adding further support to d5 and getting the knight out of the way of the f1-bishop to complete the kingside development. But, Black can now take advantage of White moving the same piece too many times in the opening and play very aggressively. }

{ One of the most natural things White can do if he wants to avoid transposing into the Semi-Slav is to force us into an e4 opening! Now we are in a Caro-Kann, but specifically, a Caro-Kann where White has already committed to playing the Panov, which is almost completely unseen nowadays and is something like his 10th best option. So, even if you are not a Caro-Kann player, it shouldn't be troublesome to transpose back into this specific line while avoiding 3.Nc3, the Advance, the exchange without c4, or the 2 knights.

{ Classically speaking, this is a very ambitious move. Black wants to complete his development with Bg7 and O-O when his bishop on g7 is well placed to pressure the soon-to-be isolated pawn on d4, while the kingside fianchetto ensures a safe king position that Black often does not get when he develops with e6 and Be7 instead. In addition, the pawn remaining back on e7 means the c8-bishop's freedom is not restricted. If White proceeds along with normal looking moves and doesn't pressure Black immediately, he could become worse without much of a fight. In general, making moves that guarantee you a good position against simple development is a good way to force your opponent to sharpen the play. }

He is forced to play  8.d5  But in general against the Panov, you really do not want to play both  e6  and  g6  together - you should pick one or the other, as moving your pawns too many times before completing your development in an open position is not a recipe for happiness. This position is no exception, and after Black's position falls apart before he can get castled. }
7. cxd5 O-O
{ The evaluation of this position is critical for the evaluation of the Panov with 5... g6 as a whole. White has an extra pawn that Black will have to work hard to get back, but it is doubled and isolated, plus White is behind in development. White has to be very careful, since Black has a very straightforward plan of Nbd7-b6-xd5, equalizing material and leaving him with a nice strategic edge. }
8. Be2
{ Of all the ways for White to try to complete his development, I think this one is best. He gets one move closer to castling without committing the g1-knight, which can consider going to h3 in case of Nbd7, and White can setup with Bf3 and Nge2 if needed. Unsurprisingly, this has been the most common move historically. }
8... Na6
{ Unfortunately, Black is unable to get Nbd7-b6 in very comfortably as White could then respond with Nh3-f4. So, he goes another route. His plan in the coming moves will be Qd8-b6 to exchange queens and remove a defender of d5, and then follow up with Rf8-d8 and Na6-b4 to win back the d5-pawn.   8...Nbd7?!  This is complacent as it allows White to complete his development without losing the d5-pawn. After  9.Bf3   9.Nh3!  Qb6   9...Nb6  10.Nf4  White is ready to castle next and will keep his extra pawn.

In the analogous position with Ng1-e2-f4 played instead of Bf1-e2-f3, Black had the resource g6-g5 to kick away the defending piece and then slamming through on  d5.  Here, Black is unable to kick away the  f3  bishop, so he is just worse. }
9. Bf4
{ This move has been played from time to time, with the point that White is ready for d5-d6 in some cases to try to liquidate the weak pawn. I don't think this is much of a problem for Black since White still is neglecting his kingside development. }
9... Qb6 { Black walks into White's 'trap'. } 10. Qxb6 axb6 11. d6

11... Nb4 12. dxe7 Re8
{ White faces an unpleasant fork on c2 that is not easy to deal with. Moving the rook would allow Nb4xa2, so White should try }
13. Kf1 { But after } 13... Nbd5 14. Bd6 Nxe7
{ White's lagging development and Black's activity fully compensates the missing pawn. Moves like Bc8-e6 and Ne7-f5  (or c6)  are coming next. The machines say equal, but I prefer Black. }

In addition, the pawn remaining back on e7 means the c8-bishop's freedom is not restricted.

Black is best advised to just let White take it, when he will have a strategically fantastic position with a pawn less, and should be ready to fight to regain the pawn in the coming moves. }
6... Bg7
{ Black cannot be troubled to defend the pawn with e6. This would see him fall too far behind in development.   6...dxc4  7.Bxc4  Black would like to make this move, but he is not ready yet since after  7...e6  He is facing a problem on the f7-square. He is forced to play  8.d5  But in general against the Panov, you really do not want to play both  e6  and  g6  together - you should pick one or the other, as moving your pawns too many times before completing your development in an open position is not a recipe for happiness. This position is no exception, and after Black's position falls apart before he can get castled. }
7. cxd5 O-O
{ The evaluation of this position is critical for the evaluation of the Panov with 5... g6 as a whole. White has an extra pawn that Black will have to work hard to get back, but it is doubled and isolated, plus White is behind in development. White has to be very careful, since Black has a very straightforward plan of Nbd7-b6-xd5, equalizing material and leaving him with a nice strategic edge. }
8. Be2
{ Of all the ways for White to try to complete his development, I think this one is best. He gets one move closer to castling without committing the g1-knight, which can consider going to h3 in case of Nbd7, and White can setup with Bf3 and Nge2 if needed. Unsurprisingly, this has been the most common move historically. }
8... Na6
{ Unfortunately, Black is unable to get Nbd7-b6 in very comfortably as White could then respond with Nh3-f4. So, he goes another route. His plan in the coming moves will be Qd8-b6 to exchange queens and remove a defender of d5, and then follow up with Rf8-d8 and Na6-b4 to win back the d5-pawn.   8...Nbd7?!  This is complacent as it allows White to complete his development without losing the d5-pawn. After  9.Bf3   9.Nh3!  Qb6   9...Nb6  10.Nf4  White is ready to castle next and will keep his extra pawn. Black has some compensation, but not enough for equality.  10.Nf4  Qxb3  11.axb3  Nb6  12.h3  Rd8  13.Bf3  Nb6  10.Nge2   10...Bf5  11.O-O  Qd7  12.a4   12...Rfd8  13.Nf4   13.d6  exd6  Rac8  14.a5  Nc4  Rad8  13.Nf4  Bg4  11.Bxg4  Nxg4   8...a5?  9.Bf3  It is worth noting that the a7-a5 resource that worked so beautifully against  8.Nge2  is far less effective here since White can defend the  d5  pawn much more harmoniously. In the analogous position with Ng1-e2-f4 played instead of Bf1-e2-f3, Black had the resource g6-g5 to kick away the defending piece and then slamming through on  d5.  Here, Black is unable to kick away the  f3  bishop, so he is just worse. }
9. Bf3

10. Qxb6 axb6

{ One of the most natural things White can do if he wants to avoid transposing into the Semi-Slav is to force us into an e4 opening! Now we are in a Caro-Kann, but specifically, a Caro-Kann where White has already committed to playing the Panov, which is almost completely unseen nowadays and is something like his 10th best option. So, even if you are not a Caro-Kann player, it shouldn't be troublesome to transpose back into this specific line while avoiding 3.Nc3, the Advance, the exchange without c4, or the 2 knights. All of these other options are tough to meet and give White serious chances of fighting for an edge, but White is instead forced into the Panov. }

{ Classically speaking, this is a very ambitious move. Black wants to complete his development with Bg7 and O-O when his bishop on g7 is well placed to pressure the soon-to-be isolated pawn on d4, while the kingside fianchetto ensures a safe king position that Black often does not get when he develops with e6 and Be7 instead. In addition, the pawn remaining back on e7 means the c8-bishop's freedom is not restricted. If White proceeds along with normal looking moves and doesn't pressure Black immediately, he could become worse without much of a fight. In general, making moves that guarantee you a good position against simple development is a good way to force your opponent to sharpen the play. }

I am not convinced Black will equalize here and I think the text is much stronger. }
11. O-O Bb7
{ White has still retained his extra pawn some 8 moves after he took it, but his options are now very limited. Given a few moves, Black can play b6-b5 and Nd7-b6, getting the pawn back with a fantastic position due to the active bishops. White has to be very direct. }
12. Re1 Re8
{ Sadly Black has to make a passive move to defend the e7 pawn, but his main plan of b5 and Nb6 comes next. }
13. Ng5
{ This aggressive lunge is the main move, since simple development won't cut it. The threats around the f7 pawn might look scary, but White really is in no position to launch an attack with his pieces all on the queenside. }
13... Rc8
{ Paying no heed to what White is up to, Black continues along with the plan of Ra8-c8, and can look for b6-b5 followed by Nd7-c5. }
14. d6
{ Nothing else makes any sense. White has to go for it, but he still ends up worse. }
14... e6
{ The sacrifices on e6 are not even close to working, and White is just worse with b6-b5 and Nd7-c5 coming next. A bishop on f4 will not save the d6-pawn in view of Nf6-h5. }

8... Bf5
{ 8...e6  9.d4  Be7  10.O-O  O-O  11.Re1  A position like this one could get very dangerous for Black, as his bishop on  c8  is not a very good defensive piece and White can start attacking along the b1-h7 diagonal. Black can, and should, get the bishop outside of the pawn chain. }
9. d4 e6
{ White is left with a weak isolated pawn on d4. Sooner or later, he will have to liquidate it with d4-d5 to avoid being worse. The bishop on f5 means Black will never have to fear a kingside attack. }

5. b3
{ Of course, White could just play d4 and transpose to a Meran. But by playing b3, he has another idea. He wants to avoid playing d4 and instead develop with some combination of Bb2, Qc2, Be2, and perhaps even Rg1 and g4 to launch a kingside attack. The absence of the pawn on d4 makes this plan more credible because the b2 bishop will not be locked in, and Black will have a hard time blasting open the center with e6-e5 since there is no pawn on d4 to attack, which was his plan against all of the g4 lines in the proper Meran. Black is fine but should know what to do. }
5... Bd6
{ I think this is clearly Black's best move order, and that it is very important to delay Nbd7. The point is that in a lot of cases, the knight will find another home. For instance, if Black is able to make the e6-e5 advance, White generally takes on d5, freeing up the c6 square. A good rule of thumb is to always play Nbd7 whenever White plays d4, but otherwise to leave the knight at home and develop in another way.   5...Nbd7  Historically, this has been the main move, but most strong players have instead opted for  Bd6  in recent years. I think  Nbd7  is inaccurate, because after  6.Bb2  Bd6  7.Qc2  O-O  8.Be2  e5  I don't see much sense in Black's position. The c6-c5 break and e6-e5 breaks don't work too well because the  d7  knight can't then come to the superior  c6  square. For example, I think White should be better after  9.cxd5  cxd5  10.Nb5  Bb8  11.Rc1  When it is abundantly obvious the d7-knight belongs on  c6. }
6. Bb2 O-O
{ Now White has a choice to make. I think his most dangerous plan is to play Qc2 and aim to launch a kingside attack with Rg1 and g4, but he should play Be2 first as prophylaxis against e5. The major drawback of White omitting the d2-d4 advance is that e6-e5 can come much more easily, and he should take care to avoid it. }

{ This has seen a lot of play, but I believe Black can now get the freeing e6-e5 advance in, pre-empting any hope of a flank attack from White. }

I think  Nbd7  is inaccurate, because after  6...Bd6  7.Qc2  O-O  8.Be2  e5  I don't see much sense in Black's position. The c6-c5 break and e6-e5 breaks don't work too well because the  d7  knight can't then come to the superior  c6  square. For example, I think White should be better after  9.cxd5  cxd5  10.Nb5  Bb8  11.Rc1  When it is abundantly obvious the d7-knight belongs on  c6.   5...c5?  6.cxd5 }

He wants to avoid playing d4 and instead develop with some combination of Bb2, Qc2, Be2, and perhaps even Rg1 and g4 to launch a kingside attack. The absence of the pawn on d4 makes this plan more credible because the b2 bishop will not be locked in, and Black will have a hard time blasting open the center with e6-e5 since there is no pawn on d4 to attack, which was his plan against all of the g4 lines in the proper Meran. Black is fine but should know what to do. }

After  8...cxd5  9.Nb5  Nc6  10.Nxd6  Qxd6  11.d4  Black just looks worse to me, as White will castle long before he runs into any problems.

I think  Nbd7  is inaccurate, because after  6...Bd6  7.Qc2  O-O  8.Be2  e5  I don't see much sense in Black's position. The c6-c5 break and e6-e5 breaks don't work too well because the  d7  knight can't then come to the superior  c6  square. For example, I think White should be better after  9.cxd5  cxd5  10.Nb5  Bb8  11.Rc1  When it is abundantly obvious the d7-knight belongs on  c6.   5...c5?  6.cxd5 }
6. Bb2 O-O
{ Now White has a choice to make. I think his most dangerous plan is to play Qc2 and aim to launch a kingside attack with Rg1 and g4, but he should play Be2 first as prophylaxis against e5. The major drawback of White omitting the d2-d4 advance is that e6-e5 can come much more easily, and he should take care to avoid it. }
7. Be2
{ If White is not going to transpose to the normal Semi-Slav with 7. d4, this is his best option. Black isn't able to get e6-e5 in at this moment and has to continue his development another way. }
7... b6
{ Again, I want to delay the development of the b8-knight, hoping for a greener pasture than d7. And again, I think Black should go Nbd7 more or less every time White plays d2-d4. This move is not mentioned by Alexander Delchev in his 2012 book 'The Modern Reti', which was the only chess literature I could find recommending this line for White. }
8. Qc2
{ This move is much more aggressive than it looks. White is preparing for a long castle in the coming moves and a launch of his g-pawn, when his king can easily run to safety on the queenside at any moment and he can look for a kingside pawn storm. Black should be careful to respond appropriately. }
8... Bb7 9. g4
{ Throwing g4 immediately is spirited, but I think Black can grab the pawn. }
9... Nxg4 10. Rg1 f5
{ An important move. Black bolsters the knight on g4 and also cuts off White's queen's access to the Black kingside. I don't think White's attack is too dangerous and Black can complete his development with Nd7, Qe7, and Ngf6 when the g4-knight gets kicked. He looks totally satisfied to me. }

1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 c6 3. e3
{ With this move, White is attempting to play into a Meran while omitting the advance d2-d4  (if he ever plays it, he will transpose directly to the Semi-Slav)  . The positions are a bit different, and Black should be prepared. }
3... Nf6 4. Nc3 e6
{ One nice thing about the Semi-Slav is that unlike a lot of other d4 openings, it is pretty resilient to move-order tricks. For example, the Queens Gambit Accepted is avoided with 1. c4, the Benoni and Benko are avoided with 1. Nf3, the Grunfeld gives White a huge amount of extraneous options if he starts with 1. Nf3 or 1. c4, and the list goes on. Black can always play something like c5 on the first move, forcing a symmetrical English and leaving any trace of transposing to a d4 opening behind as early as move one, but Semi-Slav players have the added luxury of being able to transpose to their preferred repertoire in a lot of cases without giving White many good extraneous options. This line is no exception. }
5. b3
{ Of course, White could just play d4 and transpose to a Meran. But by playing b3, he has another idea. He wants to avoid playing d4 and instead develop with some combination of Bb2, Qc2, Be2, and perhaps even Rg1 and g4 to launch a kingside attack. The absence of the pawn on d4 makes this plan more credible because the b2 bishop will not be locked in, and Black will have a hard time blasting open the center with e6-e5 since there is no pawn on d4 to attack, which was his plan against all of the g4 lines in the proper Meran. Black is fine but should know what to do. }
5... Bd6
{ I think this is clearly Black's best move order, and that it is very important to delay Nbd7. The point is that in a lot of cases, the knight will find another home.

8. Qc2 Bb7 9. cxd5
{ This is not dangerous for Black. He just recaptures with exd5 and has a very harmonious position. In general, White almost never wants to make the cxd5 exchange allowing exd5 in any Semi-Slav position unless his bishop is on g5. }

1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 c6 3. e3
{ With this move, White is attempting to play into a Meran while omitting the advance d2-d4  (if he ever plays it, he will transpose directly to the Semi-Slav)  . The positions are a bit different, and Black should be prepared. }
3... Nf6 4. Nc3 e6
{ One nice thing about the Semi-Slav is that unlike a lot of other d4 openings, it is pretty resilient to move-order tricks. For example, the Queens Gambit Accepted is avoided with 1. c4, the Benoni and Benko are avoided with 1. Nf3, the Grunfeld gives White a huge amount of extraneous options if he starts with 1. Nf3 or 1. c4, and the list goes on. Black can always play something like c5 on the first move, forcing a symmetrical English and leaving any trace of transposing to a d4 opening behind as early as move one, but Semi-Slav players have the added luxury of being able to transpose to their preferred repertoire in a lot of cases without giving White many good extraneous options. This line is no exception. }
5. b3
{ Of course, White could just play d4 and transpose to a Meran. But by playing b3, he has another idea. He wants to avoid playing d4 and instead develop with some combination of Bb2, Qc2, Be2, and perhaps even Rg1 and g4 to launch a kingside attack. The absence of the pawn on d4 makes this plan more credible because the b2 bishop will not be locked in, and Black will have a hard time blasting open the center with e6-e5 since there is no pawn on d4 to attack, which was his plan against all of the g4 lines in the proper Meran. Black is fine but should know what to do. }
5... Bd6
{ I think this is clearly Black's best move order, and that it is very important to delay Nbd7. The point is that in a lot of cases, the knight will find another home. For instance, if Black is able to make the e6-e5 advance, White generally takes on d5, freeing up the c6 square. A good rule of thumb is to always play Nbd7 whenever White plays d4, but otherwise to leave the knight at home and develop in another way.   5...Nbd7  6.Bb2  Historically, this has been the main move, but most strong players have instead opted for  Bd6  in recent years. I think  Nbd7  is inaccurate, because after  6...Bd6  7.Qc2  O-O  8.Be2  e5  I don't see much sense in Black's position. The c6-c5 break and e6-e5 breaks don't work too well because the  d7  knight can't then come to the superior  c6  square. For example, I think White should be better after  9.cxd5  cxd5  10.Nb5  Bb8  11.Rc1  When it is abundantly obvious the d7-knight belongs on  c6.   5...c5?  6.cxd5 }
6. Bb2 O-O
{ Now White has a choice to make. I think his most dangerous plan is to play Qc2 and aim to launch a kingside attack with Rg1 and g4, but he should play Be2 first as prophylaxis against e5. The major drawback of White omitting the d2-d4 advance is that e6-e5 can come much more easily, and he should take care to avoid it. }
7. Be2
{ If White is not going to transpose to the normal Semi-Slav with 7. d4, this is his best option. Black isn't able to get e6-e5 in at this moment and has to continue his development another way. }

In this particular case, I think taking c4 is the way to go. A general rule of thumb for the resulting positions is that whenever White goes a2-a4, you should let him take the pawn back on c4 since it becomes much harder to defend, he has lost time that he could have spent developing, and he has weakened the b4-square. But if White doesn't play a2-a4, you should be fighting to keep the pawn alive. }

In this particular case, I think taking c4 is the way to go. A general rule of thumb for the resulting positions is that whenever White goes a2-a4, you should let him take the pawn back on c4 since it becomes much harder to defend, he has lost time that he could have spent developing, and he has weakened the b4-square. But if White doesn't play a2-a4, you should be fighting to keep the pawn alive. }

Then, he can consider Nb8-a6, pointing out that the knight has greener pastures available than the standard d7-b6 route that he really has to take if White had not committed to a2-a4 so early. }

Black has a very comfortable game, can easily complete his development with g6 and Bg7, and White has a hard time defending the d4 pawn. }

In this particular case, I think taking c4 is the way to go. A general rule of thumb for the resulting positions is that whenever White goes a2-a4, you should let him take the pawn back on c4 since it becomes much harder to defend, he has lost time that he could have spent developing, and he has weakened the b4-square. But if White doesn't play a2-a4, you should be fighting to keep the pawn alive. }

{ In general, I think this is not the best way for White to play since it is mixing plans too much. If his goal is to develop with Nf3, Bg2, and O-O, I think it is more challenging for him to do it immediately and without bothering with c4. As is, Black can use White's decision to play c4 and g3 together so early in the game to his advantage by taking the pawn and hanging onto it to some degree. }
3... Nf6 4. Bg2
{ This position can be reached through any number of move orders, including Nf3 on move 1. There is some venom in White's setup, but in this particular case, I think Black has no major issues if he is well prepared. }
4... dxc4
{ As is my usual philosophy from the Semi-Slav course as well, I think Black should not play a triangle setup without taking on c4 against the g3 setups, and should instead look to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain or take on c4. In this particular case, I think taking c4 is the way to go. A general rule of thumb for the resulting positions is that whenever White goes a2-a4, you should let him take the pawn back on c4 since it becomes much harder to defend, he has lost time that he could have spent developing, and he has weakened the b4-square. But if White doesn't play a2-a4, you should be fighting to keep the pawn alive. }

{ At this point, I think White's best plan is to go for Na3 to challenge the c4 pawn, specifically because Black cannot respond with b5. But, I think he should include the moves a2-a4 and a7-a5 first. }
7. a4

7... a5 8. Na3
{ Now and only now White goes for Na3. The pawns being on a5 and a4 instead of a7 and a2 change two things. First, the knight on b6 is loose in a lot of lines, and Black will face far more tactical issues if he tries to hang onto the extra material at all costs as a result. But secondly, if Black is happy to let the pawn go and simply complete his development, his position has become much more strategically sound because of the weakness of the b4-square. }
8... g6
{ Marin does not consider this move.   8...Be6  This is the most ambitious move, trying to hang onto the c4-pawn, but Black will face tactical problems connected with the b6-knight that he wouldn't if  a4  and  a5  were not included.  9.Ng5  Bg4  10.Nxc4  Bxe2  11.Ne5  Bh5  12.Re1  Black is in some trouble here.

For instance, the mainline is cxd5, but he can also seriously consider Nf3, when Black cannot take on c4 so easily, and then meeting c6 with either Qb3 or Qa4, with the latter being Avrukh's recommendation in his most recent work. }
5. cxd5
{ 5.Nf3  Black cannot take on c4 so easily now since after Na3, he can't save the pawn the way he could have if he had played c6 instead of Nf6.  c6  And now instead of O-O, which would transpose to our repertoire after dxc4, White can try either  6.Qb3  Or   6.Qa4 !?  With an interesting and challenging position in both cases. }

1. Nf3 d5 2. g3
{ The most annoying development scheme White can employ against a Semi-Slav player   apart from  1.e4  , which is totally different  is playing Nf3 and g3 on the first two moves. White is aiming to transpose into a Catalan at the right moment, an opening I chose to avoid by using the Slav move order, and I think Black ends up slightly worse if he sets up with d5, c6, e6, and sits. Against all the lines with g3 in the Semi-Slav course, I always either took on c4 very early to grab a pawn and hang onto it, or I developed the bishop on c8 outside of the pawn chain before playing e6. In this case, neither option really works.   Obviously Black cannot quickly grab c4, as White has not even played it yet, but also he cannot comfortably play Bc8-f5 because the bishop will be far less secure and effective if White has not yet committed to moving the d-pawn to d4. For a long time, the Reti was considered an extremely inconvenient move order for a Semi-Slav player. But, in the 2013 World Championship match, Anand showed the way for Black. }
2... g6
{ This is not Black's only good move by any stretch, but I think it is his most direct and clear equalizer. Much like we see against 1. c4, where Black must be willing to transpose into a Caro-Kann, here, he must be willing to transpose into a Grunfeld. But just like when we are forced into a Caro-Kann where White is forced to play the Panov, here we are forced into a Grunfeld where White has already committed to playing a g3 system, and we needn't worry about Bc4+Ne2, Nf3+Rb1, Nf3+Be3, 3. f3, or any of the other extremely dangerous and theoretical tries against the Grunfeld. In fact, we only need to know a single line- the Fianchetto system where White does not play cxd5. As far as I can tell, Black is fine. }

The knight on c6 blocking the c7-pawn is not an issue since as I have explained in the Semi-Slav course at various points, you generally can get away with developing your knight to c6  (or c3 for White)  if you are able to advance your e-pawn two squares. This position is no exception. Once White takes back on c4, Black will be able to play e7-e5. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O

Still, he is probably fine, though my main variation with  6...e5  is definitely the cleanest equalizer. }

1. Nf3 d5 2. g3
{ The most annoying development scheme White can employ against a Semi-Slav player   apart from  1.e4  , which is totally different  is playing Nf3 and g3 on the first two moves. White is aiming to transpose into a Catalan at the right moment, an opening I chose to avoid by using the Slav move order, and I think Black ends up slightly worse if he sets up with d5, c6, e6, and sits. Against all the lines with g3 in the Semi-Slav course, I always either took on c4 very early to grab a pawn and hang onto it, or I developed the bishop on c8 outside of the pawn chain before playing e6. In this case, neither option really works.   Obviously Black cannot quickly grab c4, as White has not even played it yet, but also he cannot comfortably play Bc8-f5 because the bishop will be far less secure and effective if White has not yet committed to moving the d-pawn to d4. For a long time, the Reti was considered an extremely inconvenient move order for a Semi-Slav player. But, in the 2013 World Championship match, Anand showed the way for Black. }
2... g6
{ This is not Black's only good move by any stretch, but I think it is his most direct and clear equalizer. Much like we see against 1. c4, where Black must be willing to transpose into a Caro-Kann, here, he must be willing to transpose into a Grunfeld. But just like when we are forced into a Caro-Kann where White is forced to play the Panov, here we are forced into a Grunfeld where White has already committed to playing a g3 system, and we needn't worry about Bc4+Ne2, Nf3+Rb1, Nf3+Be3, 3. f3, or any of the other extremely dangerous and theoretical tries against the Grunfeld.

{ White can try grabbing the pawn back with the queen as well, but this will only lose time later on when Black gets Bc8-e6 with tempo. Black still is able to play his normal setup and he got his pawn to e5 to take a strong stake in the center. }

1. Nf3 d5 2. g3
{ The most annoying development scheme White can employ against a Semi-Slav player   apart from  1.e4  , which is totally different  is playing Nf3 and g3 on the first two moves. White is aiming to transpose into a Catalan at the right moment, an opening I chose to avoid by using the Slav move order, and I think Black ends up slightly worse if he sets up with d5, c6, e6, and sits. Against all the lines with g3 in the Semi-Slav course, I always either took on c4 very early to grab a pawn and hang onto it, or I developed the bishop on c8 outside of the pawn chain before playing e6. In this case, neither option really works.   Obviously Black cannot quickly grab c4, as White has not even played it yet, but also he cannot comfortably play Bc8-f5 because the bishop will be far less secure and effective if White has not yet committed to moving the d-pawn to d4. For a long time, the Reti was considered an extremely inconvenient move order for a Semi-Slav player. But, in the 2013 World Championship match, Anand showed the way for Black. }

7... O-O
{ Black simply castles and maintains the pawn on d5. In order to force e4 through at a moment when Black could not take it, White had to play Nbd2. As a result, he was unable to bring the knight to c3, where it would actually pressure Black's pawn center and force him to make some kind of concession. As is, Black maintains the big center, easily completes his development with h6, Re8, Be6, as always, and should take care to meet c2-c3 with a7-a5 to stop b4. Although the machines insist on 0.00, I prefer Black from a human point of view, and the results in human games confirm this assessment. }

I ran the position with various strong engines and all of them evaluated the position as close to equal, with some favoring White and some favoring Black. Both sides have chances of course, but I would prefer the Black side. He will soon castle and complete his development with Na6 and Be6, with a pretty solid position. The extra material will count one day, and it's really up to White to turn his compensation into something concrete. I don't see a great way to do so. I suspect this position will be tested many times in the years to come, but until that happens, for now, I think I will evaluate it as dynamically balanced. }

Black will have to deal with the full range of options White has available to him in the Fianchetto Grunfeld, which is not an easy task. given White's chosen move order, Black can ease his life considerably by meeting  d4  with  c6  so that it is harder for White to get  c4  in. Note that after:  5...dxc4  6.Na3!  Black cannot defend his pawn nearly as easily as he could have if he had already played c7-c6, as I am recommending. }

A generally desirable move like Qa4 or Na3 to take the pawn back and hope to claim a slight edge based on the better central control would be well met by b7-b5, maintaining the extra pawn. So, White needs to waste time with a2-a4 before trying to take the pawn back. }
7. a4 Ne4
{ Much like we see in some of the other lines within this course, such as the Reti with 2. c4, Black makes some attempt to hang onto the c4-pawn. He definitely will not succeed in the long run, but the goal is to make White work to get the pawn back and compromise his position in some way as a result. At this point, White has 3 serious options and in my opinion, the least common one is the most challenging, and the most common one is the least challenging. This is generally a sign that the masses have not yet studied this position in much detail or come to the right conclusions about what to play, and a good sign for anyone playing this repertoire in the near future. }

9. e4
{ White's play is not subtle. He wants to take space in the center and get the pawn back on c4, with a nice edge, but we won't make it easy for him. If White ever has to advance e4-e5, he will seriously weaken the f5 and d5 squares and make the d4-pawn backward.   9...O-O  10.e5   9...Be6  10.Rd1 }
9... Na6 10. Na3
{ The most challenging thing White can do is to try to take the c4-pawn without having to push e4-e5. If he can do this, he will equalize material and maintain a nice edge thanks to his big pawn center and not have to face the positional detriments of the weakened d5 and f5 squares. It is an ambitious idea and Black must react accordingly, and unsurprisingly, it is White's most common move. }

8. Nc3
{ This move was recently played by both Gelfand and Wang Hao, and despite not being nearly as popular as Qc2 or even Na3, I believe it is actually best. White immediately poses a challenge to the e4-knight, forcing it to decide whether to retreat to d6 or exchange on c3. In either case, he has obvious compensation for the missing pawn and Black should be precise to maintain the balance. }
8... Nd6
{ Naturally, Black carries out his main plan of Ne4-d6 to secure the c4-pawn. But after }
9. e4
{ We see the point of White's play. He is not necessarily that interested in fighting to get the c4-pawn back so soon, but instead has taken a huge stake in the center and is ready to continue with Bc1-e3, Qd1-e2, and putting the rooks in the center, hoping his space advantage means more than Black's extra pawn on c4. In addition, Black constantly has to be on the lookout for e4-e5 since he will not have time to play h7-h5 to secure the knight on f5. }
9... Bg4
{ An important move. Black cannot allow White to play e4-e5, and now he will be able to play Nf5 in response without fearing g3-g4.   9...O-O?  This very innocent looking move is actually a serious mistake. The point is that after  10.e5!  Black cannot secure the f5-outpost for his knight and after  10...Nf5  11.g4!  Nh6  12.h3!  The knight on  h6  is not only out of play but also in serious danger of simply getting taken after  Be3  and  Qd2.  Not to mention that Qd1-e2 will pick up the c4-pawn whenever White wants it! Things have already gone horribly long. }
10. Be3
{ This position has been seen 3 times, with 5 of the 6 players being Israeli. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the fruit of some home analysis of their national team or something similar, which is already an indicator that the line is very challenging and should be taken seriously. Here, I am very worried about the move h2-h3, which will challenge the g4-bishop and force it to either exchange on f3, ceding the bishop pair and accelerating White's development with Qd1xf3, or force the bishop on g4 to retreat instead, when the aforementioned plan of e5 followed by g4 looks deeply unpleasant. With this in mind, I have a natural novelty to propose. }
10... Qc8
{ A very important move. Black stops h2-h3, and White has a much harder time proving his compensation than he previously did in existing games when 10...O-O ?! and 10... Na6 ?! each led to disastrous positions in just a few moves.   10...Na6?!  Gelfand faced this move against Sarana and was just better after:  11.h3!  Bxf3  12.Qxf3  Nb4  13.Qe2  Nd3  14.b3  And Black's position quickly fell apart. }
11. Qd2
{ At high depths, the engines favor this move. Now, Black has one final important decision to make before I am ready to claim he has equal chances. }
11... Na6
{ I think it is most prudent to delay castling. As soon as Black's king runs to g8, White has a very serious plan of Nf3-h4 followed by f4-f5, with a vicious attack. I believe Black is fine now, but the moves Qd8-c8 and Nb8-a6 are not particularly natural for a human to play, and he must be well prepared since a very innocent looking move could prove very costly.   11...O-O?  In comparison, this position looks very shaky to me after  12.Nh4  Na6  13.f4!  Black can get his bishop trapped with f4-f5 followed by h2-h3 if he is not careful. Even still, after the relatively best  13...Bh3  14.f5!  Bxg2  15.Qxg2  This position looks absurdly dangerous for Black to me. White plans g3-g4 followed by e4-e5, and... what is Black going to do about it? }
12. Nh4
{ White has nothing better than continuing along with the same plan, but here we see the point. After }
12... Bh3
{ Black will actually castle long- a very surprising idea that is not seen much in the Grunfeld at all, much less the fianchetto Grunfeld, but his king will be surprisingly safe on c8. I think Black is fine here, and while the position is equal objectively, I tend to prefer the side with a pawn up if there are no direct threats. }

But, at this moment he broke with the plan of taking the pawn on c4 and not fighting for dear life to hang onto it, but instead to force his opponent to waste time getting it back. Black is now facing a big pawn center and more space, and naturally should break it down with c6-c5, as is recommended in the course. Instead, Morozevich chose Re8, which is painfully slow. }

{ 12...c5  While this would be desirable, White has more than one way to a nice edge. But, the best move is the extremely surprising  13.Bh6 !!  Sacrificing a bishop to break the pin on the d4 pawn. Black is in bad shape after either cxd4 or Bxh6.  cxd4   13...Bxh6  14.dxc5  The rook on d1 turns out to be very useful. White will play cxd6 next, with a clean extra pawn, thanks to the pin to the queen on d8.  14.Nxd4  Bxh6  15.Nxd6 !  exd6  16.Nxf5 !  gxf5  17.Bxb7  Nd7  18.Rxd6 !

{ 9.Ng5 !  This move concerns me, and I am not convinced Black is equalizing. }
9... g6
{ Black does not fight too hard to hang onto the c4-pawn, and instead prioritizes completing his development, as long as White has to spend time and effort taking back on c4.   9...Qd4  Trying to hang onto the pawn at all costs would be a grave mistake. Black is in bad shape after  10.Nxc6 !  bxc6  11.Bxc6+  Bd7  12.Bxa8  Nxa8  13.Nxc4  When White will easily take a5, and have way too many pawns to contain. }
10. d3
{ 10.Nexc4  Svidler could have considered taking on c4, but as I mentioned in the theory section, I believe the resulting structures are fine for Black specifically due to the inclusion of a2-a4 and a7-a5, as the b4 square offers him some counterplay. After  Nxc4  11.Nxc4  Bg7  Black is fine and can look for O-O and Nd5-b4 next. }
10... cxd3 11. Nxd3 Bg7 12. Nc5
{ Again here, I like the attitude Rodshtein took. He does not mind losing back his extra pawn, but he only does so under circumstances where he can get his pieces active very quickly, get ahead in development, and use the weakened b4 square. }

1. b3 d5 2. Bb2 Bf5 3. e3 e6 4. Nc3

{ 6...Nc6  7.Bb5  Looked a bit less clear to me. The bishop on b5 is pretty annoying. }
7. Bd3 Bg4
{ White's misplaced knight on c3 makes all the difference. If it could magically move to d2 here, I'm sure Black would not be worse, but he probably would not be better either. As is, it is very hard to maintain both the pawn on d4 and the bishop on d3 because once Nc6 comes... how to defend d4 ? }
8. dxc5
{ Taking on c5 directly does mean the d-pawn will no longer be a weakness, but it also accelerates Black's development and loses central control.   8.h3  cxd4  9.exd4  Bh5  Also looks excellent for Black. After  10.O-O  Nc6  We see what I mean- White will have to do something unproductive to defend his d-pawn, since his knight on c3 is so badly placed. }
8... Bxc5 9. h3 Bh5 10. a3 Nc6 11. e4
{ Understandably, White pushed e4. As I've said in both this course and the Semi-Slav course, the only way to ever justify putting a knight on c3 for White or c6 for black, blocking the c-pawn on its starting square, is to get e4 or e5 in, respectively. Here, White lives up to the task, but is too far behind on development for it to equalize. }
11... O-O 12. g4
{ 12.O-O  This was probably a better choice, but Black is obviously better after a move like  Qd6  Followed by centralizing the rooks on e8 and d8. At any moment, Black can look for a move like Ne5 or Nd4 to harass the pinned f3-knight, pointing out that g2-g4 is ill advised due to a check on g3. }

1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Nc3
{ As mentioned in the theory section of the course, I think Black can and should take on d5. Bogner's choice is fine as well though, and he showed convincingly that once Black takes the d5-pawn back, his position is strategically excellent. }
5... g6 6. Bc4 Bg7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. a4
{ This move is a bit mysterious to me.   8.O-O  It looks far more natural to simply castle, and White is clearly better as Black will struggle to get the d5-pawn back  (as mentioned, I think Bogner should have taken back on d5 instead of g6)  . It's possible Kosteniuk was worried about the plan of Nbd7-b6, and wanted to have a4-a5 available, but it is nothing to be concerned about here.  Nbd7  9.d3 !  Making use of being able to bolster the bishop on c4. White is clearly better after  Nb6  10.Qb3 !  In general, positions like this one where Black remains a pawn down are often fine if White's pawn is on d4, as then he has options to take on c4 and play b6 to complete his development, snare the bishop pair, and put further pressure on d5. But when the pawn can go to d3, Black has to be much more direct in getting the pawn back as a position like this one looks like a catastrophe. I even wanted to avoid playing it a tempo up when White went Qa4+ and then Qb3 later, and here when White got the queen to b3 in one move, it looks truly awful. }
8... b6
{ Black prepares to put further pressure on d5. In general, as soon as the pawn is recaptured, his position will be excellent, and White should move hell and water to keep it alive. }
9. O-O Bb7 10. Ra3
{ It baffles me White did not play Qb3.   10.Qb3  This forces Black to work a bit harder to get the pawn back. Still, he will manage after  Na6  with Nc7 to follow. Black should be fine, but at least it takes him some time to take back on d5. }
10... Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Bxd5 12. Rd3
{ This was more or less an only move, as Black would be strategically winning if he could retreat the bishop or trade on c4, as White would have a horrid structure and a bunch of weak squares while Black's pieces would be fantastic. But, giving Black an isolated pawn as well does not fully solve all the problems because the rook on d3 is awkwardly placed. We are far beyond the kinds of position this repertoire will offer, but Bogner did play an excellent rest of the game. }

{ 8.Be2  As mentioned in the course, I believe this is White's most challenging move. }
8... Nbd7 9. Bg5 Nb6
{ In stark contrast to the Kosteniuk-Bogner game, this setup for White is not nearly as effective as it would be if the pawn were on d3, as Black is able to take the bishop on c4 without the d-pawn recapturing to straighten out the pawns and permanently secure the weakness on d5. This is a big deal. }
10. Nge2
{ 10.Nf3  Black could meet this move with the same Bf5, or he could also consider  Nxc4  11.Qxc4  b6  when after Bb7 next, White will have to take on f6, leaving himself with an extra pawn, but a doubled and isolated one and two not so impressive knights against two very good bishops. After  12.O-O  Bb7  13.Bxf6  Bxf6  14.Ne5  Qd6  Black is absolutely fine and can easily pick up the d5-pawn in short order with a rook coming to d8 next. }
10... Bf5 11. Ng3 Nxc4
{ This move would have been totally infeasible under any circumstance if White's pawn stood on d3 rather than d4. As is, it promises Black good counterplay.   11...Bc2 !?  This was also very strong, and also a move that d3 would have totally ruled out.  12.Qxc2  Nxc4  =+  Black will get the d5-pawn back next, with an excellent position. }
12. Qxc4 Rc8 13. Qe2
{ 13.Qb3  Hanging on to the pawn cannot be recommended, as after  Bd3 !  White's king is stuck in the center, and he will lose the d5-pawn anyway after Bc4 next. }
13... Nxd5 14. Nxf5 gxf5 15. O-O

12... b5 13. Bb3 Nb6
{ If Black can take the pawn back on d5 unmolested, he will obviously be better due to his superior structure and fantastic bishops. So, white is almost forced to keep going pawn grabbing, but as we see in the theory section of the course, this will not work out too well. }

{ Black hits the e3 pawn, while also making a more subtle but much larger threat of a4-a3, undermining the c3-knight and establishing a monstrously strong passed pawn on b2.   18...Nxd5  Also was not bad, but I think Wei's choice is much stronger. After  19.Nxd5  Bxd5  20.d4  Black obviously has compensation and is probably a little better, but at least White managed to keep his pawn structure intact. }
19. Nxb5
{ An understandable decision, but White is more or less busted now.   19.e4  White should have tried to preserve his center at all costs. I don't like his position after  a3  20.Rb1  axb2  21.d4  b4  22.Ne2  Rxa2  But at least his center offers him something to work with. }

1. c4 c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Qc2 Nbd7
{ As I mentioned in the course, I believe this move is inflexible and not best. Black should instead play Bd6, and only Nbd7 once White transposes back to the mainline Meran with d4. This may seem like a small detail, but in this game, Giri put on a clinic and it seemed like Black never had a chance.   5...Bd6 !  6.b3  O-O  White would have to either play d4 here, when then Nbd7 transposes to the the Semi-Slav course, or Bb2, when Black can comfortably respond with e5, as seen in the theory section.  7.Bb2  e5  8.cxd5  cxd5  9.Nb5  Nc6 !  The knight is much better on c6 than d7, and Black is easily fine. }
6. b3 Bd6 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Be2
{ It's much harder for Black to get the thematic central advance e6-e5 in now that the knight has been committed to d7, and White can look to launch a kingside attack in short order. }
8... b6
{ 8...e5  In hindsight, maybe Michiels should have gone for this anyway. But he is definitely a little worse after  9.cxd5  Nxd5   9...cxd5 ?  10.Nb5  A position like this one highlights why the knight on d7 is so bad. It stops the c8-bishop from developing and cannot block the c-file the same way it would from c6. After  Bb8  11.Rc1  Black cannot stop a disastrous invasion on c7.  10.Ne4  I like White's position, as it seems like an excellent Reverse Sicilian, but the game goes on. }
