{ @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  This course presents an entirely new Sicilian line that starts on move 5 after the sequence   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  h5!  It does not include any early deviations that are typically called 'Anti-Sicilians'. If you don't already have any antidotes to these lines, I suggest checking out other courses on Chessable, in particular my course 'Fight like Magnus', which deals with all these early alternatives by White. There is also the course 'Anti Anti-Sicilians' by FM Kamil Plichta, which was only recently released and is entirely focused on this complex of lines. }

{ Play Dirty, play Harry! Nowadays pushing the h-pawn is commonly seen in many openings, usually after the other side has committed to a fianchetto. Here Black pushes the pawn 'out of the blue', seemingly without any particular purpose. Before we discuss some concrete ideas of the move, I'd like to discuss how I got the idea for this course. It all started on May 16 2020 on Twitter, when I read this tweet by legendary Indian coach Ramesh: @@LinkStart@@https://twitter.com/Rameshchess/status/1261624328329674752@@LinkEnd@@. He pointed out the online game Arjun-Aravindh, in which the line was played.   Aravindh is a young Indian GM, rated above 2600, so he certainly had some ideas with the move, right? I had never seen this idea, but of course it reminded me of Magnus Carlsen's 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 h5!?!?? against Ding Liren, which was played shortly before. Magnus was playing this line against a very strong opponent, but in a situation where he could afford a loss. I analyzed Magnus's idea a little bit and played it in Blitz for fun, but it is too dubious to recommend in a course. In any case, I was aware of early ...h5 moves in the Sicilian, but the Aravindh line looked outlandish. Still, we know that today's chess is not based on general observations - you need to prove concretely why a move is supposed to be bad.  So I checked this position with both Stockfish and Leela, and surprisingly there was no clear way to kill the line. Quite the opposite thing happened, I quickly found some fun lines that made me curious. The next step was to play it in Blitz, and by now I have played more than 100 games with the line, with good results. I played most of the games before analyzing at all, so many of them are different from this suggested repertoire, just in case you want to look them up on Lichess. It was a process over about 2 months. The first games I just played without any analysis backing it up, while the recent ones are more according to the repertoire outlined here. My experience in Blitz was the main incentive to write this course. It is so much fun early on to get your opponents on unfamiliar ground and even do it with such a highly provocative move like 5... h5! I won so many entertaining games, sometimes just after a few moves. Would you like to see an example? Here we go   6.Be3  Ng4!  7.Bg5?  Qb6!  and Black is already much better. More than once it continued with  8.Nd5  Qxd4  and Black is winning the house. These games were played against reasonably strong opponents in the 2400-2600 blitz rating range on Lichess @@StartBracket@@my rating is about 2500@@EndBracket@@. People are very confused by the unconventional ideas and if you only have seconds to make your decision, things go wrong often.  Now, let's talk for a moment about the ideas behind ...h5. One point is the control over the square g4 and the ability to play ...Ng4. This is very relevant in the lines   6.Be3  Ng4!  and   6.Nxc6  bxc6  7.e5  Ng4!.  The second point might sound a bit odd at first, but Black keeps his central formation flexible with the move. Black is still able to play with ...e6, ...e5, ....d6 or ...g6, DEPENDING on White's next move. This becomes apparent in lines like   6.Bc4  e6!  ,  blunting the bishop on c4,  or   6.f3  e5!  , when the move f3 makes less sense in the coming pawn structure in Sveshnikov style.    The move ...h5 in itself sometimes has surprising additional value in many lines, for example after   6.Bg5  Qa5!  7.Bxf6  gxf6  Black can play ...Bh6 in many cases, as the bishop is now covered by the rook.  Are you curious by now? So how to study this course? I suggest to study the '30 Minute-Repertoire' chapter, which shows you some key variations and ideas so that you are ready to play this fun line in your games. Keep in mind that your opponent is out of book on move FIVE, and very likely feels somewhat provoked. You don't need to know all the lines shown in the detailed chapters, as learning the key lines in the '30 Min-Repertoire' already gives you a large head start: your opponent knows nothing about ...h5, you are much better prepared in any case! Then we have the three detailed chapters.   In those chapters, I show you more about the possible lines, and it is definitely useful to study them, but not essential to get started. Some lines run rather deep and are included to illustrate ideas and themes. Feel free to cut them at a move count of your choice. Learning lines by heart until move 20 in an opening that is all-new on move 5 is probably a bit too much, but the more detailed chapters can help you to also compare your games with my analysis. It is your choice how deep you want to go down the rabbit hole, so to say. The second point of going so deep in some lines was my simple urge to find out if you can refute 5...h5 outright.   My conclusion is: no, you can't. It is risky, in particular, if Black continues to put more fuel into the fire - which I advise you to do! This way the line is a lot of fun to play, especially in faster time control games. Now, it's time to unleash Harry and study some crazy Chess! }

{ This chapter provides you with all the key lines of the Dirty Harry Variation to get you started. You are in for a fast and wild ride! }
6. Bg5
{ This move is encountered quite frequently, and it makes a lot of sense at first glance. If Black had played 5...d6 @@StartBracket@@The Classical Sicilian@@EndBracket@@, 6.Bg5 would be the main reply, called the Rauzer Variation. So White quite often just plays a development plan that he intended to play in case of a conventional line. Here 6.Bg5 looks particularly attractive, as ...h5 had weakened the g5 square. As we will see, ...h5 has quite some good points as well in this line. }
6... Qa5
{ The most aggressive reply, but not the only one.  6...e6  is also not bad, but the queen move sets more problems. }
7. Bxf6
{ This is more or less forced, if White wants to fight for something. Compared to the Rauzer after 5...d6 6.Bg5 Qa5 White does not have the move 7.Bb5! with an annoying pin. }
7... gxf6
{ There are some similarities between this position and the Rauzer, which often features the doubled f-pawns. A key difference is that Black has not yet committed any central pawns, which allows for some interesting ideas. An idea to take note of: ...h5 actually allows ...Bh6 in many cases as the bishop is protected by the rook. The line 8.Qd2? Bh6 clearly illustrates this point. }
8. Nb3
{ This looks logical, gaining a tempo on the queen. On the other hand the knight is not all that great on b3, so Black is not unduly worried. }
8... Qe5
{ Why not? The queen is placed in the middle of the board, using the absence of the dark-squared bishop. We are always able to go to b8, if needed. }
9. g3
{ White aims for f4, but this plan clearly has some drawbacks, weakening the dark squares in White's camp. }
9... e6
{ I also checked  9...h4  , but  10.f4  Qb8  11.Qf3  renders the further h-pawn push toothless. }
10. f4 Qd6
{ This is actually quite an important move! We should not retreat immediately to b8, as then Qf3 and O-O-O are natural moves for White. We don't mind the queen trade and have a concrete reply against Qf3 in mind. }
11. Qf3 Nd4
{ It is a bit odd to play this move, but the concrete lines work perfectly well. }
12. Qf2 Nxb3 13. axb3 a6 14. Bd3 Qc5
{ And Black is fine, again. The position is complicated and 'unusual, as usual' in this line :-@@EndBracket@@ }

7... d6 8. Nd5
{ In the traditional Sveshnikov the move 7. Nd5 has gained a lot of ground after the 2018 World Championship Match between Fabiano Caruana and Magnus Carlsen. A player, who employs this line against the Sveshnikov, is quite likely to play in the same way here. }
8... Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne7
{ Compared to the similar line 6.Be2 e5 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Nd5 Nxd5 9.exd5 Ne7 the pawn on h5 is not hanging. I think Black's chances are reasonable here, with the standard setup of going ...Nf5, ...g6, ...Bg7 and finally ...0-0. We don't need to analyse all that many moves now, as we don't need to justify the pawn loss on h5. In comparison, the 6.Be2 version of this line is far more testing. }
10. c4 Nf5 { You should move the knight first and avoid  10...a6?  11.Qa4! }
11. Bd3 g6 12. O-O a6 13. Nc3 Bg7
{ I'll stop here, as White certainly has some options. Black will play ...0-0 and often ...Nd4 next. Ideas like a later ...f5 or ...Qh4 also come to mind. Stockfish likes White quite a bit here, while Leela only gives White a small edge. I generally like Black's chances, as the kingside play is always going to be dangerous, in particular in a quick time control game. }

7... d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ The important innovation of Evgeny Sveshnikov was to play 8...b5! in the main line of the opening that now bears his name. Here ...b5 is less convincing, as ...h5 makes it more or less impossible for Black to castle kingside. Going 9...Be6 seems perfectly playable, though. To understand the coming lines, it is a good idea to keep in mind that there is the line 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 Be6, which is called the Bird or sometimes Bird-Larsen Variation. Only in the 1970s 8...b5 became popular, associated with the players from Cheliabinsk and in particular Evgeny Sveshnikov. The Bird Variation with ...Be6 has a dodgy reputation nowadays, but amazingly the two problematic lines against it are heavily affected by the inclusion of the moves h3 and ...h5! This was a fascinating discovery for me, because I played this line quite frequently in the 1990s, before engines put the finals nails in the coffin of it. Now all of a sudden 'my line' works again, as we will see! }
10. Nc4 Rc8
{ Placing the rook on the c-file is a natural move, also putting some indirect pressure on the c4-knight. The two critical moves now are 11.Nd5 and 11.Bxf6. You might also meet the slow, but not dangerous move 11.Ne3, which we briefly check in the dedicated chapter. }
11. Bxf6 gxf6
{ Instead the move 11...Qxf6 is also playable, but taking with the pawn is fine and more interesting to play for Black. In the original Bird Variation White usually plays a combination of Bd3 and Ne3, controlling the squares d5 and f5. The key difference to the Bird is twofold: 1. White does not have the usually very annoying move Qh5! and 2. White's h3 move has weakened the kingside a bit, so a counterplay on the g-file is more dangerous. }
12. Bd3 Ne7 { We are fighting for control over f5 and d5. } 13. Ne3 Bh6
{ This is how we solve the issue of the passive bishop on f8. Ideally we want to trade it for a knight, which also helps us to ultimately play the f-pawn or d-pawn. }
14. O-O Bxe3 15. fxe3 Rh6
{ Again, this move shows a difference between the Bird and this improved version. The position on the board is very interesting and unclear. Black will play ...Qb6 next, looking at e3 and b2. Note that the move h3 has weakened White's king position quite a bit, which helps us to generate play. Black's king is safe in the centre, being surrounded by many pieces. }

The Sveshnikov's main 'defect' is the weakened square on d5, and White very frequently fights for control over this square with the idea Bg5xNf6, trading the bishop for the knight. This does not go well with f3, weakening the dark squares substantially. All this does not mean that Black is better, but the analysis suggests that we have no problems. An additional note: I think that 6...e5 is objectively the best move, as the alternatives don't convince that much. 6...g6 makes no sense, as Be3 and f3 is the absolute main line vs. the Dragon and ...h5 is uncalled for against it so early on. 6...e6 is better in comparison, but I suspect White is slightly better with Be3,Qd2 etc. }

{ This chapter provides you with all the key lines of the Dirty Harry Variation to get you started. You are in for a fast and wild ride! }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced it in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6.h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6... e5. There are some alternatives to this move and I discuss this a bit more in the detailed chapter. For example, as mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Nd5
{ This idea is popular in the Sveshnikov, and having Be2 and ...h5 in addition should favor White. It turns out that things are not so clear, which is quite remarkable. One obvious issue is that the pawn on h5 is attacked by the bishop and might get taken in short order. }
8... Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne7
{ We need to transfer the knight to the kingside to drum up play for the doomed h5-pawn. Now White may take it immediately, or try to be clever about it with moves like 10.c3 or 10.c4, that I discuss in the detailed chapter. }
10. Bxh5 a6 11. Nc3 Nf5 12. Be2

d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ The important innovation of Evgeny Sveshnikov was to play 8...b5! in the main line of the opening that now bears his name. Here ...b5 is less convincing, as ...h5 makes it more or less impossible for Black to castle kingside. Going 9... Be6 seems perfectly playable, though. To understand the coming lines, it is a good idea to keep in mind that there is the line 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 Be6, which is called the Bird or sometimes Bird-Larsen Variation. Only in the 1970s 8...b5 became popular, associated with the players from Cheliabinsk and in particular Exgeny Sveshnikov. Here we play the Bird Variation with a twist: the moves Be2 and h5 are inserted. Common sense suggests that White should benefit from this insertion, but the play is very complicated and most decisions are not obvious at all.The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ...f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6.f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the regular Sveshnikov/Bird, without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continuing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@.

After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice, and I discuss 12.Bd3 @@StartBracket@@best according to the engine@@EndBracket@@ and 12.0-0 in the detailed chapter. }
12. Ne3
{ In this overview we'll focus on this natural move for White, connecting the knight to both f5 and d5. }
12... Bh6

The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3.  These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing. After 6.Be2 Black has the option to go for 6...g6, which seems playable, but not too exciting. Here 6...g6 is also possible, but after 7.

{ The usual move in the regular Sveshnikov. The alternatives are harmless, at best. }
7... d6 8. Nd5
{ In the traditional Sveshnikov the move 7.Nd5 has gained a lot of ground after the 2018 World Championship Match between Fabiano Caruana and Magnus Carlsen. A player, who employs this line against the Sveshnikov, is quite likely to play in the same way here. }

{ Compared to the similar line 6. Be2 e5 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Nd5 Nxd5 9.exd5 Ne7 the pawn on h5 is not hanging. I think Black's chances are reasonable here, with the standard setup of going ...Nf5, ...g6, ...Bg7 and finally ...0-0. We don't need to analyse all that many moves now, as we don't need to justify the pawn loss on h5. In comparison, the 6.Be2 version of this line is far more testing. }

11. Bd3 g6 12. O-O a6 13. Nc3 Bg7
{ I'll stop here, as White certainly has some options. Black will play ...0-0 and often ...Nd4 next. Ideas like a later ...f5 or ...Qh4 also come to mind. Stockfish likes White quite a bit here, while Leela only gives White a small edge. I generally like Black's chances, as the kingside play is always going to be dangerous, in particular in a quick time control game. }

{ Just as after 6.Be2 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though.

The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3.  These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing. After 6.Be2 Black has the option to go for 6...g6, which seems playable, but not too exciting. Here 6...g6 is also possible, but after 7.

White does not have the usually very annoying move Qh5! and 2.White's h3 move has weakened the kingside a bit, so a counterplay on the g-file is more dangerous. }

The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3.  These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing. After 6.Be2 Black has the option to go for 6...g6, which seems playable, but not too exciting. Here 6...g6 is also possible, but after 7.

{ Just as after 6.Be2 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analyzed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only good option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6... e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3.  These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing. After 6.Be2 Black has the option to go for 6...g6, which seems playable, but not too exciting. Here 6...g6 is also possible, but after 7. Bc4 White seems better off. }

The two critical moves are 11.Nd5 and 11.Bxf6. You might also meet the slow, but not dangerous move 11.Ne3. }

6. h3 e5
{ Just as after 6.Be2 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analyzed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only good option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6... e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3.  These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing. After 6.Be2 Black has the option to go for 6...g6, which seems playable, but not too exciting. Here 6...g6 is also possible, but after 7. Bc4 White seems better off. }
7. Ndb5
{ The usual move in the regular Sveshnikov. The alternatives are harmless, at best. }
7... d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ The important innovation of Evgeny Sveshnikov was to play 8...b5! in the main line of the opening that now bears his name. Here ...b5 is less convincing, as ...h5 makes it more or less impossible for Black to castle kingside. Going 9...Be6 seems perfectly playable, though. }
10. Nc4 Rc8
{ As mentioned at the beginning of this Chapter the original Bird Variation with ...Be6 has a dodgy reputation nowadays, but amazingly the two problematic lines against it are heavily affected by the inclusion of the moves h3 and ... h5! This was a fascinating discovery for me, because I played the Bird Variation quite frequently in the 1990s, before engines put the finals nails in the coffin of it. Now all of a sudden 'my line' works again! The two critical moves are 11.Nd5 and 11.Bxf6. You might also meet the slow, but not dangerous move 11.Ne3. }
11. Nd5
{ This is the most critical line against the mentioned Bird Variation, where the pawns are still on h2 and h7. This small difference is very important, as we will see. }
11... Bxd5 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Qxd5
{ Looking at this position it becomes clear why this line is critical. The light squares in Black's camp are terribly weak and if White manages to organize with moves like Ne3-f5, Bc4-b3 etc., Black will be busted. We need something direct, and this direct line does not quite work without the h-pawn, but it does with the h-pawns played! }
13... Nd4
{ Attacking c2, but also cutting off the queen on the d-file. Trapping the queen is an important resource now. }
14. Bd3 { This is the most critical way to play. } 14... Qe7
{ We cover b7 and threaten ...Rc5 now! } 15. Qa5
{ This is the problem move in the traditional Larsen line. White intends to just drop back to d2 with the queen. }
15... Rc5 16. Qd2
{ And here's the huge difference... we have ...Bh6 now, which is impossible in the Bird! }
16... Bh6 17. Qd1 d5
{ And Black is even taking over the initiative and is better. Here's a fun line to illustrate. }
18. exd5 e4 19. O-O Nf3+ 20. gxf3 Rg8+ 21. Kh1 Qd7

An additional note: I think that 6...e5 should be played here, as the alternatives don't convince that much. 6...g6 makes no sense, as Be3 and f3 is the absolute main line vs. the Dragon and ...h5 is uncalled for against it so early on. 6...e6 is better in comparison, but I suspect White is slightly better with Be3,Qd2 etc. }

6. f3
{ Setups with f3 are very popular against various Sicilian lines, like the Dragon or the Najdorf. Most of the time White plays Be3 first, and only later goes f3. In our line the move 6.Be3 runs into 6... Ng4, so some players want to prepare a setup with Be3, Qd2 and O-O-O with 6.f3. We have a good reply, though. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6.Be2 and 6.h3 we react in Sveshnikov style. The main reasoning is that f3 is a move that makes very little sense for White in a Sveshnikov. Why? The Sveshnikov's main 'defect' is the weakened square on d5, and White very frequently fights for control over this square with the idea Bg5xNf6, trading the bishop for the knight. This does not go well with f3, weakening the dark squares substantially. All this does not mean that Black is better, but the analysis suggests that we have no problems. An additional note: I think that 6...e5 should be played here, as the alternatives don't convince that much. 6...g6 makes no sense, as Be3 and f3 is the absolute main line vs. the Dragon and ...h5 is uncalled for against it so early on. 6...e6 is better in comparison, but I suspect White is slightly better with Be3,Qd2 etc. }
7. Ndb5 d6
{ We now need to check the two main ideas, 8. Nd5 and 8.Bg5. In both lines the move f3 is not helping White. }
8. Bg5
{ This move loses a lot of bite after f3 has been played. Taking on f6 is the idea of Bg5, but this is not as attractive any more. The coming lines show that f3 has weakened the dark squares substantially. }
8... a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ And yet another version of the Bird is on the board. The inclusion of f3 and h4 favour Black, as the weakened dark squares are a factor. }
10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. exd5 Qa5+ 12. c3 Qxd5

So in the late 1960s the line 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 was called Lasker-Pelikan-Pilnik @@StartBracket@@to add further confusion, Lasker played 5...e5 once vs. Schlechter, so his name was used as well!@@EndBracket@@, while 8...Be6 was attributed to Bird.

Are you confused?   Now we reach the 1970s, when instead of 8...Be6  @@StartBracket@@Bird or Bird-Larsen@@EndBracket@@ the move 8...b5! was analyzed and popularized mainly by Evgeny Sveshnikov. Nowadays the term 'Sveshnikov Variation' is often used for the whole 5...e5 complex, as this mainline with 8...b5 is very commonly reached and it brought the whole line back on the map, as 8...Be6 has a slightly dodgy reputation.   OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. f3
{ Setups with f3 are very popular against various Sicilian lines, like the Dragon or the Najdorf. Most of the time White plays Be3 first, and only later goes f3. In our line the move 6.Be3 runs into 6... Ng4, so some players want to prepare a setup with Be3, Qd2 and O-O-O with 6.f3. We have a good reply, though. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6.Be2 and 6.h3 we react in Sveshnikov style. The main reasoning is that f3 is a move that makes very little sense for White in a Sveshnikov. Why? The Sveshnikov's main 'defect' is the weakened square on d5, and White very frequently fights for control over this square with the idea Bg5xNf6, trading the bishop for the knight. This does not go well with f3, weakening the dark squares substantially. All this does not mean that Black is better, but the analysis suggests that we have no problems. An additional note: I think that 6...e5 should be played here, as the alternatives don't convince that much. 6...g6 makes no sense, as Be3 and f3 is the absolute main line vs. the Dragon and ...h5 is uncalled for against it so early on. 6...e6 is better in comparison, but I suspect White is slightly better with Be3,Qd2 etc. }
7. Ndb5 d6
{ We now need to check the two main ideas, 8.Nd5 and 8.Bg5. In both lines the move f3 is not helping White. }
8. Be3
{ Certainly logical enough in combination with f3, but it does not relate at all to the pawn structure. Bg5 fights for d5, at least. }
8... a6 9. Na3 b5
{ Here the pure 'Sveshnikov' approach with ...b5 is very pointed for concrete reasons. There is nothing wrong with some other moves, though. I have played 9...Rb8, for instance, before analysing the line later. I went ...Rb8, because this is how Black usually plays in the pure Sveshnikov without f3 and h5 inserted. Adding f3 and h5 makes a difference, though! }
10. Nd5 { We were threatening ...b4, so this makes a lot of sense. } 10... Nxd5
11. exd5
{ This is the problem move in the Sveshnikov proper, but it fails here! } 11...
Qh4+
{ In the Sveshnikov you need to play ...Ne7, but are worse after c4!, attacking the queenside. Here the check is terribly annoying for White. }
12. g3 Qb4+ 13. Kf2 Ne7
{ Black is already better, as White's forces are in disarray. } *

6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }

Nxe4

8. Nxe4 d5 { Now both knights are attacked. } 9. Nxg7+ Bxg7

OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Nb3 { Similarly to the Sveshnikov with 6.Nb3, this is rather harmless. }
7... Bb4 8. Bg5
{ This looks quite logical, intending to possibly capture on f6 and win the pawn on h5. Interestingly, this is not a huge concern for us. }
8... Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qc7 10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Bxh5 d6
{ This position is completely fine for Black. The king will be safe on e7 or on the queenside after 0-0-0, while White's king won't have a safe place. We have both ...d5 and ...f5 coming and the knight on b3 is misplaced. }

Are you confused?   Now we reach the 1970s, when instead of 8...Be6  @@StartBracket@@Bird or Bird-Larsen@@EndBracket@@ the move 8...b5! was analyzed and popularized mainly by Evgeny Sveshnikov. Nowadays the term 'Sveshnikov Variation' is often used for the whole 5...e5 complex, as this mainline with 8...b5 is very commonly reached and it brought the whole line back on the map, as 8...Be6 has a slightly dodgy reputation.   OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Nd5
{ This idea is popular in the Sveshnikov, and having Be2 and ...h5 in addition should favor White. It turns out that things are not so clear, which is quite remarkable. One clear issue is that the pawn on h5 is attacked by the bishop and might get taken in short order. }
8... Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne7
{ We need to transfer the knight to the kingside to drum up play for the doomed h5-pawn. Now White may take it immediately, or try to be clever about it. }
10. c3
{ Compared to 10.c4, this move carries the same threat @@StartBracket@@Qa4@@EndBracket@@, but aims for a different queenside setup. On c3 the pawn covers the square d4, which is a huge difference to 10.c4. }
10... Nf5 11. Bxh5 { Otherwise ...g6, ...Bg7 and ...0-0 is fine for Black. }
11... Nh4
{ Going for a direct attack on the kingside! Remarkably, Leela also thinks Black has compensation after slower approaches, like simple development with ...Be7 etc. I don't quite buy that assessment, but in any case I think that 11...Nh4 is a lot of fun to play and should be tried. White now has to make some concession, as castling fails. }
12. g3 { The most principled move for sure, but a tough one to make. } 12...
Ng2+ 13. Kf1 Bh3 14. Kg1
{ Forced after 12.g3, and a very unique position. It's quite helpful to know something about it, which will not be the case for White, most likely! }
14... Qd7 { A tempo gaining move on the knight. } 15. Be2
{ This looks best, covering the knight and going for Bf1 to untangle the kingside. Now Black has many interesting ideas. Leela suggests to sacrifice the knight for a strong attack, which indeed seems promising. }
15... Be7 16. Bf1
{ Now the pedestrian 16...Nf4 is possible, but there is a much more interesting possibility. }
16... a6 17. Na3 Nh4 18. gxh4 Rxh4
{ Black has a very dangerous attack. I'd like to stop here, but of course you can dig deeper - it's fun to analyze for sure. }

What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Nd5
{ This idea is popular in the Sveshnikov, and having Be2 and ...h5 in addition should favor White. It turns out that things are not so clear, which is quite remarkable. One clear issue is that the pawn on h5 is attacked by the bishop and might get taken in short order. }
8... Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne7
{ We need to transfer the knight to the kingside to drum up play for the doomed h5-pawn. Now White may take it immediately, or try to be clever about it. }
10. Bxh5 a6 11. Nc3 Nf5 12. Be2
{ This looks reasonable. We will play ...Qh4 anyway to push it back, so White may as well retreat it now. }
12... Qh4
{ Our plan is to play ...Be7 and ...Nd4. White's position is not easy to play. }
13. Bd3
{ The engines suggest this move, but I am not sure if a human under time pressure would play it. In any case, Black seems to be OK here. }
13... Be7 14. Bd2 Nd4
{ And ...Bg4 is the threat now. Again, I think Black has enough play here. } *

After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Bxf6
{ It's more obvious for White to first play 10.Nc4, and only after Black's reply decide if you want to take on f6 or not. Still, this move is certainly logical and needs to be checked. In most cases it will transpose to 10.Nc4 Rc8 11.Bxf6, however. }
10... gxf6
{ This is more interesting than  10...Qxf6  , which seems playable as well.   Now  11.Nc4  Rc8  seems very logical and this would transpose to 10.Nc4 Rc8 11.Bxf6 gxf6, the main path of this line. There are some other moves to check briefly. }
11. Bxh5 { This greedy move backfires severely. } 11... Nd4
{ Now the a3-knight is terribly offside and we have both ...f5 and ...d5 as possible ideas. }
12. Ne2
{ This has been played against me in Blitz. There are multiple refutations, here is one of them. }
12... Rxh5
{ I played 12...Qb6, which also wins - but just taking the bishop is simpler. }
13. Nxd4 Qa5+ 14. Kf1 exd4 { And Black has won a piece! } *

As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all.

The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course.

After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see.

Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. exd5 Qa5+
{ This wins a pawn, but it is tough to convert. You may also play 11...Ne7 for a complicated middlegame, if you prefer that. With a pawn already on d5, Black is certainly fine here. }
12. c3 Qxd5 13. Bxf6 Qxd1+ 14. Rxd1 gxf6 15. Nc4 O-O-O

The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. f3 Be6
{ In this position Stockfish still favours White quite a bit, while Leela thinks Black is completely fine. My own experience in the Sveshnikov and this line tells me that Black should indeed be OK here. The dark square weaknesses in White's camp are problematic and give us fair chances. I'll show some more sample moves, to illustrate one possible scenario of many. }
14. Nd5 Bh6 15. c3 Nf5
{ An interesting trick that you should be aware of in this or similar positions, based on the unsupported position of White's knight on d5. }
16. Bc2 { White intends to recapture with the queen on d5. } 16... Nh4

On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. f3 Be6
{ In this position Stockfish still favours White quite a bit, while Leela thinks Black is completely fine. My own experience in the Sveshnikov and this line tells me that Black should indeed be OK here. The dark square weaknesses in White's camp are problematic and give us fair chances. I'll show some more sample moves, to illustrate one possible scenario of many. }
14. Nd5 Bh6 15. O-O h4 16. Ncb6 Bxd5 17. Nxd5 Ne6
{ This type of position would be highly suspect for Black without the move f3. White would have additional possibilities like Qf3/Qg4, for example. Here White always has to worry a bit about Black invading on the dark squares. }

OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2

One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all.

Are you confused?   Now we reach the 1970s, when instead of 8...Be6  @@StartBracket@@Bird or Bird-Larsen@@EndBracket@@ the move 8...b5! was analyzed and popularized mainly by Evgeny Sveshnikov. Nowadays the term 'Sveshnikov Variation' is often used for the whole 5...e5 complex, as this mainline with 8...b5 is very commonly reached and it brought the whole line back on the map, as 8...Be6 has a slightly dodgy reputation.   OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. Qb1
{ Not exacly the most obvious move, but pointed out by the computer as strongest. }
13... h4 { We continue to ask questions: do you like to allow ...h3? } 14. Ne3
{ A logical alternative to 14.h3. } 14... Be6
{ Instead  14...h3  15.Nxg4  hxg2  16.Rg1  Nf3+  17.Ke2  is not working, as the rook on  g1  is now protected by the queen. }
15. Qd1 { It looks natural to get the queen back into the centre. } 15... d5
{ This move looks utterly crazy, but it was just too tempting, once I realised that it was a possibility at all. It seems just about to be playable, but White needs to find some miracle moves to try to refute it. That being said,  15...h3  16.g3  Bh6  is a more 'conservative' way to play, and a possible alternative.  Now, what is going on with 15...d5!!?!. This move has the idea to open up the bishop on f8 and at the same time to lessen White's control over f5, which allows us to play ...f5 soon. Of course the problem is that the pawn is just hanging! White can take it in three ways, let's check! }
16. Ncxd5 f5
{ This was the idea, of course. Now White can't take f5, as the knight on d5 is hanging in this case. Black's idea is now to take on e4 and play ...f5 a second time. }
17. O-O fxe4 18. Bxe4 f5 19. Bf3 Bc5
{ A crazy position, but I wouldn't mind to be Black here. We have very active pieces and likely are close to winning on the clock at this point :-@@EndBracket@@ }

I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. Qb1
{ Not exacly the most obvious move, but pointed out by the computer as strongest. }
13... h4 { We continue to ask questions: do you like to allow ...h3? } 14. Ne3
{ A logical alternative to 14.h3. } 14... Be6
{ Instead  14...h3  15.Nxg4  hxg2  16.Rg1  Nf3+  17.Ke2  is not working, as the rook on  g1  is now protected by the queen. }
15. Qd1 { It looks natural to get the queen back into the centre. } 15... d5
{ This move looks utterly crazy, but it was just too tempting, once I realised that it was a possibility at all. It seems just about to be playable, but White needs to find some miracle moves to try to refute it. That being said,  15...h3  16.g3  Bh6  is a more 'conservative' way to play, and a possible alternative.  Now, what is going on with 15...d5!!?!. This move has the idea to open up the bishop on f8 and at the same time to lessen White's control over f5, which allows us to play ...f5 soon. Of course the problem is that the pawn is just hanging! White can take it in three ways, let's check! }
16. Nexd5 { This is the least challenging move of the three captures. } 16...
f5
{ Now Black is both having ...fxe4 and ...f4 as possible ideas. Stockfish already thinks White only has one playable move! }
17. Ne3 f4 18. Ned5 Bc5
{ This gives Black an excellent position. We just play ...Rc8 and ...Qg5 next, with an attack and already a clear advantage. }

{ This chapter is called 'Three Dirty Birds', but why? One part of the answer dates back to London Tournament of the year 1883, when Henry Bird played Alexander Sellman with the Black pieces. The game went 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6. Ndb5 d6 7.Bf4 e5 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 Be6 @@StartBracket@@This position more commonly arises from 1. e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 Be6@@EndBracket@@.   At the time, this opening looked very avant-garde, and the whole idea was more or less forgotten for decades. Only a lot later, this line was picked up again, driven by the players Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik. I suspect that the name 'Bird Variation' was also coined in this era, long after Henry Bird had passed away in 1908. So in the late 1960s the line 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 was called Lasker-Pelikan-Pilnik @@StartBracket@@to add further confusion, Lasker played 5...e5 once vs. Schlechter, so his name was used as well!@@EndBracket@@, while 8...Be6 was attributed to Bird. There is also an important game by Bent Larsen vs. Karl Robatsch from 1963, connected to 9.Nc4 @@StartBracket@@or 10.Nc4, if you use the original move sequence@@EndBracket@@ Rc8, which led to the term 'Bird-Larsen' Variation! Are you confused?   Now we reach the 1970s, when instead of 8...Be6  @@StartBracket@@Bird or Bird-Larsen@@EndBracket@@ the move 8...b5! was analyzed and popularized mainly by Evgeny Sveshnikov. Nowadays the term 'Sveshnikov Variation' is often used for the whole 5...e5 complex, as this mainline with 8...b5 is very commonly reached and it brought the whole line back on the map, as 8...Be6 has a slightly dodgy reputation.   OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success.

17. f4 { Not exactly obvious, but the best move according to the engines. }

OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. Qb1
{ Not exacly the most obvious move, but pointed out by the computer as strongest. }
13... h4 { We continue to ask questions: do you like to allow ...h3? } 14. Ne3
{ A logical alternative to 14.h3. } 14... Be6
{ Instead  14...h3  15.Nxg4  hxg2  16.Rg1  Nf3+  17.Ke2  is not working, as the rook on  g1  is now protected by the queen. }
15. Qd1 { It looks natural to get the queen back into the centre. } 15... d5
{ This move looks utterly crazy, but it was just too tempting, once I realised that it was a possibility at all. It seems just about to be playable, but White needs to find some miracle moves to try to refute it. That being said,  15...h3  16.g3  Bh6  is a more 'conservative' way to play, and a possible alternative.  Now, what is going on with 15...d5!!?!. This move has the idea to open up the bishop on f8 and at the same time to lessen White's control over f5, which allows us to play ...f5 soon. Of course the problem is that the pawn is just hanging! White can take it in three ways, let's check! }
16. exd5 Bd7
{ So, we dropped the d-pawn, but now we are ready to play ...f5 and potentially ...Bc5 or ...Bd6 in some lines. White's best move now is leading to an advantage, but if someone plays it after some seconds, he has either learnt this course or cheated. }
17. O-O { The human move, but here Black is having enough compensation. } 17...
f5 18. Nc4 Bg7 19. Re1 Qc7
{ It still looks very dangerous for Black, with the king on the e-file! But we are ready to play either ...Kf8 or 0-0-0 now. }
20. Ne2 Nxe2+ 21. Qxe2 e4 22. Qe3 b5
{ It's a total mess, but objectively OK for Black. Again, you need to stop somewhere... but you'll have some fun to analyze more. Not because you suspect to get it on the board, but because it's a good dynamic exercise. }

The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. Qb1
{ Not exacly the most obvious move, but pointed out by the computer as strongest. }
13... h4 { We continue to ask questions: do you like to allow ...h3? } 14. Ne3
{ A logical alternative to 14.h3. } 14... Be6
{ Instead  14...h3  15.Nxg4  hxg2  16.Rg1  Nf3+  17.Ke2  is not working, as the rook on  g1  is now protected by the queen. }
15. Qd1 { It looks natural to get the queen back into the centre. } 15... d5
{ This move looks utterly crazy, but it was just too tempting, once I realised that it was a possibility at all. It seems just about to be playable, but White needs to find some miracle moves to try to refute it. That being said,  15...h3  16.g3  Bh6  is a more 'conservative' way to play, and a possible alternative.  Now, what is going on with 15...d5!!?!. This move has the idea to open up the bishop on f8 and at the same time to lessen White's control over f5, which allows us to play ...f5 soon. Of course the problem is that the pawn is just hanging! White can take it in three ways, let's check! }
16. exd5 Bd7
{ So, we dropped the d-pawn, but now we are ready to play ...f5 and potentially ...Bc5 or ...Bd6 in some lines. White's best move now is leading to an advantage, but if someone plays it after some seconds, he has either learnt this course or cheated. }
17. Nb1
{ This is the best move, according to the engines. White is preparing c3 and spends a lot of time to do it. }
17... Qe7
{ It looks odd, but the idea is to push ...e4. The following sequence of moves is given as much better for White by Stockfish, but I still think this is sufficiently messy for a faster time control game. We also need to take into account, that White needs to play some miracle moves to get here in the first place. }
18. c3 Nb5 19. Nd2 e4 20. Nxe4 f5 21. d6 Qe5 22. Ng5 Qf6 23. Nf3 O-O-O
{ We'll get the pawn on d6 and are still in the game. There is still more to discover in the moves prior, but we are already very deep down the rabbit hole. }

{ This chapter is called 'Three Dirty Birds', but why? One part of the answer dates back to London Tournament of the year 1883, when Henry Bird played Alexander Sellman with the Black pieces. The game went 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6. Ndb5 d6 7.Bf4 e5 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 Be6 @@StartBracket@@This position more commonly arises from 1. e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 Be6@@EndBracket@@.   At the time, this opening looked very avant-garde, and the whole idea was more or less forgotten for decades. Only a lot later, this line was picked up again, driven by the players Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik. I suspect that the name 'Bird Variation' was also coined in this era, long after Henry Bird had passed away in 1908. So in the late 1960s the line 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 was called Lasker-Pelikan-Pilnik @@StartBracket@@to add further confusion, Lasker played 5...e5 once vs. Schlechter, so his name was used as well!@@EndBracket@@, while 8...Be6 was attributed to Bird. There is also an important game by Bent Larsen vs. Karl Robatsch from 1963, connected to 9.Nc4 @@StartBracket@@or 10.Nc4, if you use the original move sequence@@EndBracket@@ Rc8, which led to the term 'Bird-Larsen' Variation! Are you confused?   Now we reach the 1970s, when instead of 8...Be6  @@StartBracket@@Bird or Bird-Larsen@@EndBracket@@ the move 8...b5! was analyzed and popularized mainly by Evgeny Sveshnikov. Nowadays the term 'Sveshnikov Variation' is often used for the whole 5...e5 complex, as this mainline with 8...b5 is very commonly reached and it brought the whole line back on the map, as 8...Be6 has a slightly dodgy reputation.   OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...

16... Rxg2 17. c3 Nc6 18. Qf3 Rg6

OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Bd3
{ This is best according to the engines, but not a particular obvious statement to a human player. The bishop is moving away from a potential capture and increases control over f5. White probably has Ne3 in mind, followed by Ncd5 and ultimately c3 to send the d4-knight back. I suggest to immediately disturb White's ideas with the next move. }
12... Bg4
{ A very direct move, and the best reply is not an easy decision to make. The engines favour 13.Qb1!, but this is not very obvious in my mind. Playing 13.f3 is more human, but this has strategic drawbacks, as we will see. Finally 13.Qd2 does not convince either. }
13. Qb1
{ Not exactly the most obvious move, but pointed out by the computer as strongest. }
13... h4 { We continue to ask questions: do you like to allow ...h3? } 14. h3
Be6 15. Qd1
{ The queen should certainly return to the centre shortly. b1 is not a very royal place for this powerful piece. }
15... Rg8 16. Ne3 Bh6 17. Qh5 Bxe3 18. fxe3 Nb5
{ This is a remarkable move! Black is fine here, as the engines confirm. The main idea is to get rid of the knight on c3, then place the king on e7 and play on g-file. }
19. Nxb5 axb5 20. O-O Ke7 21. Qxh4 Rg6
{ And we'll play ...Qg8,...Qg7 and ...Rh8 and have all the fun. White can defend, but it is not trivial. }

{ This chapter is called 'Three Dirty Birds', but why? One part of the answer dates back to London Tournament of the year 1883, when Henry Bird played Alexander Sellman with the Black pieces. The game went 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6.

At the time, this opening looked very avant-garde, and the whole idea was more or less forgotten for decades. Only a lot later, this line was picked up again, driven by the players Jorge Pelikan and Herman Pilnik. I suspect that the name 'Bird Variation' was also coined in this era, long after Henry Bird had passed away in 1908. So in the late 1960s the line 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 was called Lasker-Pelikan-Pilnik @@StartBracket@@to add further confusion, Lasker played 5...e5 once vs. Schlechter, so his name was used as well!@@EndBracket@@, while 8...Be6 was attributed to Bird. There is also an important game by Bent Larsen vs. Karl Robatsch from 1963, connected to 9.Nc4 @@StartBracket@@or 10.Nc4, if you use the original move sequence@@EndBracket@@ Rc8, which led to the term 'Bird-Larsen' Variation! Are you confused?   Now we reach the 1970s, when instead of 8...Be6  @@StartBracket@@Bird or Bird-Larsen@@EndBracket@@ the move 8...b5! was analyzed and popularized mainly by Evgeny Sveshnikov. Nowadays the term 'Sveshnikov Variation' is often used for the whole 5...e5 complex, as this mainline with 8...b5 is very commonly reached and it brought the whole line back on the map, as 8...Be6 has a slightly dodgy reputation.   OK, after boring you with a bit of chess opening history, let's get back to our Dirty Harry line! What I am getting at is that after the moves 6.Be2, 6.h3, and 6.f3 I suggest playing 6...e5, so we are going for the Lasker/Pelikan/Pilnik/Sveshnikov with additional moves inserted. As this is such a mouthful, I will refer to this general approach as a 'Sveshnikov' approach, as this is the most common name nowadays for the 5...e5 line, even though technically this is not 100% correct.   After 6...e5 the main line runs, in all three cases, 7.Ndb5 d6 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 and now 9...Be6!, which leads us back to 1883, the 'Bird Variation'. As we have three versions of the Bird, with Be2, with h3 and with f3, this Chapter is therefore called 'Three Dirty Birds'! Now, let's explore the lines in more detail. }
6. Be2
{ White develops the kingside and prepares to castle, not trying to immediately refute Black's outrageous 5th move. I believe this is one of White's best tries against the 'Dirty Harry', and I faced in about 20 percent of my games. }
6... e5
{ Just as after 6. h3 and 6.f3 I suggest to play in Sveshnikov style with 6...e5. This is not the only move that Black can play, though. I have also analysed and played   6...e6  , which seems fully viable as well. One important aspect of 6...e6 is the frequent reply  7.Ndb5  , when Black's only option is to go  7...d6  8.Bf4  e5  9.Bg5  , which transposes to 6...e5 after all. So 6...e6 will often lead to a line that 6...e5 initiates in a more forcing way.   The main difference is that our move order  6...e5  7.Ndb5  d6  allows  8.Nd5  , which is a critical line, but interesting to play for Black in my opinion.   On the other hand,  6...e6  gives White the option to go for development with  7.Be3  or quiet moves like  7.a3. These are not very scary, but still White has a good range of options.  Instead 6...e5 is a lot more forcing.   I'd also like to mention the move 6...g6, which is of a completely different nature. Black goes for a Dragon style setup with the moves ...h5 and Be2 included. Most of the time this leads to positions with White castling kingside, when Black's ...h5 move is of limited value. On the other hand, the quiet lines against the Dragon, like 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be2, are certainly not very dangerous for Black. Having played ...h5 is not ideal, but won't be disastrous. As mentioned in the intro to the course, the games of Indian GM Aravindh were my inspiration for this course. Aravindh has played 6...g6 multiple times, so it definitely deserves attention and can be an alternative to explore. I decided to go for 6...e5, because it was lots of fun to analyze and leads to sharper positions. }
7. Ndb5 { By far the most common reply, like in the regular Sveshnikov. } 7...
d6 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6
{ This setup is our idea in the Sveshnikov type lines. We can't play with ...b5, like in the regular Sveshnikov, as we need to castle kingside in these lines. After going wild with ...h5 early on, this is clearly not so easily accomplished. Still, the ...Be6 approach is playable for Black, as we will see. The most important decision that Black has to face is how to recapture after White takes on f6. Taking with the pawn is the more dynamic choice, as it opens the g-file and might allow a quicker ... f5. An important detail is that in the 6.Be2 e5 lines we need to adjust on the next move and avoid an early 10...Rc8. The rook move is fine in the 6.h3 and 6. f3 lines, but here it is too slow. }
10. Nc4
{ The most obvious move, and the one that White usually plays in the Bird Variation without Be2 and ...h5 played. It is very logical to get the offside knight closer to the action and possibly connect it to the weakended d5-square. One major point of ...b5 in the regular Sveshnikov is to keep this knight offside for a while longer. }
10... Nd4
{ I tried really hard to make  10...Rc8  work, the move that we play in the similar lines with 6.f3 and 6.h3, unfortunately without success. I would have liked an identical approach along all three lines, but it did not quite work. The problem with 10...Rc8 was the line  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  , when I couldn't find a good solution. Admittedly after my suggestion 10...Nd4 I also suspect that White is better with perfect play. This is not a huge surprise, given that our play is very provocative. However, I am going to show that things are not simple at all and many of the strong moves that White needs to play are almost impossible for a human player to find, in particular under time pressure. OK, why 10...Nd4 instead of 10...Rc8? The coming lines are very sharp and it is tough to argue in general terms about the difference between the two scenarios. My take is that ...Rc8 is not ALWAYS useful for Black @@StartBracket@@for example we forfeit queenside castling@@EndBracket@@, while White's moves like 0-0 or Ne3 are generally useful.   One key idea to mention is that after  10...Nd4  11.Bxf6  gxf6  12.O-O  Black has  12...f5  13.exf5  Nxf5  , which is fine. This is different to the similar line with ...Rc8 and Ne3 included, when White has more control over f5 and can take the knight on f5. Here it might end with White playing Ne3, allowing us to take on e3. Let's continue to check some lines. }
11. Bxf6
{ The only critical move. If we manage ...Be7, allowing to recapture on f6 with the bishop, there is nothing to worry about. }
11... gxf6
{ Continueing in sharp and provocative style. 11...Qxf6 is playable, but seems slightly better for White @@StartBracket@@at least@@EndBracket@@. The main issue with the move is that is does not pose too many problems for White. After the g-pawn recapture White has some choice. My take is that the most likely moves to happen in a practical game are 12.Ne3, connecting the knight with the crucial squares on d5 and f5, and 12.0-0, which is also very natural. The engines view 12.Bd3 as the most critical move, though. This indeed seems to be most testing, but this is not very obvious at all. We will see that Black is challengend most against 12.Bd3, but the positions remain difficult and messy, giving us chances in a practical game. }
12. Ne3 { A natural move for White, connecting the knight to both f5 and d5. }
12... Bh6

13. Bxh5 { This is fine for Black due to a concrete tactic. } 13... Bxe3 14.

{ A sharp reaction. Moves like 9...h4 or 9...e6 are also interesting. } 10. Qe2
{ This allows early trades, which secures Black's king. We don't mind trades, as we have the bishops and central pawns as good long term assets.   10.O-O  f4  Black plays for central control over e5. A very unconventional and sharp position with mutual chances. }

16... Be7

{ White usually prefers Nb3, but sometimes the knight is not doing all at much on this square. 9.Nf3 is certainly an interesting try. }
9... Qb8
{ A major difference to other Sicilian lines with the doubled f-pawn is that Black has not yet played any centre pawn. This allows a setup with ...e6 and ...Bc5 or ...Bd6. }
10. Nd5 Bg7
{ This prepares a move that I could have played right away!   10...e6 !  I did not know or find this idea, but it is very interesting.  11.Nxf6+  Ke7  12.e5  Nxe5   12...Bg7  This is interesting, as well.  13.O-O  Nxe5  14.Nxe5  Qxe5  15.Nxh5  b6  Amazingly, Black has enough play for the pawn here.  16.Bf3  Bb7 !  17.Ng3  Bxf3  18.Qxf3  Qxb2  And Black seems to be OK, bit the king still feels shaky.  13.Qd4  ...Bg7   13...Kxf6 ?  14.Qf4+  14.Nxe5  Bxf6  15.f4  d6  16.O-O-O  Qc7  With very sharp and unclear play. }

15. Rad1
{ 15.b4 !  Ba7  16.Nc4  Ths looks devastating, so 15...Be7 is better - but that was not the idea behind ...Bc5. }
15... Ne5 16. Nd4 b5 17. f4 Ng6 18. f5 Nf4
{ 18...Ne5 looks like the normal move, but I wanted to play more actively. The position remains much better for White by engine standards, but it is not easy at all to prove in a real game. }
19. g3

19... Nh3+ { 19...Nxe2+  20.Qxe2  Qe5  This was simple and good! } 20. Kh1
{ 20.Kg2 !  This was the only move! The following line is long, but rather forced.  20...Ng5  21.fxe6  fxe6  22.Rxf6  Nxe4  23.Qd3  Bb7  24.Bf3  Nxf6  25.Qg6+  Ke7  26.Nef5+ !  exf5  27.Qg7+  Ke8  28.Re1+  Kd8  29.Qxh8+  Kc7  30.Qxf6  And White is better. }

{ 21.fxe6  fxe6  22.Ng2  Nxe4  23.Qd3  Qe5  24.b4  Bb6  25.Bf3  This is the line of defense pointed out by engines, but of course in a Blitz game you can't play close to perfectly in such a messy situation. }

{ In the early days of my Dirty Harry encounters I played this move. I don't think it is bad, but you need to be aware that 7.Ndb5 forces you into a 'Dirty Bird' anyway - and White has some other options, as we will see. }
7. a3
{ Not bad at all. It's slow, but ...Bb4 is stopped and after a later ...b5 it might be useful as well. }
7... Qc7 8. Nf3
{ White's setup does not strike me as being too natural, but this games was not chosen for the opening details. }
8... a6 9. O-O Bc5 10. b4 Ba7 11. Bb2 Ng4
{ This attacking idea is featured in our repertoire, mostly after 6.Bc4. Black tries to dislodge the f3-knight and give mate on h2. It does not quite work, though. }
12. g3
{ White misses the chance to immediately strike with a typical Sicilian sacrifice.   12.Nd5 !  White had this brutal shot, which refutes the black idea.  12...exd5  13.exd5  The knight has no good square.  13...Nb8  14.d6  Qd8  15.Bc4  An Black gets destroyed in short order. }
12... h4
{ Very tempting, but it seems to be flawed.   12...Nce5 !  This was a good option. Black still has ...h4 for later, but also gets ...Nc4 as an entirely different direction. Black has fair chances here. }
13. Nxh4 Nxf2 { 13...Rxh4  14.Bxg4  Leads nowhere for Black. } 14. Rxf2 Bxf2+
15. Kxf2 Rxh4 16. gxh4 Qxh2+
{ I had seen that Ke3 is forced now for White, if he wants to play for a win. I thought that 2 pawns for the piece and the exposed king would give enough play, but this was a misjudgement. After all the bishop on c8 and the rook on a8 are not participating in the game. }
17. Ke3 Qg3+ 18. Bf3 Ne5 19. Qe2
{ Attaching a question mark is not quite fair, as the position is very tough to play in Blitz. After this move I had a chance to get back into the game, but I didn't find it!   19.Qf1  b5  20.Ke2  The difference to 19.Qe2? - now this move is possible and White should win. }
19... Qxh4
{ 19...b5 !  Very strong! Now Black threatens ...Nc4+, and the king has no good move, compared to 19.Qf1!, which enables Ke2! }
20. Rh1 Qg5+ 21. Kf2
{ It turn out that the king is safe on f2, and Black is still not fully developed. }
21... d6 22. Nd1 Ke7 23. Qe3 Qxe3+
{ Not happy about it, as you have no swindling chances after the queen trade. It was tough to avoid, though - White has Qb6 ideas, as well. }
24. Nxe3 Bd7 25. c4 Rc8
{ Well, it's Blitz. Still it was possible for both players to do better here... }
26. Bxe5 dxe5 27. c5 Bc6 28. Nc4 f6 29. Rh7 Rg8 30. Ke3 Kf7 31. Nd6+ Kg6 32.

Bg5 a6 9. Na3 Be6 10. Nc4 Nd4 11. Ne3 Be7 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Ncd5
{ 13.Bxh5  Bg5  This gives Black reasonable compensation, as we discuss in the theory part of the course. }
13... Bg5
{ One important strategic idea for Black is the fight for the square d5. Taking the knight on e3 reduces White's control over this key square. }
14. c3 Nxe2 15. Qxe2 g6
{ I just wanted to castle. Instead  15...h4  is a more creative way to play. }
16. O-O O-O
{ White has good control over d5, but Black has two bishops against two knights, which is often very favourable in an endgame. One interesting observation is that White might have a good knight on d5, but this piece is also obstructing the d-file, so it's not easy to put pressure on d6. Exploiting BOTH d6 and the square on d5 is tough and often impossible. }
17. a4 Rc8 { Rook to c5 or c6 is a typical idea. } 18. a5
{ This is a dubious, as the pawn on a5 is rather weak.   18.Rfd1  This looks better, but I don't think White has anything special, for example after the following.  18...Bxe3  19.Nxe3  Rc6  20.Rd3  Qg5 }
18... Bxe3 19. Nxe3 Rc5 20. Rfd1 Qc7 21. Nd5
{ White should play a waiting move instead. Now Black is clearly better. }
21... Bxd5 22. Rxd5 Rxd5 23. exd5
{ White would be perfectly fine if he could advance the queenside pawns. This is not possible, though... and d5 and a5 are just weak. }
23... Rc8 { Here  23...Qc5!  was even better. } 24. Qd2
{ 24.Ra4 !  This is strong, stopping ...Qc4. White is still OK here. } 24...
Qc4 { Now the pawns are too weak and easily attacked. } 25. h3 Kg7 26. g3 Rc5
27. Rd1 Rxa5 28. Kg2 Rb5 29. b4 b6
{ And White resigned. The a-pawn will run, but he was also down on time a lot, as I recall. }

{ It's like a broken record - this happens again, and again, and again... } 10.
Qd5
{ 10.Qe2  This is better. Now Black needs to know or find the right move.  10...h4 !  Stopping g3 is key. Instead 10...f5 is also fine, but please don't play a slow move and ignore White's idea. }
10... e6 { 10...Nb4 !  This is even stronger. } 11. Qxe5 fxe5
{ White is now on the defensive, as Black has the better central pawns and the bishop pair. }
12. f3
{ 12.Nb5  Ke7  13.Rd1  h4  Stockfish gives Black just a minimal advantage here, as it is not easy to activate the c8-bishop. }

25. Rhg1 Rhd8 26. Ke3 e5 27. Ke4
{ 27.f4  exd4+  28.Kd3  This is holding quite easily. Rc1 and Rg5 are coming. }

11. Bxg5 Nxe5 12. O-O-O f6 13. Bf4 Nf7
{ Here ...Ng4! was more active and stronger. This game was played with 3 mins for White vs. 90 seconds for me, so I went with the simpler...Nf7 to support ...e5. }
14. Be2 e5 15. Bd2 d5

Nxc6
{ This move makes no sense at all. Black is happy to control d5 after the recapture. }
8... bxc6
{ 8...dxc6  This is actually quite strong! Moves like ...Bg4, ...Bh6 and ...0-0-0/Rd8 are coming quickly. Stockfish already gives Black a huge advantage. }
9. Bc4 Rb8 10. Bb3 Ba6 11. Qd4 Qb6
{ 11...Rb4 !  This is just winning immediately. Black's attack is unstoppable, for instance like this:  12.Qe3  Bh6  13.Qf3  d5  14.exd5  Rd4  15.Rd1  Rf4  16.Qe3  Rf5  And ...Re5 is the decisive threat. }

14. Kb1 h4 15. g3 hxg3 16. hxg3 Rxh1 17. Rxh1 Bd6
{ Black is pressing and White has no real counterplay. Note that the knight has no good post and the bishop on b3 is misplaced. White tries to improve these points over the next moves. }
18. Nd1
{ 18.Rh8+  Ke7  19.Rxb8  Bxb8  20.Kc1  I think White should have tried that. It's not fun, but trading the rook should increase the drawing chances. }
18... Ke7 19. Ne3 Bc5 20. Nd1 { 20.Re1  Rh8  Is also great for Black. } 20...

Nb3 Qe5 9. Be2 h4 10. h3
{ This is an instructive strategic mistake. Black was not planning to play ...h3 here. After ...h3 White has g3 and f4, which is fine for White, who still can castle queenside! Pushing the pawn to ...h3 might make sense after White had alreadly castled short, but here this is not the case. The main point of ...h4 was to gain a bit more space and remove the pawn from the influence of the bishop on e2. Now, after h3? it is very difficult for White to ever drive the black queen away from e5, as f4 is almost impossible to engineer. }
10... e6 11. Qd2
{ And again White runs into the bishop move we don't mind playing anyway. }
11... Bh6 12. Qd1 a6
{ 12...Rg8  13.Bf3  b6  This setup with ...b6 is even better, it seems. } 13.
O-O b5 { This looks more active than ...b6, but there is risk involved. } 14.
a3
{ 14.a4 !  b4  15.Nd5  In a practical game of Blitz or Rapid this is the way to go. Black probably has to take the knight and defend.  15...exd5  16.exd5  Nd8  Stockfish thinks this is best, but already a tough decision to make.  17.Re1  O-O  18.Bd3  And White has a dangerous attack. }
14... Bb7 15. Qd3 Qf4 { Clears e5 for the knight and has ...Bf8-d6 in mind. }
16. Rad1 Ne5 17. Qd6 Bf8 18. Qd4 Rg8 19. Kh1 Rc8 20. Qd2 Qxd2
{ We don't mind an endgame, of course. We have the much better pieces and can open the position for the bishop pair easily. }
21. Nxd2 f5
{ 21...Bxa3  22.Nxb5  axb5  23.bxa3  Rxc2  24.Bxb5  f5  This forcing line was also very good, of course. }
22. f4 { I probably underestimated this reply. } 22... Ng6
{ 22...Nc4  is still great for Black, for example after the following sequence.  23.Nxc4  bxc4  24.Bf3  fxe4  25.Nxe4  Bxe4  26.Bxe4  Rb8  27.Rb1  d5  28.Bf3  f5  Black is much better, due to the easy targets on f4 and on the queenside. }
23. Bd3
{ 23.exf5  Yes, this fearless move is working.  23...Nxf4  24.Nde4  Rxc3  25.Rxf4  Bxe4  26.bxc3  Bxg2+  27.Kh2  Bd5  28.fxe6  fxe6  29.Rxd5  exd5  30.Rxh4  Not a very human line, but it works. }
23... Ne7 24. Rde1 Bg7 { Now the bishops are fantastically placed. } 25. e5 d6
26. Nf3 Bxf3
{ A simple solution, but 26...Ng6 was even better.   26...Ng6  27.exd6  Nxf4  Black might even win with a swift attack now. }
27. Rxf3 dxe5 28. fxe5 Nc6
{ That was the point of ...Bxf3. The e5-pawn is isolated and will fall. } 29.
Rfe3 Bh6 30. R3e2 Ke7 31. Nd1 Rcd8 { Lots of time available for Black. } 32.
Ne3 Bxe3 33. Rxe3 Rd4 34. R3e2 Rg3 35. Rf2 Rd5 36. Rf3
