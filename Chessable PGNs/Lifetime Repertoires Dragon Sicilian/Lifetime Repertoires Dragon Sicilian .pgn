6. Be3
{ By far the most principled move, going for the so-called Yugoslav Attack. True to the nature of the position, White wants to quickly castle long and start an attack on the kingside. I believe you will encounter this in most of your games, no matter what your level is. Both the amateurs and the professionals are in sync here and most of them take up the challenge and aim for the long castle plans. And rightly so.  The following lines will give you a good taste of what awaits you in the main chapters, but so as to be fully prepared, I certainly recommend going through the main body of this course, as it was hard to fit everything into this Quickstarter Guide. }
6... Bg7

f3
{ White needs to secure the bishop, as  7.Qd2  can be met with  7...Ng4!  . }
7... O-O { Castle first and Nc6 transpose to each other. } 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O
{ Possibly the most critical test of our whole repertoire. This line used to be secondary to 9. Bc4, as Black gets to strike with d5! here, but upon closer investigation and as theory started developing, it turned out that Black still has to solve his problems, especially in the12.Bd4 line. I believe that my recommendation there is completely unheard of and will turn the theory of this variation upside down. }
9... d5
{ The most critical move here is  10.exd5  , but White has a few alternatives that are very testing as well. }
10. Kb1
{ This used to be considered testing, but it can lead to some very fun lines for Black, now that the theory has evolved quite far. }

12. exf6 exf6
{ This is a better option, although  12...Bxf6!?  13.Nxd5  Qxd5!  with a queen sac for a knight and a rook may very well be enough to hold, as Black will have a strong bishop pair. }
13. Bc5 d4
{ A strong exchange sac, as the weakness of the e3-square is going to be a theme. }
14. Bxf8 Qxf8 15. Nb5 Ne3

{ The move that defines the Dragon opening, as our pawn structure is now supposed to resemble a dragon. An important characteristic of this setup is that we have basically no weaknesses @@StartBracket@@the e7-pawn at the base of the chain barely counts@@EndBracket@@, but it does create a target for a kingside attack and White's most principled approach of castling long does ask Black some important questions.

6. Be3
{ By far the most principled move, going for the so-called Yugoslav Attack. True to the nature of the position, White wants to quickly castle long and start an attack on the kingside. I believe you will encounter this in most of your games, no matter what your level is. Both the amateurs and the professionals are in sync here and most of them take up the challenge and aim for the long castle plans. And rightly so.  The following lines will give you a good taste of what awaits you in the main chapters, but so as to be fully prepared, I certainly recommend going through the main body of this course, as it was hard to fit everything into this Quickstarter Guide. }

7... O-O { Castle first and Nc6 transpose to each other. } 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4
{ This used to be the main line, intending to castle long, but not rushing with it just yet and taking a moment to stop the d5-break in the center. It remains very critical and I am quite excited to share my antidote against it, sidestepping all the current troublesome theory and offering a modern dynamic approach. }
9... Nxd4
{ It is certainly possible and highly interesting to investigate the slower lines starting with Bd7 and then Rc8 or Rb8. But while some of that is certainly a lot of fun, Black will experience some theoretical difficulties if White knows what he is doing, and it is certainly one of the reasons why the Dragon has faded away from high-level practice. With the line I would like to suggest, I propose to challenge this status quo and solve our opening problems in a very straightforward fashion. }
10. Bxd4 Be6
{ A common theme in our course. It is amazing how well the bishop is placed on e6, fighting for some vital squares along the a2-g8 diagonal. }
11. Bxe6
{ This is a critical move that is analyzed in a lot of detail in therespective chapter. }
11... fxe6 12. O-O-O Qa5
{ The queen belongs on this square, connecting the rooks. It also not only applies pressure on the queenside but also keeps the e5-square in check. }
13. Rhe1
{ Going for e5 is the most critical. Pushing h4-h5 is not so dangerous, the easiest way to stop that is with Nh5. }
13... Nd7 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 15. e5
{ A challenging push. Taking the e5-pawn would open the e-file and have us lose our crucial e6-pawn. }
15... d5
{ Keeping the center closed. It is likely to happen that the queens come off here and the ensuing endgame is analyzed in thedesignated chapter. Black is fine, especially if he keeps the Nb8-Nc6 maneuver in mind, while also keeping the e6-pawn under control with Kf7 when necessary. }

White will end up having to trade queens with Qd3 or Rhe1/Qe2 and the ensuing endgame, as you will see in theappropriate chapter, is completely fine for Black. Moreover, in a practical game, there is some potential, with Black often ending up having a 'good' knight against the 'bad' light-squared bishop. }

{ A useful move, securing the position for the queen on c7. The point of 7...Qc5 as opposed to the main move 7...Qd8 is that now we keep an eye on the c4-bishop and White needs to waste a tempo moving or defending it first, before moving his d2-knight. Our plan here is to bring back the queen to c7 and, depending on circumstances, develop the c8-bishop to g4 or b7 after b5. If possible, we would also like to push e5. }

{ And here, with White not having the Bh6 trade now that h5 and h3 were included, White lacks a good plan, while Black has plenty of useful moves before castling short, including a5-a4 and Ba6. }

10. Bxd4

10... Be6
{ This is a rather old line that has always been there, but was not thought to give Black adequate play. Now, with the help of modern computers, I managed to fully rehabilitate it and the old conclusions were completely overthrown.   Besides being the top choice of the best engines against the 9. Bc4-system, this approach is also very logical and very direct. We want to develop our pieces to the most active squares right away and start our play on the queenside as soon as possible.   White has a choice here. He can either keep the tension with  11.Bb3  or go for the bishop trade with  11.Bxe6  . }
11. Bxe6
{ The bishop trade does double Black's pawns, but it strongly reinforces our central control, as the important d5-square will now be guarded by our e6-pawn. }
11... fxe6 12. O-O-O
{ White has to castle long if he wants to get anything in this particular line, but also in the Dragon in general. Our only fundamental issue is a potentially vulnerable king.   If White were to castle short here  12.O-O  we would just get the queen out with  12...Qa5  , trade the d4-bishop after Nd7 or Nh5 and enjoy the pressure along the c-file. The c3-knight would be particularly aimless with the pawn on e6 guarding the d5-square.   12.h4  here or on the next move will transpose to the12.O-O-O move oreder, after for example  12...Qa5  13.O-O-O  Rac8  14.Kb1  . }
12... Qa5 13. Kb1
{ The most often played move. If White starts with  13.h4  , it will likely transpose after  13...Rac8  14.Kb1  . }
13... Rac8
{ It is possible to offer the trade of bishops right away with  13...Nd7  , but I like to bring our rook to the semi-open c-file first, before deciding where to jump with the knight. The knight can potentially also go to h5. }
14. h4
{ There is no real threat yet, but this move could be useful in the long run, as now h4-h5 is always in the air. }
14... Nh5
{ This feels right, blocking the kingside offense, but in fact, the computer has a point in proposing the counterintuitive  14...Nd7!?  as well. After  15.Bxg7  Kxg7  the advance  16.h5  can be fully neutralized with  16...g5!  when our king is completely safe, as the h-file remains closed. }
15. Bxg7 Kxg7
{ Black has a comfortable position. White's kingside play is blocked, as  16.g4?!  is well met with both  16...Nf4  as well as  16...Ng3!?  . We control all the key squares in the center and next we can think of doubling on the c-file or advancing our queenside pawns eventually. }
16. e5
{ This is a clever attempt to bring us off balance, but it doesn't lead to anything special for White. }
16... Qxe5 17. Rhe1 Qf4
{ Offering a trade of queens. The endgame after  18.Rxe6  Qxd2  19.Rxd2  Kf7  was equal in an old e-mail game Achilles-Gutierrez, 2008.   Instead,  18.Qf2  can be met with  18...Qb4!  threatening to take the c3-knight and not giving White time to breathe. }

{ The so-called Yugoslav Attack - the setup with Be3, f3, Qd2 and eventual long castle - is definitely THE way to go for White against the Dragon. At the high levels, White chooses this most ambitious setup in 90% of the games, and I believe that number lies even higher when players expect to face the Dragon and have time to prepare. At the same time, club players and also many strong amateurs are familiar with this setup. This is why the Yugoslav Attack is the core of our repertoire. }
6... Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4
{ The old main line of the Yugoslav Attack and still one of the most common, most ambitious and most critical attempts. In this chapter, I would like to present you with my main recommendation: a relatively rare and yet very straightforward system. }
9... Nxd4
{ In fact, it is also possible to start with  9...Qa5!?  and only after  10.O-O-O  take with  10...Nxd4  followed by Be6, which will eventually transpose to one of our lines. White will have the very same choice of going for Bxe6 or for Bb3. }
10. Bxd4
{ Instead,  10.Qxd4  would be a big mistake due to  10...Ng4  11.Qd2  Nxe3  12.Qxe3  Bd7  , and with the bishop pair and the semi-open c-file, Black has all the fun. }
10... Be6
{ This is a rather old line that has always been there, but was not thought to give Black adequate play. Now, with the help of modern computers, I managed to fully rehabilitate it and the old conclusions were completely overthrown.   Besides being the top choice of the best engines against the 9. Bc4-system, this approach is also very logical and very direct. We want to develop our pieces to the most active squares right away and start our play on the queenside as soon as possible.   White has a choice here. He can either keep the tension with  11.Bb3  or go for the bishop trade with  11.Bxe6  . }
11. Bxe6
{ The bishop trade does double Black's pawns, but it strongly reinforces our central control, as the important d5-square will now be guarded by our e6-pawn. }
11... fxe6 12. O-O-O
{ White has to castle long if he wants to get anything in this particular line, but also in the Dragon in general. Our only fundamental issue is a potentially vulnerable king.   If White were to castle short here  12.O-O  we would just get the queen out with  12...Qa5  , trade the d4-bishop after Nd7 or Nh5 and enjoy the pressure along the c-file. The c3-knight would be particularly aimless with the pawn on e6 guarding the d5-square.   12.h4  here or on the next move will transpose to the12.O-O-O move oreder, after for example  12...Qa5  13.O-O-O  Rac8  14.Kb1  . }
12... Qa5 13. Rhe1
{ The strongest move according to the engines, forgetting about the kingside play with h4-h5 and focusing instead on the center. It's currently threatening e5. }
13... Nd7
{ Given that White is not intending h4-h5 in the near future, it makes more sense to keep the knight closer to the center and go for this move, as opposed to Nh5. }
14. Bxg7 Kxg7 15. e5
{ This is White's idea. White is changing the pawn structure in the center. }
15... d5
{ Keeping the center closed.  15...Nxe5  would be met by  16.f4!  when White would regain the e6-pawn and the d5-square for his knight. }
16. a3
{ This seems like the slightly more accurate way of preparing Ne2. In the arising endgame, the king is possibly better placed on c1 than on b1, as it is closer to the center. Although frankly, it is all very subtle and the differences are minuscule. }
16... Rac8
{ This move never needs commentary in the Sicilian. The rook belongs on this file! }
17. Ne2
{ Just like in the16.Kb1 line, if White chooses to postpone trading the queens with  17.h4  , we will still force it with  17...Nb6!  intending Nc4. }
17... Qxd2+ 18. Rxd2
{ The endgame is fine for Black. It is very important that, even if White gets the grip with the pawn chain e5-f4-g3-h4, it is not the end of the world, now that we no longer have the bishop on g7.  White's knight on d4 will be challenged with the thematic Nb8-Nc6!, our king will likely reroute itself to d7 so as to stay close to e6-pawn while letting the f8-rook have the view over the f-file. And after that, we will keep the ideas of h6-g5 on the kingside and the b5-a5 pawn advance on the queenside in mind. }
18... Kf7
{ Black lost one correspondence game here after  18...a5  . Although the move makes sense, grabbing some space on the queenside, Black eventually misplayed it. }
19. Nd4
{ If White starts with  19.f4  , we may go for the active  19...Nc5  followed by Ne4. }
19... Nb8
{ The most conceptual approach is to start with this regrouping and challenge the d4-knight immediately.   Alternatively, I also like  19...g5!?  trying to avoid the kingside bind altogether. Although, as I already mentioned, without the dead bishop on g7 the kingside bind in itself is not so damaging for us. }
20. f4 Nc6 21. Nf3
{ White is also on top of things. He avoids the trade of knights. } 21... Ke8
{ Continuing with our plan. Black can also start with h6 first, it all comes down to the same thing. }
22. g3 h6 23. h4 Kd7
{ The king is well placed here. White has managed to secure his kingside, so now we can grab some space on the queenside. }
24. Re3 b5
{ Frankly, our queenside offensive is more of a preventive measure, as we aren't going to get all that much play there if White, for example, meets b5-a5 with a3-b3. However, the same applies to White: while he can prevent our counterplay on both wings, he has no resources left to start any real play of his own. Both sides appear to be at a standstill here. }

9... Nxd4

10. Bxd4
{ Instead,  10.Qxd4  would be a big mistake due to  10...Ng4  11.Qd2  Nxe3  12.Qxe3  Bd7  , and with the bishop pair and the semi-open c-file, Black has all the fun. }
10... Be6
{ This is a rather old line that has always been there, but was not thought to give Black adequate play. Now, with the help of modern computers, I managed to fully rehabilitate it and the old conclusions were completely overthrown.   Besides being the top choice of the best engines against the 9. Bc4-system, this approach is also very logical and very direct. We want to develop our pieces to the most active squares right away and start our play on the queenside as soon as possible.   White has a choice here. He can either keep the tension with  11.Bb3  or go for the bishop trade with  11.Bxe6  . }
11. Bb3
{ Apart from this being the most popular move, it also feels right. White parks the bishop on b3 and asks Black what he has achieved by playing Be6. That said, thealternative  11.Bxe6  is also very critical. }
11... Qa5
{ The standard way of developing the initiative in the Dragon. The queen heads to a5, from where it controls some key squares, like b5 and d5, but also puts pressure on the c3-knight and, at times, the a2-pawn. }
12. O-O-O b5

About a decade ago, Hikaru tried to make this line of the Dragon work with 12... Rfc8 against me.

Instead, it is the immediate b5-b4 that gives Black the counterplay he needs. }
13. Kb1

This is a very important motive in the Dragon @@StartBracket@@which doesn't always necessarily work for White, by the way!@@EndBracket@@. Do stay alert to tricks! }
13... b4 { Continuing with the direct approach. } 14. Nd5
{ The most principled and most common reply. } 14... Bxd5 15. exd5 Qb5
{ The bishop on b3 is kind of pushed back by our b4-pawn and the queen on b5. Next, we want to play a5-a4. White has to do something to rescue the bishop. }
16. Rhe1
{ This is one of the two ways to trade queens. The alternative is the immediate Qd3. }
16... a5 17. Qd3
{ This is quite clever, but there is a simple solution for Black. } 17... Qxd3
18. cxd3 a4 { Grabbing some space first. } 19. Bc4
{ Now it's time to address the e7-pawn. Or is it? } 19... Rab8
{ This is the easiest, improving on Moranda-Klekowski, 2018. We take control over the b5-square to prepare Rfe8, as it turns out that the e7-pawn is not really hanging. }
20. Rxe7 Nxd5 21. Bxd5 Bxd4
{ With equality. The opposite-colored bishops are famously neutralizing each other and, with Rb5 incoming, White will not be able to keep up the pressure on the f7-pawn. But first, we would want to go a3 to create a far-advanced pawn there, just in case our rook gets activated one day. }

At the high levels, White chooses this most ambitious setup in 90% of the games, and I believe that number lies even higher when players expect to face the Dragon and have time to prepare.

We have so much compensation that we will eventually win our pawn back one way or the other. }

15. g4

{ Fixing the pawn structure, as the h4-pawn is potentially weak. I am generally against this, as you know, and usually try to push f5 instead, but here it is not possible any longer. Rather than allowing the h5-push, this is the lesser evil when it comes to kingside pawn structure. }
21. g5 Rd5
{ A typical resource for this line. White is quite poorly coordinated here, with his bishop on a6 out of business and Black is just waiting for a good opportunity to sneak up on the h4-pawn with a well-timed Ng2!. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3
{ The so-called Yugoslav Attack - the setup with Be3, f3, Qd2 and eventual long castle - is definitely THE way to go for White against the Dragon. At the high levels, White chooses this most ambitious setup in 90% of the games, and I believe that number lies even higher when players expect to face the Dragon and have time to prepare. At the same time, club players and also many strong amateurs are familiar with this setup. This is why the Yugoslav Attack is the core of our repertoire. }
6... Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O d5 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bd4
{ This is possibly the main line at the highest level these days and I can understand why, as the trend has shifted from the ambitious  12...e5  towards the defensive  12...Bxd4  .  After the trade of bishops, White gets a strategically superior position due to his better pawn structure and also a safe king. Instead of going for the defensive approach, I propose to look for a solution with the old master @@StartBracket@@who have kept the Dragon spirit alive by preserving the dark-squared bishops@@EndBracket@@ and inject the old main line with some new knowledge from AI engines. They can save practically anything nowadays. }
12... e5
{ Keeping the bishops gives Black something to hope for. It also is still the most popular move. Let's keep it this way. }
13. Bc5 Re8
{ This is the first twist! The main move order is  13...Be6  , which looks spectacular, leaving the rook hanging. The problem is that White doesn't take the exchange. The fundamental issue with the main theoretical line is that White gets to block our kingside pawn majority and keeps the blockading knight on e4. }
14. Ne4 { This is still the main and the most challenging move. } 14... Qc7
{ This is the point. The most natural move  14...Be6  would transpose to the13...Be6 variation. In that move order, I explain how this approach is just not in time to work.   With the very rare  14...Qc7  , which is my recommendation, Black prepares the crucial f5-push, which now becomes possible, as Nd6 can be met by Rd8. The queen frees up the d8-square for the rook. Now White has a few options, the main move being  15.h4  . }
15. h4
{ The main move. White assumes that f5 is not really a threat and starts direct kingside play. He assumes wrong. }
15... f5
{ This is very rare and, at this point, we are left with a couple of games by low-rated players and one forgotten email game played by unknown players in 2011. The only move played at the high level is  15...Rd8  , preparing f5, but after  16.h5!  f5  17.h6!  Bh8  18.Ng5  White gets a nasty grip and Black is in bad shape. After the new 15...f5!, however, things seem to work out for Black in the end! }
16. Nd6 Rd8 17. Nxc8 Raxc8
{ We have lost the very important light-squared bishop, but on the bright side we have achieved a beautiful pawn structure on the kingside and White is yet to start his play. }
18. Bc4 { This is very principled and things get very messy. } 18... h5
{ We have to play this move. If we go  18...h6  instead, our light squares are going to be gaping after White pokes us with  19.h5  . }
19. g4 { Challenging. This is a very important moment. } 19... Kh7
{ An important move with a dual purpose. First of all, we indirectly defend from gxf5/gxh5, as Bh6 is now a thing, but we also walk out of the pin by the c4-bishop. }
20. Qe1 hxg4
{ Here we take. Note that we react differently to the 20. Qf2 move. } 21. h5 g5
22. fxg4 e4
{ Now that the queen is on e1, we have time for this push @@StartBracket@@that's why in the20. Qf2 line we play differently!@@EndBracket@@. }
23. gxf5 Rb8
{ Hitting b2-pawn, thus bringing the rook onto the semi-open file with a tempo. }
24. Bb3 e3
{ We have positional compensation for the pawn here. Our king is neatly hidden behind pawns @@StartBracket@@ours and our opponent's@@EndBracket@@, the dark-squared bishop is a beast and the e3-pawn is quite far advanced and annoying. Next up, we want to activate our queen with Qe5, perhaps stabilize with Bf6, maybe play Re8, and being fully mobilized, wait for a chance to strike. Black has full compensation here. }

At the same time, he wants to stop the 9... d5-push, which the other main move 9. O-O-O allows.

9... Be6
{ This is a very strong reply and the only way not to get steamrolled in the 9. g4-line. The idea here is that we aren't afraid of Nxe6, because it opens up the f-file and, due to the weakness of the f3-pawn, we will get enough tempi to set up quick counterplay on the queenside, along the c-file.   9...Nxd4  is premature, because after  10.Bxd4  Be6  White now has  11.h4!  while if he goes for  10. h4 after the text move  9...

Rab8
{ It is also possible to start with  12...Rfc8  , but here this move is more direct, as it threatens b5.  Note that after playing Kb1, White threatens an intermezzo with Nd5/Qxd2/Nxe7+! That's why, whenever Kb1 happens, we need to move the f8-rook to c8, so as to have the option of Kf8! after the check. A very important motive in the Dragon, this Nd5-Nxe7 business.   Now if  13.Kb1  we go  13...Rfc8  and transpose to the12.Kb1 line. }
13. h4
{ Now there is still no threat of Nd5, as Qxd2 comes with check, so we can push the b-pawn. }
13... b5 14. Nd5
{ White has to bail out into an equal endgame, as the threat of b4 was too strong. }
14... Qxd2+ 15. Rxd2 Bxd5 16. exd5 a5
{ With a fine endgame. We see a similar one in the12. Kb1 variation. Next, we want to trade the dark-squared bishops with Nd7 @@StartBracket@@with or without the inclusion of h5@@EndBracket@@ and play against White's weak d5-pawn. White's kingside pawns are overextended and have turned from strengths in the middlegame to targets in the endgame. }

The idea here is that we aren't afraid of Nxe6, because it opens up the f-file and, due to the weakness of the f3-pawn, we will get enough tempi to set up quick counterplay on the queenside, along the c-file.   9...Nxd4  is premature, because after  10.Bxd4  Be6  White now has  11.h4!  while if he goes for  10. h4 after the text move  9... Be6, Black has a strong reply in 10 ...d5! as we will see. }
10. Nxe6
{ Principled and doubling our pawns. The e6- and g6-pawns become a little soft now, but we do get some tempi on the f3-pawn and can set up a quick counterplay along the c-file. It is important to know this line, as some moves, especially 12... Qc8! don't immediately come to mind. }

O-O-O
{ White is better off castling short, but with the pawn on g4 it would look highly awkward. Here we have a strong new idea that I would like to mention. }
13... Nxb3+ 14. axb3 a5 { A strong novelty, hinting at the a5-a4 possibility. }
15. Bd4 { Trying to neutralize our g7-bishop, but now we can strike. } 15... a4
{ Not the only move, as the slower  15...Qc6  looks good as well, but the most energetic and spirited. }
16. bxa4 b5 { Boom! } 17. axb5
{ If  17.Nxb5  Rxa4  we have obvious compensation for the pawn as well. The a-file is open and we are on the offensive. }
17... Ra1+ 18. Nb1 Nd7
{ Rerouting the knight and asking White some serious questions. The difference in the kings' safety is huge, mainly because we were just a lot faster. White has yet to play h4-h5, but in this game, it is no longer likely to happen, as he has to focus on the defense. }

18. bxc3 Rac8

{ The so-called Yugoslav Attack - the setup with Be3, f3, Qd2 and eventual long castle - is definitely THE way to go for White against the Dragon. At the high levels, White chooses this most ambitious setup in 90% of the games, and I believe that number lies even higher when players expect to face the Dragon and have time to prepare. At the same time, club players and also many strong amateurs are familiar with this setup. This is why the Yugoslav Attack is the core of our repertoire. }
6... Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. g4
{ This is a very clever sideline that had its deserved boost in popularity a few years ago. White doesn't want to develop the bishop to c4 like in the old main line. At the same time, he wants to stop the 9... d5-push, which the other main move 9. O-O-O allows. He wants to have the best of both worlds, but committing this early to g4 also means weakening the f3-pawn, which is a nuance we immediately take advantage of. }
9... Be6
{ This is a very strong reply and the only way not to get steamrolled in the 9. g4-line. The idea here is that we aren't afraid of Nxe6, because it opens up the f-file and, due to the weakness of the f3-pawn, we will get enough tempi to set up quick counterplay on the queenside, along the c-file.   9...Nxd4  is premature, because after  10.Bxd4  Be6  White now has  11.h4!  while if he goes for  10. h4 after the text move  9... Be6, Black has a strong reply in 10 ...d5! as we will see. }
10. Nxe6
{ Principled and doubling our pawns. The e6- and g6-pawns become a little soft now, but we do get some tempi on the f3-pawn and can set up a quick counterplay along the c-file. It is important to know this line, as some moves, especially 12... Qc8! don't immediately come to mind. }

{ I had played the  4...Nf6  move order against Carlsen and there are some subtle points there, but it is a lot easier to go for  4...Nc6  , with more clarity and much fewer transpositions.  Now White is choosing from two different concepts, the traditional  5.Bb5  and the rare  5.Qe3  , a very odd-looking setup that has been played a lot at the highest level recently. }
5. Qe3

5... g6
{ This or  5...Nf6  first, I don't see the difference. Now White essentially has two different development setups that have been played so far: Bc4 and Be2. There are more move orders, as White can start with Nc3 or h3, but it mostly all transposes to one or the other. }

7. O-O Nf6 8. h3

8... O-O 9. c4 Qb6 10. Nc3
{ White shouldn't exchange queens with  10.Qxb6  axb6  , which would give Black the upper hand already. We have plenty of play with Nd7-Nc5 and White just doesn't get to consolidate, with the e4- and c4-pawns being targets. }
10... Nd7
{ An endgame like  10...Qxe3  11.Bxe3  Nd7  should be very fine for Black.   In fact, I would recommend the more ambitious  10...Nd7  because I doubt your opponent will find }
11. Qf4
{ or  11.Qg5  , keeping the queens on the board and a balanced position. }
11... Bxc3 12. bxc3 f6
{ With a very unclear position. Black has some serious strategic assets thanks to a far superior pawn structure, but White does have the bishop pair and some chances of a kingside initiative. }

{ This system used to be played mainly with the idea to pin the knight on c6 and then take it, develop with Nc3, Bg5 and castle long. Nowadays, some top players started playing it with different ideas, like dropping the queen back to e3 and simply finishing the development.   It is not that dangerous. In particular for players who aren't that experienced and want to improve their game, I would recommend, as White, to stay away from such slightly disharmonious systems. That said, as Dragon players, we are always happy to face these systems, so let's see how to react. }
4... Nc6
{ I had played the  4...Nf6  move order against Carlsen and there are some subtle points there, but it is a lot easier to go for  4...Nc6  , with more clarity and much fewer transpositions.  Now White is choosing from two different concepts, the traditional  5.Bb5  and the rare  5.Qe3  , a very odd-looking setup that has been played a lot at the highest level recently. }
5. Bb5
{ The old way of doing it, White pins the knight and doesn't want to waste time moving the queen again.   I expect this still to be the most common of the two on amateur and club level, despite that a lot of top players are trying these hypermodern Qe3 setups. }
5... Bd7
{ Here again White has a choice. The traditional way to go is to grab the knight and go for the quick long castle with Nc3 and Bg5, while the more modern attempts are connected with the Maroczy bind. }
6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Nc3
{ This is the old setup, the computers have long shown that this highly ambitious setup is not near as dangerous as it looks. }
7... Nf6 { We may want to fianchetto the bishop, so White stops that. } 8. Bg5
{ Forcing us to go for the e6/Be7 setup, which is fine. } 8... e6 9. O-O-O Be7
{ Now White usually tries something like Qd3 and Nd4 and then starts pushing the kingside pawns. Pretty slow. }
10. Qd3
{ The second most popular move and a very common idea in this position. White frees the d4-quare for the knight. }
10... Qa5
{ A strong idea, as this move is anyway useful, developing the queen and connecting the rooks, but now it also gives us an extra tempo, as White needs to do something about the g5-bishop, in order to proceed with the Nd4 idea. }
11. Bh4
{ This is not played a lot and can transpose to the10.Rhe1 move order. } 11...
O-O 12. Nd4 Rfe8 { Setting up for the Nxe4 trick sometimes. } 13. Rhe1
{ It is probably the most sensible to focus on the center, as it is hard for White to play on the kingside here. }
13... Rac8 { And we transpose to tne10.Rhe1 line. } *

I don't know whether he deserves to be worse now, but one way or the other, Black is very fine.  We can kick the bishop with  7...a6  first or just finish development with  7...Be7  and short castle. The d7-knight will find a job on b6, supporting the d5 push, while if White pushes a4 early, it can even drop back to b8 and re-develop to c6. }
7... d5 { A strong idea, sacrificing the pawn for marvelous initiative. } 8.
exd5
{ The pawn on d5 is taking away a square from White's pieces and the pawn on f3 looks odd now, weakening White's kingside tremendously. The knight on f5 will be a target and will get pushed back. }

{ There have been close to 200 games with this position in my database. } 9...
Bxd7
{ Much more common is  9...Qxd7  , trying to eventually regain the d5-pawn, but this more ambitious move is even stronger. We don't need to go after the pawn, we can just play for long-term compensation. }
10. Ne3 { White had to retreat, as the knight on f5 was hanging. } 10... Nh5
{ The natural  10...Bc5  is excellent and Black is slightly better there as well, but this practically new move is just really brutal. }
11. O-O { After  11.g3  we could just proceed with  11...Bc5  . } 11... f5
{ Again, the simple  11...Bc5  is pleasant for Black, but with this one, Black is going for the kill. There are some serious threats of Bc5, f4 and Ng3+ with checkmate and White doesn't have a good way to bail out. }
12. d6 { Trying to block the bishop is only a temporary measure. } 12... Be6
{ Hitting the d6-pawn and winning it on the next move. Black is just much better here. We have the bishop pair, more active pieces, excellent pawn structure, potentially the safer king, everything. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6
{ Besides the Open Sicilian with  3.d4  , White also very often delivers the  3.Bb5+  which has become particularly popular a few years back when the top players, including Magnus Carlsen, had discovered that it can even be used as an attempt to fight for an advantage.  However, there are also other 3rd moves and although they are a lot less trendy, some are still quite common across all levels. As the character of the position is very different compared to the open Sicilians, I believe it is worth your time to go through these lines to get a better feel for them. }
3. Bc4
{ This move has become relatively popular at the high level too, especially in the quicker time controls. I also see it pop up now and then across all levels, so it is good to know how to handle it. White intends to place the bishop on b3 and then slowly fight for the center and perhaps push c3-d4 if possible. }
3... g6

9. Nbd2

9... cxd4
{ This is typical. Now we take! Once the knight is on d2, White can't benefit from the c3-square. }
10. cxd4 a5
{ Gaining some vital space on the queenside and keeping the options open for the knight. The a6-square is starting to look very interesting as well! }
11. Bc2 Na6 12. Nf1 e5
{ We can invite White into a closed Spanish structure, now that our pieces are well placed for it. }
13. d5
{ Otherwise we take exd4 where White will have to deal with our strong bishops and pressure on the e4-pawn, as well as the constant worry of the d6-d5 break. But now we get some crucial squares on the queenside and can regroup nicely. }
13... Nc5 14. Ng3 Qb6
{ The plans are simple: improve the bishop with Ba6, the rook with Rfc8, and then we see what comes our way. The queen can even drop back to d8 and f8. }
