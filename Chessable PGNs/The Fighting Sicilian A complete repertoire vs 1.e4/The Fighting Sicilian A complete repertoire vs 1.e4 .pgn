{ Once again black takes control in the center, and his position is preferable. Here white's bishop is slightly better placed than on e2 like in the line before, but also his pieces are undeveloped and black has the advantage in the center and in space. Black is better. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. b3
{ This leads to a well-known Sicilian position with b3. White's idea is to get the dark square bishop on the long diagonal a1 - h8 in order to obtain pressure on the black kingside. This dark square bishop is also well placed on this diagonal and controls central squares e5 and d4. The drawback is the fact that white currently can't open the position in the center and black can get a nice position with natural developing moves. White plans are connected to moves like Bb5 and sometimes d3 or even d4 later on. In this closed position, black has enough time to develop all his pieces and obtain a nice position. }
2... Nc6
{ This natural move is played in order to fight for the central squares e5 and d4. This knight is on the best square, and white's plan will be to eliminate it. }
3. Bb2 e6
{ Now white can try a few moves, but black maintains the balance. Now, when white tries to play Bb5, black has that extra option of Nge7 to bring the other knight to the best square c6. On the other hand, with this move black has the plan to play d5 or just d6 to control dark squares in the center  (e5 and d4)  . }
4. Bb5
{ This is white's original idea. In order to get the advantage in the center, he wants to take this great knight on c6. After this, he can set all pawns on light squares with his next move d3 and play for a positional advantage in the pawn structure. }
4... Nge7
{ This is the key move. White can't go back with the light squared bishop because the pawn is on b3 - white can't play Ba4 and Bb3. That's why black now plays this move, and after an exchange on c6, the other knight will get there without breaking the pawn structure and with a great position for the knight from g8. }
5. Nf3 a6 6. Be2
{ This is a passive move that allows black to take over the initiative. White is tempted to exchange the knight on c6 in this kind of position. Be2 will lose time and this white light square bishop doesn't have a nice position on e2 or d3 or on any light square. }
6... d5
{ Another strong break in the center as in similar lines before. When white plays passive then black needs to strike back in the center as quickly as possible. }
7. exd5 Nxd5
{ This is the next important move in the black plan. Black needs to take this pawn with the knight and not to get a position with exd5 when white will with d4 get a better pawn structure in the center. Now, this knight is on a great square and the dark squared bishop is ready to come in to play. Black has no problems here and he is at least equal, if not slightly better. }
8. O-O Nf6 9. Nc3 Be7 10. d3 O-O 11. Qd2 Qc7 12. Rfe1 b5
{ Black develops all his pieces without problems in the opening. Also white gets a passive position for his knights and less space in the center because of the d3 pawn. Black controls the d4 square and has potential play on the c and d files. Black is in a slightly better position because white played passively and black took the space on the queenside and the initiative. }

First, with the exchange of the light squared bishop for the knight on c6 white brings and develops the other black knight on c6 and secures it there. Next white exchanges his bishop for a knight - a trade that favours black. And lastly, the most important thing is that now white pawn's structure looks very nice but this is just optical. White's pawns on the light squares are passive and stationary while black's pawns are active and mobile. Because of that black will have more space with his pawns and maybe try to get the advantage. It is important to remember that black can not allow white to take the knight on c6 when black doesn't have the other knight on e7 because with a broken pawn structure this position will be better for white since then black's pawns will not be mobile and potentially they could be weak. }
8... f6
{ Another strong move. Black neutralizes white's dark-squared bishop on b2 and securely develops his dark square bishop. This is possible because white plays passively and doesn't do anything to fight for the initiative in an open battle. }

9... cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bd7 11. c4 Be7 12. Nc3 O-O 13. Re1 Qc7
{ Black gets a position from some lines in the open Sicilian where white is without a light square bishop while black exchanged one piece and now has nice squares for all the other pieces. Black has a slightly passive position for now, but he has strong center pawns on e6 and d6 and the bishop pair that can be dangerous when the position will get open later. Black needs to aim for the d5 and b5 breaks. With the bishop pair and without weaknesses, only black can be better in the long run. }

1. e4 c5 2. f4
{ This is the first deviation on the second move. White's idea is to fight for the central squares with the f pawn and to reach an aggressive setup on the kingside. Here if black uses the Nc6, d6 and g6 setup, white can also build an aggressive setup from the Grand Prix attack. I play a lot of games in the Grand Prix variation and have had mixed results, mostly in blitz and rapid tournaments. Those positions are double-edged, and in most cases, white obtains the initiative. In my opinion, it's not good for black when white has an easy plan, while black needs to play very precisely in order to get a playable position. Because of that, I will recommend variations that do not allow white to obtain an initiative. I like positions where black sacrifices a pawn for the initiative and an obtains an attack. With his next move, black will take over the initiative and play an active game. In all variations, you will see that black has more than enough compensation. }

4. c4 e6
{ Now as in the mainline black sacrifices a pawn for great play. Now white needs to take the pawn and give black great compensation. In my view, this pawn is not worth so much compared to space and activity. The black position is preferable, and I will always choose black here. }
5. dxe6 Bxe6 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. d3 Nc6
{ A nice picture. Black has all his pieces in play while white struggles to develop his pieces. Black has an enormous initiative and more than enough compensation for this pawn. The best black setup here is: Rfe8, Qd7 or c7, Rad8. Black need to develop the lightsquare bishop on f5 and play two preventive moves h6 and a6 in order to stop white knight from reaching g5 and b5 squares. }
8. Be2 O-O 9. Nc3 Re8 10. O-O h6 11. Re1 Bf5 12. Bd2 a6 13. Bf1 Qd7
{ With more than just compensation for the material. Black dominates the board: all his pieces are better than White's, and White is unable to improve his position. All White's queenside pawns, as well as the one on f4, are potential weaknesses. }

1. e4 c5 2. f4
{ This is the first deviation on the second move. White's idea is to fight for the central squares with the f pawn and to reach an aggressive setup on the kingside. Here if black uses the Nc6, d6 and g6 setup, white can also build an aggressive setup from the Grand Prix attack. I play a lot of games in the Grand Prix variation and have had mixed results, mostly in blitz and rapid tournaments. Those positions are double-edged, and in most cases, white obtains the initiative. In my opinion, it's not good for black when white has an easy plan, while black needs to play very precisely in order to get a playable position. Because of that, I will recommend variations that do not allow white to obtain an initiative. I like positions where black sacrifices a pawn for the initiative and an obtains an attack. With his next move, black will take over the initiative and play an active game. In all variations, you will see that black has more than enough compensation. }

{ This leads to a well-known Sicilian position with b3. White's idea is to get the dark square bishop on the long diagonal a1 - h8 in order to obtain pressure on the black kingside. This dark square bishop is also well placed on this diagonal and controls central squares e5 and d4. The drawback is the fact that white currently can't open the position in the center and black can get a nice position with natural developing moves. White plans are connected to moves like Bb5 and sometimes d3 or even d4 later on. In this closed position, black has enough time to develop all his pieces and obtain a nice position. }
2... Nc6
{ This natural move is played in order to fight for the central squares e5 and d4. This knight is on the best square, and white's plan will be to eliminate it. }
3. Bb2 e6
{ Now white can try a few moves, but black maintains the balance. Now, when white tries to play Bb5, black has that extra option of Nge7 to bring the other knight to the best square c6. On the other hand, with this move black has the plan to play d5 or just d6 to control dark squares in the center  (e5 and d4)  . }
4. Bb5
{ This is white's original idea. In order to get the advantage in the center, he wants to take this great knight on c6. After this, he can set all pawns on light squares with his next move d3 and play for a positional advantage in the pawn structure. }
4... Nge7
{ This is the key move. White can't go back with the light squared bishop because the pawn is on b3 - white can't play Ba4 and Bb3. That's why black now plays this move, and after an exchange on c6, the other knight will get there without breaking the pawn structure and with a great position for the knight from g8. }

7... h5
{ This is a strong positional move. Black needs to place his minor pieces on the kingside on the best squares. With h5 black manages to take over the advantage on all light squares on the kingside. The best setup is to get the knight from g8 to f5 and the light-squared bishop on e4 or on g6 in some lines. }

The drawback of white's play is the fact that now white shows black his plan and with a few natural moves black will have an even better position. This is a very passive move that allows black to seize the initiative and take the lead in the center and get better development. White with this move can't count on an advantage - with this move white will only fight for equality. }
2... Nc6 3. c3 e5
{ White is passive, and slow play allows black to get the advantage in the center and in development. All the black pieces are in better positions than white's, and with his next move, d5 black will get the advantage in space and in the center. Black is better here. }
4. Nf3 Nf6
{ Black just develops the pieces and with natural developing moves gets an advantage. White's play is very passive and black easily gets a better position. }

{ Here white can go for the 5.c4, but you will hardly see that option. After c3 white can still play c4 but this is unlikely. Also, in some similar positions, white can go for the e4 and then c4 setup, but this will immediately equalize the position, because not white or black can improve in the center and white has the d5 square when black has the d4 square for the equality in the center. The position is immediately equal and white doesn't get anything there. }
5... d5
{ With a great position for black. This is not the way white wants to play in the opening. Black is better after only 5 moves. You will not see many players playing like this. The White position is passive, and his pieces are undeveloped. Black is better. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4
{ This is the first deviation on the second move. White's idea is to fight for the central squares with the f pawn and to reach an aggressive setup on the kingside. Here if black uses the Nc6, d6 and g6 setup, white can also build an aggressive setup from the Grand Prix attack. I play a lot of games in the Grand Prix variation and have had mixed results, mostly in blitz and rapid tournaments. Those positions are double-edged, and in most cases, white obtains the initiative. In my opinion, it's not good for black when white has an easy plan, while black needs to play very precisely in order to get a playable position. Because of that, I will recommend variations that do not allow white to obtain an initiative. I like positions where black sacrifices a pawn for the initiative and an obtains an attack. With his next move, black will take over the initiative and play an active game. In all variations, you will see that black has more than enough compensation. }
2... d5
{ A natural move. With 2. f4 White starts some activities on the kingside before he manages to secure his center. Now black strikes immediately in the center and plays for more than equality. In these positions black sacrifices a pawn for the initiative. The position will be very active and black will get more than sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. This is in my view a great situation for black and because of the many resources that black has here not too many white players play this variation today. }

{ This is the only alternative to 6. Nf3 that protects White's pawn on d4. But now this dark square bishop is out of the queenside and black will get an even better initiative there. }
6... Bf5
{ Now Bg4 is not possible but f5 is also a nice position for the light square bishop before black secure his center with e6. It is important to understand that this light square bishop needs to be placed on g4 or f5 before black plays e6. However, e6 is also important as it allows the dark square bishop to be developed. }
7. Nf3 e6
{ Again, the final touch. All black pieces have nice squares and white struggles to finish development. }
8. Bd3
{ The only move that allows white to play on. The alternative 8. Be2 is much worse. }
8... Nge7 9. O-O Rc8 10. axb4 Bxd3 11. Qxd3 Nxb4
{ And again. White doesn't have any targets or plans, and black doesn't have any weaknesses. Black is a clear pawn up. The position is much better for him. }

Because I like to attack and have positions where I have the options to sacrifice pawns and take over the initiative. I do not want to have extra material and give my opponent the initiative. I do not want to take white's pawn and give up all that. I will show you this in the Sveshnikov lines where I analyze black's pawn sacrifices in exchange for the initiative. One important psychological moment is to be noted herein that if white wants to play a gambit that means that he should like open positions and the option is there for you to close the position. }

The problem for black can be a really passive position where white will have clear plan and always some form of attack. }

{ Here we reach an important position similar to the Marozy bind structure. The black plan is easy to understand and play. First black needs to transfer his knight from f6 to c5 via d7 to his perfect place. After this black will have the option to develop his light square bishop and with a6 or a5 black will get a nice position on the queenside. This is the perfect way to play against an aggressive player. }
11. Be3 Nc5 12. Bc2 b5 13. Ncd2 Qc7 14. a3 Rb8
{ Black manages to develop all of his pieces onto nice squares and has a completely equal position. Here you can remember and play one very nice plan. Bd7, Rfc8, a5 with more than enough for black. }

1. e4 c5 2. d4
{ This is the so-called Matulovic gambit. In my view, this is a nice gambit idea. White wants to sacrifice the central pawn for fast development and initiative. Because I like to attack and have positions where I have the options to sacrifice pawns and take over the initiative. I do not want to have extra material and give my opponent the initiative. I do not want to take white's pawn and give up all that. I will show you this in the Sveshnikov lines where I analyze black's pawn sacrifices in exchange for the initiative. One important psychological moment is to be noted herein that if white wants to play a gambit that means that he should like open positions and the option is there for you to close the position. }
2... cxd4 3. c3
{ The second move in White's plan. Now if black takes the pawn, white will have big initiative and in my opinion full compensation for the sacrificed pawn. From my experience  (I play this position with both colors)  I believe that is for black better to avoid main lines. The problem for black can be a really passive position where white will have clear plan and always some form of attack. }
3... d3
{ This is I believe the best way to play against this gambit, a gambit which I consider one of the best gambits in chess theory. Now, black doesn't want to take the extra pawn but instead gives it back and in return gets enough time to develop all his pieces and get a nice position. Also, it is really important to understand that this kind of gambit is used by really aggressive players who want to play for the initiative. Now after d3 there is no way for white to get an aggressive and attacking position. }
4. Bxd3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6
{ Here you need to understand and remember two important things. First, black needs to secure the e5 square with Nc6 and d6, and after that, he plays g6 and develops his dark square bishop on the best diagonal a1 - h8. With this easy plan black will get all his minor pieces on the best squares and equalize. }
6. O-O g6 7. Qe2
{ A similar idea to 7. Re1. This is another white attempt to try to fight for the advantage without the more natural move c4. Black in my view can easily reach equality. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ After 2. Nc3 we get the position from the Closed Sicilian. White can play to get two types of positions. The first one is the Closed Sicilian with g3 and the second option is to play the Grand Prix Attack line with f4. I played all kind of setups against this until 2009, which is when I found in a publication the move a6. The same year I got the chance to test this in a tournament game against the Croatian International Master Biti and found it easy to get a slight edge, even though the game ended in a draw. After this game, I analyzed it even more and concluded that it is a great move. Now, with a6 you do not allow white to play the Grand Prix Attack, and White needs to play the Closed Sicilian, or he can try to play open some lines that I will show you as well. }
2... a6 3. g3 b5
{ This is the setup that most White player's will dread. Black starts immediate action on the queenside and gets really great fighting positions. This is something that you will not get if you will play Nc6 instead of a6 !?. }
4. Bg2 Bb7 5. d3 e6
{ Here we can also see a nice black setup. Black develops his queenside first and opposes white's light-squared bishop on the great diagonal h1 - a8. On the other hand, black has set up a position with great potential on the queenside but also can stake a claim to the center with the idea of d5. Great and easy playable positions for black. }
6. f4 { White's main move, logically seizing some space. He can also try: }
6... d6
{ Black's plan is simple now. First, he wants to secure his center with d6 and then to develop all his minor pieces, the knight on f6 and c6 and the dark-squared bishop on e7. Then black will maintain the balance in the center and potentially have chances on the queenside where he is better because he has more space and better-placed pieces. }
7. Nf3 Nf6 8. O-O Be7 9. h3 Nc6
{ Now black manages to develop all his pieces and white needs to do something fast so as to not to get a worse position on the queenside. The only real white try is to play aggressively on the kingside. }
10. g4
{ This is the only white setup that is fast enough to organize a slight attack on the black kingside. }
10... Nd7
{ Black removes the knight from f6 because this is the place for the dark-squared bishop. On f6 this bishop will be in it's most active position. }
11. Be3 Bf6
{ An important black move. Now black will improve the position of his worst piece and secure the black squares. }
12. Qd2 O-O 13. g5 Bd4 14. h4 e5 15. f5 Bxe3+ 16. Qxe3 Nd4 17. Qd2 f6
{ Black manages to get a blockade on the kingside, after this, he exchanges the dark square bishop. This is important because if black blocks the position with dark square bishops on the board, then the black bishop will be almost like a pawn and white's bishop will dominate the board. Now black needs to be careful and not to allow white an attack on his king, but in the long run black has the better chances because of the potentially better knight versus bishop, more space and play on the queenside. }

2... a6 3. f4
{ This is the move that white wants to play in the Grand Prix attack. It is not so good here because Black has played a6 and now white cannot get the bishop to b5 or c4. }
3... b5
{ Black does not allow white to play the Grand Prix Attack and also gets some space on the queenside. Black also prepares the b7 square for the light-squared bishop. This is an important setup for black in these positions. }
4. Nf3 Bb7
{ After b5, the next step is to develop the light-squared bishop and put some pressure on the e4 square because Black wants to push b4 and maybe get the pawn on e4. }
5. d3
{ Now you can see that white needs to play the position without the light-squared bishop on b5 or c4. He will need to develop it to e2 or g2, much more passive squares. }
5... e6
{ And now this extra flexible move. Black does not show white what his idea is. Black can now play d6 or even d5. }
6. Be2 d5
{ White plays passive and now black immediately gets play in the center. Black easily equalizes. }
7. O-O d4 8. Nb1 Nc6 9. a4
{ White's idea is to open the position up on the queen side. This is not the best idea, because there is a rule in chess that says that you need to play on the side where you are stronger and avoid to play or open the position on the side where you are worse. White needs to play on the king side where he is better, not on the queen side where black has the better position. }

{ This is the only real try in view of all the play on the queen side. Now white wants to open the position on the queen side. }
13... dxc3 14. bxc3 c4
{ This is the key move. Black is better on the queen side and with this move he gets the advantage. All of the black pieces will have nice roles on the queen side. This also wins a tempo because the white knight on a3 is hanging now. }
15. Nc2 Be7 16. Be3 O-O
{ Black developed all of his pieces and white helped him by opening the position on the queen side. Black is slightly better because the white advantage on the king side means nothing. There white is better but now he needs to play on the queen side where black is better. In my view, black is a little bit better. }

Black manages to stop white from getting any kind of advantage in the center. One small advantage for white is, for now, the slightly exposed black square on d5. But this is only temporary and in next few moves, I will show you how to equalize completely. }

In this manner, White will have at least compensation for the pawn.

{ This is the Alapin variation in the Sicilian defense. The idea of this move is to build a strong center. White does not want to play d4 and allow black to exchange his c-pawn for white's d-pawn. After this move white will play d4 and try to build a strong center with e4 and d4, if black allows this. }
2... d5
{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw. You will see later on that this is a great variation and in my view, black completely equalizes the game. }

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation in the Sicilian defense. The idea of this move is to build a strong center. White does not want to play d4 and allow black to exchange his c-pawn for white's d-pawn. After this move white will play d4 and try to build a strong center with e4 and d4, if black allows this. }
2... d5
{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw.

{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw.

It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw.

3. exd5 { This is now forced. } 3... Qxd5 4. d4 Nc6
{ This is the real start of the variation. Black exerts pressure against white's d4 pawn and white needs to decide what he wants to do. He has two possible ideas. The first idea is to defend this pawn and the second is to take black's pawn on c5. Now you can see that black has better development and is first to start the attack on white's center. }
5. dxc5
{ This is an alternative to 5. Nf3. With this move, white wants to take the pawn on c5 and later try to defend his extra pawn. }
5... Qxd1+ 6. Kxd1 e5
{ The position on the board is unclear but with compensation for black. For white's extra pawn on c5, black has a better position in the center and also an attack on this c5 pawn. In the next two lines, I will show you how to play against this white setup. }
7. b4 a5
{ A very important move. White wants to secure his extra pawn, and black needs to play actively to return this pawn or get serious initiative. }
8. Bb5
{ White needs to defend the pawn on b4. a3 is impossible because black can take on b4 two times. }
8... Bd7 9. Nf3 f6 10. Bd2
{ This is the move that white plays to secure his pawns on the queenside. The drawback is the fact that now the d2 square is not free for the knight on b1. }
10... Nge7
{ This is an important black move. Potentially black can jump with this knight to d5 and exert a lot of pressure on white's position. }
11. Bc4
{ Here white's idea is to not allow black's move d5, but now this bishop doesn't pin the black knight on c6 anymore, and with this move, white loses tempi. }
11... axb4 12. cxb4 e4
{ This is the key move. Now, black can't destroy white's queenside, but he can break in the center and get the initiative. }
13. Ne1 Ne5 14. Bb3 Ng4
{ Now you can see how many tempi black gets here. White has to watch how black plays and defend himself move after move. Black has an extremely nice initiative for the sacrificed pawn. }

{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw. You will see later on that this is a great variation and in my view, black completely equalizes the game. }

The first idea is to defend this pawn and the second is to take black's pawn on c5. Now you can see that black has better development and is first to start the attack on white's center. }

Black does not want to secure his position and play solidly with e6 because then his bishop will stay on c8 for a long time and white will have a slight advantage. With this move, black wants to get as much pressure against white's d4 pawn as possible. The position that will arise next will be about equal. White will have slightly more active pieces but also an isolated and potentially weak pawn on d4. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation in the Sicilian defense. The idea of this move is to build a strong center. White does not want to play d4 and allow black to exchange his c-pawn for white's d-pawn. After this move white will play d4 and try to build a strong center with e4 and d4, if black allows this. }
2... d5
{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw. You will see later on that this is a great variation and in my view, black completely equalizes the game. }
3. exd5 { This is now forced. } 3... Qxd5 4. d4 Nc6
{ This is the real start of the variation. Black exerts pressure against white's d4 pawn and white needs to decide what he wants to do. He has two possible ideas. The first idea is to defend this pawn and the second is to take black's pawn on c5. Now you can see that black has better development and is first to start the attack on white's center. }
5. Nf3
{ A natural move. White develops the knight and defends the pawn on d4. } 5...
Bg4
{ An important moment in this variation. Black does not want to secure his position and play solidly with e6 because then his bishop will stay on c8 for a long time and white will have a slight advantage. With this move, black wants to get as much pressure against white's d4 pawn as possible. The position that will arise next will be about equal. White will have slightly more active pieces but also an isolated and potentially weak pawn on d4. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation in the Sicilian defense. The idea of this move is to build a strong center. White does not want to play d4 and allow black to exchange his c-pawn for white's d-pawn. After this move white will play d4 and try to build a strong center with e4 and d4, if black allows this. }
2... d5
{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw. You will see later on that this is a great variation and in my view, black completely equalizes the game. }
3. exd5 { This is now forced. } 3... Qxd5 4. d4 Nc6
{ This is the real start of the variation. Black exerts pressure against white's d4 pawn and white needs to decide what he wants to do. He has two possible ideas. The first idea is to defend this pawn and the second is to take black's pawn on c5. Now you can see that black has better development and is first to start the attack on white's center. }
5. Nf3
{ A natural move. White develops the knight and defends the pawn on d4. } 5...
Bg4
{ An important moment in this variation. Black does not want to secure his position and play solidly with e6 because then his bishop will stay on c8 for a long time and white will have a slight advantage. With this move, black wants to get as much pressure against white's d4 pawn as possible. The position that will arise next will be about equal. White will have slightly more active pieces but also an isolated and potentially weak pawn on d4. }
6. Be2 cxd4 7. cxd4 e6 8. h3
{ An important move. White can play without this move, but it is better to play it because potentially later white has an extra option of playing g4 at the right moment. }
8... Bh5 9. Nc3 Qa5 10. O-O Nf6 11. Be3
{ The most natural move. White develops the last piece and now can start to play the middlegame. }
11... Bd6 12. Qb3
{ This is the move that white uses to attack black's pawn on b7. Now to do this the right way, he needs to have the pawn on a3 because if the pawn is not on a3, then black can easily play Qb4 and as we mentioned before almost every endgame there is slightly better for black  (better pawn structure)  . }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ This is the Alapin variation in the Sicilian defense. The idea of this move is to build a strong center. White does not want to play d4 and allow black to exchange his c-pawn for white's d-pawn. After this move white will play d4 and try to build a strong center with e4 and d4, if black allows this. }
2... d5
{ A natural and strong reply from black. His main alternative to d5 is Nf6 which is also very popular. Nevertheless, I like d5 more. Black's idea is to destroy white's dream of making a strong center, because now he is forced to exchange the e4 pawn for black's d5 pawn. It is important to also understand that white already has played c3 and now after taking on d5, following black's reply Qd5, white cannot play Nc3. The slight drawback from black's perspective is that his Queen on d5 will be slightly exposed, but with accurate play, black will at least maintain equality. I started working on this variation more than 10 years ago. In this line, I have even obtained great positions against very strong opposition, e.g., in the Croatian Cup 2008 versus GM Dusko Pavasovic. I was better but the game ended in a draw. You will see later on that this is a great variation and in my view, black completely equalizes the game. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6
{ This is the only move that leads to the Sveshnikov Sicilian. It is important to understand that since white can play 3. Bb5, a move that cant be played if black had played e6. This is not a disaster, but you need to know that this move order gives white this opportunity. In one of the following chapters, I will show you how to play against that. Also, 3. c3 is the Alapin variation where I will also cover the line using this move order Nc6. In the Sicilian you need to be prepared for all possible scenarios and move orders. }
3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. The Sveshnikov is a unique opening where black plays aggressively and wants to fight for the initiative right from the start. This gives him enough time for quick development and a safe position for the king. But, by playing e5 black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and potentially a weak square on d5. This is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality, with this opening you can play for initiative right from the start ! Today this is the opening choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik plays it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only the forced lines but also the very complex strategy that is behind it. Let start first with the unusual 6th moves by white. }
6. Nb3
{ This is also a move that does not give white any kind of advantage. It is not natural because white once again does not do anything to fight for the d5 square. White's knight is misplaced on b3 as it would be on f3, e2 or f5. }
6... Bb4
{ Once again the same idea as 6. Nf3. Black immediately fights for the d5 square and takes aim at the pawn on e4. Also after taking on c3, white's pawn structure on the queenside will be broken. }
7. Bd3
{ This is very similar to the previous line. There is no big difference if the white knight is on f3 or b3. Both squares are no good ! This alternative is bad. White loses control over the d5 square and black gets the initiative and the better position. This is why the Sveshnikov is a good opening. You can fight for the advantage as soon as move 7! }
7... d5
{ Once again a typical blow in the center. Black takes control in the center and gets the initiative. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6
{ This is the only move that leads to the Sveshnikov Sicilian. It is important to understand that since white can play 3. Bb5, a move that cant be played if black had played e6. This is not a disaster, but you need to know that this move order gives white this opportunity. In one of the following chapters, I will show you how to play against that. Also, 3. c3 is the Alapin variation where I will also cover the line using this move order Nc6. In the Sicilian you need to be prepared for all possible scenarios and move orders. }
3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. The Sveshnikov is a unique opening where black plays aggressively and wants to fight for the initiative right from the start. This gives him enough time for quick development and a safe position for the king. But, by playing e5 black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and potentially a weak square on d5. This is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality, with this opening you can play for initiative right from the start ! Today this is the opening choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik plays it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only the forced lines but also the very complex strategy that is behind it. Let start first with the unusual 6th moves by white. }
6. Nf5
{ On first sight it looks like this is a nice move, because compared to all other 6th white moves, beside Ndb5, this move somehow attacks the d6 square. But the knight on f5 is more exposed than on b5, and this gives black an easy breakthrough in the center and nice play. }
6... d5
{ An instant breakthrough with the thematic d5 ! Now the white knight on f5 is attacked by black's light-squared bishop on c8. }
7. exd5 Bxf5 8. dxc6 bxc6 9. Qf3 Qd7
{ Here black needs to be precise. It is important to know that here you need to play Qd7.Qc8 will allow white 10. Ba6 with a nice tempo gaining move and slight initiative. }
10. Bg5 e4 11. Qe2
{ Nice and precise move. The alternative 11. Qg3 is no good. } 11... Be7 12.
Rd1 Qe6 13. Qc4 Rb8 14. Qxe6 fxe6 15. Bc1
{ White needs to defend his position first, his pawn on b2. } 15... Nd5 16. Bc4
e3
{ Great move. Black pushes the e pawn to attack the c2 pawn, break white's pawn structure and the bishop on c1 will now not get to play for quite some time. }
17. fxe3 Bxc2 18. Rd2 Bg6
{ Black is better. White's pieces are in the wrong places, and black is superior. White will have a hard time to fight for equality. }

6. Nxc6
{ This is the last of white's alternative to 6. Ndb5. This is a completely illogical move. Now white instead of controlling the d5 square and somehow putting pressure on d6, will allow black to get the better chances in the center. After bxc6 black gets a clear advantage in the center and a much better pawn structure. }
6... bxc6 7. Bc4 d6 8. O-O Be7 9. Qd3 O-O 10. h3 Be6
{ Now when black develops all of his pieces and gets the king castled he has the upper hand for play in the center. The half-open b file and the potential of d5 gives him better chances and a preferable position. }

6. Nf3
{ This is one of four main alternatives to 5. Ndb5. This move does not give white any kind of advantage. Here and in other moves black has a strong reply, Bb4. With 5. Nf3 white is not doing anything to control the squares d4 and d5, and allows black to play for the advantage. }
6... Bb4
{ A strong reply. Now black pins this knight on c3 and fights for the d5 square. In some lines, Black can double White's c pawns which could become very weak. Also after taking on c3, the d5 square will be in black's control, and the possible breakthrough d5 is strong. }
7. Bd3
{ This alternative is worse. White loses control over the d5 square, and black gets the initiative and the better position. This is why the Sveshnikov is a good opening. You can fight for the advantage as soon as on move 7. }
7... Bxc3+ { Now black doubles white's pawns on the c file. } 8. bxc3 O-O 9.
O-O d6 10. Bg5 h6
{ Black is better. The better pawn structure and control over the d5 square give him a small but stable edge. An easy plan for black is Be6, Rc8, Qa5, and Rfd8. All of black's pieces will be in play, and the weak white pawns on the c file will fall. In this position, white will struggle to make a draw. }

White is without a plan and black's play is very easy. One possible idea is Rac8, Na5, Bc4 and so on. Black is better. }

7. Nd5
{ The Mainline for white is 7. Bg5. Here I will show you three main alternatives. The first one is 7. Nd5. This is the move where white tries to get out of the many possibilities in the main line. With this move as in the other two options, I believe that white cannot manage to get an advantage out of the opening. Nevertheless here White has an easy plan. He wants to get a small space advantage on the queenside and the upper hand for play there. The problem for White is that this takes too much time and allows Black to counterattack him on the kingside. Also, this move allows black an exchange, after which there is no more potential pawn weakness on d6. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ I give that move the examine mark not because it is a good move, but because I believe it is superior to alternative Ne7. The knight belongs on the d7 square and maybe on f6. From those squares, he will protect the c5 and e5 squares and potentially support a pawn storm on the kingside. If black moves the knight to e7 it will be hard to improve his position, and from e7 he does not defend or support any square or piece. }
9. c4
{ The second move of the white plan. He tries to get space and a potential break on the queenside. Now after a6, his knight can retreat to c3 when the pawn is already on c4, and he does not lose time for it. }
9... Be7 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O a6 12. Nc3 f5
{ Here black kicks away white's knight from b5 starts advancing with the pawns in the center and the kingside. The e5 and f5 pawns are much better than all of white's pawns on the queenside. }
13. f4
{ This is the last stage of the white plan with Be2. Now when white gets the bishop on e2 in this position, he wants to play f4 and then if black play e4 his bishop will not be under attack. But this is the only white idea. Remember that here black does not want to play e4. e4 looks like a great move, black has a protected passed pawn on e4, but white has a nice grip on the position and gets the blocking square e3 for his pieces. Also, white's pawns on f4 and d5 control too many vital squares in the center. What black wants to do here is to develop all his pieces and at the right moment take the pawn on f4. }
13... Nd7
{ As we mentioned before, the knight is perfectly placed on d7. He slows down white's possible breaks on the queenside with c5, and after a later exchange on f4 this knight will come to the great e5 square. }
14. Kh1 { White removes the king from the possible threat Qb6. } 14... Bf6 15.
Be3 exf4
{ Now when black develops all of his pieces onto the best squares, he can take on f4 and then will try to take the advantage over the dark squares in the center. }
16. Bxf4 Ne5 17. Rc1 Bd7 18. b4 a5 19. a3 axb4 20. axb4 Qb6
{ A nice picture after only 20 moves. You can see how the black idea was the better one. All of black's pieces are better placed than whites and white needs to protect his queenside pawns instead of trying to attack black with them. Black's knight on e5 is a monster, and together with both active bishops controlling the hole in the position, Black has the initiative and stands better. }

10... O-O 11. O-O a6 12. Nc3 f5 13. f4
{ Now this move doesn't make sense because if the light-squared bishop is on d3 then black can play e4 with tempi and get a great passed pawn in the center, whenever he wants to do that. If white wants to play f4 then his light-squared bishop needs to be on e2. Also if the white light-squared bishop is on d3 then Ne5 or Nc5 are also very nice ideas for black. }
13... Nd7
{ For now there is no need to hurry up with e4. This is always in the air and white needs to be careful. }
14. Kh1 g6 15. Be3 Bf6
{ And again black's setup is as in the line before. A great grip on the center, a possible e-pawn advance and great outposts for black's knight on e5 and c5 give him the advantage. It is much easier to play with black than with white who need to be very careful not to get into serious problems with every move that he makes. }

Remember that in this scenario black needs to exchange it. }
14. Bxg5 Qxg5 15. Qe2 Nd7 16. Rad1 Qf6
{ An important move. Black's idea is around the dark squares when he exchanges the dark square bishop. First Qf6 secures the pawn on d6, and then black will play b6 and a5 to neutralize white's play on the queenside. After that black has the better pawn structure in the center and some initiative on the kingside. }

exd5 Nb8 9. Qf3
{ This is a tricky idea ! Here white plays for some tactics. White wants to attack the c7 or a7 squares. One idea is to move the queen to c3 and the other is to move the queen to a3 in order to not allow white the capture of the knight on b5. This plan can get white an advantage only if black doesn't know how to defend against it. }
9... a6 10. Qa3 b6
{ I give this move an exclam because I think this is an easy way of handling the position. After this move black doesn't have any kind of problems with white's tricks. The next move will be Bb7 and the white knight will need to go back. }
11. Bg5
{ If white chooses anything else, with the next move Bb7, black will get this knight out of b5 and develop all of his other pieces. }
11... f6 12. Bd2 Bb7 13. Nc3 Be7
{ Black slowly improves his position. White makes some odd moves like Qf3 and Qa3, and loses a few tempi, and gives black enough time to develop all of his pieces. White doesn't have anything to play against. The black position is at least equal. With the next moves O-O and Nbd7, all black pieces will be in the game when white will face some problems. I prefer black here. This is only a line playing for tricks, which gives white nothing. }

{ This is a more solid move than the tricky 9. Qf3. With this move, white wants to make a favourable pawn structure on the queenside. a4 prevents black from playing a6 and the b5 idea.

Now he is first to execute a concrete plan, in view of f5. Black strikes immediately in the center and tries to develop an initiative. }
12. f4
{ The only real move for white that can give him equality. Here white needs to be careful. Other moves like c3 are not enough for equality. White needs to play active and get counter play in the center. After any passive moves, black will get an initiative and better chances. }

12. Bd2
{ Before we go any further, I would like to say a few words about this position in general and the plans for both players. This is a strategically very complex position where both players have to work in offense and on defense. Now, white has the more space in the center and on the queenside and there he wants to play, but also has to be careful on the kingside not to get under the big pressure from black. So, he likes to go for the moves like a4-a5 and then b4, c4 -c5 and on the kingside after black move f5, he likes to go for the f4 to stop the further black advance. Black for that time wants to play on the kingside with the f5-f4 move and start an attack there. On the other side, he has to be careful on the queenside and not allow white a4 - a5. }

Nevertheless, I believe that the best way how black can play this position is just not to allow white the a4 - a5 with the idea to reroute the knight to c4 square later on.

16... Bb7 17. Be3 Rc8
{ White and black for now develop all the pieces and work in the offense and defense. The game is very sharp and now white will try to do something on the queenside and black on the kingside. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is starting position of Svesnikov. Black play aggressive and want to fight for the initiative right from the start. This idea gives him enough time for quick development and safe position on the king. But, playing e5 black accept backward pawn on d6 and potentially weak square on d5. This opening is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality, with this opening you can play for initiative right from the start. Today this is the opening choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik play it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only forced lines but also a very complex strategy that is behind it. }
6. Ndb5
{ This is the white positional approach. With this move, white want to force black to play d6 without time to develop dark square bishop and that to occupy a weak square on d5. Alternative to this move I will explain in one of the next chapters. Black have here few very nice ideas that will give him great positions. }
6... d6 7. Bg5
{ This is the second part of white's idea. After taking the knight on f6, the square on d5 will be even weaker. The drawback is in the fact that black will have the two bishops and great activity. }
7... a6
{ Black needs to bring back this knight to a3 and after that seize the initiative and space on the queenside with b5. }
8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5
{ This is one of two main lines or positions in Sveshnikov Sicilian. White now takes over control over the d5 square. In return, black gets the bishop pair and a lot of activity. 9. Nd5 is a more positional line where white will not double Black's f pawns. Because of this, the position will be much more closed, and there will be plenty of time for improving the positions of pieces and pawns. Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }
9... Be7 10. Bxf6 { With the capture on f6 white gets control of d5. } 10...
Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5 12. h4
{ This move is possible here but somehow not the best option for white. With h4 white attacks the bishop on g5 and gets a tempo but in the long run, this will be a weakness. Now, white with 11.c3 wants to play on the queen side with a4 at some point, as in lines with 12.g3 or Be2, and then his king needs to castle on the king side. This move 12.h4 will potentially expose his king later on. }
12... Bh6 13. g3
{ There is now nothing better than g3 or Bg2 to defend the king side. White cant play this position without g3 because his king can't castle when the pawn on h4 is hanging, attacked by the black queen on d8. }
13... O-O 14. Bg2 Rb8
{ And black gets a nice and equal position. He developed all of his pieces and castled on the king side, while white didn't make any progress in the center or on the queen side. }

Because of this, the position will be much more closed, and there will be plenty of time for improving the positions of pieces and pawns. Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }

Black can with concrete play, and the idea of securing the d5 square, reach a very promising position. I believe that black is slightly better because of the potential of the center pawns. This is not a line that you will see too often. }

Black's idea is to bring the dark-squared bishop onto the best diagonal c1 - h6, play Qc5 via a5 when possible, and get the knight on d4 or even c5 via b8 and d7. If you want to get the rook onto the c file, then you will have to use the a7 square for that idea, because in most lines white will play Bh3 and the c8 square will be not available for it. In these positions black is at least equal. }

{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Black plays aggressively and wants to fight for the initiative right from the start. This gives him enough time for quick development and a safe position for the king. But by playing e5 black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and a potentially weak square on d5. This is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality and instead can play for initiative right from the start. Today this is the opening of choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik plays it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only the forced lines but also the often complex strategy that is behind the ideas. }

8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5
{ This is one of two main lines or positions in Sveshnikov Sicilian. White now takes over control over the d5 square. In return, black gets the bishop pair and a lot of activity. 9. Nd5 is a more positional line where white will not double Black's f pawns. Because of this, the position will be much more closed, and there will be plenty of time for improving the positions of pieces and pawns. Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }

12. Nc2 O-O
{ There is no need to rush with a5 because white cannot take on b4 for now. This is one of the most positional ideas that white can try against the Sveshnikov. The position will now be closed, and it is important to understand the ideas. Black's idea is to bring the dark-squared bishop onto the best diagonal c1 - h6, play Qc5 via a5 when possible, and get the knight on d4 or even c5 via b8 and d7. If you want to get the rook onto the c file, then you will have to use the a7 square for that idea, because in most lines white will play Bh3 and the c8 square will be not available for it. In these positions black is at least equal. }

{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. g3
{ This is white's attempt to get the bishop on g2, and develop this way. I am not so sure about the purpose of the light-squared bishop there. The only real play white can try to get is on the queenside against the pawns on a6 and b5. If the light-squared bishop is on the f1 - a6 diagonal, then it exerts a lot of pressure against them. If you place this light-squared bishop on g2, then there is no chance for it to exert pressure against those pawns. With the next move Rb8 and a5, black takes over control the queenside, as I will show you next. }
12... Rb8 13. Nc2 a5
{ Now black takes over the initiative on the queenside. White's passive play allows Black to do this. Black's position is preferable in the long run. }

{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns.

Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. g3
{ As I mentioned before, every move other than 13. a4 is not in the spirit of this position. White's only real chance is active play on the queenside. Here the bishop will go on the bad g2 square and without a4 white does not have any real active play. In the long run, if black gets time to open the position he can easily be better with the strong bishop pair. }

{ Black develops all of his pieces, easily secures the d6 pawn and also the d5 square, because now a white knight cannot get there. Also if you look at this position, you can see that white does not get any chance of active play. Now the play on the queenside is in black's control, and the d6 pawn is very easily defensible. The position is about equal, but it is much easier to play with black. }

Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8. Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. g3
{ As I mentioned before, every move other than 13. a4 is not in the spirit of this position. White's only real chance is active play on the queenside. Here the bishop will go on the bad g2 square and without a4 white does not have any real active play. In the long run, if black gets time to open the position he can easily be better with the strong bishop pair. }
13... O-O 14. Bg2 a5
{ Now black takes over the initiative on the queenside. White's passive play allows him that. }
15. a3
{ I give this move a dubious mark I think it's wrong. White's major idea is to fight for an advantage on the queenside, and not to defend his position on the queenside ! Now black has the upper hand to play where he likes. }
15... Ne7 { A classic move for black. Exchange the only active white piece. }
16. Nxe7+ Qxe7 17. O-O Be6
{ The position is close to equal, but I believe that black's position is slightly better. White does not achieve anything, and black gets the bishop pair and a lot of activity. }

{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Black plays aggressively and wants to fight for the initiative right from the start. This gives him enough time for quick development and a safe position for the king. But by playing e5 black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and a potentially weak square on d5. This is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality and instead can play for initiative right from the start. Today this is the opening of choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik plays it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only the forced lines but also the often complex strategy that is behind the ideas. }
6. Ndb5
{ This is white's positional approach. With this move, white wants to force black to play d6 without time to develop the dark-squared bishop and then he can occupy the weak square on d5. Alternatives will be explained in the other chapters. Black has a few nice ideas here that will give him great positions. }

{ Black needs to bring back this knight to a3 and after that seize the initiative and space on the queenside with b5. }
8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5
{ This is one of two main lines or positions in Sveshnikov Sicilian. White now takes over control over the d5 square. In return, black gets the bishop pair and a lot of activity. 9. Nd5 is a more positional line where white will not double Black's f pawns. Because of this, the position will be much more closed, and there will be plenty of time for improving the positions of pieces and pawns. Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }
9... Be7 10. Bxf6 { With the capture on f6 white gets control over d5. } 10...
Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns. Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8.

15... Ne7 { A classic move for black. Exchange the only active white piece. }
16. Nce3 Bxe3 { Again as before, a strong positional move. } 17. Nxe3 b4 18.
axb4 axb4 19. O-O Be6 20. Qd3 bxc3 21. bxc3 Qc7
{ This position is equal, but black manages to secure the d5 square and the pawn on d6. Now both pawns, the white one on c3 and the black one on d6 are weak. The side who manages to attack the pawn first will get the initiative. Because of the passive white light-squared bishop, black has more of a chance to do that. }

13. Bd3
{ I'm sure you heard about how playing according to a bad plan is better than to play without any plan. 13. Bd3 is a good looking developing move that does not do anything. It is the same for now to have the bishop on f1 or d3. He needs to attack those black pawns on a6 and b5. Now after this move black will have time to play the strong move a5 and take over control of the queenside. }
13... Bd7 14. O-O Ne7 15. Nxe7 Qxe7 16. Nb4 a5 17. Nd5 Qd8 18. Qe2 O-O
{ Here we have a position with the typical piece arrangement and pawn structure for this variation. It is in black's favor. Now, objectively the position is close to equal, but let's try to see the potential for both sides. Black's only weakness is the pawn on d6, but white has such badly placed pieces to play against it that it is hard to believe that he can even get a chance to attack it. The knight on d5 and bishop on d3 are on the way of the rooks and the queen on the d file. Let's see black's pluses, the bishop pair, and nicely placed pieces. Black has the potential of playing on the queenside with b4, and the kingside with Kh8, g6, f5. The White knight is a great looking piece, but black can easily play around it. }

Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns. Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8. Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. Be2 a5
{ White loses tempi and does not play a4, so black can play a5 and take over control of the queenside. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5
{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Black plays aggressively and wants to fight for the initiative right from the start. This gives him enough time for quick development and a safe position for the king. But by playing e5 black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and a potentially weak square on d5. This is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality and instead can play for initiative right from the start. Today this is the opening of choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik plays it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only the forced lines but also the often complex strategy that is behind the ideas. }
6. Ndb5
{ This is white's positional approach. With this move, white wants to force black to play d6 without time to develop the dark-squared bishop and then he can occupy the weak square on d5. Alternatives will be explained in the other chapters. Black has a few nice ideas here that will give him great positions. }

{ Black needs to bring back this knight to a3 and after that seize the initiative and space on the queenside with b5. }
8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5
{ This is one of two main lines or positions in Sveshnikov Sicilian. White now takes over control over the d5 square. In return, black gets the bishop pair and a lot of activity. 9. Nd5 is a more positional line where white will not double Black's f pawns. Because of this, the position will be much more closed, and there will be plenty of time for improving the positions of pieces and pawns. Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }

Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black.

13. a3
{ This is the possibility that I left for the end of this line. Now if you have been paying attention carefully you will know that this is the worst possible white move. White is better on the queenside only for a moment and a4 is the only move. a3 is a move without any purpose. Black once again can easily take over control of the queenside. }
13... a5
{ With only a transposition to the lines before. Black's position is preferable here. }

Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }

Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }

Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }

Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. a4
{ The only move that gives white some chance for play. White has a secure center and a great knight on d5 but if you look a little bit more carefully you will see that this knight does not do anything special and because of him white cannot attack the weak pawn on d6. Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }

9... Be7 10. Bxf6 { With the capture on f6 white gets control over d5. } 10...
Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns. Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8. Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. a4
{ The only move that gives white some chance for play. White has a secure center and a great knight on d5 but if you look a little bit more carefully you will see that this knight does not do anything special and because of him white cannot attack the weak pawn on d6. Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }
13... bxa4
{ Now black cannot hold on b5 and needs to take on a4. Now it is also clear why the black rook is nicely placed on the b file because the pawn on b2 is hanging. }
14. Ncb4 Bd7

15. Bxa6 Nxb4
{ A second important move which exchanges one minor piece and allows the bishop to defend the pawn on a4. }
16. Nxb4 Qa5
{ And here is the next important move to remember. Now you can see what I was talking about. Here black needs to play accurately to maintain an equal position. }
17. Bd3
{ This once again allows the exchange sacrifice and a better position for black as 17. Qe2. }
17... Rxb4 18. cxb4 Qxb4+ 19. Ke2 d5 20. Qc2 dxe4 21. Bxe4 O-O 22. Rhd1 Rc8
{ This is a better scenario where the white king is on e2, and now black has an almost winning situation. The plan is very simple with the next move, Bb5, get the king on f3 and then start chasing him with moves like Qb3. The position is almost winning for black. }

Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }

13. a4
{ The only move that gives white some chance for play. White has a secure center and a great knight on d5 but if you look a little bit more carefully you will see that this knight does not do anything special and because of him white cannot attack the weak pawn on d6. Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }

Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns. Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8. Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. a4
{ The only move that gives white some chance for play. White has a secure center and a great knight on d5 but if you look a little bit more carefully you will see that this knight does not do anything special and because of him white cannot attack the weak pawn on d6. Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }

Now, it is important to understand that the white knight on d5 is not superior to the black dark-squared bishop because the pawns are on both wings and black has a great passed a pawn. Only black can play here for a win because the white c pawn under control. }

9... Be7 10. Bxf6 { With the capture on f6 white gets control over d5. } 10...
Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns. Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8. Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. a4
{ The only move that gives white some chance for play. White has a secure center and a great knight on d5 but if you look a little bit more carefully you will see that this knight does not do anything special and because of him white cannot attack the weak pawn on d6. Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }
13... bxa4
{ Now black cannot hold on b5 and needs to take on a4. Now it is also clear why the black rook is nicely placed on the b file because the pawn on b2 is hanging. }

15. Bxa6 Nxb4
{ A second important move which exchanges one minor piece and allows the bishop to defend the pawn on a4. }
16. Nxb4 Qa5
{ And here is the next important move to remember. Now you can see what I was talking about. Here black needs to play accurately to maintain an equal position. }
17. Qxd6

17... Rb6 18. Qd3 Be7 19. Nd5 Rxb2 20. O-O Qc5
{ Another strong thematic move that you need to remember. The queen on c5 controls the dark squares that the white knight on d5 attacks, and also attacks the weak pawn on c3. It also supports black's potential break with a3. Great positional move ! }
21. Rad1
{ This is a nice alternative to 21. Rb1. It leads to an equal position. } 21...
Bc6 22. Nc7+ Kf8 23. Bc4 g6
{ An important move to secure the square for the king on g7. } 24. Na6 Qa7 25.
Nb4 Qc7 26. Nd5 Bxd5 27. Qxd5 Bc5
{ And the position is equal. Black has a passed pawn on the a file, but white has a small lead in development. Also, we have opposite colored bishops. All in all, the position is about equal. }

7... a6
{ Black needs to bring back this knight to a3 and after that seize the initiative and space on the queenside with b5. }
8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5
{ This is one of two main lines or positions in Sveshnikov Sicilian. White now takes over control over the d5 square. In return, black gets the bishop pair and a lot of activity. 9. Nd5 is a more positional line where white will not double Black's f pawns. Because of this, the position will be much more closed, and there will be plenty of time for improving the positions of pieces and pawns. Mainly white will try to play on the queenside and try to take advantage of the potentially exposed pawns on a6 and b5. Black will have a very solid pawn structure on the kingside and the bishop pair. This will be enough for equality. The positions that arise after this move are very rich and playable for both sides. Once again you can see how simply you can play with the Sveshnikov. The positions you get will be equal but far from a draw ! }
9... Be7 10. Bxf6 { With the capture on f6 white gets control over d5. } 10...
Bxf6 11. c3
{ After this move, it is clear what white wants. First, he wants to secure the d5 square, then to transfer his worst piece, the knight on a3 to the more active square on c2, and then e3 or even b4. Only then he wants to start activity on the queenside. This is a much more solid way to play than the illogical 10. Ne7. It is important to remember something White now has a great looking knight on d5. This knight is strong on d5, and you need to be careful, especially so when you try to exchange it. Now there are two possible ways to exchange it, one for the knight and the second for the light-squared bishop. In most of the situations, you want to exchange it for the knight on c6 because if you look at the position, this knight is black's worst piece on the board. Nc6 cannot jump to any vital square and also if you can exchange it and keep the bishop pair it will be perfect for black. Also, I want to tell you a secret, the white knight on d5 is a great piece but does not do anything in the attack for now, and black can easily play around this knight as I will show you in the next lines. The pawn structure in the center is for the time being slightly better for white, but the weak d6 pawn is hard to get at because the white knight on d5 protects it and on the d file white does not have the possibility to attack it. So you do not need to be afraid of losing it. If white tries to do it, you can easily protect the pawn with Be7. Also when one day you exchange the knight on d5, and white takes back with the e4 pawn, black will have a perfect pawn structure. }
11... Bg5
{ Black has here a few promising lines, but I will recommend this one. As I mentioned in the previous move, white's idea is to play on the queenside but only after he stabilizes the position in the center. Because of this, black has to first get his bishop on the most active square possible, and then decide what he wants to do next. I like the bishop pair and here with Bg5 black's bishop will stay alive. I think that there is no need to rush with castles because the black king is safe in the center, and when he needs to he can castle in just one move. Another great thing about this move is that now the bishop controls the e3 square, where white was planning to place his knight from a3 via c2. }
12. Nc2 Rb8
{ After 12. Nc2 white prepares himself for activity on the queenside. The next white move will be a4, with an attack on black's queenside pawns. Now black has a few options, but I will recommend the one with Rb8. Black supports his pawn on b5, moves the rook from the a file and after the exchange on a4, the rook may be able to take the vital pawn on b2. }
13. a4
{ The only move that gives white some chance for play. White has a secure center and a great knight on d5 but if you look a little bit more carefully you will see that this knight does not do anything special and because of him white cannot attack the weak pawn on d6. Also, the position will open up, and then black bishop pair can play a big role. So, white needs to open lines on the queenside because this is the only play that he has. One more thing that I believe is important here, is the move order. You see that position in the center is closed, and the black king stays in the center without any possibility for white to attack him. Because of this white also needs to wait before castling and first needs to improve the position on the queenside. If white does not move this pawn to a4 now, he will never be able to do it later. }
13... bxa4
{ Now black cannot hold on b5 and needs to take on a4. Now it is also clear why the black rook is nicely placed on the b file because the pawn on b2 is hanging. }
14. Ncb4 Bd7
{ Here you need to remember a few precise moves. Bd7 is one of them. You need to defend Nc6 and control the c6 square. }
15. Bxa6 Nxb4
{ A second important move which exchanges one minor piece and allows the bishop to defend the pawn on a4. }
16. Nxb4 Qa5
{ And here is the next important move to remember. Now you can see what I was talking about. Here black needs to play accurately to maintain an equal position. }
17. Qxd6
{ This is the best and the only move that gives white equality. All other options are better for black. Let's look at them. }
17... Rb6 18. Qd3 Be7 19. Nd5 Rxb2 20. O-O Qc5
{ Another strong thematic move that you need to remember. The queen on c5 controls the dark squares that the white knight on d5 attacks, and also attacks the weak pawn on c3. It also supports black's potential break with a3. Great positional move ! }
21. Rab1 Rxb1 22. Rxb1 O-O 23. Bb5 Be8 24. Bxe8 Rxe8 25. Rb7 Bd6 26. Qa6 a3
{ And the position is equal. This position arises after 25 moves, but before this, both players will have had plenty of possibilities to deviate. In most of the alternatives, black will be better. Just look at all the notes I have written, they will help you remember the basic plans and ideas as well as the tactical blows that I have shown you. }

Author Logozar makes this variation and suggests the move Ne7 here with the evaluation as the slightly better for white. In my view is always difficult to evaluate the slight advantage for each side, but here I don't think that white has any advantage at all. First, this is the variation that white playin order to get the better position based on the better knight on d5 against the black dark square bishop. In order to do that, he exchage this knight only if he gets the material advantage. Here, unfortunately for him this will not happens and I will show you a direct line which is completely equal. }

{ This is the starting position of the Sveshnikov. Black plays aggressively and wants to fight for the initiative right from the start. This gives him enough time for quick development and a safe position for the king. But by playing e5 black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and a potentially weak square on d5. This is one of the most uncompromising openings in chess. With this opening, you do not need to fight for equality and instead can play for initiative right from the start. Today this is the opening of choice for many leading players in the world. Ex-world champion Vladimir Kramnik plays it with great success. Here I will try to explain not only the forced lines but also the often complex strategy that is behind the ideas. }
6. Ndb5
{ This is white's positional approach. With this move, white wants to force black to play d6 without time to develop the dark-squared bishop and then he can occupy the weak square on d5. Alternatives will be explained in the other chapters. Black has a few nice ideas here that will give him great positions. }

11... b4
{ Now black can push b4 and a5, and after that reposition his knight and bishop from f6 to g1 - a7 diagonal. }
12. Nc2 O-O
{ There is no need to rush with a5 because white cannot take on b4 for now. This is one of the most positional ideas that white can try against the Sveshnikov. The position will now be closed, and it is important to understand the ideas. Black's idea is to bring the dark-squared bishop onto the best diagonal c1 - h6, play Qc5 via a5 when possible, and get the knight on d4 or even c5 via b8 and d7. If you want to get the rook onto the c file, then you will have to use the a7 square for that idea, because in most lines white will play Bh3 and the c8 square will be not available for it. In these positions black is at least equal. }
13. g3
{ This is white's main idea. To get some space on the kingside with his next move h4 and to get this bad bishop from f1 to a natural square in h3. }

{ This is, in my opinion, the only move that white can play to try and get an advantage. White wants to double black's pawns on the f file and secure a nice home for his knight on d5. Now, the positions that occur here are fighting and double-edged and just like white, black also has a lot of chances to play for equality but also for the advantage and the initiative. }
9... gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Here I preferred to play this instead of f5. I think that both moves are playable but this is the move that has caught my attention, after having all kinds of problems with sacrifices on b5. When you want to fight for the initiative, giving white two possible sacrifices after f5 is something that I'd like to avoid  (on b5 with Bb5 and also Nb5)  . This is the so-called Novosibirsk variation where black has nice and rich possibilities. The first idea is to not allow white sacrifices on b5 because you can your king to f8, and also this bishop will be on great diagonal after the next move, f5. Also after Bg7 you will have the extra option to play Ne7 as I will show you in the next position. }
11. c3
{ This here is also one of the main ideas for white. Now as in the line with the positional 9. Nd5 white has a plan with Nc2 - Ne3 and then a4. But here you can see that white does not control the central square e4 well, because black can push f5 immediately and open the position in the center. That is exactly what black needs to do here, now ! }

{ This is, in my opinion, the only move that white can play to try and get an advantage. White wants to double black's pawns on the f file and secure a nice home for his knight on d5. Now, the positions that occur here are fighting and double-edged and just like white, black also has a lot of chances to play for equality but also for the advantage and the initiative. }
9... gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7
{ Here I preferred to play this instead of f5. I think that both moves are playable but this is the move that has caught my attention, after having all kinds of problems with sacrifices on b5. When you want to fight for the initiative, giving white two possible sacrifices after f5 is something that I'd like to avoid  (on b5 with Bb5 and also Nb5)  . This is the so-called Novosibirsk variation where black has nice and rich possibilities. The first idea is to not allow white sacrifices on b5 because you can your king to f8, and also this bishop will be on great diagonal after the next move, f5. Also after Bg7 you will have the extra option to play Ne7 as I will show you in the next position. }
11. Bd3
{ This today remains the main move and does not allow f5 but allows Ne7, an exchange that is in black's favor. The knight on d5 is the best white piece, and black wants to exchange it. }

Rad1 Rb6
{ The star move. This rook is perfectly placed on b6 where it control the d6 square and can easily be switched through the 6th rank to the kingside. Every single black piece is better placed than white and black has a nice position and clear compensation for the sacrificed pawn. }
19. Qd3 Qd7
{ Do not be afraid of white capturing on h7. This pawn does not have enormous value and you will get an important tempo for an attack on the white king with Rh6. }
20. Bxh7+ Kh8 21. Qe3 Rh6 22. Bb1 Qd6 23. Nc2 e4 24. g3 Bh3 25. Rfe1 f5
{ I have analyzed this position for a long time and have come to the conclusion that black has more than enough compensation to sacrifice two pawns. The problem for white here is in the fact that he does not have any kind of active play and all the black pieces attack the white king on g1. Black has enormous pressure. }

When you want to fight for the initiative, giving white two possible sacrifices after f5 is something that I'd like to avoid  (on b5 with Bb5 and also Nb5)  . This is the so-called Novosibirsk variation where black has nice and rich possibilities. The first idea is to not allow white sacrifices on b5 because you can your king to f8, and also this bishop will be on great diagonal after the next move, f5. Also after Bg7 you will have the extra option to play Ne7 as I will show you in the next position. }

Now, in the original game that has been played, black  (GM Sibenik)  played Rfe8. I don't like that move. First because white exerts pressure in the center and black needs to play aggressively in order not to lose active play, and second because white is preparing an assault on the kingside with move Kh1. Now black immediately needs to play on the other side. Ths Rook is nicely placed on b8 and can give black nice counterplay there. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation in the Sicilian. It has been popular for the last couple of years on the highest level. E.g. world champion W. Anand uses it regularly. It has also become popular at the club level. This is perhaps because of it's easy to play nature and most of the main lines gives white slightly better chances, without counterplay for black. In these positions black mainly plays for a draw. Main lines like g6, e6 or d6 give white a position that he likes with a clear plan. Because of that, I believe that black needs to avoid those positions and force white to think for themselves after the move Qc7. This is the move that does not allow white a better pawn structure and the positions he seeks. Also, black has to try to play aggressively. This line is mentioned in some publications as white being clearly better than Black which I believe is not correct. As with the rare move a6 in the closed Sicilian, I started to analyze this move in the Rossolimo and after a while, I reached the conclusion that black has as nice play as in any other system and the fight is in his own territory. With this move you will force white to think with his own head from the third move. }
3... Qc7
{ This is the move that in my opinion has been completely underestimated. This move gives black good positions as any other suggested moves here, like g6 or e6. I think this move has two good things going for black. First that to play for advantage white will need to open the position up and in almost all cases get open Sicilian positions that he does not want. Rossolimo players are in most cases positional players and they do not want to play the Open Sicilian. The second nice thing for black is that not many white players will prepare for this line because as I mentioned in most publications it is totally underrated. White players think that it is easy to play against. I will show you how to play it ! }
4. Nc3 e6
{ Black needs to control the d5 square and not allow white's knight to jump from c3 to d5. }
5. O-O a6 { This will lead to the main line but with a different move order. }

It is important to understand that white gives away his light-squared bishop and when the position opens up this can be in black's favor. Now white needs to open the position, and this will lead to a double-edged position. }

This is a nice example how white can get into a slightly worse position if black does not compromise his pawn structure on the queenside. That's why white needs to open the position to seize the initiative. }

12. Be3 Be7 13. Rae1 Bb7
{ Here we have a nice picture. The position is equal but very complex and playable for black. This is an Open Sicilian Scheveningen type of position where white gives black the light-squared bishop for the knight, and this is in black's favor. White has more space and slightly better-placed pieces for now but the black position is very solid, and he has the bishop pair. The black plan is very easy to understand and play, castle on the kingside, then the rook from f8 goes on e8 and the a8 rook to c8. After that black will try to get play on the c file and on the queenside. Here without a light-squared bishop it is hard for white to organize an attack on the black king like in the Scheveningen with a bishop on e2 or even d3. }

This is the move that does not allow white a better pawn structure and the positions he seeks. Also, black has to try to play aggressively. This line is mentioned in some publications as white being clearly better than Black which I believe is not correct. As with the rare move a6 in the closed Sicilian, I started to analyze this move in the Rossolimo and after a while, I reached the conclusion that black has as nice play as in any other system and the fight is in his own territory. With this move you will force white to think with his own head from the third move. }
3... Qc7
{ This is the move that in my opinion has been completely underestimated. This move gives black good positions as any other suggested moves here, like g6 or e6. I think this move has two good things going for black. First that to play for advantage white will need to open the position up and in almost all cases get open Sicilian positions that he does not want. Rossolimo players are in most cases positional players and they do not want to play the Open Sicilian. The second nice thing for black is that not many white players will prepare for this line because as I mentioned in most publications it is totally underrated. White players think that it is easy to play against. I will show you how to play it ! }
4. O-O
{ There is no real alternative to this move except 4. Nc3 that will lead us to the main line. }
4... a6 5. Bxc6
{ White does not have an alternative to this move because Ba4 will lose the bishop and Be2 will lose too many tempi and place the bishop on a bad square. }
5... Qxc6
{ This is the idea that black started with when he played Qc7. Black does not want to allow white to double his c pawn even if he spends a few tempi on this. It is important to understand that white gives away his light-squared bishop and when the position opens up this can be in black's favor. Now white needs to open the position, and this will lead to a double-edged position. }
6. d4
{ This is the only real try for white. Black spends a few tempi on queen moves, and white wants to open the position and play for better development. }
6... cxd4

7. Nxd4 Qc7
{ Once again, please don't take the pawn on e4 because white will have huge initiative. }
8. Nc3 e6 { Now white has two moves: } 9. e5
{ GM Lutikov played this way and won a nice game because black made a few bad moves. Black needs to play d6 which gives an equal game. In this game, black played the bad move Ne7 and lost the game. d6 is an improvement and a clearly superior move. Black needs to destroy the white pawn on e5 and secures the dark squares around his king. }
9... d6 10. exd6 Bxd6 11. Re1 Ne7 12. g3 Be5 13. Be3 O-O
{ In this position as in the previous two, black manages to develop the kingside and castle, and because of the bishop pair, I believe he is slightly better. }

12. Be3 h5 { Now black gains some space on the kingside. } 13. Qh4 g6 14. f4
Be7 15. Qf2 Nh6
{ And we reach a kind of position after 15 moves that is not often seen in the Rossolimo. You can see how black defended the position with a few nice ideas. Here the position happens to remind me of positions from the Sicilian Scheveningen which white players do not want to play when they try for the Rossolimo. And on top of that in these positions now Black has the advantage given the bishop pair. Black holds the kingside and builds up a strong center. In some lines, it looked like white had some initiative but it was but temporary, and when black manages to get all of his pieces into play, the game is equal. Just remember not to open the position in the center before you develop all of your pieces and don't be afraid to play Kf8 when white attacks the g7 pawn. Black is at least equal here. With this smart system, you will be able to play some nice anti-Rossolimo positions. }

12. e5 d5 13. Qf3
{ Another nice move from white. Now white wants to set-up a sacrifice on d5 or e6, and black needs to be careful. }
13... g5
{ Now, I think that after this, black can try to play aggressively in the move order with g5 and h5. In my opinion, white doesn't have enough to sacrifice the knight on d5. Black gets the tempo back and I believe that white, if anything, only has a slight and temporary advantage }
14. Bd2 h5 15. Rad1 Rh7
{ Black will soon develop his other pieces and maintain the balance. The light-squared bishop will go on d7 and the king on g7 and h8 after this nice rook move. White doesn't have any clear targets, and the position is closed for now. Black will have enough time to consolidate the position. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Qc7 4. O-O a6 5. Bxc6 Qxc6 6. Na3
{ This is the most playable move from white in this position but in my view doesn't give white anything. As in the other more aggressive lines, here white can try to open the game with d4 or play more positional but passive position after d3. The problem for white is the fact that white's knight is much more passive on a3 than on c3 for example. }
6... e6 7. d3
{ This is the second white idea. Here white wants to play very solid positional chess. This doesn't give any problems to black. This white plan is solid but is passive and black, who is for now behind in development, will get enough time to develop his pieces and castle without any kind of problems. After that as in the main line with the bishop pair, I would always play with black. }
7... d6 8. Be3 Nf6 9. h3 b5 10. c3 Be7 11. Qd2 O-O 12. Rfe1 Bb7
{ And here it is similar to the line with the white knight on c3 instead of a3, black has a nice position. Black has the bishop pair, more space and clear targets on the queenside. This is once again, a nice example of how white can get into a slightly worse position if black does not compromise his pawn structure on the queenside. That's why white needs to open the position in order to try to get the initiative. Here I would always play with black. }

6... e6 7. d4
{ The first idea is to open the game in the center. Now this will give a position similar to the lines with Nc3 and d4 but better for black. Its better for black compared to the position when the knight is on c3 because the knight on a3 will not easily get into play. A more natural square for him is the c3 square. }

His position is at least equal. In the long run, because of the bishop pair and the nice center, I would prefer black here. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation in the Sicilian. It has been popular for the last couple of years on the highest level. E.g. world champion W. Anand uses it regularly. It has also become popular at the club level. This is perhaps because of it's easy to play nature and most of the main lines gives white slightly better chances, without counterplay for black. In these positions black mainly plays for a draw. Main lines like g6, e6 or d6 give white a position that he likes with a clear plan. Because of that, I believe that black needs to avoid those positions and force white to think for themselves after the move Qc7. This is the move that does not allow white a better pawn structure and the positions he seeks. Also, black has to try to play aggressively. This line is mentioned in some publications as white being clearly better than Black which I believe is not correct. As with the rare move a6 in the closed Sicilian, I started to analyze this move in the Rossolimo and after a while, I reached the conclusion that black has as nice play as in any other system and the fight is in his own territory. With this move you will force white to think with his own head from the third move. }
3... Qc7
{ This is the move that in my opinion has been completely underestimated. This move gives black good positions as any other suggested moves here, like g6 or e6. I think this move has two good things going for black. First that to play for advantage white will need to open the position up and in almost all cases get open Sicilian positions that he does not want. Rossolimo players are in most cases positional players and they do not want to play the Open Sicilian. The second nice thing for black is that not many white players will prepare for this line because as I mentioned in most publications it is totally underrated. White players think that it is easy to play against. I will show you how to play it ! }
4. O-O
{ There is no real alternative to this move except 4. Nc3 that will lead us to the main line. }
4... a6 5. Bxc6
{ White does not have an alternative to this move because Ba4 will lose the bishop and Be2 will lose too many tempi and place the bishop on a bad square. }
5... Qxc6
{ This is the idea that black started with when he played Qc7. Black does not want to allow white to double his c pawn even if he spends a few tempi on this. It is important to understand that white gives away his light-squared bishop and when the position opens up this can be in black's favor. Now white needs to open the position, and this will lead to a double-edged position. }
6. d4
{ This is the only real try for white. Black spends a few tempi on queen moves, and white wants to open the position and play for better development. }
6... cxd4
{ Do not take the pawn on e4 because white will have a huge initiative for it. There is no need to do that. Now we arrive at some positions from the Open Sicilian which white players do not like if they play the Rossolimo. }
7. Nxd4 Qc7
{ Once again, please don't take the pawn on e4 because white will have huge initiative. }
8. Nc3 e6 { Now white has two moves: } 9. Re1 Be7
{ Black needs to be precise here because white's idea is to play e5 and Ne4 or sometimes if, b5 or b6 white has the very unpleasant move 10. Nd5. With Be7 black keeps the position closed and doesn't allow black to open the position or to play Nd5. Also if white doesn't play aggressively with 10. e5 black will complete development and get an Open Sicilian position with the bishop pair and without any disadvantage. Potentially in the long run black can be better. }
10. Qg4 Kf8 11. e5 d5
{ Here again the position is about equal. White has a slight initiative, but black has a very nice position. With time White's initiative will disappear. }
12. Bf4 Bc5
{ Here I initially go for the 12...Bd8, but this is a bad move for black because of the 13.Nxd5! and black is lost. Black has to get the bishop on the c5 to not allow N13.Nd5. Now black has to go for the Ne7 and h5, g6 later on. The position is about equal. White has more space and black has the bishop pair. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is Rossolimo variation in the Sicilian. It has been especially popular for the last couple of years as on the highest level  (ex. world champion W. Anand use it regularly)  but also at the club level. That happens because of it easy to play it and in most of the main lines gives white slightly better chances without counterplay for black. In this position black mainly play for a draw. Main lines like 3... g6, e6 or d6 gives a white position that he like with clear plan and almost no counterplay for black. Because of that, I believe that black need to avoid those positions and make white to think with his own head after the move 3... Qc7. This is the move that does not allow white better pawn structure and the positions that he likes. Also, black try to play aggressively after that. This line is mention in some publications but with examine, mark white is clearly better than I believe is not correct. As the rare move 2... a6 in the closed Sicilian, I start to analyze this move in Rossolimo. After quite a while I get to the conclusion that black has nice play as in any other system but in his own territory. With this move you will make white to think with his own head from the third move. }
3... Qc7
{ This is the move that is for most of the publication completely underestimated. In my opinion, this move gives black as good positions as any of suggested moves here like g6 or e6. Here I think this move has two extra good things for black. First is that here in order to play for advantage white need to open the position and in almost all position play open Sicilian position that he does not want. Rossolimo players are in most cases positional players and they do not want to play open Sicilian positions. The second nice thing for black is that no much white players will prepare for this line because as I mention in most publications is totally underestimated and white players think that it is easy to play against it. I analyze it for a while now and here I will show you how to play it. }
4. O-O
{ There is no real alternative to this move except 4. Nc3 that will lead to the main line. }
4... a6 5. Bxc6
{ White do not have alternative to this move because La4 will lose the bishop and Be2 will lose too many tempi and the bishop will be on bad square. }
5... Qxc6
{ This is the idea that black start with 3... Qc7. Black does not want to allow white to double his c pawn even if he spends few tempi. It is important to understand that white give away his light square bishop and when the position will open later this can be in black favor. Now white need to open the position and this will lead to a double-edged position. }
