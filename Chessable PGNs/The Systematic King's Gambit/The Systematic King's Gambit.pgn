{ Welcome to the King's Gambit!  The course is structured in three parts:  Part 1: King's Gambit Accepted, Bishop's Gambit   2...exf4  (played 47% of the time)  3.Bc4  (ch. 1-12)  Part 2: Falkbeer Countergambit   2...d5  (played 17% of the time)  3.exd5  (ch. 13-19)  Part 3: King's Gambit Declined   2...Nc6  or 2...other  (played 35% of the time, ch. 20-31)  We'll start with Black's most commonly played  (and Black's best)  move. }
2... exf4
{ In this book, '!' indicates Black's best move  (per Stockfish 10 at depth >= 25)  , and not necessarily a brilliant or unusual move. }
3. Bc4
{ The King's Bishop's Gambit!    This is the one exception in the entire course in which White doesn't play Stockfish's preferred move.  Here, Stockfish prefers   3.Nf3  ,  with an evaluation of -0.5, versus -0.9 for 3. Bc4  (at depth 50, Stockfish 11)  .  I could provide some rationalization for choosing Bc4.  For instance, several big names in chess have played it, including Morphy, Anderssen, and Fischer.  Also, the difference in Stockfish 11's evaluation between the two moves isn't that great, especially given that it is looking 50 half-moves into he future. And Bc4 is likely going to surprise most opponents, as it is only played 12% of the time, versus 3. Nf3 which is played 86% of the time.  Though my main reason for playing it is simply that it's fun to play.  White wastes no time in attacking the f7 square. White has no fear about ...Qh4+, forcing White to move its King. And with good preparation  (which you'll get from this course)  , White can happily exploit the many pitfalls that your opponents might make.  If you insist on playing Nf3, you still will find parts of this course useful -- the Falkbeer Countergambit and other King's Gambit Declined chapters. Though I hope you'll take a look at the Bishop's Gambit lines - I think you may change your mind... }
3... Qh4+
{ This is Black's best move, and it is probably the main 'weakness' of the King's Bishop's Gambit, allowing Black to force White's King to move, losing its ability to castle.  However, as we'll see over the next four chapters and 64 variations, White often ends up doing very well, especially if Black isn't prepared. }
4. Kf1
{ White has lost the ability to castle, and its King is awkwardly placed.  Though so is Black's Queen, which will probably be chased off, with tempo, via an eventual Nf3.  This is the starting position for the first four chapters of this book:   Chapter 1 - Greco Variation   4...Bc5?  (played 25% of the time)  5.d4  (+0.6)  Chapter 2 - First Jaenisch Variation   4...Nf6  (22%)  5.Nf3  (-0.4)  Chapter 3 - Cozio Variation   4...d6!  (20%)  5.Nc3  (-0.4)  Chapter 4 - Boden Variation   4...Nc6  (12%)  (and other less common Black choices)  (Evaluations are from Stockfish 11 at depths between 31 and 40.) }
4... Bc5
{ The Greco variation.  This is Black's most commonly played move, but it's also a mistake!  (The evaluation changes from -0.4 to +0.6.)  Black allows White to develop with tempo, a main theme of the King's Gambit. }
5. d4
{ Through this entire book, White usually plays d4 immediately after Black's often poor move, ...Bc5.  Separately, White's d4 move also lays the groundwork for White's preferred way to try to win back the gambited f-pawn: Bxf4. }
5... Bb6 6. Nf3
{ Here we see one of the main advantages of White allowing ...Qh4+: White gets to develop with tempo. }
6... Qe7 { Black retreats, but now attacks e4. } 7. Nc3
{ White develops and protects e4. } 7... Nf6
{ This Black Knight will have a hard time finding a safe square. } 8. e5
{ White continues advancing forward, Black keeps moving out of the way. } 8...
Ng4 9. Bxf4
{ +5.1 at depth 30  (Stockfish 11)  .  A nice opening example of the power of the King's Gambit.  White sacrifices the f4 pawn; in exchange, White gets initiative and control of the center.  If Black doesn't know what he or she is doing, things can go poorly for Black very quickly.  After 9 moves, the game is essentially won for White, and this is after Black has played the most commonly played move on every turn!  White has two powerful Knight moves ready to go: Nd5  (which White will likely play next)  and Ng5. }

e5 Nh5
{ An awkward looking spot for the Black Knight, though it does have the advantage of defending f4. }
9. g4
{ Definitely a surprising move!  One way to remember this is to recall that White is often aggressive in this opening, and isn't necessarily shy about moving the g- and h-pawns despite the White King's seeming vulnerability.  The main point of this move is that Black's h5 Knight has no safe squares to move to.  Black is forced to capture the pawn en passant, which is exactly what White wants... }
9... fxg3
{ Certainly a tempting move, but it's a blunder in an already lost position  (moving the evaluation from +4.4 to +7.2)  .  The Black Knight on h5 still has no safe square to retreat to, and Black has neither enough time nor active pieces to attack the White King. }
10. Ng5
{ +7.9 at depth 33  (Stockfish 11)  .  The Black Knight on h5 is going to die.  More importantly, the Black King is vulnerable in the center, and castling doesn't help Black either.  This is also the first example of another major theme for White in the King's Gambit: attacking f7.   If  10...O-O  , White plays  11.Qxh5  , winning a piece and threatening mate on  h7.   Notably , if  10...g2+  ,  11.Kxg2  , and Black doesn't have any more meaningful checks.   And if  10...g6  , trying to save the Black Knight ,  11.hxg3  (+10.3 at depth 30, Stockfish 11)  (.) }

{ Black wants to get its light-squared Bishop involved. } 8. Nd5
{ White's common refrain: forward!  White is fine leaving its e4 pawn undefended, preferring initiative over material.  This is the first time we're seeing White sacrifice its e4 pawn in order to gain in initiative and attack.  We'll see White do this in other variations in this chapter and sprinkled through other chapters as well.  White's idea is that the Black Queen will actually be misplaced on e4, despite its central location.  The Black Queen will be further from its King, which is vulnerable to all of White's minor pieces crowding toward the center.   The obvious seeming  8.Bxf4  is worse  (+0.6, versus +1.1 with the text move, at depth 30)  (.  White's position is fine, but not nearly as threatening as in the)  Nd5!  (line.) }
8... Qxe4 9. Bxf4
{ +1.6 at depth 30  (Stockfish 11)  .  White has a huge lead in development.  While Black's Queen is centrally placed, it is vulnerable to a skewer  (via an eventual)  Re1  or further harassment by White's minor pieces.  White will likely play Qd2 and Re1 next.  Another idea for White is Ng5, targeting f7. }

8... Qxe4 { Yes! } 9. Nxg5
{ +8.1 at depth 30  (Stockfish 11)  .  Another won game for White.  Granted, the entire first chapter of this book starts with Black making a big mistake with 4...Bc5?, but that is Black's most commonly played move in that position, so I want to be sure I know how to make Black pay for the mistake.  One thing to note about White's sacrifice of a pawn on e4  (and the same goes for the previous example we saw of White's)  e4  (sacrifice)  , is that Black really has no serious threats despite having a Black Queen on e4 and a Bishop on b6 pointing toward f2.  Black has no meaningful checks, and just doesn't have enough active pieces to create a serious threat.    Also, Black can't play ...Bxd4 because that Bishop needs to stay on b6, defending the c7 square against White's threat of Nxc7+. }

{ Black tries to keep f4 defended. } 8. Bd3
{ +1.6 at depth 42  (Stockfish 11)  .  White chases the Queen away.  It is unusual for White to move its light-squared Bishop off the c4-f7 diagonal, as f7 is such as common target in this opening.  Here, the prize of winning back the gambited pawn with tempo while developing  Bxf4  is worth it for White.   Of note ,  8.Nc3  is nearly equally good , at +1.5 at depth  42.  Black has only three options for saving its Queen: ...Qh5, ...Qe6, and ...Qg4.  Interestingly, and consistent with typical principles in the King's Gambit, the move for Black that attempts to save the f-pawn  ...Qg4  is Black's worst option.  Black should really stop being greedy with pawns.  The continuations could be:   8...Qh5!  9.Nc3  , +1.6 at depth 31 , Stockfish 11   8...Qe6  9.c4  , +1.9 at depth 31 , Stockfish 11   8...Qg4?  9.h3  , +2.6 at depth 31 , Stockfish 11 }

White can't win back the gambited pawn just yet, so White goes ahead and develops the queenside Knight to its most common spot, where it can jump to d5  (attacking)  f4  and perhaps later threaten c7.  White's advantage is minor  (+0.5)  because Black has played perfectly on five of the last six moves.  If White can't play Nd5 next  (e.g., if Black plays the good move)  ...Ne7  , White has a good alternative idea.  White can play the aggressive move, g3, as Black's f4 pawn is pinned to its Queen. }

Black cannot play  9...f5??  , as White can take en passant ,  10. exf6; Black's Knight cannot recapture because it is pinned to the King; and now the Black King is very exposed.   If Black tries to defend the  e4  Knight with its Queen via  9...Qg6  , White can play  10.Nh4   If Black tries  9...Qf5  , White first moves its Bishop to safety While continuing to have its Queen pressure Black's Knight; thus the only square for the White  f4  Bishop is back to  10.Bc1.  White will then move its light-squared Bishop and attack the Black Knight , and White will eventually win the Black Knight.  This chapter makes clear why 4...Bc5? is such a poor move.  Black allows White to put a pawn on d4 with tempo, giving White a lead in development and control of the center that Black has a very hard time countering. }

White always has that move in its back pocket to shore up the center and win a tempo. For now, leaving Black's bishop on b4 is fine as it doesn't threaten anything. This could be an example of 'the threat is stronger than the execution' -- Black may voluntarily retreat its b4 Bishop, leaving the c3 square open for White's Knight, perhaps.  Black has five reasonable options for retreating its Queen.   6...Qf6  is met with  7.e5  , further challenging the Black Queen and allowing White to continue pushing central pawns  (+1.2 at depth 33, Stockfish 11)  (.)   6...Qd8  , the abject retreat , and  ...Qe7  are met with  7.c3  (+1.2 and +2.2, respectively, at depth 33, Stockfish 11)  (.)   6...Qh5  is met by the simple  7.Bxf4  , winning back the gambited pawn with ease  (+1.9 at depth 33, Stockfish 11)  (.)   6...Qh6  is met with  7.Ne5  (+2.1 at depth 33, Stockfish 11)  (. This motif shows up in other places in this course, in which White can gang up on the f7 square with its light-squared Bishop and a Knight when Black puts its Queen on the h6 square)  (blocking its Knight from going to h6 to help defend f7)  (.) }

White has the flexibility to decide which side to castle on  (it will likely be O-O-O)  , and White also is now defending the previously undefended Bishop on c4.  A nice example of how White can build a solid advantage by move 8 even with Black playing good, reasonable moves. }

Granted, in the first variation of this chapter we saw a very similar situation, with Black's d-pawn attacking White's c4 Bishop, in which White played Bb5+ to win a tempo and then followed up with Bxf4.  The only difference in those two positions was that, in the previous variation White's kingside Knight and Black's dark-squared Bishop were undeveloped.  Why should that mean that White should play Bb3 here, and not Bb5+?  It's above my head--I welcome others' suggestions. }

4. Qf3
{ This is not what anyone was expecting!  In fact, this move is played a measly 0.4% of the time by White!  On its face, I admit that the move looks dubious.  Though even out to a depth of 35  (!)  , it's the best move per Stockfish 10: -0.4, better than the more expected 4. Nf3, d4, or Nc3  (all are -0.5)  .  It's surprising to move your Queen out so soon, and to move it to the square usually occupied by the kingside Knight.  An advantage of the move is that it immediately puts pressure on the f4 pawn, while defending h1.  Defense of h1 comes into play if Black plays ...Qh4+ and White responds with g3.  After the exchange of pawns ...fxg3 hxg3, the White Rook on h1 now threatens the Black Queen on h4, and the White Queen defends the h1 Rook.  A more straightforward advantage of Qf3 is that it immediately puts the Queen on the f-file, with the latent threat of Bxf7+ or Qxf7#.  GM Simon Williams talk about 'cave man chess'--Qf3 seems like a nice example of that. }

8. Nh3
{ +0.4 at depth 25  (Stockfish 10)  .  This is an unusual move for White to make in this opening book.  One way of making sense of it is to observe that the Black Bishop is in no place to attack d4, thus the White Knight doesn't have to sit on f3 to defend d4.  The more direct reason for Nh3, rather than Nf3, is that the Knight attacks f4, while also clearing the way for the White Queen to go to f3 or h5. }

Of note, the best reply by Black here is 6...f3, not ...Nxe4, as you'll see in this variation.  This was noted in John Shaw's amazing King's Gambit book  I'm not including a variation in this book with 6...f3.  Given the infrequency of it occurring in real games, I think it's not practical enough to include. I don't doubt that it's important, if not critical. I think that this course is big enough already; including less frequent moves by Black would make the book more comprehensive but less useful.  For this particular line, 6...f3 was played only 12% of the time, and in only 12 total games from the lichess dataset; while the included move 6...Nxe4 was played 58% of the time, and also happens to be a natural and tempting move for Black to make.  I will add that, should Black play the best, and critical, line with 6...f3, rather than 6...Nxe4, White should respond gxf3. The line could go something like this:   6...f3  7.gxf3  d5  8.exd5  Nxd5  9.O-O  (-0.3 at depth 28)  (.) }

1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5
{ The Falkbeer countergambit.  Black plays this about 17% of the time after 1. e4 e5  2. f4.  It's a clever move, essentially just as good as 2...exf4, and it will test White's preparation.  If you are going to play the King's Gambit as White, you have to know what to do with the Falkbeer countergambit. }
3. exd5
{ After this, Black has four main options: ...e4  (played 51% of the time)  , ...exf4  (32%)  , ...Qxd5  (9%)  , and ...c6  (6.5%)  ; all other Black options combined are only played 1.5% of the time.   Very importantly , NEVER play  3.fxe5??  Qh4+  4.g3  Qe4+  5.Qe2  Qxh1 }
3... e4
{ The Staunton Line.  This is Black's most common move, but it is nearly a mistake!  It changes the evaluation from -0.4 to +0.4. }

{ Black plays this move 92.5% of the time.  Thus, of the 26 variations in this chapter, 24 branch off from this point. }
6. Nf3
{ In the King's Gambit Accepted, King's Bishop's Gambit, White often waits to play Nf3 until after Black has played ...Qh4+.  In the Falkbeer, Nf3 comes earlier. }
6... Bc5
{ This move is played overwhelmingly often in this position by Black: over 82% of the time.  Black can't resist the urge to attack the f2 square.  Again, happily for White, this move is not Black's best, and White is already up +0.7 at this point. }
7. Qe2
{ Black may start to realize that it is actually on the defensive, not the attack.  As you'll see in a later variation in the chapter, White does not fear ...Bf2+ nor the subsequent ...Qxd5+.  The key is the obvious pin on Black's e4 Knight. }
7... Qe7
{ Ok, Black sees the pin, but now White has an extra tempo to defend f2. } 8.
Be3 Bxe3 9. Qxe3
{ +1.0 at depth 25  (Stockfish 10)  .  An exciting start to the exciting Falkbeer countergambit.  It is definitely dangerous for White.  These are probably the most important set of chapters to learn precisely, or else a well-prepared opponent can quickly grab a big advantage. }

The move recommended here, 3. d3, is played a minuscule 2% of the time.  Besides it being the best move, per Stockfish, it's so rarely played that Black will very likely be immediately off book.

White wants to keep its dark-squared Bishop on its initial square until Black eventually plays ...exf4.  Similarly, White can't develop its b1 Knight to d2 because it blocks the Bishop's defense of f4.  So without a good way to develop its two remaining minor pieces, White goes ahead and pushes in the center. }

{ Thanks again for your interest in this course.  Below are some additional King's Gambit resources online.  If you know of others, please let me know in the comments and this can become an expanding list of resources for fellow King's Gambiteers.   @@HeaderStart@@VIDEOS@@HeaderEnd@@  --King's Gambit Opening Theory, by Hanging Pawns, on YouTube.  This is a series of nine excellent videos covering all aspects of the King's Gambit.    --Overview of the King's Gambit with  3. Bc4!?  by GM Simon Williams  (aka GingerGM)  , on YouTube.  This is a single video on the King's Bishop's Gambit, though it is over 20 minutes long.  GM Williams also has a great series of short videos on the King's Gambit on chess.com.    @@HeaderStart@@BOOKS@@HeaderEnd@@  --The King's Gambit by John Shaw.  This is often cited as one of the best ever books on the King's Gambit.  It is a big, thorough book, written  (in my opinion)  for high level players, perhaps expert and above.
