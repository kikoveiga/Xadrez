1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Be7 {The point of this move is to avoid the development 
of White's knight to e2 in the exchange variation. This Botvinnik invention is 
still considered as most promising for White in the Exchange Variation. Its idea 
is not to block the f-pawn so as to be able to build a big centre by playng f3 
and e4. Now if White still wants to play the Exchange Variation he will have to 
make some concessions.} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4 c6 {Now Black's plan is to play Bd6, 
exchanging the active Bf4. Later he will try to put the bishop on f5.} 6. Qc2

Bf5} 7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. e3 Ne7 {With the idea of ...Bf5, so White prevents it with

a knight.} 10. O-O O-O {This is very similar to 7 Qc2 g6 8 e3 Bf5, here Black's 
pawn is still on g7 rather than on g6. The manner of treating the position 
remains the same though - Black can successfully defend against the typical 
minority attack, as shown in the following game by Kramnik.} 11. Rab1 a5 
{Preventing b4 and when White prepares it with a3 then the exchange on b4 will 
open the a-file for Black.} 12. a3 Ne4 {This knight jump is based on the tactic 
that the Bg5 is attacked so White cannot take twice on e4. If White takes on e7 
then after Black takes with the queen then the Ne4 is defended twice.} 13. Bxe7 
Qxe7 14. b4 $6 b5 $1 {A very important move. Not only does it prevent the 
typical minority attack with b5, but also establishes a strong outpost on c4 for 
one of the knights (Nd6-c4 or Nb6-c4) .} 15. Qc2 axb4 {Opening the a-file to 
activate the Ra8.} 16. axb4 Nd6 $15 {Avoiding the exchange as both Black's 
knights have excellent outposts, so it's better to keep them both.} 17. Rb3 Nb6 
18. Ne5 Rfc8 {The other rook is useful on the a-file. The Ne5 can easily be 
kicked with ...f6, so this is only temporary.} 19. Nd3 Nbc4 {Black is better 
here, as he has successfully plugged the queenside and can now turn his 
attention to the centre and the kingside. In the game Nikolic,P (2635)

to play ...Re8, ...g6, ...h5, ...Qg5, ...Ra7-e7, ...Nf5 and eventually 
sacrificed on e3!} *

lead him into trouble, for example:} a5 13. Qc2 Re8 {The difference with the 
Kramnik game is that here ...Ne4 would be bad because White can escape with the 
bishop on h6, gaining tempo and winning a pawn after taking on e4 twice.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Be7 {The point of this move is to avoid the development 
of White's knight to e2 in the Exchange Variation. This Botvinnik invention is 
still considered as most promising for White in the Exchange Variation. Its idea 
is not to block the f-pawn so as to be able to build a big centre by playng f3 
and e4. Now if White still wants to play the Exchange Variation he will have to 
make some concessions.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 {Leads to the normal position of the QGD and 
here the exchange variation is rather harmless for Black, who can comfortably 
develop his Bc8 to f5.} 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bg5 c6 7. Qc2 g6 $1 {It is vital to 
secure the exit of the bishop to f5!} 8. e4 {The only way for White to try for 
more} dxe4 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Qxe4+ Kf8 {It is possible to cover with the queen, 
but the king will quickly move to g7 so the loss of castling rights is not an 
issue here.} 11. Bc4 Bf5 {Winning tempo to speed up the development.} 12. Qf4 
Qe7+ {Forcing White to go back with the bishop.} 13. Be2 h5 {Preventing g4} 14. 
O-O Nd7 {Black has smooth development and with the bishop pair can be optimistic 
about the middlegame} 15. Rad1 Kg7 {Finally connecting the rooks.} 16. a3 
{Preventing possible Qb4 ideas} Rhe8 17. Rfe1 Qd8 {With the nice idea of Qb8-d6 
as the queen on d6 will be centralised and if if White takes on b8 then the 
endgame with a pair of bishops and an isolated queen's pawn for White would be 
very pleasant for Black.} 18. d5 Qb6 {The queen changes the trajectory now, 
attacking b2 with good counterplay.} 19. dxc6 bxc6 {Taking with the queen is 
impossible because of Bb5 and Black will be in trouble, but taking with the pawn 
is good because the pawn controls the important d5-square, thus limiting the 
Nc3. Now the pawn on b2 is hanging and Black's bishops are very active in an 
open position.} 20. Nd4 Bxd4 {Again exchanging everything on d4 is good for 
Black as in the endgame he can use the open b-file to create counterplay against 
the b2-pawn.} 21. Qxd4+ Qxd4 22. Rxd4 Nc5 {Threatening ...Nd3.} 23. Kf1 Rab8 
{Attacking b2.} 24. b4 Nb3 {Gaining a tempo by attacking the rook as on the next 
move Black will get rid of the c6-pawn and will equalise the position 
completely.} 25. Rd6 c5 $11 *

c7 and e6 eventually) but it also keeps the king in the centre and by not 
determining the king's position it makes it more difficult for White to attack 
on an empty kingside. Depending on how the game develops later castling on both

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Be7 4. Nf3 Nf6 {Now White has 3 main ways to avoid the 
main lines. They are all harmless, but Black needs to know what he's doing 
against each of them.} 5. g3 {this transposes to a line in the Catalan where 
White has already committed the knight to c3} O-O 6. Bg2 dxc4 {With a knight on 
c3 it is more difficult for White to recuperate the pawn on c4. But Black's plan 
isn't to hold to it at all cost, it rather depends on what White chooses on the 
next move.} 7. O-O Nc6 {Developing the knight on c6 exerts pressure on d4 (this 
preventing a move like Ne5) and aims to push ...e5 after ...Bd6. When Black 
achieves this he will have an excellent position as the e5-push will immediately 
solve the development of the Bc8.} 8. e4 a6 {White's last move prevented Black's 
plan of ...Bd6 and ...e5, so Black switches plan and will develop the Bc8 to b7, 
at the same time defending the extra pawn on c4 by ...b5.} 9. Qe2 b5 10. Rd1 Nb4 
{Avoiding possible attacks with d5 and eyeing the d3-square. The move also 
vacates the h1-a8 diagonal so the bishop will immediately become active on b7.} 
11. Ne1 {Covering the d3-square.} Bb7 12. b3 cxb3 13. axb3 Qd7 {And Black will 
put the rooks in the centre and will try to prepare c5. He continues being a 
pawn up while White's compensation isn't very obvious.} *

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Be7 4. Nf3 Nf6 {Now White has 3 main ways to avoid the 
main lines. They are all harmless, but Black needs to know what he's doing 
against each of them.} 5. e3 O-O 6. b3 c5 {Hitting in the centre while White is 
still undeveloped. Black's idea is to take on d4 and leave White with a pawn on 
d4, thus rendering the Bb2 passive.} 7. Bb2 cxd4 {If now White takes with a 
knight, then Black can continue with the fianchetto with ...b6 and ...Bb7 and 
then he can take on c4, before or after ...Nbd7.} 8. exd4 b6 {The bishop on b7 
can be activated at any moment by taking on c4 if a need arises.} 9. Bd3 Bb7 10. 
O-O Nbd7 $5 {A flexible move with a concrete idea behind it. It keeps the h1-a8 
diagonal open and also has extra control over the c5-square, preventing possible 
plans by White aimed at queenside expansion.} 11. Qe2 {White's typical 
development in this line is to put the rooks in the centre (d1 and e1 or d1 and 
c1) and then either jump Ne5 or push d5 in case Black had already taken on c4. 
Another idea White has is to advance on the queenside with c5, but by placing 
his knight on d7 Black already took care of that. It is worth noting though that 
when White uses this system he usually places his queenside knight on d2 instead 
of c3, when he has the additional idea to support his Ne5 by Ndf3 (in those 
positions it is especially important not to allow it so Black is well advised to 
take on c4 immediately when White had played Ne5) .} dxc4 $5 {This is the 
beginning of a curious transformation that aims to obtain either a blockade on 
the dark squares or a better pawn structure as compensation for the bishop pair. 
The move opens the h1-a8 diagonal and Black will follow up with taking on f3 and 
pushing ...e5.} 12. bxc4 Bxf3 $5 {Eliminating the piece that controlled e5.} 13. 
Qxf3 e5 $1 {Using the fact that White cannot take because of the double attack, 
Black now either exchanges the d4-pawn or forces it to d5, in both cases gaining 
the excellent post on c5.} 14. Nb5 exd4 15. Nxd4 Ne5 {A double-attack and giving 
Black the option to take on d3 if he wishes so.} 16. Qe2 Bd6 {It is also 
possible to take on d3 with an equal position (even there Black is comfortable 
with the better structure) . The bishop move is more ambitious as it keeps the 
Bd3 on the board and Black aims for the ideal scenario of a good Nc5 vs a bad 
Bd3.} 17. Bc2 Re8 $11 {An alternative is to play ...Ng6, concentrating his 
forces on the kingside and continuing with ...Re8 and possibly ...Qc7. 1/2-1/2
