[Black "Why I love the KID, by FM Marko Makaj"]
[Result "*"]

{ The Fighting KID is the second course that I've made here on Chessable.  It's based on my own playing repertoire that I've used from the very start of my 'Chess Journey'. This is one of the most, if not the most, interesting chess openings.  Some of the best players in chess history loved using this great opening like Mikhail Tal, Robert Fisher, Garry Kasparov and today Hikaru Nakamura, Ding Liren, Teimour Radjabow, and many others as well.   The KID is one of the sharpest and most uncompromising openings for black against the first white move 1.d4. The positions that black gets here are extremely double-edged with the nice chances to play for the initiative.  @@HeaderStart@@Sharp and uncompromising@@HeaderEnd@@  I like to play sharp and complex systems and because of that use the most aggressive openings against all first white moves. Against first white move 1.e4, I like The Sicilian  (my first course 'The Fighting Sicilian – A complete chess repertoire against 1.e4' that you can find here: @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/the-fighting-sicilian@@LinkEnd@@ a-complete-repertoire-vs-1e4/course/8018/)  and in this book, The Fighting KID, I explain how to play against the first white move 1.d4.   All the lines that you will find here have been analysed and tested in practise. I try to focus on the explanations and ideas that are very important. Also, I haven chosen lines that I think are easy to understand and get the clear path to the middlegames for black.  I have seen many different chess books and have to say that many of them are based only on real games that have been played, and explained based on only those games. Here, I didn’t use only specifical games, but tried to give the best possible lines based on the ideas behind those moves.  @@HeaderStart@@Learn the plans@@HeaderEnd@@  With this idea, I not only cover opening lines but what is more important: giving the ideas that are possible after the opening to get the full picture about what black and also white wants to achieve in this great opening.  Also I, of course, I have analysed the lines that I give in this book with the computer but I don’t only 'believe' the machine. Some of the positions here, the computer doesn't like and maybe even judges as clearly better for white - but this is not necessarily the truth.  Sometimes because of the complex positional considerations at play and the attack that white is faced with against his king, the extra space that he gets are not enough to get a clear edge. So, I used the computer but also 'believed' that human ideas in these situations are equally important as well. So, please analyse with the computer, but don’t blindly believe them as I didn't.  Also, to understand what black has to do, I have tried to explain white's ideas as well. It's not possible to know what to do only based on the plans that one side can do. To get the whole picture, it's important to understand both the plans and the ideas for white and then black.  I am Marko Makaj, an FM with a classical rating of 2362 Fide at the time of writing, and I have been a chess trainer for more than 15 years.  This book will help, in my opinion, a wide range of the players from the masters, club players, but also beginners because here in this book you can find not only the opening lines but also the plans that are important in all the middlegames that we find.  I hope you enjoy it, and it brings you success!  by Marko Makaj October, 2018 }

[White "The Classical Variation vs. main line with 9.b4"]
[Black "Mainline with 9.b4 1"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O
{ This is the starting move of the classical King's Indian defense or so-called Mar del Plata variation. White takes over the center of the board and black counter attacks white with e5 in all situations where he can do that. Because of the e5 move, black will after d5 have an option to play on the kingside and white on the queenside. For the moment, black in unable to start playing on the kingside because the center is still open and now start some operations on the kingside when the center is open will only be in white's favor. Because of that, before black can starting some operations on the kingside, he has to close the center. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the start of black's plan. First, close the center and then start operations on the kingside - even if that means that black has to lose a tempo because after d5 black has to remove the knight. }
8. d5 Ne7
{ This is the only real move that black has here. Nb8, Nb4 or Na5 are bad moves. It is important that this knight is for now not on the best square. Later on black will get this knight into play on the g6 or even Ng8 - h6 squares. }
9. b4
{ This is the start of so-called Bayonet attack in the Classical King's Indian. Thrusting the b4 pawn like a bayonet starts an immediate fight for the c5 square and the break that white wants to achieve. The thematical white break here is c4 - c5. Because of the pawn structure, white has more space and the upper hand for the play on the queenside and black have on the kingside. The move c4 - c5 is white's wish and f7 - f5 for a start is black's one. In order to push the pawn to c5, b4 is the preparation that white wants to make. }
9... Nh5
{ White starts immediate operations on the queenside so black has to go on the kingside. This is a thematic move that black plays in order to play f5 and open the front on the kingside. }
10. c5
{ This is an older move that caused a lot of problems for black before, but now black finds a nice way to play against it. }
10... f5
{ Black has to start immediate action on the kingside because of white starting it on the queenside. Now white has many options. Let's see relevant ones. }
11. Qb3
{ With this move, white wants to protect the pawn that will go on e6 after Ng5 - e6 plan. }
11... h6
{ This is also the move that has been tested in many games. With this move, black doesn't allow white to get his idea with the Ng5 - e6, but somehow it can potentially weaken the g6 square and black has to be careful later on. }
12. a4
{ This is a classical white continuation that is the alternative to the more direct way of playing exf5. With this move white starts a pawn avalanche on the queenside but also allows black counterplay on the other side. It's a race. One nice thing that goes to in black's favor is the fact that even if white completely destroys black's defense on the queenside that doesn't mean that black loses the game because of black's attack on his opponents king, and if he manages to mate him than the game is over. }
12... fxe4
{ This is a direct answer to the a4 move from white. Now black strikes first in the center and opens the f - file for his rook. A4 now looks like a waste of tempo for white. }
13. Nxe4 Nf4
{ Black now improves the position of the knight and attacks white's light square bishop. }
14. Bxf4
{ The black idea is Bg4 and then to put pressure on the knight that is on f3. With this move, the white light square bishop will stay on the board. }
14... Rxf4 15. cxd6 cxd6 16. Bd3 { White defends his knight on e4. } 16... b5
{ I think that this move is better than b6 here. First, black want to put pressure on the weak white pawn on d5 and with b5 free the b6 square for the queen later on. The position is about equal. The black plan is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. }
17. Bb1
{ For instance, white can try that move. Remove the bishop to clear the d - file for the rook. }
17... Bb7 { With pressure on the d5 pawn. } 18. Rd1 bxa4
{ Important move to remove the a - pawn and avoid a5. } 19. Rxa4 Qb6
{ And after that move, black develops all the pieces and secures equality. His idea is to pressurize the d5 and b4 pawns and also bring the other rook from a8 to f8 to start some action on the kingside. The position is equal. }

{ After that move, black activate the worst piece, knight, on e7 and get great play. }
13. Ne4 a5
{ White didn't manage to develop all the pieces there because of too much pawn moves. Now black destroys the position of the white pawns on the queenside. This is typical break against b4 pawn when white didn't manage to clear the first rank for the rooks. }
14. cxd6
{ This is not a good alternative for white. Now black can take this pawn with the knight and make the pressure with tempo on the white best piece in the center, a knight on e4. }
14... Nxd6
{ With a little bit better position for black. White is not developing yet and all black pieces are on the nice squares. Black has more of the play. }

For the moment, black in unable to start play on the kingside because the center is still open and now start some operations on the kingside when the center is open will only be in white's favor. Because of that, before black can start operations on the kingside, he has to close the center. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the start of black's plan. First, close the center and then start operations on the kingside - even if that means that black has to lose a tempo because after d5 black has to remove the knight. }
8. d5 Ne7
{ This is the only real move that black has here. Nb8, Nb4 or Na5 are bad moves. It is important that this knight is for now not on the best square. Later on black will get this knight into play on the g6 or even Ng8 - h7 squares. }
9. b4
{ This is the start of so-called Bayonet attack in the Classical King's Indian. Thrusting the b4 pawn like a bayonet starts an immediate fight for the c5 square and the break that white wants to achieve. The thematical white break here is c4 - c5. Because of the pawn structure, white has more space and the upper hand for the play on the queenside and black have on the kingside. The move c4 - c5 is white's wish and f7 - f5 for a start is black's one. In order to push the pawn to c5, b4 is the preparation that white wants to make. }
9... Nh5
{ White starts immediate operations on the queenside so black has to go on the kingside. This is a thematic move that black plays in order to play f5 and open the front on the kingside. }
10. c5
{ This is an older move that makes a lot of problems for black before, but now black finds a nice way how to play against it. }
10... f5
{ Black has to start immediate action on the kingside because of white starting it on the queenside. Now white has many options. Let's see relevant ones. }
11. Re1
{ This is the move that even Kramnik try few times. Later goes for 10. Re1 which is more unpleasant for black. White wants to play Bf1 if black jump on the f4 square. Black can go with his main idea fxe4 and Nf5, as usual, to get a nice position there. }
11... fxe4 { control of f4 square } 12. Ng5
{ This is not so good move now because after Nf4 white light square bishop is under attack as the pawn on d5. }
12... Nf4 13. Bc4
{ White remove the light square bishop from the exchange on e2 and support his d5 pawn. }
13... Kh8
{ The move that is here the most precise I think. If black jump on f5 here with the knight, then after Ne6 and exchange there this knight will have to go back on e7 in order to secure the advance of that pawn and to support the d5 break, so black will not lose the tempo. }
14. Ngxe4 Nf5
{ Finally with the same idea. Knight goes to f5 with the equality as in many lines before. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O
{ This is the starting move of the classical King's Indian defense or so-called Mar del Plata variation. White takes over the center of the board and black counter attacks white with e5 in all situations where he can do that. Because of the e5 move, black will after d5 have an option to play on the kingside and white on the queenside. For the moment, black in unable to start play on the kingside because the center is still open and now start some operations on the kingside when the center is open will only be in white's favor. Because of that, before black can start operations on the kingside, he has to close the center. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the start of black's plan. First, close the center and then start operations on the kingside - even if that means that black has to lose a tempo because after d5 black has to remove the knight. }
8. d5 Ne7
{ This is the only real move that black has here. Nb8, Nb4 or Na5 are bad moves. It is important that this knight is for now not on the best square. Later on black will get this knight into play on the g6 or even Ng8 - h7 squares. }
9. b4
{ This is the start of so-called Bayonet attack in the Classical King's Indian. Thrusting the b4 pawn like a bayonet starts an immediate fight for the c5 square and the break that white wants to achieve. The thematical white break here is c4 - c5. Because of the pawn structure, white has more space and the upper hand for the play on the queenside and black have on the kingside. The move c4 - c5 is white's wish and f7 - f5 for a start is black's one. In order to push the pawn to c5, b4 is the preparation that white wants to make. }
9... Nh5
{ White starts immediate operations on the queenside so black has to go on the kingside. This is a thematic move that black plays in order to play f5 and open the front on the kingside. }
10. g3
{ This is the move that doesn't allow the black knight to jump on f4 but weaken little bit a kingside. This move was many years white try to find the advantage in this variations, but black find the way to fight against it. }
10... f5
{ Here this is the move that black has to play. The only real alternative that black has here is the move a5. I have tried this move few times myself with good results  (mostly in blitz games)  but the f5 move is I think the better one. One important thing is that when you will study the Kings Indian, please don't just go for the computer suggestions. Here also computer suggest as better than f5 moves like even Nf6, which is a bad one here. The computer doesn't understand the position there and will always be on the white side. }
11. Ng5
{ This is the most critical white move here. White goes for the very active play and likes to get the Ne6 move in order to get open the center there. Black has to be careful not to get a bad position after that white plan. }
11... Nf6 12. exf5
{ With this move, white wants to get the knight on the e4 square instead of the e6. }
12... Nxf5
{ This is better move then the gxf5. Now this knight is great there on the f5 square and easy can get the d4 square as well. }
13. Nge4 a5
{ White gets the knight on e4 but didn't manage to create something there. With the a5 move black just wants to destroy white pawn structure on the queenside. White didn't manage to develop the dark square bishop and now he can t go for the a3 move. }
14. Ba3 Nxe4 15. Nxe4 axb4 16. Bxb4 b6
{ Black manage to destroy the pawn structure on the queenside and with the next move Nd4 this knight will be the best piece on the board. }
17. a4 Nd4
{ Black is slightly better. His pieces are a little bit better and he has the better pawn structure. }

12... f4
{ The most important thing to know here is that there is no time to slowplay. Black immediately has to start the operations on the kingside and try to get the attack going. Now white has a few moves here. }
13. Qb3
{ With this move, white wants to get some kind of the pressure on the diagonal a2 - g8 after the move Ne6. Also, the queen, after the c4 - c5 break, can protect the white pawn on the e6. }

14... Ne8
{ Please remember this move. After the f4 move, when the white knight is on the g5 square, this move is better than the h6 move. After that move, white has to go for the Ne6 because black has the Nd5 move and then his queen can take the knight on the g5 square. Ne8 is a better move than h6 because now this knight secures the c7 square. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O
{ This is the starting move of the classical King's Indian defense or so-called Mar del Plata variation. White takes over the center of the board and black counter attacks white with e5 in all situations where he can do that. Because of the e5 move, black will after d5 have an option to play on the kingside and white on the queenside. For the moment, black in unable to start play on the kingside because the center is still open and now start some operations on the kingside when the center is open will only be in white's favor. Because of that, before black can start operations on the kingside, he has to close the center. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the start of black's plan. First, close the center and then start operations on the kingside - even if that means that black has to lose a tempo because after d5 black has to remove the knight. }
8. d5 Ne7
{ This is the only real move that black has here. Nb8, Nb4 or Na5 are bad moves. It is important that this knight is for now not on the best square. Later on black will get this knight into play on the g6 or even Ng8 - h7 squares. }
9. b4
{ This is the start of so-called Bayonet attack in the Classical King's Indian. Thrusting the b4 pawn like a bayonet starts an immediate fight for the c5 square and the break that white wants to achieve. The thematical white break here is c4 - c5. Because of the pawn structure, white has more space and the upper hand for the play on the queenside and black have on the kingside. The move c4 - c5 is white's wish and f7 - f5 for a start is black's one. In order to push the pawn to c5, b4 is the preparation that white wants to make. }
9... Nh5
{ White starts immediate operations on the queenside so black has to go on the kingside. This is a thematic move that black plays in order to play f5 and open the front on the kingside. }
10. g3
{ This is the move that doesn't allow the black knight to jump on f4 but weaken little bit a kingside. This move was many years white try to find the advantage in this variations, but black find the way to fight against it. }
10... f5
{ Here this is the move that black has to play. The only real alternative that black has here is the move a5. I have tried this move few times myself with good results  (mostly in blitz games)  but the f5 move is I think the better one. One important thing is that when you will study the Kings Indian, please don't just go for the computer suggestions. Here also computer suggest as better than f5 moves like even Nf6, which is a bad one here. The computer doesn't understand the position there and will always be on the white side. }
11. Ng5
{ This is the most critical white move here. White goes for the very active play and likes to get the Ne6 move in order to get open the center there. Black has to be careful not to get a bad position after that white plan. }
11... Nf6 12. f3
{ In my view this is the most natural and challenging white move here. This pawn now on f3 support the e4 pawn and secure the stable center there. }
12... f4
{ The most important thing to know here is that there is no time to slowplay. Black immediately has to start the operations on the kingside and try to get the attack going. Now white has a few moves here. }
13. Kg2
{ This is the idea that has been used by the GM Van Wely. White wants to get the king away from the g1 - a7 diagonal and then push the c4 - c5 break. }
13... c6
{ Now when white loses tempi for Kg2 and wants to push c4 - c5 black doesn't need to let him do that. After the c6, c4 - c5 is not good. }
14. Rb1
{ This is the alternative to the Qb3. Again, white is aiming for the b4 - b5 break. }
14... Ne8
{ The idea is to go with the next options like 15...h6 for black or even 16...Nxd5 because the knight on g5 is not protected. }
15. c5 h6 16. Ne6 Bxe6 17. dxe6 d5
{ And again, black managed to break with d5 and now the target is again the white pawn on the e6 square. The position is unclear with chances for both sides and black is by no mean worse. }

14. Qb3
{ This is somehow black victory in this line. Now, white abandon the c4 - c5 break and start using the b4 - b5 idea with the Ne6. I don't really believe in this, because white loses too much time here. If he wants to get this idea, there is no need to play Kg2. }
14... h6 15. Ne6 Bxe6 16. dxe6 Qc8 17. Rd1 Rd8
{ As in many lines there, black's idea is the same: secure the center square d5 and attack the white pawn on the e6 square. The position remains unclear and double - edged with great chances for black. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O
{ This is the starting move of the classical King's Indian defense or so-called Mar del Plata variation. White takes over the center of the board and black counter attacks white with e5 in all situations where he can do that. Because of the e5 move, black will after d5 have an option to play on the kingside and white on the queenside. For the moment, black in unable to start play on the kingside because the center is still open and now start some operations on the kingside when the center is open will only be in white's favor. Because of that, before black can start operations on the kingside, he has to close the center. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the start of black's plan. First, close the center and then start operations on the kingside - even if that means that black has to lose a tempo because after d5 black has to remove the knight. }
8. d5 Ne7
{ This is the only real move that black has here. Nb8, Nb4 or Na5 are bad moves. It is important that this knight is for now not on the best square. Later on black will get this knight into play on the g6 or even Ng8 - h7 squares. }
9. b4
{ This is the start of so-called Bayonet attack in the Classical King's Indian. Thrusting the b4 pawn like a bayonet starts an immediate fight for the c5 square and the break that white wants to achieve. The thematical white break here is c4 - c5. Because of the pawn structure, white has more space and the upper hand for the play on the queenside and black have on the kingside. The move c4 - c5 is white's wish and f7 - f5 for a start is black's one. In order to push the pawn to c5, b4 is the preparation that white wants to make. }
9... Nh5
{ White starts immediate operations on the queenside so black has to go on the kingside. This is a thematic move that black plays in order to play f5 and open the front on the kingside. }
10. Nd2
{ With the combination of the early b4 move, white doesn't achieve anything with this move. This move is much stronger immediately before b4 when doesn't allow black to jump with the knight to h5. }
10... Nf4 { Standard move to attack the white light square bishop. } 11. Nb3
{ This move again allows black to take the bishop and then open the position with f5. }
11... Nxe2+ 12. Qxe2 f5 { With unclear but nice position for black. } 13. f3
{ The idea of this move is to stop Black's kingside storm by answering. . .f4 with g2-g4. }
13... f4 14. g4 g5
{ I prefer to recommend the blocked position here. With the f4-pawn cramping the bishop and good prospects on the light squares, I don't believe Black can be in any way worse. }
15. Ba3 Ng6 16. c5 h5 17. h3 Rf7
{ The standard method for Black, preparing to defend both d6 and c7 in an economical way. }
18. Kf2 { The king will be safer away from the kingside. } 18... Bf8 19. Ke1
hxg4 20. hxg4 Rh7 21. Kd2 a5

{ And again this very important move. In this and similar positions that we saw early, black has to start immediate actions on the kingside with the pieces because the pawn attack is to slow. With this move, black makes a lot of pressure on this diagonal d1 - h5 when a white light square bishop is out of play on f1 or c4 or even exchanged for the black knight on f4. Now white has a couple of options. }
13. bxa5
{ With this move, white starts immediate operations on the queenside and doesn't care about the pressure on the d1 - h5 diagonal. Now black can make even bigger pressure thereby open the f file with thematic move f5. }
13... f5
{ White wants to open the f file and make even bigger pressure on the knight on f3. Now white has few options, but I believe that only the c5 is worth of try. H3 here is not good. }
14. c5 Rxa5 { Now black has time and takes the pawn back. } 15. Bb4 Ra8 16. Rb1
fxe4
{ Now black start with the same idea as in the positions before. Black takes the pawn on e4 to destroy white center and then proceed from there. White pawn on d5 will after that be under pressure because white's light square bishop has to be on f1 square. If white remove that light square bishop for instance on c4 to support the pawn on d5 as in some lines before, black has winning blow Ng2. }
17. Nxe4 Nh3+
{ With this tactical trick, black will improve the position of his pieces and activate all of them. White has enough resources for the defense but nothing more. }
18. Kh1 Rxa2
{ Please notice here that the knight on h3 is untouchable because of the knight on f3 and black rook is now activated on the second rank. The position is nice for black who has the initiative there. }

White takes over the center of the board and black counter attacks white with e5 in all situations where he can do that. Because of the e5 move, black will after d5 have an option to play on the kingside and white on the queenside. For the moment, black in unable to start play on the kingside because the center is still open and now start some operations on the kingside when the center is open will only be in white's favor. Because of that, before black can start operations on the kingside, he has to close the center. }

9. b4
{ This is the start of so-called Bayonet attack in the Classical King's Indian. Thrusting the b4 pawn like a bayonet starts an immediate fight for the c5 square and the break that white wants to achieve. The thematical white break here is c4 - c5. Because of the pawn structure, white has more space and the upper hand for the play on the queenside and black have on the kingside. The move c4 - c5 is white's wish and f7 - f5 for a start is black's one. In order to push the pawn to c5, b4 is the preparation that white wants to make. }

White get the rook on e1 in order to free the f1 square for the light square bishop, and also this rook supports the pawn on e4. }
10... a5
{ There is no doubt that here f5 is the main move and I try it also many times. Now, why a5 ? After f5 white has the move Ng5 and then in all the lines where black has to find incredibly precise moves to get a nice position. I like this move because it's in the spirit of all lines that I show you and somehow my guidance idea is to make something fresh, something that is not so much tested and analyzed as the move f5. }

13... f5
{ Black just start the operations on the kingside with the natural f5 move and get nice play. }
14. h3 Bh5
{ When a black pawn is on f5, then even this is possible because of white cant trap this light square bishop with g4. The position is nice for black. Black has enough play on the kingside and white start defending his position. Black has slight initiative but the position remains unclear where black can't be worst. }

White will usually build up on the queenside with the main play c5 break and support that break with b4 and a3. On the other side, the black plan is a standard pawn storm on the kingside with the starting move f5. One thing is here important, today you hardly ever see that move because black has the potential to slow down white on the queenside and because of that, nowadays Ne1 or b4 - the Bayonet attack - is more common. }
9... a5
{ I like this move here a lot. It is a move that slows down white's play on the queenside and has slowed the popularity of this variation. I have personally tested this move many times with good results mostly in blitz games at weekend tournaments. With this move black has somehow forced white to lose time in order to put the pawn on b4 and then on c5 because now he has to prepare b4 with b3. White can also try two rook moves, Rb1 and Ra2, which I think aren't as good. }
10. a3 { White's idea is to prepare b4 and black will try to slow that down. }
10... Bd7
{ This is the star move here. Black tries to put the pawn to the a4 pawn and exchange the a for the b pawn and not allow white to start a pawn storm with b4 and c5. }
11. Rb1
{ White plays this move in order to push the pawn on b4 without losing the tempi for preparation with b3 when black can't really stop b4. Nevertheless, this move now allows black to respond with a4 after which white will find it hard to organize something on the queenside. }
11... a4
{ This is the tricky move that black has here. After Bd7 that pawn is now defended and white can't get the position he wants with the b4 and c5 pawns. Nevertheless, white has to put the pawn to b4, because if not, how else to continue the play on the queenside? Anything else will be bad for him because black will then have a commanding lead on the kingside without white counter-play on the queenside. }
12. b4
{ Now it is important to understand that this is the only real move here for white. Other options are not good, because white can't take the black pawn on a4 and a waiting move will allow black to get what is likely to be a winning position on the kingside without white counterplay on the queenside. It's interesting to see how the computer evaluates this position: a little bit better for white and want to play the moves like Re1 and h3. This really is very bad because black will immediately start the attack on white king in the standard way with f5 and so on with an incredible initiative. }
12... axb3 13. Nxb3 b6
{ Here we have a position where black can stop white's main idea for a long, long time. C5 is not possible here and white has to find a way to continue. A4 and a5 are move that will potentially force black to exchange the b for the a - pawn and then c5 will be possible. But this is not easy to achieve. With the rook on b1 in order to even put this pawn to a4, white has to play Ra1 and lose the tempi. It's important to note that almost all white's pieces are on the queenside and it looks like white has great potential on the queenside. But without the pawn, the break is very hard to achieve because of the strong defensive block that black manages to get there. }
14. Ra1
{ Now white has to lose the tempi because once again, any other plan but the break on the queenside will be a positional disaster for white. }
14... Qe8
{ And now the move that stops white a4 and gets in my view clear advantage for black. Not the advantage right now, because all white pieces are developed and the game continues, but this is a long-term positional advantage. Black stops white play on the queenside and now has the time to take over the initiative and start an attack on the white king on the kingside with classical pawn storm f5, g5, h5 and so on. }

14. Be3 b6

Ne7 9. Ne1
{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for white o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }
9... Nd7
{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to clean the seventh row for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }

{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }
9... Nd7
{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }

{ This is an important black move here. With this move, black remove the king from the g - file because if white takes on f5 than black will recapture with the g - pawn and open the g - file. Next benefit from that move is the maneuver that black wants to make here. This is the Ng8 move with the idea to get this knight at some point on the h6 or f6 squares or even to support the move Bh6. The knight on e7 is the worst black piece and with this maneuver, black wants to place it in the better place. Now white has many moves that he can try. Let's go through all of them. }

Another benefit from that move is the maneuver that black wants to make here. This is the Ng8 move with the idea to get this knight at some point on the h6 or f6 squares or even to support the move Bh6. The knight on e7 is the worst black piece and with this maneuver, black wants to place it in the better place. Now white has many moves that he can try. Let's go through all of them. }
12. Be3 Ng8

13. Nd3 Bh6
{ One of the main black plan. With the knight on e7, this dark square bishop is a black worst piece there. Also, the white dark square bishop is great white attacking piece on the queenside and also can help white at some point in the defense on the kingside so black wants to exchange it. }
14. Qd2 Bxe3+
{ If white allows black this exchange, the position will improve into black favor. }
15. Qxe3 f4

16. Qf2 b6
{ Now black want to slow down white play on the queenside and doesn't allow him quick c4 - c5 break. After that, black will start operations on the kingside with h5 and play on the dark squares. The position is still unclear and equal with chances for both players. }

The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }

In the Classical Kings Indian, black always has the edge on the kingside. This is related with the pawn structure after e5 and d5. Black has more space and the pieces on the kingside and white on the queenside. }

The white ideal position of the pawns, for now, is h4 and g4 and if he can at some point he will try to close the game on the kingside. Black has to be careful not to allow that because if white manage to close the game on the kingside, on the queenside white is much better. }

The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }
10. Nd3
{ This is the first white main move here. The night on d3 support the c4 - c5 break and white hope for quick queenside play there. }
10... f5
{ Standard black response. As soon as possible, black has to start to build up the psosition on the kingside. Also is here nice to see that, for now, the knight on d7 prevent the c4 - c5 break. Now white has maybe even 10 moves that can play here. I will show you all that I think can be good for white and make sense here. }
11. f4
{ This is the move that is strategically bad. White has the advantage on the queenside and has to play there. When he starts to play on the kingside this only helps black. }
11... exf4 { Black just has to open the game. } 12. Nxf4 Nc5

13. Be3 { This is a better move than exf5 here. Now black has to take on e4. }
13... Nxe4 14. Nxe4 fxe4 15. g4

15... h5

16. h3 hxg4 17. hxg4 Bxb2 { Now black can take on b2 and get a nice position. }
18. Rb1 Be5 19. Qd2 Rf7
{ White has the compensation for the pawn but nothing more. The position is about equal with for now an extra pawn for black. }

{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }

For instance hee if you take a look, the computer will always give white the advantage, here even a white is much better. This is for sure not a good evaluation.

One thing that I have to say here once again is that when you play the Kings Indian don't try to blindly look the computer suggestions. For instance hee if you take a look, the computer will always give white the advantage, here even a white is much better. This is for sure not a good evaluation. This position is unclear completely with by no means worst chances for black. }

{ Here once again I have to show you the first line of the computer that is very bad. This is the move after which white gains incredible space on the queenside but now can't proceed with the play there because the position is completely closed. After that move, it's all about the black play on the kingside. }
18... Bf8 19. Bd2 Rg7

Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square.

The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on.

Here I have to say that black light square bishop is a key piece in all those actions on the kingside. After blacks break g5 - g4 - g3 the bishop has to be alive in order for black to be able to sacrifice it on h3. Without this light square, the bishop will be hard for black to break through the white defense after easy move h3. }

{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }
9... Nd7
{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }

10... f5

Now white has maybe even 10 moves that can play here. I will show you all that I think can be good for white and make sense here. }
11. Bd2

{ What we see here, we have seen in some other lines before as well. The black standard idea is here also the best one. Rook goes to f7, dark square bishop to the f8, Rg7, and g4 will be possible. Now white can play with both rooks on c1. }
18. Rfc1 Bf8 19. a4 Nh4
{ The main move here that black try is g4, but I like this move slightly more. Black can prepare g5 - g4 for a little bit more because for now white didn't make anything on the queenside and black has enough time. }

12. f3 { White secures the e4 pawn. } 12... f4
{ Now black can and has to close the game in the center in order to maintain the kingside attack. }
13. c5

16. Bb4 Nfxd5
{ This is a classic trick in those type of the positions where black clear the h4 - d8 diagonal for the queen. After the Qh4 will be hard for white to save himself against the mate on h2. Remember this trick. }
17. Qb3 Kh8

To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square.

The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on.

{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }

{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }

{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }
9... Nd7
{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }
10. Be3
{ This is the first white option that he can try here. Interesting is to know that great Victor Korchnoi uses it regularly in his games with white against the Kings Indian. The move Be3 has one great side and this is the fact that on the diagonal h2 - a7 he will accelerate white play and the break c4 - c5. The other, bad side of that move for white is the fact that after f5 - f4, black will get important tempi for the kingside attack. The positions that arrive here are incredibly rich and complicated with enormous potential for both sides. This is why I like Kings Indian. }
10... f5 { Standard black reaction. } 11. f3 f4 12. Bf2 g5
{ Now is easy to see that here if we compare this position to the position without the Be3 black get one tempo for f4. Nevertheless, white now have the dark square bishop on the g1 - a7 diagonal where he will support the c4 - c5 break. In this position black idea is the same as in the Nd3 variation to push g5 - g4 - g3 pawn and attack the white king. Now white has many possible moves there. Let's see what white can try here. }
13. Nd3 Ng6
{ Here in the position where white doesn't lose the move for the Rc1 black has to abandon the idea of Rf6 because white is after 14. c5 first in the attack. }
14. c5 Nf6
{ Here again black play to his original idea Rf7, Bf8 and then prepare the g5 - g4 break. }
15. Rc1 Rf7

18... cxd6 19. Nb5 g4

20. Nxa7 Bd7 { Just don't allow white t exchange your light squared bishop. }
21. Nb5 h4
{ White lose again as in the line before too many moves and the time on the queenside and black managed to get an incredible attack on the kingside. Black compensation for the pawn is enormous and I think that black is better here. This kingside attack is huge there. }

The move Be3 has one great side and this is the fact that on the diagonal h2 - a7 he will accelerate white play and the break c4 - c5. The other, bad side of that move for white is the fact that after f5 - f4, black will get important tempi for the kingside attack. The positions that arrive here are incredibly rich and complicated with enormous potential for both sides. This is why I like Kings Indian. }

{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }

{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook.

{ This is a tricky white try. He plays Nb5 with the idea to jump on a7 in order to exchange the knight for the black bishop on c8. Because we know that this bishop is the black piece that he has to have in order to play for the mate on the white king, black can't allows that. }
13... b6 { Best black move. Black can't allow Na7. } 14. b4 a6

{ Very nice black move. This move prevents white knight on a3 to come in to play on c4 square. }
17. Nac2 g4

Ne7 9. Ne1
{ This is the most interesting and complicated move, line and variation in the Classical King's Indian. White has standard plan to play on the queenside with the basic c4 - c5 move there. To prepare this, he will play here at some point c5 even without the move b4. This c4 - c5 break white prepares with the moves Nd3 and Be3. Ne1 is a good move for white because after this move black can't put the knight on the most active square h5 and the knight from e1 will come to the d3 supporting the c5 break. Also, there is a possibility for wite o use this knight sometimes as the kingside defender on the g2 square after the move g4. In this variation, we have two subvariations. One is with the dark square bishop on e3 and the other is without the white dark square bishop on e3  (mainly that bishop goes to the d2 square. As I mentioned above, this is an incredible variation with enormous possibilities for both sides. In many lines, white gets a huge advantage on the queenside, but black kingside attack sometimes ended as the mate.) }
9... Nd7
{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }
10. Be3
{ This is the first white option that he can try here. Interesting is to know that great Victor Korchnoi uses it regularly in his games with white against the Kings Indian. The move Be3 has one great side and this is the fact that on the diagonal h2 - a7 he will accelerate white play and the break c4 - c5. The other, bad side of that move for white is the fact that after f5 - f4, black will get important tempi for the kingside attack. The positions that arrive here are incredibly rich and complicated with enormous potential for both sides. This is why I like Kings Indian. }
10... f5 { Standard black reaction. } 11. f3 f4 12. Bf2 g5
{ Now is easy to see that here if we compare this position to the position without the Be3 black get one tempo for f4. Nevertheless, white now have the dark square bishop on the g1 - a7 diagonal where he will support the c4 - c5 break. In this position black idea is the same as in the Nd3 variation to push g5 - g4 - g3 pawn and attack the white king. Now white has many possible moves there. Let's see what white can try here. }

13... b6 { Best black move. Black can't allow Na7. } 14. b4 a6
{ And now black remove the white knight on b5. } 15. Nc3
{ After that move black can't play b5 because the knight is on c3 and he doesn't want to get on the c4 square. Nevertheless, here this knight doesn't have a clear future on the c3 square and black can proceed with his kingside play. }
15... Rf6
{ This is here a great move. Black wants to put the rook on h6 and then bring the queen on e8 and h5 with the mating attack on h2 square. This is a very direct and dangerous plan for white. }
16. a4
{ With this move, white wants to show that he is not afraid of black kingside plan and go for the initiative on the queenside. }
16... Rh6 17. a5
{ This is similar to the Nd3 move. White just remain with his main idea on the queenside and wait to see how black will attack him on the kingside. }
17... Qe8 { This is the black move according to his main idea Qe8 - h5. } 18.
Kh1
{ White prepare the defense against Qh5. He wants to play Bg1 to defend the h2 pawn with the dark square bishop. }
18... bxa5 19. Rxa5 Nf6 20. Nd3 Qh5 21. Bg1 Qg6
{ Black brings all the pieces close to the opponent's king and now his initiative there is in my view much more important than white advantage on the queenside. The position remains double-edged, but in my view, the black kingside attack is more important than white on the queenside. I prefer black here. }

{ This is the first white option that he can try here. Interesting is to know that great Victor Korchnoi uses it regularly in his games with white against the Kings Indian. The move Be3 has one great side and this is the fact that on the diagonal h2 - a7 he will accelerate white play and the break c4 - c5. The other, bad side of that move for white is the fact that after f5 - f4, black will get important tempi for the kingside attack. The positions that arrive here are incredibly rich and complicated with enormous potential for both sides. This is why I like Kings Indian. }
10... f5 { Standard black reaction. } 11. f3 f4 12. Bf2 g5
{ Now is easy to see that here if we compare this position to the position without the Be3 black get one tempo for f4. Nevertheless, white now have the dark square bishop on the g1 - a7 diagonal where he will support the c4 - c5 break. In this position black idea is the same as in the Nd3 variation to push g5 - g4 - g3 pawn and attack the white king. Now white has many possible moves there. Let's see what white can try here. }
13. Nb5
{ This is a tricky white try. He plays Nb5 with the idea to jump on a7 in order to exchange the knight for the black bishop on c8. Because we know that this bishop is the black piece that he has to have in order to play for the mate on the white king, black can't allows that. }
13... b6 { Best black move. Black can't allow Na7. } 14. b4 a6

{ After that move black can't play b5 because the knight is on c3 and he doesn't want to get on the c4 square. Nevertheless, here this knight doesn't have a clear future on the c3 square and black can proceed with his kingside play. }
15... Rf6
{ This is here a great move. Black wants to put the rook on h6 and then bring the queen on e8 and h5 with the mating attack on h2 square. This is a very direct and dangerous plan for white. }

The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on.

{ This is the only black move here that make sense. The white plan is to ramp up the pressure and start play on the queenside and black has to do the same on the kingside. With this move, black removes the knight from f6 in order to play the f5 break and start the kingside attack. Now black has this general plan: play on the kingside with the move f5 - f4, then g5 and sometimes even h5 - h4. The main black pawn break on the kingside is the g4 - g3 break, one knight goes from d7 back and the second one in most positions goes from e7 to the g6 square. The rook from f8 comes to f7 with multiple purposes, first o free the f8 square for the black dark square bishop and the second thing is that he can support the attack with the Rg7 or h7 move later on. The black dark square bishop goes from g7 to f8 in order to defend the pawn on d6 later and to free the 7-the rank for the rook. Remember that black is better on the kingside and has to play there, but at some point, if you can, try to slow down white's play on the queenside. }
10. Be3
{ This is the first white option that he can try here. Interesting is to know that great Victor Korchnoi uses it regularly in his games with white against the Kings Indian. The move Be3 has one great side and this is the fact that on the diagonal h2 - a7 he will accelerate white play and the break c4 - c5. The other, bad side of that move for white is the fact that after f5 - f4, black will get important tempi for the kingside attack. The positions that arrive here are incredibly rich and complicated with enormous potential for both sides. This is why I like Kings Indian. }
10... f5 { Standard black reaction. } 11. f3 f4 12. Bf2 g5
{ Now is easy to see that here if we compare this position to the position without the Be3 black get one tempo for f4. Nevertheless, white now have the dark square bishop on the g1 - a7 diagonal where he will support the c4 - c5 break. In this position black idea is the same as in the Nd3 variation to push g5 - g4 - g3 pawn and attack the white king. Now white has many possible moves there. Let's see what white can try here. }
13. a4
{ I think that is the most dangerous move for black here. Even the Kasparov who was I think the best player who plays Kings Indian with black pieces for many many years, play this against Yusupov with the white pieces. The white main idea is first to bring this pawn to a5 and make a big pressure on the black queenside before the concrete action there. }

Once, when you take of f3 like here, then this bishop doesn't have his original idea anymore and you can exchange it and get the knight pair to make the pressure on the kingside. Here, white wants to take on g3 with the pawn and the bishop and then is much better to have the knight for he aggression like Nh5 - f4 and so on. White has a standard advantage and the plan to move on the queenside and black has to play on the kingside. Again, this is a clear race where black can't be worse. }

11... Kh8
{ This is an important black move here. With this move, black remove the king from the g - file because if white takes on f5 than black will recapture with the g - pawn and open the g - file. Next benefit from that move is the maneuver that black wants to make here. This is the Ng8 move with the idea to get this knight at some point on the h6 or f6 squares or even to support the move Bh6. The knight on e7 is the worst black piece and with this maneuver, black wants to place it in the better place. Now white has many moves that he can try. Let's go through all of them. }

Now, here it is important that this is not as good in this Saemisch setup, because white worst square here, and the most vulnerable, is d4. That means that this dark square bishop belongs on the e3 square from which he will control it.

It is similar to positions in the Benko gambit where white has problems because his dark square bishop has to be on the queenside to protect the position and the pawns there. For instance: }

{ This is the move after which we have the Samisch Variation in the King's Indian. White plays f3 in order to immediately support the pawn on e4 and then to develop the dark square bishop and the queen on the long dark diagonal c1 - h6. He does this in order to castle queenside and put pressure on the black kingside or even after that to castle long, bring the king on b1 and the rook on c1 with once again the classical King's Indian plan c4 - c5. White can try this plan only if black plays the main variation with e5. Today, black often plays c7 - c5 in order not to allow white this idea. Nevertheless, I am a principled player and I think that the e5 break here can also bring black a nice position. Please note, I will show in the main line that there is one line that white can use in order to avoid the e5 move. }

{ Now black get the second pawn and need only one more to get full material equality.

I really like this position for black because white doesn't have a clear target and is hard to break through a black position on the kingside or even on the kingside. With a couple of white weaknesses there, black can even play for more than equality. And finally, if the Kasparov himself recommend this line for black it has to be incredibly good one. }

That means that this dark square bishop belongs on the e3 square from which he will control it. It's not often that white goes for this move but also, unfortunately for him, black can use the move here that will mainly transpose the position to the main line where black will have the extra move that I think is not critical for either side. }

This is completely different than almost all other positions in the King's Indian because here white doesn't want to get any active play, just wants to squeeze black and not giving him any active play on entire board, not only kingside.

4... O-O 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O Nc6
{ Now, this was a star move for me when I start to analyze this move order and the possibility here for black. With this move, black doesn't want only to break in the center with e5 but set up the position for play on the queenside. }
7. Nc3
{ This is the most natural white move and in the spirit of his main idea to just get the tension in the center without the clarifying the position of the central pawns. }

8. Qd3
{ This is another move in the spirit of the white plan here in the Fianchetto variation. White wants to develop the psieces but without clarifying the center. Obviously, this is a better move than Bd2 that we saw in the line before. }

{ Nice positional move. Black wants to get the pressure on the d4 pawn immediately. }
9. h3 Bxf3 10. Bxf3 e5 { Black just want to take the d4 square. } 11. d5 Nd4
{ Black manages to do that and has a nice position here. Please notice that here black gives white the bishop pair but the position is closed and here black knights are better than white bishops. Also, a white light square bishop doesn't have any active plan here and is a white worst piece. Potentially, if black manages to get the endgame with the knight against the white light square bishop that can be a disaster for white. }
12. Bg2 c5 13. dxc6 bxc6 14. b4 c5

4... O-O 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O Nc6
{ Now, this was a star move for me when I start to analyze this move order and the possibility here for black. With this move, black doesn't want only to break in the center with e5 but set up the position for play on the queenside. }
7. Nc3
{ This is the most natural white move and in the spirit of his main idea to just get the tension in the center without the clarifying the position of the central pawns. }
7... a6
{ a6 is here nice waiting move. Black wants to see the white reaction here and also this move as ve seen in the lines before is always good to support the b5 later. Now white can try many different things. }
8. b3
{ This is an interesting white try here. If we now that the best idea to the wite Double FInachetto is c5 break and here the knight is on c6 now, we have to be precise with the next few moves in order to get the nice play. }
8... Rb8
{ Important move that black has to know here in order to get a nice position. Other moves are not sufficient to equalize in my opinion. Rb8 is a great move because of the b5 and than a potential bxc4 which will open the b - file where black rook will be on a perfect square. }
9. Bb2
{ This is the move in the spirit of the b3 move in the move before. Now white place the second bishop on great long diagonal a1 - h8. The potential problem for white as we mention can be the open b - file after the bxc4. }
9... b5 10. cxb5
{ The most principled move. White doesn't want to open b - file. } 10... axb5
11. Rc1
{ That move is much better than the Re1. Rook on c1 makes the pressure on the half-open c - file and the knight on the c6. }
11... b4 { With this move, black wants to isolate the white knight on a4. } 12.
Na4 Na5
{ Black knight has to go because is under attack from the white rook on c1. }
13. Qc2 { Now white attacks black pawn on c7. } 13... c6
{ Black defends the pawn and with the next moves Ba6 and Bb5 her will secure this pawn on c6 with the nice position. White again has little bit more space but black pieces are on nice squares and manage to cover everything. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3
{ This is the starting position in the so-called Fianchetto variation. The white idea is here to not allow black the standard play on the kingside because he will not close the center and then there will not be the space for black to attack the white king. Also, this light square bishop defends the white king on the kingside. White like to develop the pieces here and aims for the long positional maneuvering without in my view the advantage but the nature of the position can be annoying for black. To be honest, I play the King's Indian for my entire chess life, more than 20 years and I had the biggest problems in this system.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3
{ This is the starting position in the so-called Fianchetto variation. The white idea is here to not allow black the standard play on the kingside because he will not close the center and then there will not be the space for black to attack the white king. Also, this light square bishop defends the white king on the kingside. White like to develop the pieces here and aims for the long positional maneuvering without in my view the advantage but the nature of the position can be annoying for black. To be honest, I play the King's Indian for my entire chess life, more than 20 years and I had the biggest problems in this system. This is completely different than almost all other positions in the King's Indian because here white doesn't want to get any active play, just wants to squeeze black and not giving him any active play on entire board, not only kingside. Now, I will try here to think of almost all the systems that can be used and then start playing the system that will show you now, with which I get nice active positions. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3
{ On the second move white can play Nf3 instead of c4 and if he wants to play Classical King's Indian later he can just transpose. When white plays Nf3 on the second move, more often than not he will try to go for the Fianchetto or even The Double Fianchetto Variation. }
2... g6 3. g3
{ This is the start of the Fianchetto Variation. White puts the light square bishop on g2 and gets a solid position on the kingside and a safe king. Here in this chapter, I would like to show you how to play against the Double Fianchetto. }
3... Bg7 4. b3
{ This is the start of the Double Fianchetto. White wants to get both his bishops on the best diagonal on the board. The plan is obvious, white doesn't want to get into a pawn race and with this system he likes to try to go for a slight positional edge. His idea is to get a positional advantage on the whole board, not only on the queenside and that is connected mainly with the open position in the center. Usually, this line is played by white players who like don't like to get attacked on the kingside. }
4... d6 5. Bb2
{ Until this point, everything has been pretty much straightforward. Now, black has to make a decision. He can go for the castle here and then start to think about the plan of playing for c5 or even e5 at some point, but I really like the clear c5 break here before the castle. Black has to be careful and not allow white to complete his setup because then it will be really hard for him to get active counterplay. }
5... c5
{ This is the move that I think is the best one here and I want to advise you to go for it immediately. Because of the double fianchetto and the position of the white pieces it is really hard to break with e5. Just remember what we say about this situation: if black can't go for e5, he needs to go for c5. }
6. dxc5 Qa5+
{ This is the move that is really good to remember here. With this move, black slightly uncoordinated white pieces and take the pawn back on c5 in this particular position. Also, be careful with some moves like dxc5 because of the future white aggression on both long diagonals a1 - h8 and h1 - a8. Always go for the Qa5 - c5 and avoid the dxc5. }
7. Nbd2 Qxc5 { And black get the pawn back with the nice position. } 8. e3
{ Here black also has a trick and if white makes the mistake with 8. Bg2, black win the game immediately with the Ng4. }
8... O-O 9. Bg2 Bf5 10. c4 Qc8 11. O-O Nc6
{ And black manage to get all the pieces into play and with the pressure on the h3 - c8 diagonal with the potential play on the queenside after the exchange of the light square bishop on h3 soon, black has a nice position. }

{ This is the most aggressive white play against the King's Indian. White wants to immediately to punish black for somehow passive play. It's important to understand that this is not so easy and black has great chances here as in many other variations. The biggest problem for white is the fact that the pawns don't go back and at some point, if black manage to stop white from getting forward, especially on the e4 - e5 break, white pawns can potentially be weak and targets for the black pieces. }
5... O-O 6. Nf3 c5
{ Here I have to say that black can even try to play e5 with the Na6 and then e5 and this is also not so bad for black. Nevertheless, I like more the approach that I will show you now with c5. One thing that is important to know here is that players who play The Four Pawn Attack like sharp positions. After the system that I will show you now, black will be able to block white from the aggression in the next couple of moves. }
7. dxc5 { This is the only real alternative to the d5. } 7... Na6

8. Bd3
{ This is the move that doesn't make sense. Black play Na6 to get this knight on the c5 square. With the Bd3 white just help black to get this even with the tempi because then white light square bishop on d3 will be under attack. }

Now when black start the attack on those pawns, they can become weak at any point. I think that black, in the long run, has just a little bit more pleasant position. }

After that, black will build up the position on the kingside with f4, g5, h5, g4, h4, Nf6 and so on. Black has the bishop pair and will first start operations on the kingside. Because of that, black has the initiative and I believe better chances here. }

16. Nd2 fxg3 17. hxg3 Bg4
{ This is the move after which I believe black has a nice initiative and more than sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. He puts incredible pressure on the white light square bishop and with the next move Rae8, this pressure will be even bigger. On the other side, all pawns on the white queenside are weak and the black knight on a6 has a nice future on the c5 square from where he can put a lot of pressure on the queenside. Black is at least equal here even with a pawn less. }

7. O-O e5 8. fxe5 dxe5 9. Nbd2 e4
{ With better position for black. White is passive and black pieces easily can get into a play. Black idea is to go for the play on the kingside with the moves like h5, Bf5 and so on. }

{ That's the position in the so-called "London" system. First of all, I would like to say that in my view the most unpleasant black setup against this setup that white try. The main "London setup is with the black pawn on d5 and not on d6. There the center is locked and black doesn't have active couterchances in the center and white get a small but long-term advantage. Here, with the d6 instead of the d5, black has a much more active play and white cant really hope for the small long-term advantage, because there will be a sharp battle in the next few moves. This setup in the KID is a nightmare for any London" player. }

4... c5
{ This is the move that I think is good to avoid main white territory in the London system. Here black immediately wants to avoid symmetrical structure and fight for more than equality. }
5. e3
{ This is the most solid and semi-automatic move that "London players" use here. White just secure the d4 pawn and want to proceed from there. Next moves will be c3 and Be2. The setup that will introduce here, will be a very nice practical decision because white players love static center and slowly improving on the kingside using the e5 square and here this is impossible. Black close with the d6 the dark square bishop and also cover the e5 square. There will be very dynamic positions, not static one that white likes and because of that I really believe that this is the most challenging way of playing that white players will fight against. }

The main "London setup is with the black pawn on d5 and not on d6. There the center is locked and black doesn't have active couterchances in the center and white get a small but long-term advantage. Here, with the d6 instead of the d5, black has a much more active play and white cant really hope for the small long-term advantage, because there will be a sharp battle in the next few moves. This setup in the KID is a nightmare for any London" player. }
3... Bg7 4. Nbd2
{ This is white the main alternative to the Nc3 with the idea to go for the e4 without the c4 move there and hope for the some of Pirc positions. }
4... c5
{ This is the move that I think is good to avoid main white territory in the London system. Here black immediately wants to avoid symmetrical structure and fight for more than equality. }
5. e3
{ This is the most solid and semi-automatic move that "London players" use here. White just secure the d4 pawn and want to proceed from there. Next moves will be c3 and Be2. The setup that will introduce here, will be a very nice practical decision because white players love static center and slowly improving on the kingside using the e5 square and here this is impossible. Black close with the d6 the dark square bishop and also cover the e5 square. There will be very dynamic positions, not static one that white likes and because of that I really believe that this is the most challenging way of playing that white players will fight against. }
5... b6
{ Black secure the c5 pawn and prepare the Fianchetto of the light square bishop. }
6. c3 { The last move that secures the white pawn on d4. } 6... Bb7 7. Bd3
{ This is one of two possibilities that white has here. He has to choose where to put this light square bishop. The alternative is Be2, and the h3 will here just transpose to one of the following lines now. }
7... O-O 8. O-O d6
{ Black also for now just go for the development and the setup of the pieces as in some lines in the KID. }
9. Re1 Nbd7

10. h3
{ This is just waiting for the white move here. White secure the square for the dark square bishop and wait to see what black wants to do here. The dropback is the fact that black develop all the pieces and is prepared now for the concrete play. In my view, this is not a good idea for white here. }
10... e5
{ I really like this move. Black sacrifices the pawn for a great play here. He can also wait here and improve the position of his pieces with the moves like Re8, Rc8 but white lose some time and there is the perfect moment to strike in the center. }
11. dxe5 dxe5 12. Bxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Ne8 { Now the knight on e5 is hanging. }

I really believe that black has to be even slightly better, because white has to find some really precise moves, not to lose the game immediately. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4
{ This is the so popular "London" setup. Here white wants to play e3, c3 and then Nd2 and Nf3 in order to get the small advantage against almost all black setups. As I mention, almost all, because against the Kings Indian, that is not the play that will secure him easy play. Black again can play very aggressive and get nice positions. }
2... g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e4
{ This is a white pawn sacrifice in which I really don't believe. After the dxe4 white has the f3 move, but I really like the main alternative in which I really believe and in my view white will be worst at the end. }
4... Nxe4
{ There is no need to go for many forced lines after dxe4. Here, black will easily get a better position. }
5. Nxe4 dxe4 6. f3 Bg7
{ Black doesn't take the pawn on the f3, but make the pressure on the d4 pawn and develop the piece on g7. }
7. c3 c5
{ Again, aggression before the pawn. There is no need to allow white to finish the development after the exf3. Much better is to go for the initiative than for the pawn. }
8. d5
{ This is a better option then dxc5. White has to close the center and slow down black initiative. }
8... Qb6 { Now the b2 pawn is under attack. } 9. Qa4+
{ This is the white idea here to get the tempi for the castle on the queenside. Again, as in the line before, I really dislike this, because the white king is much more safe on the kingside then on the queenside. }
9... Nd7 10. O-O-O O-O 11. fxe4 Qf6
{ Now black wants to prevent white center pawns from advancing by blocking them on the dark squares. }
12. Bg3 Ne5 { Now white pawns are blocked. } 13. Kb1 Bd7 14. Qc2 b5

5. e4 O-O 6. e5
{ This is now the only white idea here. If he managed to break with the e4 he has to go further and play e5 here. Other moves don't make sense here or will just transpose. }
6... Nfd7 7. h4
{ Main white plan. Just straightforward attack on the black king. This looks dangerous for black, but it isn't. White doesn't have enough pieces to get a big attack. First of all, he has to develop the pieces and then get the attack going, here, black will easily counter attack him. }
7... c5 { Black immediately strike in the center. } 8. Nxd5
{ This is just bad because white wants to attack the black on the kingside and wants to close the center in order to be able to attack him. Once when the center will get opened, there will be hard to attack the black king. }
8... Nc6 9. dxc5 Nxc5 10. Qd2 Be6
{ Black is again much better. He will take the pawn on e5 in the next move and all the black pieces are better placed then white. This is the setup for white that is not so good because he tries to break black position on the kingside only with the few pieces when almost half of the pieces are still undeveloped. This is not a good idea. Black takes over the initiative and gets a clear advantage here. }

4... Bg7 5. Bh6
{ This is the most direct way to attack black kingside. White wants to exchange the dark square bishop in order to weak the dark squares on the black kingside. In some positions  (for example in the Sicilian Dragon)  this is the most dangerous idea that white can try, but here this is to early and black manage to get even maybe better position with the quick counter-attack in the center based on the c5 move. White is too slow on the kingside because there doesn't have enough pieces for now. }
5... Bxh6
{ I believe in this move. Black just exchange the dark square bishop and doesn't castle immediately on the kingside. For the time that white lost to exchange this bishop, black will get a few tempi to develop the pieces. }

White doesn't have any real plan and still has to find the way where to put the pieces from the kingside. Black is a little bit better in my opinion. Black does have to be afraid of this aggressive setup of white. Just be aware of the quick c5 counter-attack and the tempi that you can get in those positions here. This is for sure not the line where white can hope for any advantage at all and he can easily be a worst. }

The main 'London setup is with the black pawn on d5 and not on d6. There the center is locked and black doesn't have active couterchances in the center and white get a small but long-term advantage.

The setup that will introduce here, will be a very nice practical decision because white players love static center and slowly improving on the kingside using the e5 square and here this is impossible. Black close with the d6 the dark square bishop and also cover the e5 square. There will be very dynamic positions, not static one that white likes and because of that I really believe that this is the most challenging way of playing that white players will fight against. }

{ This is white the main alternative to the Nc3 with the idea to go for the e4 without the c4 move there and hope for the some of Pirc positions. }
4... c5
{ This is the move that I think is good to avoid main white territory in the London system. Here black immediately wants to avoid symmetrical structure and fight for more than equality. }
5. e3
{ This is the most solid and semi-automatic move that 'London players' use here. White just secure the d4 pawn and want to proceed from there. Next moves will be c3 and Be2. The setup that will introduce here, will be a very nice practical decision because white players love static center and slowly improving on the kingside using the e5 square and here this is impossible. Black close with the d6 the dark square bishop and also cover the e5 square. There will be very dynamic positions, not static one that white likes and because of that I really believe that this is the most challenging way of playing that white players will fight against. }
5... b6
{ Black secure the c5 pawn and prepare the Fianchetto of the light square bishop. }
6. c3 { The last move that secures the white pawn on d4. } 6... Bb7 7. Bd3

{ Black also for now just go for the development and the setup of the pieces as in some lines in the KID. }
9. Re1 Nbd7

10. e4 cxd4
{ The first black has to take on the d4 in order to later get the rook on the c8 for the play on the queenside. }
11. cxd4 e5

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. d5
{ This is a more ambitious line and move than 4. e3. With this move white gets space in the center and prepares the e4 move. The drawback is in the fact that with this move white opens up a great diagonal for the black dark square bishop, who will now become a monster on the g7 square and potentially allow black to attack and undermine his center with b5 or a6 and b5 on the queenside. Another possibility for black is to start undermining white's center with the e6 move. Those are two main ideas for black now. }
5... h6
{ This looks like a little move, but in the fact, this is big and strong one. With h6 here, as we mentioned before, black wants to ensure that white's dark square bishop will never go back on the queenside if he now goes on h4. After that black can easily organize the play on the queenside. }
6. Bf4
{ This is one of two possible replies from white here in this position. White dark square bishop is under attack and he needs to go back. With this move, white doesn't want to abandon the queenside with this bishop and stay in the diagonal where he can go way back to c1. The drawback is now that white doesn't make the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. The main alternative to this move is 6. Bh4 and this move we will cover in next variation. }
6... d6
{ Standard move from black. Here is this also some kind of the waiting move. Black wants to see what white will do in the next move. Also, this move stop white d - pawn from advancing, open light squared diagonal and secure d7 square for the black queenside knight. }
7. e4
{ Standard move from white. With e4 white here secure d5 square and occupy the center with his e - pawn. White now has the advantage in the center but incredible black dark square bishop on g7 and possibly undermining move b5 or a6 and b5 secure him more than enough counterplay. }
7... g5
{ This is now clever black move. With h6 black prepare g5 with the idea to secure the f4 square and now white need to show his idea and where he wants to get with his dark square bishop. Slight drawback is in the fact that with this move black little bit weak his position on the kingside and need to be careful later on. Now white has three moves. }
8. Be3
{ The first possible move is here 8. Be3. This is in my view the worst one, because now white allow black Ng4 with the attack on the bishop and the possibility to get on the best possible square e5 with the tempo. After that move black will be even slightly better. }
8... Ng4
{ The strong move that with the tempo transpose black knight to dream position on e5. Black gets the initiative here in this line. }
9. Bd2 Bd4
{ Another strong move that doesn't allows white to make nice developing moves. Now, instead to get the knight on f3, white need to develop it on the edge of the board with no chance to go in to play early in the game. Also, on h3 this knight will be under pressure from a black light square bishop from c8. Black gets here nice initiative and white need to defend the position from 10. move. Nice example how easy black can get initiative after an only little mistake from white in the Kings Indian. }
10. Nh3 { The only move that can defend f2 pawn. } 10... Ne5
{ Black manages to transpose the knight the bishop to the beautifull positions in the center  (e5 and d4)  and get the initiative in only 10 moves. White now needs to defend the position and try to exchange few piece in order to defend the position and neutralize black initiative. Black is slightly better and the main idea is to try to secure center squares for his pieces and with a6 and b5 to get some chances on the queenside. }

8... Qa5
{ Black now can be aggressive and start to get some serious pressure on the white queenside. With Qa5 black make the pressure on the e4 pawn and pinning the white knight on c3, when white dark square bishop cant helps him from g3 square. This is one of the main ideas from black when white dark square bishop stays on the wrong side of the table. }
9. Bd3 { White need to defend his attacks e4 pawn. } 9... Nbd7

10. Nf3
{ This stop black knight from getting on e5 square but allow the activity of the other knight who will make the pressure on the dark square bishop on g3. }
10... Nh5
{ Key move and the idea of this position. After black make himself possibility of Ne5 and white knight need to prevent this by playing Nf3, black get the option to play Nh5 because knight from f3 cover the h5 square and now white queen cant take the black knight. This move is here important because now white bishop cant escape and black will get the bishop pair, but also with this move black stop white from playing an h4 move that can be good for him because black kingside is slightly exposed. After the black exchange the dark square bishop from g3 there will be no real attacking chances for white. }

{ This is a more solid move that will immediately make this position equal. Nevertheless, black can now take the dark square bishop and force the exchange the pair of the knights after which he will get the position with the bishop pair. }
11... Nxg3 12. hxg3 Ne5
{ As ve mention before, now black exchange the pair of the knight and get the position with the bishop pair. }
13. Nxe5 Bxe5
{ We can now evaluate this position as the equal one, but black stay with the bishop pair that can be very important in the long run because if the position gets opened at some point, bishop pair can make a lot of pressure on the white position. Standard plan for black here is to get the light square bishop on d7 and prepare b5 break with a6 and Rb8. Also be careful and castle on the kingside only when white castle short. Stay with the king in the center as long as white does. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. d5
{ This is a more ambitious line and move than 4. e3. With this move white gets space in the center and prepares the e4 move. The drawback is in the fact that with this move white opens up a great diagonal for the black dark square bishop, who will now become a monster on the g7 square and potentially allow black to attack and undermine his center with b5 or a6 and b5 on the queenside. Another possibility for black is to start undermining white's center with the e6 move. Those are two main ideas for black now. }
5... h6
{ This looks like a little move, but in the fact, this is big and strong one. With h6 here, as we mentioned before, black wants to ensure that white's dark square bishop will never go back on the queenside if he now goes on h4. After that black can easily organize the play on the queenside. }
6. Bf4
{ This is one of two possible replies from white here in this position. White dark square bishop is under attack and he needs to go back. With this move, white doesn't want to abandon the queenside with this bishop and stay in the diagonal where he can go way back to c1. The drawback is now that white doesn't make the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. The main alternative to this move is 6. Bh4 and this move we will cover in next variation. }
6... d6
{ Standard move from black. Here is this also some kind of the waiting move. Black wants to see what white will do in the next move. Also, this move stop white d - pawn from advancing, open light squared diagonal and secure d7 square for the black queenside knight. }
7. e4
{ Standard move from white. With e4 white here secure d5 square and occupy the center with his e - pawn. White now has the advantage in the center but incredible black dark square bishop on g7 and possibly undermining move b5 or a6 and b5 secure him more than enough counterplay. }
7... g5
{ This is now clever black move. With h6 black prepare g5 with the idea to secure the f4 square and now white need to show his idea and where he wants to get with his dark square bishop. Slight drawback is in the fact that with this move black little bit weak his position on the kingside and need to be careful later on. Now white has three moves. }
8. Bg3
{ This is a much better alternative to 8. Be3. Now black cant gets the tempo for his knight to transpose on the great square e5. Nevertheless, now white dark square bishop is out of play on the queenside and with next few aggressive moves there, black can get nice counterplay on the queenside. }
8... Qa5
{ Black now can be aggressive and start to get some serious pressure on the white queenside. With Qa5 black make the pressure on the e4 pawn and pinning the white knight on c3, when white dark square bishop cant helps him from g3 square. This is one of the main ideas from black when white dark square bishop stays on the wrong side of the table. }
9. Bd3 { White need to defend his attacks e4 pawn. } 9... Nbd7
{ Now black start developing other minor pieces and try to get them on some aggressive squares. This knight from d7 will try to get the e5 square. }
10. Nf3
{ This stop black knight from getting on e5 square but allow the activity of the other knight who will make the pressure on the dark square bishop on g3. }
10... Nh5
{ Key move and the idea of this position. After black make himself possibility of Ne5 and white knight need to prevent this by playing Nf3, black get the option to play Nh5 because knight from f3 cover the h5 square and now white queen cant take the black knight. This move is here important because now white bishop cant escape and black will get the bishop pair, but also with this move black stop white from playing an h4 move that can be good for him because black kingside is slightly exposed. After the black exchange the dark square bishop from g3 there will be no real attacking chances for white. }
11. O-O
{ White will now never get the chance to play h4, so now he immediately castles short. After that move, black doesn't have anything to worry about on the kingside and get the great game by just exchanging the bishop on g3 and creating some attacking chances on the kingside. }
11... Nxg3 12. hxg3 Ne5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. Rc1
{ With this move white protect the knight on c3 and get his rook on the better square. }
14... h5
{ And hereafter 14... h5 we have classical King's Indian type of the position. Black has managed to get the attack on the white king. With the bishop pair and strong pawns on g5 and h5, black has nice potential for an attack on the kingside. All white's pieces are passive and white king can easily get in trouble. It's important to understand that the black king is perfectly safe in the center. That's because the center is closed and white's pieces are too passive to organize an attack on him. A clear plan for black is to try to destroy and open the position on the kingside and then with rook and bishop pair to start a mating attack on the white king. The position is in my view better for black and he has a nice attacking chance on the kingside. }

7... g5
{ This is now clever black move. With h6 black prepare g5 with the idea to secure the f4 square and now white need to show his idea and where he wants to get with his dark square bishop.

8. Bd2
{ This is a third alternative here. This move is much more solid than two moves before but also insufficient to get any kind of the advantage for white because is too passive. With this move white cover the knight on c3 and also stay with this bishop on the queenside. The problem is in the fact that white is passive and start defending his position. Black easy can equalize with few ideas, but I will show you the next one. }
8... Nbd7

9. Nge2

{ With the idea of Nf5. } 10... Ng6

Now black manage to attack the weak white pawn on f5 and if white protect this pawn with g4 than black knight will stay forever on the great h4 square and make great pressure on the white kingside. One of the most dangerous squares for white will be an f3 square that will be always under black reach. The position is double-edged but clack chances are not worsted for sure with that great knight on h4. Standard idea of Rb8 with a6 and b5 will provide him more than enough play on the queenside. }

3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. d5
{ This is a more ambitious line and move than 4. e3. With this move white gets space in the center and prepares the e4 move. The drawback is in the fact that with this move white opens up a great diagonal for the black dark square bishop, who will now become a monster on the g7 square and potentially allow black to attack and undermine his center with b5 or a6 and b5 on the queenside. Another possibility for black is to start undermining white's center with the e6 move. Those are two main ideas for black now. }
5... h6
{ This looks like a little move, but in the fact, this is big and strong one. With h6 here, as we mentioned before, black wants to ensure that white's dark square bishop will never go back on the queenside if he now goes on h4. After that black can easily organize the play on the queenside. }
6. Bf4
{ This is one of two possible replies from white here in this position. White dark square bishop is under attack and he needs to go back. With this move, white doesn't want to abandon the queenside with this bishop and stay in the diagonal where he can go way back to c1. The drawback is now that white doesn't make the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. The main alternative to this move is 6. Bh4 and this move we will cover in next variation. }
6... d6
{ Standard move from black. Here is this also some kind of the waiting move. Black wants to see what white will do in the next move. Also, this move stop white d - pawn from advancing, open light squared diagonal and secure d7 square for the black queenside knight. }
7. e4
{ Standard move from white. With e4 white here secure d5 square and occupy the center with his e - pawn. White now has the advantage in the center but incredible black dark square bishop on g7 and possibly undermining move b5 or a6 and b5 secure him more than enough counterplay. }
7... g5
{ This is now clever black move. With h6 black prepare g5 with the idea to secure the f4 square and now white need to show his idea and where he wants to get with his dark square bishop. Slight drawback is in the fact that with this move black little bit weak his position on the kingside and need to be careful later on. Now white has three moves. }
8. Bd2
{ This is a third alternative here. This move is much more solid than two moves before but also insufficient to get any kind of the advantage for white because is too passive. With this move white cover the knight on c3 and also stay with this bishop on the queenside. The problem is in the fact that white is passive and start defending his position. Black easy can equalize with few ideas, but I will show you the next one. }
8... Nbd7
{ As in the line before, with this move black want to bring the knight from b8 to dream position on e5. Now white can prevent or allow this to black with next moves. }
9. Nf3
{ This is the move that white use in order not to allow black the move Ne5. Now if black goes for Ne5, white will take this knight and black pawn structure will be compromised. Because of this black need to find another idea how to transpose the knight from d7 to the nice square g6. Here the best move is Nf8 with next move Ng6, where the knight will find the best square on the kingside. }
9... O-O
{ Important move. Black should first castle and not play Nf8 without the castle because white will get a nice position with e5. First black need to castle short and then to remove the rook from e8 in order to replace the passive knight from d7 to great square g6. From there black will be able to get the control over vital squares e5 and f4. Also, this knight will compensate slightly exposed pawn structure on the kingside. }
10. Be2
{ With wants to finish the development and t bring his king to safety. } 10...
Re8
{ Great positional move. The idea is simple, to free the f8 square for the knight and to support the break in the center with the e6. }
11. O-O Nf8 12. Re1 Ng6
{ black manage to develop all his pieces. He brings the knight on the best square on g6 and manages to equalize the game. Now, black has few nice plans. First is to open the position in the center with e6 and exd5 and to play a6 and with the help of the rook on b8 to play for b5. This is one of the objectively equal positions in the Kings Indian with a lot to play for. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3

6... d6

7. e4

9. h4
{ This is a more ambitious white idea. White wants to do something against slightly compromised black pawn structure on the kingside. Black cant defends the pawn, so next black move is forced. Exchange on h4 will also get only better position for the white, based on the fact that black pawn structure will collapse and the h - file will get half - opened for the white rook on h1. This is something that black need to avoid at any cost. }
9... g4
{ This is the only real black answer to h4 here and in similar positions. He cant allow white to destroy his pawn structure on the kingside. With this move, black also doesn't allow the white knight to goes to the most natural square f3. }
10. Be2
{ This is after sharp move h4, the unambitious move that allows black immediately equal position. The Be2 move is to passive move that allows black full consolidation in next move Ne5. After this move, a white knight from g1 will hardly get in to play on e2, because his bishop doesn't allow him that. }
10... Ne5
{ This is the immediately equal position. Black secure his position with this move. The black knight is a monster on e5 and white cant exchange or removes it from there. Whit knight on e5 black manages to secure the pawn on g4 and open his light square bishop from c8. }

{ Black immediately goes to counter-attack on the queenside. For now white doesn't make something concrete and black has time to active play. In my opinion black first get the play and concrete idea. He needs to be at least equal here but with some initiative on the queenside. }
7. Qd2 d6
{ This is a standard move that black cant avoid. Mainly because after that move black knight on the b8 is ready to go for d7 square and black open the light square diagonal for the bishop from c8. }
8. e4
{ This is the only white move that makes sense here. White need to get the space in the center and secure the pawn on d5. }
8... g5
{ Now, after the e4 move from white, black need to be careful with the possibility of e5. After g5, here black want to exchange the black bishop for the knight from f6 with standard plan g5, Nh5, and Ng3. After that black will get the bishop pair and white will try to play against slightly exposed pawn structure on the black kingside. }
9. Bg3 Nh5
{ After g5 black need to go for this move with the idea of capturing the bishop on g3, because if not then white can try to get some advantage with h4 and then bishop can retreat to h2. }
10. Bd3
{ After that white move, black should not be in a hurry to exchange on g3 and he should at first prepare the blockade of the kingside. }
10... Nxg3 11. hxg3 Nd7
{ The first step is over after exchange the knight for the bishop on g3, now we need to make next one. Secure the square on e5 and prepare some activity on the queenside with a6 and b5 it will be possible. }
12. Nf3 Ne5
{ This is important exchange for black. Knight on f3 is nice attacking piece and potentially can take the pawn on g5 creating some dangerous ideas on the kingside. After the exchange of the knight, white will have not enough pieces for the pressure on the kingside. }
13. Nxe5 Bxe5
{ This is the nice position for black. He gets the bishop pair and some potential on the queenside. Also, dark square bishop on g5 is the best piece on the board and control the best diagonal a1 - h8 without white opponent. Once again the position is objectively equal but black bishop pair can make some trouble if the position will get opened at some point. I will prefer to play here with white. Black plan on the queenside will be related to the moves a6, b5, Bd7, and Rb8. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. d5
{ This is a more ambitious line and move than 4. e3. With this move white gets space in the center and prepares the e4 move. The drawback is in the fact that with this move white opens up a great diagonal for the black dark square bishop, who will now become a monster on the g7 square and potentially allow black to attack and undermine his center with b5 or a6 and b5 on the queenside. Another possibility for black is to start undermining white's center with the e6 move. Those are two main ideas for black now. }
5... h6
{ This looks like a little move, but in the fact, this is big and strong one. With h6 here, as we mentioned before, black wants to ensure that white's dark square bishop will never go back on the queenside if he now goes on h4. After that black can easily organize the play on the queenside. }
6. Bh4
{ The idea of this white move is to extend the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. The drawback is once again in the fact that the dark square bishop is out of the queenside. Now black can organize the counter-play on the queenside with standard moves like a6, b5, Qa5, Rb8 and so on. }
6... Qa5
{ Black immediately goes to counter-attack on the queenside. For now white doesn't make something concrete and black has time to active play. In my opinion black first get the play and concrete idea. He needs to be at least equal here but with some initiative on the queenside. }
7. Qd2 d6
{ This is a standard move that black cant avoid. Mainly because after that move black knight on the b8 is ready to go for d7 square and black open the light square diagonal for the bishop from c8. }
8. e4
{ This is the only white move that makes sense here. White need to get the space in the center and secure the pawn on d5. }
8... g5
{ Now, after the e4 move from white, black need to be careful with the possibility of e5. After g5, here black want to exchange the black bishop for the knight from f6 with standard plan g5, Nh5, and Ng3. After that black will get the bishop pair and white will try to play against slightly exposed pawn structure on the black kingside. }
9. Bg3 Nh5
{ After g5 black need to go for this move with the idea of capturing the bishop on g3, because if not then white can try to get some advantage with h4 and then bishop can retreat to h2. }
10. Nf3
{ This is also the move that doesn't make the pressure on black knight on h5 and black can start to make the second stage of his plan before exchange on g3. Nd7 is the move with the idea as in the line before. Get the square on e5 and exchange this nicely placed knight on f3 and not to allow white some potential sacrifices on g5. }
10... Nd7
{ Black next move will be the exchange on g3 and Ne5 as in the line before. }
11. Be2 Nxg3 12. hxg3 a6 13. O-O Ne5
{ Again the same idea with the same efect. Black gets great position. } 14.
Nxe5 Bxe5
{ And with the objectively equal position as in the line before. Here in those lines, you can see that black idea is always the same. Get the bishop pair with g5 and Nh5 and than to take the bishop on g3 and important exchange on the white knight on f3 with the move Nd7 - e5. After that black gets great position. }

{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. Nf3
{ With this variation white doesn't aim for space in the center with d5 but to play solid, developing move Nf3. In my view, this is a worse move than d5. First white's only chance to get some advantage here is space because all other things are not in his favor. For instance, the great dark square bishop on g7 will also create great pressure on the d4 square and black will be able to get the pieces on more aggressive squares. After an exchange of the pawns on d4 the black knight from b8 will be able to jump onto the great c6 square and extend the pressure on the square d4. Black's main idea and potential in this position is to create as much pressure as he can on the d4 square. }
5... cxd4
{ If white doesn't want to get the space with d5 don't give him this option anymore. Exchange the pawn on d4 and put pressure on white knight on d4 after that. }
6. Nxd4 O-O
{ With the transposition to the main line after the e3 and Qa5 next. } *

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }

5. e3
{ This is the move that secures the d4 square but nothing else. With this move white just wants to protect his central square d4 and doesn't want to seek an advantage in the center with the move e4. e3 is too passive a move and with this move white will not get any advantage at all. The better alternative for white  (at least more ambitious alternative)  here is d5 with the idea of e4 in next move. This will be covered in next variation. }
5... O-O 6. Nf3
{ This move is more in the spirit of the position and white's try. With 6. Nf3 white builds up a solid position and develops all his minor pieces. On the other side, that move allows black quick action in the center and an equal game. }
6... cxd4
{ This is the start of the idea that black can always play in those pawn structures without white's d5 move. Passive white play allows black quick and direct center action. First black exchanges cd4 and that puts the pawn on d5 that will completely blow up white's center pawns. Very concrete action after which black will not get any kind of problems. }
7. Nxd4
{ This is the alternative to slightly better move 7. ed5. With 7. Nd4 white loses the center control and now after next black move has to give up the bishop pair. That can be a problem for him later because bishops are great in those open positions. }
7... Qa5
{ Now black gets some active play and white has to be careful. Black attacks the bishop on g5 and prepares Ne4 in the next move. This can be annoying for white. The best idea is to take the knight on f6 and the alternative is Bh4. }
8. Bh4
{ White doesn't want to give the bishop pair to black. This is one side of the coin and the other is the fact that now he loses a very important tempo and black will get the initiative. }
8... Ne4
{ Direct move that immediately attacks the white knight on c3. Black's idea is to double the white pawns on c3 and get a favorable pawn structure later on. }
9. Qd3
{ This move or Qc2 allows black now to double white pawns and get a better pawn structure until the end of the game. }
9... Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxc3+ 11. bxc3 Re8 12. Be2 d6 13. O-O Na6
{ This is a strong positional move. Black wants to control the c5 square and not allow white to exchange those doubled c-pawns. Also, you can see that the white dark square bishop on h4 is completely out of the game. Next very easy to understand but the very strong black idea is just to develop the light square bishop on d7, get the king on f8 to support the pawn on e7 and that start the attack on the double white pawns on c file. Black's position is better. }

{ Now black gets some active play and white has to be careful. Black attacks the bishop on g5 and prepares Ne4 in the next move. This can be annoying for white. The best idea is to take the knight on f6 and the alternative is Bh4. }
8. Bxf6
{ White exchanges an attacked dark square bishop for a potentially unpleasant knight on f6 and for now doesn't get in difficulty. But this is in my opinion only for now. Black can just develop the pieces and then later those bishops can be very good. Objectively the position is equal but I think potentially just better for black. }
8... Bxf6 9. Be2 Nc6 10. Qd2 Bg7 11. O-O d6
{ Black gets all the pieces on the nice squares. After the next move Bd7, he can start some action on the queenside with a6, Rb8, b5 and potentially also make some pressure on d4 knight and the h8 - a1 diagonal. Equal position, but as I mentioned with the bishop pair for black. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. e3
{ This is the move that secures the d4 square but nothing else. With this move white just wants to protect his central square d4 and doesn't want to seek an advantage in the center with the move e4. e3 is too passive a move and with this move white will not get any advantage at all. The better alternative for white  (at least more ambitious alternative)  here is d5 with the idea of e4 in next move. This will be covered in next variation. }
5... O-O 6. Nf3
{ This move is more in the spirit of the position and white's try. With 6. Nf3 white builds up a solid position and develops all his minor pieces. On the other side, that move allows black quick action in the center and an equal game. }
6... cxd4
{ This is the start of the idea that black can always play in those pawn structures without white's d5 move. Passive white play allows black quick and direct center action. First black exchanges cd4 and that puts the pawn on d5 that will completely blow up white's center pawns. Very concrete action after which black will not get any kind of problems. }
7. exd4 d5
{ This is typical and powerful center play that black has if white plays passively. Now black completely blows up the white center and potentially also gets the target: the white isolated pawn on d4. }
8. cxd5
{ This is the alternative that white has here. He doesn't want to leave black the bishop pair but now has to be careful, because his pawn structure can be under pressure. }
8... Nxd5 9. Qb3
{ This is an important white move here. With Qb3 he wants to put pressure on the d5 knight in order to secure the pawn on d4 with the exchange on c3. }
9... Nxc3 10. bxc3 Nc6
{ Now we reach one very important pawn structure. White manages to secure the pawn on d4 but get the pawn on c3 that can also be a potential weakness. Black is without weaknesses and after he finishes the development, black can start some actions against the d4 and c3 pawns. }
11. Be2 Qc7 12. O-O Be6
{ Black has managed to develop all his pieces and now he can start the action on the light squares and the white d4 and c3 pawns. Now, after white's queen goes back, black can put the bishop onto d5, a knight on a5 and freeze this pawns and then use his rooks on d8 and c8 to increase the pressure. In my opinion, black has a better prospects. I will always take black pieces here. }

Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }

With this move white just wants to protect his central square d4 and doesn't want to seek an advantage in the center with the move e4. e3 is too passive a move and with this move white will not get any advantage at all. The better alternative for white  (at least more ambitious alternative)  here is d5 with the idea of e4 in next move. This will be covered in next variation. }
5... O-O 6. Nf3
{ This move is more in the spirit of the position and white's try. With 6. Nf3 white builds up a solid position and develops all his minor pieces. On the other side, that move allows black quick action in the center and an equal game. }
6... cxd4
{ This is the start of the idea that black can always play in those pawn structures without white's d5 move. Passive white play allows black quick and direct center action. First black exchanges cd4 and that puts the pawn on d5 that will completely blow up white's center pawns. Very concrete action after which black will not get any kind of problems. }
7. exd4 d5
{ This is typical and powerful center play that black has if white plays passively. Now black completely blows up the white center and potentially also gets the target: the white isolated pawn on d4. }
8. Bxf6 Bxf6 9. Nxd5
{ Now white gets the pawn but this is only temporary. After the retreat of the dark square bishop and the pressure on d4, black will get the pawn back. }
9... Bg7 10. Ne3
{ With this move, white open the a1 - h8 diagonal and allows black a concrete and aggressive approach. Black is, after that move, better. }
10... Nc6 11. d5 Bxb2
{ After that move black is better. White can't get the piece because of the next tactical blow. }
12. dxc6 Qa5+ 13. Ke2 Rd8 14. Qe1 Bc3 15. c7 Rd6 16. Qc1 Be6 17. g3 Rc8 18. Bg2
Rxc7
{ Incredible picture. Black sacrifices the piece for only a pawn but white is completely paralyzed. He doesn't have any activity move. Black dominates on the board it is a only matter of time this positional advantage will be a material advantage. }
19. Re1 Rxc4 20. Kf1 Ra4 21. Kg1 Bxe1 22. Nxe1 Rxa2 23. Rxa2 Bxa2

This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }

This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }

{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. e3
{ This is the move that secures the d4 square but nothing else. With this move white just wants to protect his central square d4 and doesn't want to seek an advantage in the center with the move e4. e3 is too passive a move and with this move white will not get any advantage at all. The better alternative for white  (at least more ambitious alternative)  here is d5 with the idea of e4 in next move. This will be covered in next variation. }
5... O-O 6. d5
{ This is one of few moves that white can try here. With this move, white wants to close the center and get some space. The drawback of this move is in the fact that white get the space after the move e3 which is not in this spirit. With e3 white starts building but it is a little bit of a passive position. Now after d5 he will need to play e4 and support that pawn and his space advantage. That will obviously lose important tempo. }
6... d6 { Don't allow white to play d6. } 7. Nf3 h6
{ In this and also in similar positions when the white dark square bishop is on g5 this is very strong and important positional move. With this move, black cuts off the bishop from the retreat on the queenside and then start operations there. }
8. Bh4 Qa5
{ Once again a very simple black idea. Now when this dark square bishop is unable to retreat to the queenside, black start the actions there. The idea is Ne4 with too much pressure on the c3 knight. }
9. Qd2
{ This move is not so good as the 9. Nd2 here. After this move white first rank  (queen and the rook)  are not connected and black can use the idea from Benko gambit a6 and b5. This idea here is very strong because the white pawn should be on e4, not e3 and also the dark square bishop is miles away from the queenside. I use this idea always when white doesn't allow me to play e5. Then I try with the c5 and a6 with b5. It serves me well. The positions are very rich and black has nice play. }
9... a6
{ The start of the play on the queenside. This prepares b5 and now a4 is not so good because white can't take on b5 with a pawn when the Queen is on d2 and the rook on a1 is not defended. }
10. Be2 b5 11. cxb5
{ Here white has a few moves but, in my opinion, only this one and castle short here make much sense. After this move white wants only to take the pawn on b5 and try to get the material advantage. This is unfortunately not possible for him because the pawn on d5 is, after that move, weak and black will get huge compensation and the initiative. }
11... g5
{ Remember here to first play g5 and than ab5 not to allow white to exchange this dark square bishop that will now be only the observer on g3. }
12. Bg3 axb5 13. Nxb5
{ This is an immediate mistake. Now the pawn on d5 is not defended and black can just take that pawn in the next move, after which white's position will be awful. All the pieces are on bad squares and doing nothing. Black pieces dominate the board and the initiative is huge there for black. I think that black here has a big positional advantage that can easily become material. }
13... Nxd5 14. Rd1 Bb7 15. O-O Qxd2 16. Rxd2 Nd7 17. a3 Rfb8
{ With a much better position for black. This is an incredible upgrade to the Benko gambit. Not only that black is not materially down, but also white's dark square bishop is out of play on the queenside. Black has a dream position. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }

First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. e3
{ This is the move that secures the d4 square but nothing else. With this move white just wants to protect his central square d4 and doesn't want to seek an advantage in the center with the move e4. e3 is too passive a move and with this move white will not get any advantage at all. The better alternative for white  (at least more ambitious alternative)  here is d5 with the idea of e4 in next move. This will be covered in next variation. }
5... O-O 6. d5
{ This is one of few moves that white can try here. With this move, white wants to close the center and get some space. The drawback of this move is in the fact that white get the space after the move e3 which is not in this spirit. With e3 white starts building but it is a little bit of a passive position. Now after d5 he will need to play e4 and support that pawn and his space advantage. That will obviously lose important tempo. }
6... d6 { Don't allow white to play d6. } 7. Nf3 h6
{ In this and also in similar positions when the white dark square bishop is on g5 this is very strong and important positional move. With this move, black cuts off the bishop from the retreat on the queenside and then start operations there. }
8. Bh4 Qa5
{ Once again a very simple black idea. Now when this dark square bishop is unable to retreat to the queenside, black start the actions there. The idea is Ne4 with too much pressure on the c3 knight. }
9. Nd2
{ White has to block the e1 - a5 diagonal here and stop black from playing Ne4. The alternative is Qd2. }
9... g5
{ As in the position before, here g5 is the move that will get white's dark square bishop on the passive g3 square. Nevertheless, you have to be careful with moves like that one because potentially this pawn on g5 can be weak and white can try to attack him with h4. Here this is not the case and g5 is a good move. Also, the bishop on f5 will give extra protection on the kingside. }
10. Bg3 Bf5
{ Nice developing move. Now this bishop gets on the best light diagonal and can fight for the e4 square. }
11. h4
{ This is always an interesting option for white in similar positions. Here, in my opinion, it is not the best one because white doesn't have the option of attacking the black king and black can easily open the position in the center with e6 and ed5 later on. That means that white will have to castle on the kingside and h4 will not help his play on the kingside without an mating attack. }
11... Nbd7 12. hxg5 hxg5
{ And there is nothing on the kingside for white. Black's bishop pair and the knight perfectly defend the king. }

Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play.

Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear.

5. Nf3
{ With this variation white doesn't aim for space in the center with d5 but to play solid, developing move Nf3. In my view, this is a worse move than d5. First white's only chance to get some advantage here is space because all other things are not in his favor. For instance, the great dark square bishop on g7 will also create great pressure on the d4 square and black will be able to get the pieces on more aggressive squares. After an exchange of the pawns on d4 the black knight from b8 will be able to jump onto the great c6 square and extend the pressure on the square d4. Black's main idea and potential in this position is to create as much pressure as he can on the d4 square. }
5... cxd4
{ If white doesn't want to get the space with d5 don't give him this option anymore. Exchange the pawn on d4 and put pressure on white knight on d4 after that. }

{ As we mention. The direct play on white square d4. Now white needs to decide what he wants to do. Exchange the knight on c6 or defend his knight with e3 ? }
7. e3
{ This is the second, and I think better, more solid, white option. With this move, white doesn't want to give black the great pawn structure on c6 and secure the knight on d4. }
7... O-O 8. Be2 d6
{ There is no need to hurry with the exchange on d4 or to make some dubious moves connected with the attack on d4. White can play too passive and make some moves like Bg5 and Nxd4 that are not connected and don't make a concrete plan. White just makes some developing moves that are not connected and getting him nowhere. With only developing pieces on the queenside, black will get a nice position. }
9. O-O Bd7
{ The only nice developing move. White doesn't attack anything and black has plenty of time to finish the development. }
10. Qd2 Rc8
{ This is the last black undeveloped piece that now comes to the great square from where can attack a potential target, the white pawn on c4. Some ideas later are connected with move Ne5 and some pressure together with the rook on c8 against the pawn on c4. }
11. Rfd1 Re8
{ This is always a nice move with the idea of defending the pawn on e7. This is important in some positions where black can play the move Qa5 and when the black rook is on f5 white can make the nice move Nd5 with the idea of an intermezzo move Ne7. }
12. Rac1 a6
{ Black completely secures his position and gets the equal position. All black's pieces are connected and on solid squares. White plays too passively and doesn't get anything. In this position, black can start some activities on the queenside with the moves like Qa5, Na5 and so on. }

I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. Nf3
{ With this variation white doesn't aim for space in the center with d5 but to play solid, developing move Nf3. In my view, this is a worse move than d5. First white's only chance to get some advantage here is space because all other things are not in his favor. For instance, the great dark square bishop on g7 will also create great pressure on the d4 square and black will be able to get the pieces on more aggressive squares. After an exchange of the pawns on d4 the black knight from b8 will be able to jump onto the great c6 square and extend the pressure on the square d4. Black's main idea and potential in this position is to create as much pressure as he can on the d4 square. }
5... cxd4
{ If white doesn't want to get the space with d5 don't give him this option anymore. Exchange the pawn on d4 and put pressure on white knight on d4 after that. }
6. Nxd4 Nc6
{ As we mention. The direct play on white square d4. Now white needs to decide what he wants to do. Exchange the knight on c6 or defend his knight with e3 ? }
7. Nxc6
{ This is white's first option. He doesn't want to allow black to take on d4 and exchange the black knight on c6. In my opinion, this is not good because now black will get a great pawn structure after he takes the knight on c6 with the b-pawn. }
7... bxc6
{ After this move Nxc6, I don't like white's position. Now black gets in my view a favorable pawn structure and covers the critical square on d5. Also, the half open b-file goes only in black's favor. The rook on b8 will be a great piece in next couple of moves. After that white will need to play the move b3 after which black's dark square bishop will become a monster. }
8. Qd2 h6
{ Important move. Black's dark square bishop is a far better piece than white's and black needs to save him from the exchange. }
9. Bh4 Rb8
{ As we mentioned before, this rook is a great piece in a half-open b-file and puts nice pressure on the b2 pawn. }
10. e3
{ This is a possible white mistake here and a not so obvious one. After this, white is almost lost because black can get an incredible attack after the next sequence of moves. }
10... g5 11. Bg3 Ne4 12. Nxe4 Rxb2 13. Qd3 Qa5+ 14. Kd1 d5 15. Nd2 Ba6
{ And white's position collapses. The typical black idea in this position. Remember it and you will get the chance to convert the advantage. I have managed to do that a couple of times in the blitz games. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges.

11. e3 Nd7
{ Great move that is important to know and understand. The Black knight on f6 doesn't do anything and is in front of the bishop on g7. With this standard manoeuvre, Nd7 - c5, black places the knight on the best square and secures the long diagonal for his bishop. It is an important moment and idea in this position that will bring black some pressure after just a few moves. }
12. Be2 Nc5 { And the knight manages to get to the best square. } 13. O-O O-O
14. b3 a5
{ Great positional move with the idea of a4 and also this pawn secures the square on b4. }
15. Rfd1 g5 16. Bg3 Bf5
{ An incredible picture after only 16 moves. Black is better and white hasn't made any big mistakes. Only bad decision to take on c6 makes now some problems for him. Black's bishops are far better than his white opponents' and black has an obvious play on the queenside when white can just defend and hope for the best. Now black's idea is to destroy the white pawn structure on the queenside with a4 and then to take some pawns there if it is possible. The position is better for black. }

6... cxd4
{ This is the start of the idea that black can always play in those pawn structures without white's d5 move. Passive white play allows black quick and direct center action. First black exchanges cd4 and that puts the pawn on d5 that will completely blow up white's center pawns. Very concrete action after which black will not get any kind of problems. }

8. Bxf6 Bxf6 9. Nxd5

If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7 4. Bf4
{ This is another developing move that white could try with the idea to play the Qd2 and the Bh6 next. Also if he goes for the Nf3 next this would just transpose to he line with the move order Nf3 and Bf4. }
4... O-O 5. Qd2 d6 6. Bh6 c5
{ And white doesnt have anything better then the Nf3 that would lead to the Nf3 and Bf4 position. }
7. Bxg7 Kxg7 8. h4

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
{ This is the starting move order of The King's Indian Defense. This is one, if not the, most complicated openings in chess. Both, white and black have numerous ideas, variations, lines and sublines that can radically change the position and the way of play. In the main lines white almost always get almost winning advantage on the queenside, but black has an incredible attack on the white king. Those lines and positions are hard to judge and evaluate properly because of they are so double-edged that even computer engines can't calculate them until the end. Because of that, you will see that I like to evaluate a lot of those positions and mark them unclear. In those positions, it's impossible to get the final conclusion but practise has shown that in all of them black has more than enough play. Based on that fact that black has a very dangerous attack on the white king, white players today choose safer options where they don't get the advantage on the queenside, but secure the king and try to play positional chess. In those positions, black can't attack white's king but can also play very sharp and try to create some pressure on the queenside. Black gives white the center and the advantage on the queenside, but wants to attack that center and if it's possible, the opponent's king later. The main black idea is by nature very simple. First to fianchetto the dark square bishop on g7, the knight from g8 comes to f6 and then black always castle on the kingside. After that black mainly has two ideas and moves e5 and c5 but those moves are dependent on white's ideas. Black's first choice should be e5 with a strong pawn structure in the center that will later secure him attacking opportunities against the white king that will be placed in the short castle on g1. If black manages to get the closed structure with e5 pawn, then this will be a race. White almost winning advantage on the queenside against demolition attack on the white king. If white chooses the safer options then black will strike even on the queenside with the move c5. In both situations black has great positions and chances. The King's Indian likes is played by the sharp attacking players because the positions are double-edged with unsymmetrical pawn structures and without many exchanges. I also personally think that this is the opening that all players need to study because in the King's Indian they can learn a lot in all aspects of this great game, the game of chess. }
3. Nc3
{ This is the standard developing move from white. With 3. Nc3 white wants to take the advantage in the center with 4. e4. The only real white alternative here is 3. Nf3 and this move will be covered in the following lines. }
3... Bg7
{ Black continues with his plan. First to develop the knight on f6 and now the Bishop on g7. }
4. Bg5
{ This is one of the main alternatives that white can try against the King's Indian setup. This move puts pressure on the black knight on f6 and possibly prepares the Qd2 move that will put pressure on the c1 - h6 diagonal. The problem with this move is that white doesn't do anything to make progress and secure a big center with e4. The best advantage that white gets with this move is that black, for now, can't play e5 because of the pressure on the h4 - d8 diagonal. Nevertheless, black has another idea that he usually uses when white stops him to playing e5, the move c5. So, if you can't make the progress with e5 than is time to push the c5 pawn because black needs to attack white's center after finishing the development of the kingside. C5 is here also a strong counterattacking move in the center because now white's dark square bishop is out of position on the queenside. You also need to know that sometimes a little h6 move is very strong  (not in this position but in the similar ones)  after which white's bishop can get on h4 and he will never go back to the queenside. The white idea will never be Bxf6 because that will only help black improve the position and to stay with the bishop pair. This white alternative doesn't create any problems for black and he can easily maintain the balance. }
4... c5
{ c5. The main alternative to the main black idea, e5. Remember that when white stops you from playing e5 you should play c5. This is another move which black uses to get a counterattack in the center and mainly on the queenside. You will see that e5 will bring black the advantage on the kingside, but c5 give you the option to play on the queenside. With 4... c5 black immediately attack the most vulnerable white square and the pawn on d4. This is now attractive because the white dark square bishop is out of the queenside and the best square is e3 from where he can support the d4 pawn. He can now get back on e3 but then white will lose two moves and black can easy get the initiative. C5 also makes the move Qb6 possible with the idea of attacking the pawn on b2. }
5. Nf3
{ With this variation white doesn't aim for space in the center with d5 but to play solid, developing move Nf3. In my view, this is a worse move than d5. First white's only chance to get some advantage here is space because all other things are not in his favor. For instance, the great dark square bishop on g7 will also create great pressure on the d4 square and black will be able to get the pieces on more aggressive squares. After an exchange of the pawns on d4 the black knight from b8 will be able to jump onto the great c6 square and extend the pressure on the square d4. Black's main idea and potential in this position is to create as much pressure as he can on the d4 square. }
5... cxd4 6. Qxd4
{ The Qxd4 is the alternative to the Nxd4 but now black would get tempi for the Nc6 with the attack on the white queen. }
6... Nc6 7. Qd2 { Qh4 is not good because of the h6. } 7... h6
{ Important move. Just don't allow the Bh6. } 8. Bh4 d6
{ And with the next move 0-0 black king would be safe, there is no attack on him anymore with the Bh4 instead on the most natural c1-h6 diagonal. The Be3 after the h6 is not good because white pawn is still on the e2 instead e4 and also the Ng4 is in the air. }

Now, after that move here   6.Bg5  as in some other variations  (like for instance the Saemisch variation with f3 and Bg5)  black should strike in the center with c5.

7... e6
{ Here is important to stop and explain some things in this position. As I mentioned before in the King's Indian black first choice to play e5 and close the center with e5. Those positions are incredible double-edged and white has the head in the bag in many variations that I will show later in that chapter. More positional players will try not to allow that and than they will play variations like this one where is impossible to strike good with e5. In those positions is mandatory to strike with c5 and here we have to start. With c5 black also strike in the center and fight for the square d4. The most natural answer is for sure d5. Now, this is one of the important structure that black will get in the positions with c5 instead of e5. The move e6 here is one of two moves that black has to think about. The other one is a6. In my opinion booth moves are fine here but I think that e6 here is more precise. Why do I think so ? If you take a look, you will see that white kingside is completely undeveloped and if black manages to open the center and e-file, white will have to be careful not to get in the problems with the king in the center. Now, what a6 ? A6 is the move that secures the b5 square and potentially prepare b5. This is a nice strike in the similar positions. In this book, I will try to explain how to get some favorable opening variations from some other systems like Benko Gambit and Ben - oni or even combination of both openings. }

4... d6

5. h3
{ This is the move that white try to not show black what he wants to do. Some ideas are possible g4 with the sharp play even on the kingside or maybe just ordinary next move Nf3. In some variations white also try some other moves like 6. Bg5. I will try to show you all of them. The obvious bad side of this move is the fact that now white don't use his space advantage and don't develop the pieces, so black has the time to counter white. }
5... O-O 6. Bg5
{ This is an interesting white idea. With this move, white doesn't want to allow the black main idea of the e5 push. Now, e5 is not possible because after 7. de5 de5 8. Qd8 Rd8 white has winning move Nd5. Now, after that move here   6.Bg5  as in some other variations  (like for instance the Saemisch variation with f3 and Bg5)  black should strike in the center with c5. Remember this important strategy. Black doesn't have time or space to wait. He has to strike immediately in the center, with e5 or c5 if white doesn't allow him e5. }
6... c5 { If white doesn't allow e5, strike in the center with c5. } 7. d5
{ The white idea in the Kings Indian is to build up a strong center because black allow that. In this fashion, white will mostly aim for that move because e5 is here not possible and as we see, dxc5 will not get him anywhere. Important is also to know that the pawn structure dictates the play in all chess positions. If black play e5, that he has to play on the kingside and of course in the center if white allow that, and after c5, black always start the operations on the queenside and of course in the center. }
7... e6
{ Here is important to stop and explain some things in this position. As I mentioned before in the Kings Indian black first choice to play e5 and close the center with e5. Those positions are incredible double-edged and white has the head in the bag in many variations that I will show later in that chapter. More positional players will try not to allow that and than they will play variations like this one where is impossible to strike good with e5. In those positions is mandatory to strike with c5 and here we have to start. With c5 black also strike in the center and fight for the square d4. The most natural answer is for sure d5. Now, this is one of the important structure that black will get in the positions with c5 instead of e5. The move e6 here is one of two moves that black has to think about. The other one is a6. In my opinion booth moves are fine here but I think that e6 here is more precise. Why do I think so ? If you take a look, you will see that white kingside is completely undeveloped and if black manages to open the center and e-file, white will have to be careful not to get in the problems with the king in the center. Now, what a6 ? A6 is the move that secures the b5 square and potentially prepare b5. This is a nice strike in the similar positions. In this book, I will try to explain how to get some favorable opening variations from some other systems like Benko Gambit and Ben - oni or even combination of both openings. }
8. dxe6
{ This is the white alternative here. Instead to develop the kingside, white can try to take on e6. The idea is the same, doesn't want to open the game in the center and the e-file for the rook soon. }
8... Bxe6
{ With this move black develop the light square bishop and has only the knight on b6 to develop before he starts some action in the center and on the queenside. }

{ Black can also play without this move and just castle here on the kingside. If white play e5 in the next move knight goes to e8 and with d6 black can destroy white center. Nevertheless, this will only transpose to the main line after 5. Nf3 and d6. }
5. h3
{ This is the move that white try to not show black what he wants to do. Some ideas are possible g4 with the sharp play even on the kingside or maybe just ordinary next move Nf3. In some variations white also try some other moves like 6. Bg5. I will try to show you all of them. The obvious bad side of this move is the fact that now white don't use his space advantage and don't develop the pieces, so black has the time to counter white. }
5... O-O 6. Bg5
{ This is an interesting white idea. With this move, white doesn't want to allow the black main idea of the e5 push. Now, e5 is not possible because after 7. de5 de5 8. Qd8 Rd8 white has winning move Nd5. Now, after that move here   6.Bg5  as in some other variations  (like for instance the Saemisch variation with f3 and Bg5)  black should strike in the center with c5. Remember this important strategy. Black doesn't have time or space to wait. He has to strike immediately in the center, with e5 or c5 if white doesn't allow him e5. }
6... c5 { If white doesn't allow e5, strike in the center with c5. } 7. d5
{ The white idea in the Kings Indian is to build up a strong center because black allow that. In this fashion, white will mostly aim for that move because e5 is here not possible and as we see, dxc5 will not get him anywhere. Important is also to know that the pawn structure dictates the play in all chess positions. If black play e5, that he has to play on the kingside and of course in the center if white allow that, and after c5, black always start the operations on the queenside and of course in the center. }
7... e6
{ Here is important to stop and explain some things in this position. As I mentioned before in the Kings Indian black first choice to play e5 and close the center with e5. Those positions are incredible double-edged and white has the head in the bag in many variations that I will show later in that chapter. More positional players will try not to allow that and than they will play variations like this one where is impossible to strike good with e5. In those positions is mandatory to strike with c5 and here we have to start. With c5 black also strike in the center and fight for the square d4. The most natural answer is for sure d5. Now, this is one of the important structure that black will get in the positions with c5 instead of e5. The move e6 here is one of two moves that black has to think about. The other one is a6. In my opinion booth moves are fine here but I think that e6 here is more precise. Why do I think so ? If you take a look, you will see that white kingside is completely undeveloped and if black manages to open the center and e-file, white will have to be careful not to get in the problems with the king in the center. Now, what a6 ? A6 is the move that secures the b5 square and potentially prepare b5. This is a nice strike in the similar positions. In this book, I will try to explain how to get some favorable opening variations from some other systems like Benko Gambit and Ben - oni or even combination of both openings. }
8. Bd3
{ This is one of three good moves that white has here. With this move white develop his kingside and defend the pawn on e4. }
8... exd5
{ Black should immediately exchange the pawn on d5 and open the game in the center. }
9. exd5
{ This is the move that makes that structure symmetrical and gets to the equal position immediately. After that move, white doesn't have a potential to break in the center and black dark square bishop on g7 becomes the best piece on the table. }
9... a6 { This move prepares the brake on b5. } 10. a4 { White not alow b5. }
10... Re8+ { Get the rook on the open file whenever you can. } 11. Nge2 Nbd7
{ Now, this position is equal. Black ideas are related to the move Ne5 or if white play f4 with Nf8 and Bd7. The position is equal but with all pieces, there is plenty of possibility for both sides. }
12. f4 { White doesn't allow Ne5. } 12... h6
{ Important move that drives away the dark square bishop and decreases the pressure on black diagonal h4 - d8. }
13. Bh4 Nf8 { This is another way to develop all the pieces there. } 14. O-O b6
15. Qd2 Ra7 16. Rae1 Rae7
{ Black develop all pieces and has a bishop pair. The position is equal but there is a plenty of play. }

The initiative is on the black side. Now potentially after next black move b4, the white pawn on e4 will be exposed and white has to find the way how to handle that. }
10. Qc2
{ This is white try to defend the pawn on e4. The problem is that black is much ahead in development and with next few moves he will get once again nice initiative. }
10... b4
{ First black get the space on the queenside and push almost only white piece back to the first rank. }
11. Nd1 Re8
{ And next move is one more that develop black pieces, make the pressure on white weak psawns  (here on e4)  and to improve the position of black pieces. }
12. f3 Nbd7
{ And now with the next developing moves like a5, Bb7, Ne5 and so on, black will get a better position. His lead in development and potentially weak white pawns on e4, d5 and g4 secure him long-term initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4

4... d6
{ Black can also play without this move and just castle here on the kingside. If white play e5 in the next move knight goes to e8 and with d6 black can destroy white center. Nevertheless, this will only transpose to the main line after 5. Nf3 and d6. }
5. h3
{ This is the move that white try to not show black what he wants to do. Some ideas are possible g4 with the sharp play even on the kingside or maybe just ordinary next move Nf3. In some variations white also try some other moves like 6. Bg5. I will try to show you all of them. The obvious bad side of this move is the fact that now white don't use his space advantage and don't develop the pieces, so black has the time to counter white. }
5... O-O 6. g4
{ This is a white ultra aggressive option here. In my opinion not so good. White start here to aggressive and he played only with the pawns. Those pawns not defended and supported from other pieces can be easy targets for black pieces. One important statement in chess is "The pawns don't go back" and you have to be careful when pushing them forward. }
6... c5 { And again. If you cant push e5, push c5 immediately. } 7. d5
{ More positional move than dc5 but also not enough I believe even for the equality. White pawns are too much advanced and now black can start attacking them. }

8. Be2

The position will be now very sharp, but because of the lead in development and the fact that white play too many moves with the pawns that now can be weak, I believe that black is here better. WIth next direct idea and the moves, I will show you how to get the initiative. }
9... b5
{ The key move here, and I think in the whole line here. After that move, black take immediate actions on the queenside, before white start the play on the kingside. The initiative is on the black side. Now potentially after next black move b4, the white pawn on e4 will be exposed and white has to find the way how to handle that. }
10. Bxb5
{ Both the moves Bb5 and Nb5 will run into Ne4 when black will completely open the game and white king will be in a bad shape. }
10... Nxe4
{ This is the key move here and in many similar positions as well. Black temporarily sacrifice the knight on e4 and with next move, Qa5 get at least the pawn back with the initiative and the pressure on opponents king. }
11. Nxe4 Qa5+
{ Black now get the piece back, and black king will run up to g2. } 12. Kf1
Qxb5+ 13. Kg2 Qb6
{ Not only that get the material back and the fact that the white king is potentially exposed on g2, but black also has the bishop pair now. White pawns on b2, d5 are weak and g4 pawn after f5 can make big problems for white after potential exchange because the white king will be on the open fire. Black is better. }

5... O-O 6. Nf3
{ This is white best move here. With this move white develop his knight and then his bishop from f1 in order to castle on the short side and start playing on the queenside. After that move, we have the position from the classical position but with the white move h3. It is hard to say is this good or bad because the position will be different and mostly related to the Petrosyan line with the fast move d5 after the black move e5. }
6... e5
{ This is the classical black reply to this white setup with the knight on f3 and c3 with or without the move h3. Now, I always try to play e5 with black pieces in the Kings Indian, if white allows me. Some players like here also the different plan with c5 which is possible but my preferences are here for the e5 move. With the e5 here, black wants to close the center and after that to start operations on the kingside with standard maneuver f5 and so on. }
7. d5
{ This is the move that white play always when he plays h3 and that this classical setup. The idea is to close the center immediately and then to not allow black his standard play on the kingside. White play after that at some point g4. I will show you that in the next few moves. }
7... Na6
{ This move maybe doesn't have to be marked as the great move but I think that is really important to play that move here before the main alternative a5, which use many players even the strong ones. Now, I analyze that position for quite a while when I was facing the line even without the move Nf3 with only the setup h3, Be2, and Be3 which I will show you in the next lines as well. Why Na6 before ? Because of the tempo in some positions after Nc5 if white doesn't cover immediately the e4 pawn or to pin the black knight on the diagonal h4 - d8. }
8. Be3
{ This is the first of two main moves here. All others don't have a purpose. With Be3, white wants to develop the queenside quicky and play for the c5. Now you can see why Na6 was a good move. }
8... Nc5
{ Now black get the tempo for the attack on the e4 pawn and after that, he will manage to complete the blockade on the queenside with a5 right on the time. }
9. Nd2 a5
{ And black makes perfect blockade on the queenside. Now white has to show what his idea is. Mainly this is here related to playing on both of the wings and the move g4. }
10. g4
{ This is the move that is what white wants to do here in the h3 variation. White play h3 in order to have at some point the g4. After that move is hard for black to push the f5 but has here the other possibility that is equally good. }
10... c6
{ With g4 white stop the f5 break but now black can play on the other side and in the center as well. }
11. Be2 a4
{ This is the waiting move that I like here. Black doesn't need to show white how he wants to proceed here, before the white show where he wants to get with his king. }
12. Bxc5
{ With this move white get the pawn but black get incredible compensation and a clear plan. }
12... dxc5 13. Nxa4 Qa5 14. Nc3 Bh6 15. Qc2 Bd7 16. Rg1 Bf4
{ And the final position is great for black. For the pawn black get the initiative and white struggle to find the right way to play here. White ends here with the bad light square bishop and without the best piece, the dark square bishop. Black compensation is in the bishop pair, incredible active dark square bishop and the domination on the dark squares. Il always prefers black here. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4
{ This is the most principled white move here. Black allows white to take the center with the pawns and white do that. With this move white completely grab the space in the center. }
4... d6
{ Black can also play without this move and just castle here on the kingside. If white play e5 in the next move knight goes to e8 and with d6 black can destroy white center. Nevertheless, this will only transpose to the main line after 5. Nf3 and d6. }
5. h3
{ This is the move that white try to not show black what he wants to do. Some ideas are possible g4 with the sharp play even on the kingside or maybe just ordinary next move Nf3. In some variations white also try some other moves like 6. Bg5. I will try to show you all of them. The obvious bad side of this move is the fact that now white don't use his space advantage and don't develop the pieces, so black has the time to counter white. }
5... O-O 6. Nf3
{ This is white best move here. With this move white develop his knight and then his bishop from f1 in order to castle on the short side and start playing on the queenside. After that move, we have the position from the classical position but with the white move h3. It is hard to say is this good or bad because the position will be different and mostly related to the Petrosyan line with the fast move d5 after the black move e5. }
6... e5
{ This is the classical black reply to this white setup with the knight on f3 and c3 with or without the move h3. Now, I always try to play e5 with black pieces in the Kings Indian, if white allows me. Some players like here also the different plan with c5 which is possible but my preferences are here for the e5 move. With the e5 here, black wants to close the center and after that to start operations on the kingside with standard maneuver f5 and so on. }
7. d5
{ This is the move that white play always when he plays h3 and that this classical setup. The idea is to close the center immediately and then to not allow black his standard play on the kingside. White play after that at some point g4. I will show you that in the next few moves. }
7... Na6
{ This move maybe doesn't have to be marked as the great move but I think that is really important to play that move here before the main alternative a5, which use many players even the strong ones. Now, I analyze that position for quite a while when I was facing the line even without the move Nf3 with only the setup h3, Be2, and Be3 which I will show you in the next lines as well. Why Na6 before ? Because of the tempo in some positions after Nc5 if white doesn't cover immediately the e4 pawn or to pin the black knight on the diagonal h4 - d8. }
8. Be3
{ This is the first of two main moves here. All others don't have a purpose. With Be3, white wants to develop the queenside quicky and play for the c5. Now you can see why Na6 was a good move. }
8... Nc5
{ Now black get the tempo for the attack on the e4 pawn and after that, he will manage to complete the blockade on the queenside with a5 right on the time. }
9. Nd2 a5
{ And black makes perfect blockade on the queenside. Now white has to show what his idea is. Mainly this is here related to playing on both of the wings and the move g4. }
10. g4
{ This is the move that is what white wants to do here in the h3 variation. White play h3 in order to have at some point the g4. After that move is hard for black to push the f5 but has here the other possibility that is equally good. }
10... c6
{ With g4 white stop the f5 break but now black can play on the other side and in the center as well. }
11. Be2 a4
{ This is the waiting move that I like here. Black doesn't need to show white how he wants to proceed here, before the white show where he wants to get with his king. }
12. b4 axb3 13. axb3 Rxa1 14. Qxa1 Na6
{ Black prevents b4 with that move and also wants to get the knight there to make the pressure on the queenside. }
15. Qa3 c5
{ Black stop white from play on the queenside and also provide the knight great square on b4. }
16. Nf1 Nb4 17. Qc1 h5
{ Black has a great position. He can play on one side and then switch on the other as well. White is behind in the development and his pieces are not on the best squares. For instance, the knight on d2 that is now on f1 will have a hard time to find the right place. }
18. g5
{ With this move white take some space on the kingside and get the tempo but this pawn will be exposed and after f5 black will easily open the game on the kingside. }
18... Ne8
{ And now with the combination of the moves Bd7, And f5 black will open the game on the kingside and white king will be exposed there. The position is about equal but I think that is much easier to play with black. }

5... a6
{ This is one of the moves in chess that I really like. First of all, is not often seen, so white will not be prepared at first and then this is the move that is easy to play and to get great position. With the Nge23 and Ng3 moves white sometimes want to also open the game on the kingside and this knight somehow potentially can be active after black brake with f5. So, it is better to not open the game on the kingside, but on the queenside, if it is possible. }
6. Ng3 c6

14. bxc4 c5 15. Rab1 cxd4 16. Bxd4 Bc6
{ Black managed to develop all the pieces on the right squares. Pawn structure is even better for black because white has three pawn islands and the pawn on c4 can become the target for black pieces. The position is about equal. }

The first one is that Be is better placed than on the d3 because after Ne1 or Nd2 the Be control the important h5 square and in some positions doesnt even allow this active black move. The second one is that now white cant ply the main positions with the Ne1-Nd3 because this bishop takes the d3 square and the final one is that now after the both e5 or c5 the d4 square would be weak and white would have to play d5 after which the bishop would be under attack after both Ne5 or Nc5 later on. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4
{ This is the most principled white move here. Black allows white to take the center with the pawns and white do that. With this move white completely grab the space in the center. }
4... d6
{ Black can also play without this move and just castle here on the kingside. If white play e5 in the next move knight goes to e8 and with d6 black can destroy white center. Nevertheless, this will only transpose to the main line after 5. Nf3 and d6. }
5. h3
{ This is the move that white try to not show black what he wants to do. Some ideas are possible g4 with the sharp play even on the kingside or maybe just ordinary next move Nf3. In some variations white also try some other moves like 6. Bg5. I will try to show you all of them. The obvious bad side of this move is the fact that now white don't use his space advantage and don't develop the pieces, so black has the time to counter white. }
5... O-O 6. Nf3
{ This is white best move here. With this move white develop his knight and then his bishop from f1 in order to castle on the short side and start playing on the queenside. After that move, we have the position from the classical position but with the white move h3. It is hard to say is this good or bad because the position will be different and mostly related to the Petrosyan line with the fast move d5 after the black move e5. }
6... e5 7. Bg5
{ This is another move that is not making the point behind the h3 idea. Now white just allow black to exchange the d4 pawn and the white king is still in the center of the board. Also, if white allow the exd4 hen the bishop belongs to the e3 to support the d4 square. }
7... exd4 8. Nxd4 Re8
{ Now the pawn on e4 cant be immediately taken, but he h6 and g5 could put the bishop back and then e4 pawn could fall. }
9. Qc2 { To protect the e4 pawn. } 9... Nc6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bd3 h6 12. Be3 c5

5. Nf3
{ With this, most natural move white start the main line of the King's Indian. Because of that, you can find this variation as the Classical King's Indian. In this chapter, I would like you to show the main miscellaneous white answers here and the Exchange variation of the King Indian. Here white has three main alternatives to the 5. Nf3. Let's see all of them. }
5... O-O 6. Be2 e5
{ This is the starting position from the Classical King Indian. Here I would like to show you how to play against the drawish exchange variation. }
7. dxe5
{ With this move, we get the most drawish positions in the Kings Indian. Nevertheless, there is still some potential for play. Remember that this position using only the players that want to play for a draw. Knowing that just play in the equal position. }
7... dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Bg5
{ This is the most tested and played white move here. Nevertheless, it is hard to believe that white can get any kind of the advantage here. The main problem for him is potentially the pawn structure. White has the pawns on e4 and c4 and that potentially means that in the long run d4 square can be weak. On the other side, black can play c6 and secure the d5 square. White is the side that has to be precise in order to get the equality. }
9... Re8 10. O-O
{ This is the best move for black. If white does not force position with the Nd5 black would just put the knight on the c5 or the c7 after the c6 and via e6 fight for the d4 square. In the meantime white just doesnt have a concrete plan and even do his position is not maybe worst is hard to play it. }

{ This is another white tray to make it difficult or even not to allow black the standard plan with e5. In reality, white cant here stop black from playing the e5, but this is in my opinion even worse for black. I play the king Indian for whole my life and especially on the club level or the IM, GM level, this is white often try here. I have played here hundreds of games.

5... d6 6. Qd2
{ With this move white dream about the attack on the black king with the Bh6 and h4 idea. But this is only a dream here. }

7. Bh6 Bxh6 8. Qxh6 cxd4 9. Nxd4 Nc6
{ The position is about equal. Black is a little bit ahead in development since White has lost too much time for the exchange of the dark square bishop. That been said, white doesn't have now enough time to maintain with his mating attack related with the h4 move. }
10. Qd2 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 Be6 12. e3 Qa5 13. Be2 Rfc8
{ With a nice position for black. He is ahead in development and gets first to the play. The position is objectively equal, but it's much easier to play with a black who has slight initiative. }

After a while, I had a time and start investing this line for a couple of months. I took hundreds of games and realize that e5 is just not enough. That been said, I think that c5 is mandatory here. Black has to start the break in the center, and if e5 is not so good then c5 is the only alternative. To be honest, I also play this line with white when I have a chance. Not because is so good, but because black to often play e5. }

{ This is one, actually really interesting white try here. I see and analyze this move for quite a lot of the time with one of a friend, strong National Master, who regularly used this as his main weapon against the KID but at the end with the start of this year, after the defeat in the last game abandon this idea. To be honest, I find the plan that I will show you before earlier in our analyze, but no one has found him in the games, except in that last game. We come to the conclusion that black cant be worst there and he abandons that idea and starts to find some other lines in the KID. The white plan is here to get some kind of the attack on the kingside. he tries that with the moves like f3, g4, h4 and so on. This plan looks scary but this is not something that is really serious for black to be afraid there. The first time that I saw this idea a few years ago, where the friend of mine shows me, I already was a little bit suspicious because with this plan white make a positional 'mistake' because he starts playing on the side where black has to play based on the pawn structure. Nevertheless, we make a lot of investigations and get to the conclusion that white can do that and black tries to play also there on the kingside is not enough for him. Actually, if black goes for the play on the kingside and open the position there, he will get under heavy pressure. The problem for black is related to the position of the kings. Black easily can be very exposed on the kingside when white is quite safe in the middle of the board because the position is closed, and white has extra space in the center, but also can at some point castle on the queenside. Then I exclusively try o get the plan how to play on the queenside and find a specifical play that is very close with the early h3 variation and get black incredible positions. }

To be honest, I find the plan that I will show you before earlier in our analyze, but no one has found him in the games, except in that last game. We come to the conclusion that black cant be worst there and he abandons that idea and starts to find some other lines in the KID. The white plan is here to get some kind of the attack on the kingside. he tries that with the moves like f3, g4, h4 and so on. This plan looks scary but this is not something that is really serious for black to be afraid there. The first time that I saw this idea a few years ago, where the friend of mine shows me, I already was a little bit suspicious because with this plan white make a positional "mistake" because he starts playing on the side where black has to play based on the pawn structure. Nevertheless, we make a lot of investigations and get to the conclusion that white can do that and black tries to play also there on the kingside is not enough for him. Actually, if black goes for the play on the kingside and open the position there, he will get under heavy pressure. The problem for black is related to the position of the kings. Black easily can be very exposed on the kingside when white is quite safe in the middle of the board because the position is closed, and white has extra space in the center, but also can at some point castle on the queenside. Then I exclusively try o get the plan how to play on the queenside and find a specifical play that is very close with the early h3 variation and get black incredible positions. }
6... e5
{ As I mentioned many times when wite allows you to play e5, go for it. } 7. d5
Na6
{ Here I want to explain the basic thing about this move and why I think that this is an important precise move. The black idea is here to go for the a5 and c6 with the play on the queenside. But, if now black first go for the a5, he will not get important tempi for the attack on the e4 pawn that we will saw not in this move order. }
8. f3
{ This is less aggressive white move here. It's not a bad one but doesn't fit into the main white idea to go for the action on the kingside. This now looks like a hybrid of the Saemisch system, but the bishop is here on e2 to early and the knight on g1 doesn't have a nice square to go. }
8... Nh5
{ This is the main reason why f3 is not a good idea. Now, black can play Nh5 and block the play on the kingside by playing Nf4. }
9. Qd2 Nc5 { Black improve the position of the knight from a6. } 10. O-O-O a6
{ Now black start preparing the play on the queenside. } 11. Kb1 Bd7
{ And we get incredible unclear position on the board. But, to be honest this white setup with the f3 and Be2 and without the developed knight from g1 doesn't look so good for me. IN my view, here white makes few moves that are not good together and now has a problem how to proceed. On the other side, black has clear play to go for the b5 and start to open the front there. }
12. g4 { This is almost the same as in the line before. } 12... Nf4
{ Black block the play on the kingside and can start actions on the queenside. }

{ This is an incredibly important move. Here black makes the pressure on the e4 pawn in order to make white to play f3 and doesn't have such a nice pawn structure on the kingside and also to close the d1 - h5 diagonal where both, white queen and the light square bishop support h4 - h5 break later on. }

The light square bishop defends the pawns on the e4 and g4, and his queen also defends the pawn on g4. That means that still, his knight can go on e2 or queen on d2. It's too artificial setup where black has a nice position after the next move c6. }

13... Rb8 14. O-O-O Nd4

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Be3
{ This is one, actually really interesting white try here. I see and analyze this move for quite a lot of the time with one of a friend, strong National Master, who regularly used this as his main weapon against the KID but at the end with the start of this year, after the defeat in the last game abandon this idea. To be honest, I find the plan that I will show you before earlier in our analyze, but no one has found him in the games, except in that last game. We come to the conclusion that black cant be worst there and he abandons that idea and starts to find some other lines in the KID. The white plan is here to get some kind of the attack on the kingside. he tries that with the moves like f3, g4, h4 and so on. This plan looks scary but this is not something that is really serious for black to be afraid there. The first time that I saw this idea a few years ago, where the friend of mine shows me, I already was a little bit suspicious because with this plan white make a positional "mistake" because he starts playing on the side where black has to play based on the pawn structure. Nevertheless, we make a lot of investigations and get to the conclusion that white can do that and black tries to play also there on the kingside is not enough for him. Actually, if black goes for the play on the kingside and open the position there, he will get under heavy pressure. The problem for black is related to the position of the kings. Black easily can be very exposed on the kingside when white is quite safe in the middle of the board because the position is closed, and white has extra space in the center, but also can at some point castle on the queenside. Then I exclusively try o get the plan how to play on the queenside and find a specifical play that is very close with the early h3 variation and get black incredible positions. }
6... e5
{ As I mentioned many times when wite allows you to play e5, go for it. } 7. d5
Na6
{ Here I want to explain the basic thing about this move and why I think that this is an important precise move. The black idea is here to go for the a5 and c6 with the play on the queenside. But, if now black first go for the a5, he will not get important tempi for the attack on the e4 pawn that we will saw not in this move order. }
8. g4
{ This is the most dangerous move I think in this system and the better one then f3 here, because, after f3, black can go for the Nh5 and here this is impossible. White use here brutal method to go for the white king with all the pawns there, g4, h4 and so on. }
8... Nc5
{ This is an incredibly important move. Here black makes the pressure on the e4 pawn in order to make white to play f3 and doesn't have such a nice pawn structure on the kingside and also to close the d1 - h5 diagonal where both, white queen and the light square bishop support h4 - h5 break later on. }
9. Bf3
{ This is the most principled white answer here, but unfortunately for him also doesn't work because now all his pieces are tied up in the defense and can't control the black c6 break in the next move. This is the move that white has to play if he wants to maintain his ideas setup but please take a look and see how all white pieces are tied up now into defense. The light square bishop defends the pawns on the e4 and g4, and his queen also defends the pawn on g4. That means that still, his knight can go on e2 or queen on d2. It's too artificial setup where black has a nice position after the next move c6. }
9... c6
{ This is a critical move that gives black nice position. All other moves allow white to continue his plan to play on the kingside. Now, black immediately counter-play white in the center and want to open the front on the queenside. }
10. g5
{ And now we get the most accurate and in my view the only white move to get the unclear and equal position. }
10... Nfd7
{ In my view the best move. The alternative 10... Ne8 is in my opinion to passive. Black has to be concrete and active immediately. This move sacrifices the pawn, but for the pawn, black get a very nice alternative. }
11. dxc6 bxc6 12. Qxd6 Ne6
{ Black sacrifices the pawn, but now all his pieces get the nice squares and black get nice initiative. }
13. Nge2 { The best white move. Alternative Qc6 is not so good. } 13... Qa5
{ Black remove the Queen from d8 in order to play the next move Nb6 without to exchange the queens. }
14. O-O-O Nb6
{ And now is hard for white to even defend the pawn on c4. With the next moves likes Ba6 and Rab8, Rfc8, the black initiative will become extra dangerous for white. I will always take black here. }

9... dxc5 10. h4 Ne8 11. h5 Nd6
{ Without the dark square bishop, those pawns on the kingside will become weaker more time then stronger for white. Also, now when white doesn't have the darksquare bishop, its hard to imagine how his attack will go through. Black position on the kingside is great and the knight on d6 is a great piece. The position is still unclear, but I believe that black with time will get a slight edge because of the bishop pair and a safe king. }

{ This is one, actually really interesting white try here. I see and analyze this move for quite a lot of the time with one of a friend, strong National Master, who regularly used this as his main weapon against the KID but at the end with the start of this year, after the defeat in the last game abandon this idea. To be honest, I find the plan that I will show you before earlier in our analyze, but no one has found him in the games, except in that last game. We come to the conclusion that black cant be worst there and he abandons that idea and starts to find some other lines in the KID. The white plan is here to get some kind of the attack on the kingside. he tries that with the moves like f3, g4, h4 and so on. This plan looks scary but this is not something that is really serious for black to be afraid there. The first time that I saw this idea a few years ago, where the friend of mine shows me, I already was a little bit suspicious because with this plan white make a positional "mistake" because he starts playing on the side where black has to play based on the pawn structure. Nevertheless, we make a lot of investigations and get to the conclusion that white can do that and black tries to play also there on the kingside is not enough for him. Actually, if black goes for the play on the kingside and open the position there, he will get under heavy pressure. The problem for black is related to the position of the kings. Black easily can be very exposed on the kingside when white is quite safe in the middle of the board because the position is closed, and white has extra space in the center, but also can at some point castle on the queenside. Then I exclusively try o get the plan how to play on the queenside and find a specifical play that is very close with the early h3 variation and get black incredible positions. }

{ This is an incredibly important move. Here black makes the pressure on the e4 pawn in order to make white to play f3 and doesn't have such a nice pawn structure on the kingside and also to close the d1 - h5 diagonal where both, white queen and the light square bishop support h4 - h5 break later on. }
