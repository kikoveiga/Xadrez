{ @@HeaderStart@@Sethuraman's 1.e4 Part 2: a Lifetime Repertoire@@HeaderEnd@@   The “1. e4 Saga” continues...    Hello, friends from all over the Chess World! Welcome to my second part of 1. e4. This is Grandmaster S.P. Sethuraman and I am back with my deadliest novelties and roaring analysis with breezy and entertaining comments. Hope you guys relished Part-1 of this series which focused on the Petroff, Scotch & others, and now we are continuing the journey ahead with the Sicilians, French, and Caro Kann. So, I can already feel the excitement among you when you hear the names: 'Sicilian, French and Caro Kann.' I can guess that your first question will be whether I am going to steer the wheel into semipopular directions like the Rosolimo or dive into the ocean of the killer Open Sicilians. We are diving headfirst into the principled Open Sicilians battles, the highly fashionable and aggressive Tal Variation against the Caro Kann, and the dangerous 3. Nc3 against the French, which could lead to lines such as the Rubinstein, Steinitz, or Winawer variations. So, the lines I've chosen contain a lot of atom bombs, waiting to burst.     As they say, the 1. b3 boys belong to the Cowboy clan. I was wondering, what do we call ourselves who play 1.e4 -? It is indeed a million-dollar Question, :@@EndBracket@@ and perhaps the one identity which comes to my mind right now is the Wolf Pack. :@@EndBracket@@ We can take pride in calling ourselves, The Wolf Pack as they are intelligent and hunt together.

I have won the Asian Championship in the year 2016.  I am a member of the historic bronze-winning Indian team at the Tromso Olympiad 2014.   And in the year 2020, I was euphoric to venture on a new role as an author and I wrote a book on the two main Sicilians - Taimanov and Najdorf from the White side for Thinkers Publishing.   So, I already have ample experience in taming the Sicilians. And then my journey as an author continues in Chessable as you are now holding my fourth course. I hope my courses and books have made a huge impact on the students to improve their understanding and get into the mind of how a Grandmaster analyses his openings and I can assure you that this course which you are holding right now is one of my best works and I am pretty confident that it will make a big name.   Among my fellow compatriots and peers, I have always made a huge impression on them for my opening preparation and known to be a deadly 1. e4 player. It was really mellifluous to receive appreciation of my opening work from the former World Champion, my chess hero, and ageless Vishy Anand himself, who quoted the following words in the foreword of my book on 1. e4 against the Nadjtorf and Taimanov. So here it goes.”   In his own words:  @@StartBlockQuote@@I got to know Sethu more closely a few years back when we trained together a few times.

So the positions are arranged in such a away that it contains both positional, strategical and tactical ones jumbled with each other without many hints as in a tournament game no one would tell you the details. Good luck solving them!  D@@EndBracket@@ Quickstarters!  And to start with we have the quick starter guide which will help the viewers to gain a quick insight. It is divided into three parts which will make it convenient for the viewers to browse through.  The first part is on the Sicilian and the second part is on the Caro and the third part on French.  And I would also like to mention the students that there is a prominent feature of important lines marked inside the course which mainly deals with the options having higher chances to occur in a tournament game. So, it is an extremely useful feature available in Chessable apart from many others like the fascinating move trainer technology.  References  Apart from the main tools like Megabase, Twic, Correspondence database, I have gone through various chess books and Chessable courses. To name them a few:  Books:  Parimarjan Negis book on Sicilian/French  Gawain Jones Book on Dragon  Chessable courses:  Anish Giri's course on the Najdorf, French and Dragon  Sam Shankland's course on Classical Sicilian  Wesley's course on  1.e4  part 1 and 2  Erwins course on the Caro Kann  Harikrishna's Course on the Taimanov  Alex Colovic course on Simplified Najdorf  FM Kamil Plichta course on the Four Horsemen  So, these are main chess material I checked out to see what their recommendations are against our main directions.  Uff... That’s a long list and that explains the reason why it took a hell of a lot of time. Good things are always worth the wait I believe and hope this jaw-dropping course will satisfy the people who are eagerly waiting for it. Discussions in the Forum/Feedbacks/ Ideas, First of all, I would like to thank everyone for showing me towering support for all my Chessable courses with some raving reviews and comments. I am always ready for improvements and looking forward to discussing in the forum. So, keep posting them. I love to interact with the wonderful Chessable community in the Forum as every time they surprise me with their interesting suggestions/unexpected ideas. So once again shout out to the lovely people out there supporting my courses and exchanging ideas 😊  Thank you notes:😊  My sincere gratitude to my wonderful parents for always being there and constantly supporting me in all my ventures, my awesome Chessable students for motivating me to do great work, the professional Chessable team always ready to help when you need it, and most importantly the beta testers who did a fantastic job in making this course a quality one. They took a lot of pain to highlight the improvements and I thank them for their immense efforts. Now without further adieu, I invite you to the deadliest course in Chessable History.

{ The main move with the intention to unpin the Knight on f6 with ...Be7. The immediate  7.Bxf6  will be met with  7...Qxf6  . }
7. Qd3
{ The modern way of reacting to this mainline of 6...e6. The Queen on d3 after long castle can head to g3, that is the point of placing it here.   Apart from 7. Qd3,  7.Qd2  is, of course, the main line.   and there is also this interesting sideline  7.Bb5  which I myself played a couple of times against strong Grandmasters like Gelfand and Sam Shankland. In Shankland's course, he found some nice ideas for Black to neutralize this move. So let's focus on the unexplored and fresh option 7. Qd3. }
7... Bd7 { Solidifying the Knight on c6. } 8. O-O-O
{ 8.Ndb5  is a good practical try from White but if Black plays accurately then it fizzles out to a draw. For example:  8...Nb4  9.Qd1  a6  10.Bxf6  gxf6   10...Qxf6  fails to  11.Nc7  11.a3  axb5  12.axb4  Rxa1  13.Qxa1  and  13...d5  is the key conrete idea here and after  14.exd5  Bxb4  Black is doing fine. }
8... a6
{ As Ndb5 was a serious threat, Black is forced to include ...a6 before developing his other pieces. }
9. f4 { And we foray our pawn towards the centre. } 9... b5
{ One of the points behind ...a6. } 10. Nxc6 Bxc6 11. f5
{ Exerting pressure on the e6 pawn.  11.Nd5  is interesting but Black is time to stabilize after  11...exd5  12.e5  dxe5  13.fxe5  Be7  14.exf6  Bxf6  and he is doing fine. }
11... Be7 12. fxe6 fxe6 13. e5
{ Blowing up the position by breaking up the opponent's pawns. This leads to an advantage for White, but we need to know what exactly we are doing. That is why this line is analyzed in greater detail in the corresponding chapter. }

{ The “Keres Attack” against the Scheveningen variation of the Sicilian is a well-known name among the chess aficionados and has a reputation of being very dangerous for Black. The Keres attack is named after Paul Keres, who in 1943 played this move 6.g4! against Efim Bogoljubow. In that game, Black did not react very well against the newly discovered 6. g4 and was thrashed in 32 moves.   The main idea is to play  6...--  7.g5  forcing the Knight on  f6  to run away from the kingside, leaving Black with fewer defenders on this area. It is also the starting move of a pawn storm on this flank. Although  g4  is a highly aggressive move, it can also be steered in a positional style. White can develop his bishop to  g2  , play  h3  , and keep things more under control. This is a modern treatment that became popular a few years later.  So there is a wide array of attacking plans. If White manages to play  g5  , he usually continues later with  f4  and  h4  grabbing more space on the Kingside. The Kingside Rook can join the attack via  h3  or  g1  , depending on the demands of the position. White can aim for the pawn rupture with f4-f5 or he can go further with h4-h5-g6. Castling is usually done on the Queenside but by no means this is the only way to play. White can keep his King in the center for quite some time, or he can unexpectedly castle short bringing his Kingside Rook into the game if needed.  In general, there is a large field for imagination in the Keres Attack. In fancy terms, The Ghost Rider @@StartBracket@@ g4@@EndBracket@@ is all set to haunt the Black pieces. So let's go! }

{ In the Dragon Variation, Black fianchettos a Bishop on the h8–a1 diagonal. It was named by Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky in 1901, who noticed a resemblance between Black's Kingside pawn structure @@StartBracket@@pawns on d6, e7, f7, g6 and h7@@EndBracket@@ and the stars of the Draco constellation.   Some brief history about the Draco constellation as well: :@@EndBracket@@  @@StartBracket@@Draco is one of the largest constellations in the sky. Located in the northern celestial hemisphere, the constellation represents Ladon, the dragon that guarded the gardens of the Hesperides in Greek mythology. The name Draco means “the dragon” in Latin.@@EndBracket@@  Perhaps you can google the pictures of it and you will identify clear similarities.   Coming back to chess, White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterized by  6.Be3  Bg7  7.f3  O-O  8.Qd2  Nc6  ,  when  9.O-O-O  ,  9.Bc4  and  9.g4  are White's most common moves.   This variation leads to extremely sharp play and is ferociously complicated since the players castle on the opposite wings and the game becomes a race between White's kingside attack and Black's queenside counterattack. Some of the notable players who have popularized Dragon from the Black side are the Great Garry Kasparov who used it as a surprise weapon in his 1995 World Championship match against Anand, and yes, we have Grandmaster Tiviakov as well whose main opening is the Dragon. In modern times it is English Grandmaster Gawain Jones who played a pivotal role in spearheading the opening theory. And recently to add to that list is Anish Giri's Dragon course on Chessable.

{ In the Dragon Variation, Black fianchettos a Bishop on the h8–a1 diagonal. It was named by Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky in 1901, who noticed a resemblance between Black's Kingside pawn structure @@StartBracket@@pawns on d6, e7, f7, g6 and h7@@EndBracket@@ and the stars of the Draco constellation.   Some brief history about the Draco constellation. Draco is one of the largest constellations in the sky. Located in the northern celestial hemisphere, the constellation represents Ladon, the dragon that guarded the gardens of the Hesperides in Greek mythology. The name Draco means “the dragon” in Latin.  Perhaps you can google the pictures of it and you will identify clear similarities.   Coming back to chess, White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterized by  6.Be3  Bg7  7.f3  O-O  8.Qd2  Nc6  ,  when  9.O-O-O  ,   9.Bc4   and  9.g4  are White's most common moves.   This variation leads to extremely sharp play and is ferociously complicated since the players castle on the opposite wings and the game becomes a race between White's kingside attack and Black's queenside counterattack. Some notable players who have popularized Dragon from the Black side are the great Garry Kasparov who used it as a surprise weapon in his 1995 World Championship match against Anand.   And yes, we have Grandmaster Tiviakov whose main opening is the Dragon. In modern times it is, English Grandmaster Gawain Jones who played a pivotal role in spearheading the opening theory. And recently to add to that list is Anish Giri's Dragon course on Chessable.   Let's go ahead with the moves now. }

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5, and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharp positions after 6. Bg5. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. This is the most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-Vachier in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move 6. Bg5 is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow up with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }
6... Nbd7
{ This is one more trendy option to hold the f6 knight and develop the pieces immediately maintaining the option of either ...e6 or ...e5 in the future. }
7. Bc4
{ And in this particular direction, we opt for a different approach with 7. Bc4. Our general setup is to play f4 and Qf3, but here it is not that effective as Black has not committed to ...e6.   Nevertheless,  7.f4  is one the main moves and Black reacts with  7...Qc7  8.Qf3  h6  9.Bxf6   9.Bh4  g5  9...Nxf6  10.f5  Qc5  11.O-O-O  g5  with a complex battle where Black is doing fine. The text move 7. Bc4 is threatening as the Bishop's eyes the c4-f7 diagonal and Black has to be concerned about sacrifices on e6 when he initiates his pawn to ...e6 to connect his pieces. }
7... h6
{ If Black tries to push the g5 Bishop, then we can gain the momentum by exchanging it. }
8. Bxf6
{ 8.Bh4  is also possible, but the point of Bxf6 is to hurry up with quick development and utilize the attacking possibilities before Black consolidates his position. }
8... Nxf6 9. Qe2

And  9...b5  is met by  10.Bb3  Bb7  11.O-O-O  and once again Black is in big trouble with his King in the centre. If you look closely all his pieces on the Kingside are sleeping and if it is definitely a bad sign for him. }
10. O-O-O { All our forces are set. Next, it is time to fire. } 10... Qc7

13... bxc3 14. exf6 gxf6 15. Rd3 cxb2+ 16. Kb1
{ And White is in fact winning here with his commanding pieces. Black's Majesty is stuck, his pieces are underdeveloped, and the pawn on b2 only looks flashy and does nothing else. Next on the cards is Qh5 piercing into Black's camp. }

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5, and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharp positions after 6. Bg5. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. This is the most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-Vachier in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move 6. Bg5 is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow up with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }

{ This looks logical as now  6...e5  doesn't make sense. Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }
7. f4 { The immediate threat is e5 to trap the Knight on f6 which is pinned. }
7... Nbd7
{ This is often referred as the Gelfand variation due to his immense contribution to his line. }
8. Qe2
{ The new trend.  8.Qf3  used to be the mainline in the olden days but later this new trend of 8. Qe2 became more poisonous as it helps White to carry out the e5 break. }
8... h6
{ Played by Nepomniatchi once against Vishy Anand in Wijk An Zee 2019. Black always has this option of pushing the Bishop to h4 before proceeding with his plans. But sometimes it weakens his position and sometimes it is useful. So let's probe into it. }

Qxf6 12. Nd5 { Squeezing in and the Knight on d5 is a star. } 12... Qd8 13. Nf3
{ An extremely precise move to challenge the Knight on e5. Otherwise Black is totally fine. For instance, if  13.O-O-O  then Black has this fantastic resource  13...g6  followed by Bg7 and he holds the Knight on e5. }

{ This is known as the Gothenburg variation named after the famous Gothenburg event of 1955 where the Soviet trio of Geller, Spassky and Keres score some spectacular wins for White against respectively Panno, Pilnik and even Miguel Najdorf himself. It's a highly risky option for Black as it strips apart the Kingside, but White ought to know what he is doing in order to punish it, otherwise, it is not going to be easy.   This used to be popular before and once in a while some grandmasters revive the line but now it is in the graveyard as White found modern ways to treat this tabiya and gain an advantage. }

{ The Najdorf!! The opening is named after the Polish-Argentine grandmaster, Miguel Najdorf, although he was not the first strong player to play the variation. Many players have lived by the Najdorf, notably Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov and recently Mr. Anish Giri :@@EndBracket@@ has been a successful ambassador of this opening.

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5, and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharp positions after 6. Bg5. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. This is the most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-Vachier in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move 6. Bg5 is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow up with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }
6... e6
{ This looks logical as now  6...e5  doesn't make sense. Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }
7. f4 { The immediate threat is e5 to trap the Knight on f6 which is pinned. }
7... Be7 { Looks logical to unpin the Knight on f6. } 8. Qf3
{ The Queen is more active here on f3 where it can go to g3 at some instances and also mainly prevents Black's regrouping of pieces by b5-Bb7 due to the blow with e5. Moreover, after long castling which is coming next, the d-file is left free for the Rook to operate.   Having said that, here if  8.Qe2  like in the line of 7...Nbd7, it fails to  8...h6  9.Bh4  Nxe4  10.Bxe7  Nxc3  That's the problem when the Black Bishop is on e7. So beware!! And don't fall into this cunning trap. }
8... Qc7
{ Keeping control over the e5 square.  8...Nbd7  9.O-O-O  Qc7  leads to the same story. }
9. O-O-O Nbd7
{ Next, Black will follow it with ...b5-Bb7. This is an ideal Black setup. The only question is whether he is in time before White starts the attack. }
10. g4
{ And here Anish has recommended two directions in his course. One is  10...h6  and the other one is  10...b5  . }
10... b5
{ So if Black achieves his ideal setup: that is Bishop on b7 then ...b4 is a strong threat. White should already act quickly here not to lose the momentum for the attack. }
11. Bxf6 { White gives the Bishop to roll the g-pawn. } 11... Nxf6 12. g5
{ The main point behind capturing on f6 is to advance our pawns as far as possible, focusing on the Black King and making short castling quite dangerous for Black. }
12... Nd7 13. f5 { Seizing the initiative. } 13... Bxg5+
{ Capturing the pawn is one of the mainlines here. } 14. Kb1 O-O
{ At some point Black players tried this move as well to hold the game but White got a pleasant edge. }
15. fxe6 Nb6
{ 15...fxe6  is a blunder due to  16.Qg2  and White wins as Black is unable to cope with double threats: his Bishop on g5 is hanging and the pawn on e6 as well. }

Before, only  19.Qxg5  was played and play might continue with  19...exd4  20.Bd3  g6  21.Rhf1  Qg7  22.Rxf8  Qxf8  and though it looks dangerous for Black he is doing fine in the ensuing complications. One enthralling line here is  23.Bxg6  hxg6  24.Qxg6  Qg7  25  Qe8  Kh7  26.Rf1  threatening Rf7 to win the Queen  26...Kh6  27.Qe1  and here comes the mind-blowing defensive resource of  27...Kh5!!  and Black holds. }
19... Bh6 20. Qe2 { Drifting way from the pin along the c8-g4 diagonal. } 20...

2. d4
{ A logical move towards the centre. There are some funky or offbeat lines like  2.Qe2  stopping ...d5 but then Black can play  2...c5  transposing to a Sicilian where our Queen is not ideally placed on e2.

2... d5 3. Nc3
{ Placing the Knight on a more active square which supports the e4 pawn, maintaining the tension.   Apart from that,  3.e5  and  3.Nd2  are the other main options.   3.Nd2  is  equally popular, advocated by Wesley So in his Chessable courses, but my main concern was that the Knight on d2 blocks the c1 Bishop. Likewise  3.e5  clarifies tension in the centre in a quick manner. So if we look from a principled point of view brutally then 3. Nc3 is in the spirit of the position and is the option that Black players are really afraid to face while employing the French. :@@EndBracket@@ }

9... b6
{ This move became popular after the French expert Daniel Fridman employed it against Caruana, and later the Polish youngster Duda took it up and defeated some strong players. So White ought to know how to react in a precise way to secure an advantage. The idea is simple, Black holds the c5 pawn and prepares ...Ba6. }
10. Bd2 { Playing against the Queen on a5 and right now c4 is the threat. }

1. e4 e6
{ FRENCH!! The idea behind the French Defense is that Black plays e6 to prepare to advance d7-d5, in order to immediately challenge White’s pawn on e4. But the biggest problem is that the c8 Bishop is blocked by the very first move of 1. e6 and often minimizes its scope. Many times the entire game will revolve around this key weakness. }
2. d4
{ Logical move towards the center. There are some funky or offbeat lines like  2.Qe2  stopping...d5 but then Black can play  2...c5  transposing to a Sicilian where our Queen is not ideally placed on  e2  . Nevertheless, it has been tried and tested in many top level games as it avoids heaps of theoretical debates. But let's stick to the principled option here. :@@EndBracket@@ }
2... d5 3. Nc3
{ Placing the Knight on a more active square which supports the e4 pawn maintaining the tension. Apart from the text move,  3.e5   and  3.Nd2  are the key options. 3.Nd2 is also equally popular, recommended by Wesley So in his Opening series, but my main concern was that the Knight on d2 blocks the c1 Bishop.   Likewise  3.e5  clarifies tension in the centre in a quick manner. So if we look from the principled point of view, then  3.Nc3  is in the spirit of the position and is the one Black players are really afraid to face while employing the French :@@EndBracket@@. }
3... Bb4
{ This is called the Winawer Variation, named after Szymon Winawer and pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik. It is one of the main systems in the French apart from  3...N  f6  .   The point of  3...Bb4  is that it pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve the central tension. White normally clarifies the central situation for the moment with  4.e5  ,  gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced. P.S Anish in his French defense course has recommended the move 3... Bb4. }
4. e5
{ There are some funkier tries for White: to hold the pawn on e4 by  4.Bd3  , aggressive ones like  4.Nge2  , and quieter ones like  4.exd5  , but  4.e5  is the main principled line advancing further and gaining space. }
4... b6
{ This move is rarely played, but it was employed by some Grandmasters like Jusupow, Vaganian and Ponkratov. The point is to provide scope for the c8 Bishop, but unlike  4...c5  it is not challenging the centre and is too slow allowing White to build up a strong attack. }
5. Qg4
{ Targetting the g7 pawn. One of the major drawbacks of Black placing the Bishop on b4. }
5... Bf8
{ 5...g6  , of course, weakens the dark squares and White can react with  6.h4  with the idea of h5 and if  6...h5  now we can go back with  7.Qg3  and White will steer into the dark squares soon. White is clearly better here.   Apart from 5...g6, if  5...Kf8  Black obviously loses the right to castle and White can react in the same manner with the h- pawn with  6.h4  with a nice advantage.   The text move with  5...Bf8  looks to be the only move which does not create square weaknesses by pawn push or weakening the King position but the drawback is, of course, Black has wasted two moves with his Bishop @@StartBracket@@ Bf8- Bb4-Bf8@@EndBracket@@ just to make White advance his pawn to e5. }
6. Nf3
{ Natural development. Meanwhile the Queen keeps an eye on the g7 pawn. } 6...
Ne7 7. a3
{ A powerful subtle positional move with the point that when Black plays ...Ba6 and exchanges the bishops, the pawn on a3 will have two roles:  
Preventing the Knight jump to b4  Preserving a tempo to exchange the bishops on a6 by not moving the bishop from f1. }
7... Ba6
{ If  7...Nf5  then we can go for  8.Bd3  eyeing the f5 Knight which makes ...Ba6 unplayable. }
8. Bxa6 Nxa6 9. Ne2
{ Once again rerouting the Knight to the Kingside and Black's pieces are stuck. Next on the cards is castling, Ng3, and improving the position slowly but surely. }

4... Qd7
{ This mysterious Queen move to  d7  always amazes me as it blocks the  c8  Bishop, but neverthless with ...Qd7 Black clearly shows that he is going to develop the Bishop via ...b6 and the point is to answer  5.Qg4  with  5...f5  . }
5. Qg4
{ But anyway we opt for the standard plan of exploiting the Bishop's placement on b4. }
5... f5
{ 5...f6  is met by  6.Nf3  followed by Bd3 and castle and White is on top. }
6. Qg3
{ Now that Black can no longer attack our centre, White is strategically much better as Black cannot develop his Knight to e7 due to the hanging pawn on g7. So his pieces are somewhat stuck. }
6... b6 { 6...Nc6  is met with  7.Bb5  and the pin is quite annnoying. } 7. h4

1. e4 e6
{ The FRENCH!! The idea behind the French Defense is that Black plays e6 to prepare to advance d7-d5, in order to immediately challenge White’s pawn on e4. But the biggest problem is that the c8 Bishop is blocked by the very first move of 1...e6 and often minimizes its scope. Many times the entire game will revolve around this fundamental weakness. }
2. d4
{ A logical move towards the centre. There are some funky or offbeat lines like  2.Qe2  stopping ...d5 but then Black can play  2...c5  transposing to a Sicilian where our Queen is not ideally placed on e2. Nevertheless this has been tried and tested in many top-level games as it avoids heaps of theoretical debates. But let's stick to the principled option here. :@@EndBracket@@ }
2... d5 3. Nc3
{ Placing the Knight on a more active square which supports the e4 pawn, maintaining the tension.   Apart from that,  3.e5  and  3.Nd2  are the other main options.   3.Nd2  is  equally popular, advocated by Wesley So in his Chessable courses, but my main concern was that the Knight on d2 blocks the c1 Bishop. Likewise  3.e5  clarifies tension in the centre in a quick manner. So if we look from a principled point of view brutally then 3. Nc3 is in the spirit of the position and is the option that Black players are really afraid to face while employing the French. :@@EndBracket@@ }
3... Bb4
{ This is called the Winawer Variation, named after Szymon Winawer and pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik. It is one of the main systems in the French apart from  3...N  f6  .   The point of  3...Bb4  is that it pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve the central tension. White normally clarifies the central situation for the moment with  4.e5  ,  gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced. P.S Anish in his French defense course has recommended the move 3... Bb4. }
4. e5
{ There are some funkier tries for White: to hold the pawn on e4 by  4.Bd3  , aggressive ones like  4.Nge2  , and quieter ones like  4.exd5  , but  4.e5  is the main principled line advancing further and gaining space. }
4... c5 { Challenging the centre immediately without any delay. } 5. a3
{ The mainline - asking questions to the Bishop on b4. } 5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3
{ White has doubled pawns on the Queenside, which form the basis for Black's counterplay. They can also help White since they strengthen his centre and give him a semi-open b-file. White has a spatial advantage on the Kingside, where Black is even weaker than usual because he has traded off his dark-squared Bishop. Combined with the Bishop pair, this gives White attacking chances, which he must attempt to use as the long-term features of this pawn structure favour Black. }
6... Ne7 7. Qg4 O-O { This is one of the main options for Black. } 8. Bd3
{ Focusing on the kingside. } 8... Nbc6
{ Developing the Knight to put pressure on the d4 pawn. } 9. Bg5
{ Before, White players usually opted for  9.Qh5  which leads to complex variations.  9...Ng6  The only sensible move as other means to protect the h7 pawn will fail miserably.   For instance,  9...g6  weakens the dark squares.   And after  9...h6  the  10.Bxh6  blow kills Black.   Finally, if  9...Nf5  then we have  10.Nf3  as it's important to prevent ...Qh4 from Black and next 11.g4 is coming.  10.Nf3  Qc7  11.Be3  c4  12.Bxg6  fxg6  13.Qg4  Qf7  This position is discussed heavily in the opening book of Parimarjan Negi, Grandmaster Repertore. There are so many options there leading to different kinds of complex positions. Hence I prefer 9.Bg5 which is more direct and cuts down a lot on Black's options. }
9... Qa5 10. Ne2 { Supporting the c3 pawn. } 10... Ng6
{ Blocking the d3 Bishop, as the direct  10...c4  is met with  11.Bxh7  Kxh7  12.Bxe7  followed by Qh4+. }
11. O-O c4
{ At least now Black eliminates the Bishop pair, but the problem of him being strategically worse is not solved yet. Moreover the pawn chain of c3, d4, e5 is unrivaled. }
12. Bxg6 fxg6
{ 12...hxg6  would be a blunder as then  13.Qh4  followed by f4-Rf3-Rh3 is devastating for Black. }
13. a4
{ Expanding on the queenside as well, and not allowing even an inch of counterplay with ...Qa4. }
13... Bd7 { This happened in the game Leko-Morozevich 2016. } 14. h4
{ Coming for it. Next on cards is h5, breaking open Black's rigid pawn structure. }
14... Rf7 15. h5 { The much needed break to create an entry point. } 15... gxh5
16. Qxh5

Black has to sit and watch while White can execute his plans, although White has to choose his plans carefully in order to break the wall.

{ The “Keres Attack” against the Scheveningen variation of the Sicilian is a well-known name among the chess aficionados and has a reputation of being very dangerous. The Keres attack is named after Paul Keres, who in 1943 played this move 6. g4! against Efim Bogoljubow. In that game, Black did not react very well against the newly discovered 6. g4 and was thrashed in 32 moves.   The main idea is to play  6...--  7.g5  forcing the Knight on  f6  to run away from the kingside, leaving Black with fewer defenders in this area. It is also the starting move of a pawn storm on this flank. Although  g4  is a highly aggressive move, it can also be steered in a positional style. White can develop his bishop to  g2  , play  h3  , and keep things more under control. This is a modern treatment that became popular a few years later.  So there is a wide array of attacking plans. If White manages to play  g5  , he usually continues later with  f4  and  h4  grabbing more space on the kingside. The kingside Rook can join the attack via  h3  or  g1  , depending on the demands of the position. White can aim for the pawn rupture with f4-f5 or he can go further with h4-h5-g6. Castling is usually done on the Queenside but by no means this is the only way to play. White can keep his King in the center for quite some time, or he can unexpectedly castle short bringing his kingside Rook into the game if needed.  In general, there is a large field for imagination in the Keres Attack. In fancy terms, The Ghost Rider @@StartBracket@@ g4@@EndBracket@@ is all set to haunt the Black pieces. So let's go... }

6. g4
{ The “Keres Attack” against the Scheveningen variation of the Sicilian is a well-known name among the chess aficionados and has a reputation of being very dangerous. The Keres attack is named after Paul Keres, who in 1943 played this move 6. g4! against Efim Bogoljubow. In that game, Black did not react very well against the newly discovered 6. g4 and was thrashed in 32 moves.   The main idea is to play  6...--  7.g5  forcing the Knight on  f6  to run away from the kingside, leaving Black with fewer defenders in this area. It is also the starting move of a pawn storm on this flank. Although  g4  is a highly aggressive move, it can also be steered in a positional style. White can develop his bishop to  g2  , play  h3  , and keep things more under control. This is a modern treatment that became popular a few years later.  So there is a wide array of attacking plans. If White manages to play  g5  , he usually continues later with  f4  and  h4  grabbing more space on the kingside. The kingside Rook can join the attack via  h3  or  g1  , depending on the demands of the position. White can aim for the pawn rupture with f4-f5 or he can go further with h4-h5-g6. Castling is usually done on the Queenside but by no means this is the only way to play. White can keep his King in the center for quite some time, or he can unexpectedly castle short bringing his kingside Rook into the game if needed.  In general, there is a large field for imagination in the Keres Attack. In fancy terms, The Ghost Rider @@StartBracket@@ g4@@EndBracket@@ is all set to haunt the Black pieces. So let's go... }

{ The “Keres Attack” against the Scheveningen variation of the Sicilian is a well-known name among the chess aficionados and has a reputation of being very dangerous. The Keres attack is named after Paul Keres, who in 1943 played this move 6. g4! against Efim Bogoljubow. In that game, Black did not react very well against the newly discovered 6. g4 and was thrashed in 32 moves.   The main idea is to play  6...--  7.g5  forcing the Knight on  f6  to run away from the kingside, leaving Black with fewer defenders in this area. It is also the starting move of a pawn storm on this flank. Although  g4  is a highly aggressive move, it can also be steered in a positional style. White can develop his bishop to  g2  , play  h3  , and keep things more under control. This is a modern treatment that became popular a few years later.  So there is a wide array of attacking plans. If White manages to play  g5  , he usually continues later with  f4  and  h4  grabbing more space on the kingside. The kingside Rook can join the attack via  h3  or  g1  , depending on the demands of the position. White can aim for the pawn rupture with f4-f5 or he can go further with h4-h5-g6. Castling is usually done on the Queenside but by no means this is the only way to play. White can keep his King in the center for quite some time, or he can unexpectedly castle short bringing his kingside Rook into the game if needed.

In that game, Black did not react very well against the newly discovered 6. g4 and was thrashed in 32 moves.   The main idea is to play  6...--  7.g5  forcing the Knight on  f6  to run away from the kingside, leaving Black with fewer defenders in this area. It is also the starting move of a pawn storm on this flank. Although  g4  is a highly aggressive move, it can also be steered in a positional style. White can develop his bishop to  g2  , play  h3  , and keep things more under control. This is a modern treatment that became popular a few years later.  So there is a wide array of attacking plans. If White manages to play  g5  , he usually continues later with  f4  and  h4  grabbing more space on the kingside. The kingside Rook can join the attack via  h3  or  g1  , depending on the demands of the position. White can aim for the pawn rupture with f4-f5 or he can go further with h4-h5-g6. Castling is usually done on the Queenside but by no means this is the only way to play. White can keep his King in the center for quite some time, or he can unexpectedly castle short bringing his kingside Rook into the game if needed.

Some brief history about the Draco constellation. Draco is one of the largest constellations in the sky.

The name Draco means “the dragon” in Latin.  Perhaps you can google the pictures of it and you will identify clear similarities.   Coming back to chess, White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterized by  6.Be3  Bg7  7.f3  O-O  8.Qd2  Nc6  ,  when  9.O-O-O  ,   9.Bc4   and  9.g4  are White's most common moves.   This variation leads to extremely sharp play and is ferociously complicated since the players castle on the opposite wings and the game becomes a race between White's kingside attack and Black's queenside counterattack. Some notable players who have popularized Dragon from the Black side are the great Garry Kasparov who used it as a surprise weapon in his 1995 World Championship match against Anand.   And yes, we have Grandmaster Tiviakov whose main opening is the Dragon. In modern times it is, English Grandmaster Gawain Jones who played a pivotal role in spearheading the opening theory.

And yes, we have Grandmaster Tiviakov whose main opening is the Dragon. In modern times it is, English Grandmaster Gawain Jones who played a pivotal role in spearheading the opening theory.

I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines.

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor-sharp positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. 6. Bg5 is the most principled mainline, which has always had a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castling. }
6... e6 7. f4 Qc7
{ An interesting move drifting away the Queen from the g5-d8 diagonal and as well delaying ...Nbd7 so that he can be flexible with his b8 Knight either to c6 or to d7 later depending upon the situation but the drawback is that we can take Bxf6 here and Black is forced to double his pawns. }
8. Bxf6
{ Shattering Black's pawn structure. Here if   8.Qe2  then Black has extra options like  8...Nc6   and  8...b5  .  So we change our plans. }
8... gxf6 9. Qf3
{ The ideal place for the Queen which operates on the f3-a8 diagonal and as well it can go to h3 sometimes eyeing the e6 spot. }
9... Nc6 { Happened in the game of Giri-Korobov 2019 Rapid/Blitz. } 10. O-O-O
{ Holding the Knight on d4 strongly. } 10... Bd7 11. Nxc6
{ A timely exchange and Black now has to take a decision of how to capture on c6. }
11... Qxc6
{ 11...bxc6  simply blunts his Bishop on d7 and is bad after  12.Bc4  .   The same story goes for  11...Bxc6  as White has  12.Bc4  followed by f5 and there is huge pressure on the e6 pawn. So with 11...Qxc6, the main recapture, Black maintains his Bishop on d7 so that it can safeguard the e6 square. }
12. Qh5
{ A powerful move.   12.f5  was played in the aforementioned game of Anish-Korobov which was also slightly better for White but the text move, 12. Qh5 is even stronger as it eyes the f7 pawn and makes life difficult for Black as he is unable to castle long. }
12... Qc5 13. f5
{ And now we block the Queen exchange and White is simply much better due to the fact that the Black King has to remain stuck on e8 to defend the f7 spot. }

{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor-sharp positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. 6. Bg5 is the most principled mainline, which has always had a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castling. }

{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor-sharp positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. 6. Bg5 is the most principled mainline, which has always had a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castling. }

Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }

{ The perfect move order, Black hurries to develop his bishop to b7 before Be7. As we can see in line with  9...Be7  ,  how dangerous it can be if he delays bringing the c8 Bishop first. Now also ...b4 is one of Black's ideas. }
10. a3 { Stopping ...b4 is important here. } 10... Bb7
{ A very logical move but it is shockingly not the best option here. One might wonder the whole point of ...b5 is to place the Bishop on b7 and then why it is dubious here.

That's the subtle reason why 10...Be7 is more accurate here keeping the option of Rb8 flexible. }
11. Kb1 { Always an useful move to include. } 11... Be7

13. Rh3

Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor-sharp positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. 6. Bg5 is the most principled mainline, which has always had a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castling. }
6... e6
{ Looks logical as now  6...e5  doesn't make sense due to  7.Nf5  Bxf5  8.Bxf6  Qxf6  9.Nd5  Qd8  10.exf5  with a pleasant bind on the position. Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }
7. f4 { The immediate threat is e5 to trap the Knight on f6 which is pinned. }
7... Nbd7
{ This is often referred as the Gelfand variation due to his immense contribution to his line. }
8. Qe2
{ The new trend.  8.Qf3  used to be the mainline in the olden days but later this new trend of 8. Qe2 became more poisonous as it helps White to carry out the e5 break. }
8... Qc7 { Preventing e5 and controlling the e5 square. } 9. O-O-O b5
{ The perfect move order, Black hurries to develop his bishop to b7 before Be7. As we can see in line with  9...Be7  ,  how dangerous it can be if he delays bringing the c8 Bishop first. Now also ...b4 is one of Black's ideas. }
10. a3 { Stopping ...b4 is important here. } 10... Be7
{ Preferred by Anish Giri, and it is the best here, keeping the plan of ...Rb8-b4 alive. }
11. Bxf6
{ So now we change our plans and exchange the Bishop on  f6  , instead of  11.g4  or  11.h4  which is faced by  11...Rb8  . }
11... Nxf6 12. g4
{ And now we go for the hunt with the g-pawn. This happened in the online game of Pichot Alan-Anish Giri. }
12... Nd7
{ Anish played the best move, once again keeping control over the e5 square, and here I found a nice improvement over the game. }
13. Bg2 { 13.g5  happened in that game but after  13...Rb8  Black was fine. }
13... Rb8 { 13...Bb7  14.g5  followed by h4 and we have a wonderful position. }
14. e5
{ The key nuance as now Nc6 is on the cards thanks to the support from the g2 Bishop. }
14... Rb6
{ Keeps a check on Nc6 invasions but that does not solve his problems. } 15.
exd6 Rxd6 16. f5

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharped positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. The most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }

So that leaves the key option  9.a3  to spring in action. With the obvious fact that now Black cannot take on  9...Qxb2  due to  10.Na4  trapping the Queen. That is the main point of this quiet move 9. a3. }

12. O-O-O
{ It looks natural to castle long and go with the g-pawn roll with Garry four! }
12... Bd7
{ Black's idea is to take on d4 and sneak in with his Bishop to c6 having some pressure on the centre. }

{ On the direct  13.g4  Black has  13...Nxd4  14.Rxd4  Bc6  15.g5  hxg5  16.fxg5  Nd7  and his Knight is coming to e5 and he is totally fine. }

The most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines.

The most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-MVL in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharped positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. The most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-Vachier in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }
6... e6
{ Looks logical as now  6...e5  doesn't make sense. Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }
7. f4 { The immediate threat is e5 to trap the Knight on f6 which is pinned. }
7... Be7 { It looks logical to unpin the Knight on f6. } 8. Qf3
{ The Queen is more active here on f3 where it can go to g3 at some instances and also mainly prevents Black's regrouping of pieces by b5-Bb7 due to the blow with e5. Moreover, after long castling which is coming next, the d-file is left free for the Rook to operate.   Having said that, here if  8.Qe2  like in the line of 7...Nbd7, it fails to  8...h6  9.Bh4  Nxe4  10.Bxe7  Nxc3  (That's the problem when the Black Bishop is on e7. So beware!! Don't fall into this cunning trap.) }
8... Qa5
{ An old-fashioned move. The Black queen generally belongs to c7 and not on a5 as whenever Black plays ...b5 to develop his c8 Bishop, it hinders the a5 Queen. }
9. O-O-O Bd7
{ If  9...h6  10.Bh4  Qh5  then White can exchange the Queens by  11.Qxh5  Nxh5  12.Bxe7  Kxe7  and White is in time to play  13.g3  & Bg2 before Black consolidates. Black is clearly suffering this endgame.   And if  9...Nbd7  here, it doesn't really correlate with his Queen on a5 and we can continue with  10.Bc4  and Black is clearly struggling to develop and stabilize his position. }
10. Bxf6
{ With a concrete idea in mind. Otherwise, there was no need to give away the Bishop. }
10... Bxf6
{ The problem with  10...gxf6  is that  11.Nb3  Qc7  12.f5  is incredibly strong as after  12...Nc6  13.Qh5  is killing it, threatening to take the pawn on e6. }
11. e5 { Bam! and the Queen on f3 is eyeing the b7 pawn. } 11... dxe5 12. Nxe6
{ Double exclamation!! Only if I could use more exclamations I can tell how cool it is to play such moves. }

{ This is known as the Gothenburg variation named after the famous Gothenburg event of 1955 where the Soviet trio of Geller, Spassky and Keres score some spectacular wins for White against respectively Panno, Pilnik and even Miguel Najdorf himself. It's a highly risky option for Black as it strips apart the Kingside, but White ought to know what he is doing in order to punish it, otherwise, it is not going to be easy.   This used to be popular before and once in a while some grandmasters revive the line but now it is in the graveyard as White found modern ways to treat this tabiya and gain an advantage. }

6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharped positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. The most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-Vachier in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }
6... e6
{ Looks logical as now  6...e5  doesn't make sense. Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }
7. f4 { The immediate threat is e5 to trap the Knight on f6 which is pinned. }
7... Be7 { It looks logical to unpin the Knight on f6. } 8. Qf3
{ The Queen is more active here on f3 where it can go to g3 at some instances and also mainly prevents Black's regrouping of pieces by b5-Bb7 due to the blow with e5. Moreover, after long castling which is coming next, the d-file is left free for the Rook to operate.   Having said that, here if  8.Qe2  like in the line of 7...Nbd7, it fails to  8...h6  9.Bh4  Nxe4  10.Bxe7  Nxc3  (That's the problem when the Black Bishop is on e7. So beware!! Don't fall into this cunning trap.) }
8... Qc7
{ Keeping control over the e5 square.  8...Nbd7  9.O-O-O  Qc7  leads to the same story. }
9. O-O-O Nbd7
{ Next, Black will follow it with ...b5-Bb7. This is an ideal Black setup. The only question is whether he is in time before White starts the attack. }
10. g4
{ And here Anish has recommended two directions in his course. One is  10...h6  and the other one is  10...b5  . }
10... h6
{ The idea of this move is that after White captures on f6, he is not able to push g5 which was his main intention, due to the pawn on h6. So for the time being Black restricts this plan from White. }
11. Bxf6 { Anyway we go for it as we can follow up our g5 plan by h4. } 11...
Bxf6
{ Obviously Black takes with the Bishop to keep pressure on the d4 Knight.  11...Nxf6  is bad and gives free hand for White after  12.h4  . }
12. h4 { Renewing the threat of g5. } 12... Nb6
{ The new trend after Anish Giri's Najdorf course.   In his own words:   'This is the first real surprise. There was a point in time when Black tried making 12...Qb6 work here, but all in vain. It turns out that Black is perfectly in time to focus on the development of the queenside, something that the modern neural network engines point out instantly. This move has never been played on the high level and at the moment of me writing these words the only high-level game here was played by myself on my YouTube stream against a talented Turkish GM Vahap Sanal. I wasn't sure if I should still keep it a secret, but I couldn't resist. And yes I won my game - I never took a casual online game this seriously!' }
13. g5
{ The obvious reaction, otherwise no point in giving the Bishop and insert h4. }
13... Bxd4 14. Rxd4 Qc5
{ This is key and the reason why this whole line works for Black. He needs this extra tempo before White gets the time to connect his rooks with Be2 and Rhd1. }
15. Qd3
{ After digging my head for almost a week, I settled on this direction. I tried all the moves like  15.Rd2  ,  15.Rd1  ,  15.Rd3  ,  15.Qd1  etc. But it was in vain to find a good practical try for White. On top of that Anish has killed every line. This is one move which he didn't focus in greater depth, so I had my doubts whether this could be the best practical move in this position and here we go... }
15... hxg5 16. b4
{ Anish gives  16.fxg5  Rxh4  17.Rxh4  Qxg5+  for Black but here comes the intermezzo with  16.b4!  deflecting the Queen from this tactical resource and then we take on g5. }
16... Qc7 17. fxg5 { And now the d6 pawn is vulnerable. } 17... Ke7
{ Black supports the d6 pawn but now his King is exposed. } 18. h5
{ Marching ahead. } 18... Bd7

22... Rf8 { 22...Nxc3  23.Rc4  is the point and Black is suffering. } 23. Qg5+
{ And it goes on... We've gone too deep already and Black has not equalised completely. One sample line is  23...Rf6  24.Nxa4  Bxa4  25.Rc4  and game on. :@@EndBracket@@ }

{ The Najdorf!! The opening is named after the Polish-Argentine grandmaster, Miguel Najdorf, although he was not the first strong player to play the variation. Many players have lived by the Najdorf notably Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov and recently Mr. Anish Giri :@@EndBracket@@ has been a successful ambassador of this opening.   He not only made an impressive course but also lived through this opening for so many years. And one more @@StartBracket@@ actually three more :@@EndBracket@@@@EndBracket@@ name comes to my mind: Maxim Vachier Lagrave @@StartBracket@@MVL@@EndBracket@@, one person but three names, lol, who made an immense contribution to this opening by playing it consistently over the years. }
6. Bg5
{ I was struggling with my choice against the Najdorf and it took the most of my time to come up with a direction. I was mainly hesitating between 6. Be3 the English attack and 6. Bg5 and finally decided to dive deep into the ocean of crazy razor sharped positions. Yes, we enter into the world of topsy-turvy battles. The most principled mainline, which always has a dangerous reputation and indeed it still holds to the test of being deadly as you can witness the recent duel between Caruana-Vachier in Candidates 2020-2021 where it proved its worth.   I have seen many Najdorf players being afraid to face this move but the only point is that it involves a lot of theory and long lines. But at some point, if you want to be a good chess player, you have to employ principled main lines and of course, when you play principled lines it is bound to happen that you have to enter long lines. The point of the move is obviously to keep pressure on the f6 Knight and follow it with f4-Qf3 and long castle. }
6... e6
{ Looks logical as now  6...e5  doesn't make sense. Everywhere else Black has both these options of 6...e6 and 6...e5 but only here it narrows down to one that is 6...e6 as with the Bishop on g5 already, it would look dubious to weaken the d5 square since the f6 Knight is already pinned. }
7. f4 { The immediate threat is e5 to trap the Knight on f6 which is pinned. }
7... Be7 { It looks logical to unpin the Knight on f6. } 8. Qf3
{ The Queen is more active here on f3 where it can go to g3 at some instances and also mainly prevents Black's regrouping of pieces by b5-Bb7 due to the blow with e5. Moreover, after long castling which is coming next, the d-file is left free for the Rook to operate.   Having said that, here if  8.Qe2  like in the line of 7...Nbd7, it fails to  8...h6  9.Bh4  Nxe4  10.Bxe7  Nxc3  (That's the problem when the Black Bishop is on e7. So beware!! Don't fall into this cunning trap.) }
8... Qc7
{ Keeping control over the e5 square.  8...Nbd7  9.O-O-O  Qc7  leads to the same story. }
9. O-O-O Nbd7
{ Next, Black will follow it with ...b5-Bb7. This is an ideal Black setup. The only question is whether he is in time before White starts the attack. }
10. g4
{ And here Anish has recommended two directions in his course. One is  10...h6  and the other one is  10...b5  . }
10... b5
{ So if Black achieves his ideal setup: that is Bishop on b7 then ...b4 is a strong threat. White should already act quickly here not to lose the momentum for the attack. }
11. Bxf6 { And yes, giving the Bishop to roll the g-pawn. } 11... Nxf6 12. g5
{ The main point behind capturing on f6 is to advance our pawns as further as possible focusing towards the Black king and which also makes short castling quite dangerous. }
12... Nd7 13. f5 { Seizing the initiative. } 13... O-O
{ The Modern line developed in the late 2000s. At first, though it looks very dangerous for Black to castle with our pawn already advanced much further, with computer-like defense Black can parry the attack. This was one of the main recommendations of the Twitter King, Anish Giri in his Chessable course. }
14. Rg1
{ Simple chess, holding the g5 pawn threatening f6 next. The Rook belongs on the g-file.  14.Qh5  b4  15.Rd3  is crazy leading to concrete forced stuff but Black is holding there with computer-like defense. So we are not heading there which is already well analysed and explored and concluded to be draw, in fact. }
14... b4
{ Disturbing the Knight on c3 before playing e5 as without White will get the square d5 for his c3 Knight. }
15. Nce2 e5
{ Pushing both the Knights back which were creating a ruckus in Black's camp. }
16. f6 { Time to strike. No more of this going back business. } 16... exd4
{ The only move, otherwise, the d4 Knight will head to f5. } 17. fxe7 Re8 18.
e5
{ One more intersting try from the White side and Black has to play really precisely in order to contain the attack. }
18... Ra7
{ The only move to keep the position balanced, but the drama continues... } 19.
e6 fxe6 20. g6 { Sacrificing two pawns to weaken the position of the King. }
20... hxg6 21. Nf4 Ne5 22. Qg3
{ 22.Qh3  Rxe7  23.Nxg6  Nxg6  24.Rxg6  e5  25.Qh5  Bb7  and Black survives the attack. }
22... Qxe7 { There are a lot of 'only moves' for Black. And it's not over. }
23. Nxg6 Qf6 24. Rxd4
{ Here, the problem with  24.Nxe5  dxe5  25.Rd2  is obviously e4 as the Rook is on a7 and not b8 and Black is taking over. }
24... Qxg6 25. Qxg6 Nxg6 26. Rxg6
{ And this endgame is even according to the computers and the correspondence games, but it is too far and practically still playable. }

The idea of the move  8.a3  is very subtle: to meet  8...b5  with  9.dxc5  and after massive exchanges on c5 White will sabotage Black's Queenside totally by playing b4.

{ In fact, I've faced this position two times against Grandmasters Danielian and Akobian. In the first game, I mixed up the move orders and lost very badly but in the second game, I won a beautiful game against Akobian in a classy manner, one of my best games. :@@EndBracket@@ and you can as well see that game in detail in the model games chapter.

If  11.O-O-O  then Black has this option of  11...Bxd4  12.Bxd4  b5  followed by ...Rb8 with decent counterplay. So we get more or less similar positions in the 11. h4 line too but there our pawn will already be on h5 which is definitely a better version. :@@EndBracket@@ }

12. Bxd4 b5 13. O-O-O Rb8

14. Bxc5 Nxc5 15. b4
{ 15.Qd4  was my choice in my game against Akobian which was also equally good, but our standard plan with 15. b4 is even more simple. For more details about the plans and typical ideas, you can always hop on to the annotated games section where I present a beautiful win against Grandmaster Akobian. }

But not all Black players would like to force matters which involve mesmerizing memory and great skill to maintain nerves in dangerous positions, as the resulting positions are extremely sharp and one wrong move for Black would end the game immediately.Coming to the point of the move 8...Qb6, of course, the b2 pawn is attacked and Black is planning to put pressure on the d4 Knight with ...Bc5. }
9. Qd2

9... Qxb2 { 9...Bc5  is just stupid here due to  10.Na4  . } 10. Rb1 Qa3 11.
Bb5
{ The key move pinning both the Knights. If  11.Bd3  then Black has a6 stopping all potential invasions on b5. }
11... Bb4 { Counterpinning the c3 Knight, but this fails. } 12. Rb3

13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Nxc6 { Now we'll get a few forcing moves. } 14... Bxc3 15.
Nxa5 Bxd2+ 16. Kxd2 O-O
{ And we reach an endgame where Black simply lacks coordination and proper squares to develop his pieces to. White is simply dominating on the open b-file. }
17. Rhb1
{ All pieces are brought into the action.  17.Nc6  is an equally powerful move, not allowing Black to consolidate his position. Play might continue with  17...Nb6  19.Bxb6  axb6  and now we can grab the pawn on b6 by  20.Rxb6  and if  20...Rxa2  21.Ne7+  followed by Rb8 wins the piece.   So after  20.Rxb6  Bd7  21.Nb4  we just defend the extra pawn and we are much better. }
17... Nb6
{ Black plans to slowly develop his pieces. Next the c8 Bishop will come to d7. }
18. Rc3
{ Though Black gets to develop his Bishop to  d7  he is still doomed to passivity. For instance  18...Bd7  19.Bd4  Rfc8  20.Rxc8  Black can't take back with the rook as after  20...Rxc8  21.Bxb6  Rb8  White has this nice move with  22.c4  Rxb6   22...axb6  23.c5  wins on the spot for White  23.Rb3  and this endgame is extremely dangerous for Black. Before, it was not possible for us to take on b6 when Black's Rook was on a8 as it will open the a-file for the Rook attacking our Knight on a5. }

1. e4 e6
{ FRENCH!! The idea behind the French Defense is that Black plays e6 to prepare to advance d7-d5, in order to immediately challenge White’s pawn on e4. But the biggest problem is that the c8 Bishop is blocked by the very first move of 1...e6 and often minimizes its scope. Many times the entire game will revolve around this fundamental weakness. }
2. d4
{ A logical move towards the centre. There are some funky or offbeat lines like   2.Qe2  stopping ...d5 but then Black can play  2...c5  transposing to a Sicilian where our Queen is not ideally placed on e2 but nevertheless it has been tried and tested in many top-level games as it avoids heaps of theoretical debates. But let's stick to the principled option here. :@@EndBracket@@ }
2... d5 3. Nc3
{ Placing the Knight in a more active square which supports the e4 pawn, maintaining the tension. Apart from that,   3.e5  and 3. Nd2 are the other main options.   3.Nd2  is also equally popular, advocated by Wesley So in his Opening series, but my main concern was that the Knight on d2 blocks the c1 Bishop, likewise 3. e5 clarifies tension in the centre in a quick manner. So if we look from a principled point of view brutally then 3. Nc3 is in the spirit of the position }
3... Nf6
{ This is one more major direction apart from the Winawer with   3...Bb4  With this option, Black pressurizes the e4 pawn and forces White to take some responsible action regarding the pawn on e4. }
4. e5
{ This is known as the Steinitz Variation, named after Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Champion. :@@EndBracket@@  Advancing the pawn further and kicking the Knight at the same time. Apart from this main option, White has   4.Bg5  but then Black can react with the Burn Variation, named after Amos Burn, which is the most common reply at the top level with  4...dxe4  now as he gets a better version of the Rubinstein line and White is forced to give the Bishop away in order to be ambitious and leads to unclear play after  5.Bxf6  gxf6  Hence we prefer 4. e5 which is still the principled mainline. :@@EndBracket@@ }
4... Nfd7 5. f4 { Building up the centre. } 5... c5
{ A natural move to challenge the center. If   5...a6  then  6.Nf3  and Black has to play ...c5 anyway which leads to the same story after   5...c5  6.Nf3  a6  Apart from 5...c5 plan I dont see any logical move for Black here. }
6. Nf3
{ White's setup is basically designed to hold the d4 pawn with Be3, Qd2 and long castle, then aim for a quick attack on the Kingside. And here Black has a couple of options. }
6... Nc6 7. Be3
{ Fortifying the pawn on d4. Next on the  agenda is Qd2 & O-O-O } 7... cxd4
{ Clarifying matters in the centre to bring the f8 Bishop to life. :@@EndBracket@@ }
8. Nxd4
{ And here Black has many options. Let's check them one by one. :@@EndBracket@@ }
8... Qb6
{ This move leads to long, forcing, crazy variations which have gained immense popularity in recent years. But not all Black players would like to force matters which involve mesmerizing memory and great skill to maintain nerves in dangerous positions, as the resulting positions are extremely sharp and one wrong move for Black would end the game immediately.Coming to the point of the move 8...Qb6, of course, the b2 pawn is attacked and Black is planning to put pressure on the d4 Knight with ...Bc5. }
9. Qd2
{ The mainline which more or less resembles the poisoned pawn variation in the Sicilian where White sacrifices the b2 pawn for the initiative. }
9... Qxb2 { 9...Bc5  is just stupid here due to  10.Na4  . } 10. Rb1 Qa3 11.
Bb5
{ The key move pinning both the Knights. If  11.Bd3  then Black has a6 stopping all potential invasions on b5. }
11... Nxd4
{ The main move. At least Black is getting rid of some pressure on c6 by exchanging it. }
12. Bxd4 a6
{ The Bishop on b5 is powerful and has to be taken care of immediately. } 13.
Bxd7+
{ The only way as  13.Ba4  maintaining the pin is not efficient due to a  13...Bb4  14.Rb3  Qxa4  trick. }
13... Bxd7 14. Rb3
{ A important intermezzo before taking on b7, so as to push the Queen on a3 to an inferior square. The direct  14.Rxb7  is not accurate due to  14...Bb4  followed by...Rc8. }
14... Qe7 15. Rxb7
{ And now we capture as the Queen on e7 is blocking the f8 Bishop. } 15... Rc8
{ The critical response which was first played in some correspondence games and later introduced by Mr. Biel, Morozevich against Karjakin in World Rapid 2014, years after he retired. Later Grandmaster Sutovsky played it in 2018, reviving this option once again which still stands as the main critical option. }
16. O-O Qd8
{ It looks akward to retreat the queen to its starting square, but this is the only way to free the position. Now White has numerous options. }
17. Qe3
{ Preventing ...Bc5 which is the key idea of Black to neutralize White's attack.   Apart from 17. Qe3 there is the direct  17.f5  forcing matters,   as well as  17.Rf3  as played by Grischuk against Shirov in the Isle of Man tournament, and many more options which cause problems for Black players. With the engines, it is easier to claim that it is equal but during the game, it is very difficult to deal with it as the games prove. One inaccurate move and Black is collapsing. }
17... Rc4
{ If  17...Be7  then now  18.f5  is even more powerful as  18...exf5  is met by  19.Qg3  targetting the g7 pawn and Black is unable to castle due to  19...O-O  20.e6  opening the diagonal for the Bishop on d4 and mate is threatened on g7 along with the d7 Bishop. Hence 17...Rc4 is the only move, with the idea of 18...Qc8 attacking the Rook on b7 and also aiming for a cheap trick with ...Rxd4 and Bc5 pinning the Queen. }
18. Rfb1 { Connecting the Rooks. Now  18...Qc8  fails to  19.Rb8  . } 18... Be7
{ Black is hurrying to castle and save himself from drowning. } 19. f5
{ Finally, it is high time to strike. } 19... Bg5
{ Black needs to get out his Bishop in order to castle, so as to prevent tactics with f5-f6 from White. }
20. Qd3
{ 20.Qf2  was opted for by Aronian against Vallejo Pons in Grenke 2019, but Black was totally fine after  20...exf5  21.e6  fxe6  22.Bxg7  Rg8  23.Be5  Bf6  and in fact White has to be careful here as there is no real attack. }
20... O-O
{ 20...exf5  obviously is met by  21.Nxd5  as the Queen on d3 immediately attacks the c4 Rook. }
21. Ne4 { Bringing all the pieces into the action. :@@EndBracket@@ } 21... Bc8
{ The only move as White was threatening to take on g5 and win the piece on d7. }
22. Bb6
{ This is the key position and it looks like Black is lost as  22...Qe8  ,  the only square for the Queen, is met by  23.Nxg5  Bxb7  24.fxe6  threatening Qxh7 mate and exf7. But Black has an unbelievable resource here. }
22... Be3+
{ I cannot ever imagine that this option saves Black from losing. Can you imagine memorizing everything till here and then seeing this incredible saving move? 22... Be3!! Hilarious. Lol :@@EndBracket@@ This is insane and the funny part is that it is not over and the madness continues... If I am Black, I would not prefer to play this line as I will have to make so many accurate moves assuming that I can hold the position. }
23. Qxe3 { After  23.Bxe3  there is  23...Rxe4  . } 23... Qh4
{ The whole point of the sacrifice is to vacate some space for the Queen. } 24.
Nf6+ { Bam! The madness continues. :@@EndBracket@@ } 24... gxf6 25. Rc7
{ What a messy position. Black would be literally having a heart attack to defend this position. }
25... exf5 26. Rxc4 dxc4 27. exf6
{ Finally the position has clarified. Black has good chances to make a draw but I still think Black is slightly worse due to our annoying pawn on f6. And yes, first he has to reach this position, all the way facing hurdles and adventures. At the very least this variation is a huge practical try for White. :@@EndBracket@@ }

The point of  3...Bb4  is that it pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve the central tension. White normally clarifies the central situation for the moment with  4.e5  ,  gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced. P.S Anish in his French defense course has recommended the move 3...Bb4. }
4. e5
{ There are some funkier tries for White to hold the pawn on e4 such as  4.Bd3  , aggressive ones like  4.Nge2  and quieter ones like  4.exd5  ,  but 4. e5 is the main principled line advancing further and gaining space. }
4... b6
{ This move is rarely played, but it was employed by some Grandmasters like Jusupow, Vaganian and Ponkratov. The point is to provide scope for the c8 Bishop, but unlike  4...c5  it is not challenging the centre and is too slow, allowing White to build up a strong attack. }
5. Qg4

White is clearly better here.   Apart from 5...g6 there is  5...Kf8  ,  but this obviously loses the right to castle and White can react in the same manner with the h- pawn with  6.h4  with a nice advantage.   The text move with  5...Bf8  looks to be the only move which does not create square weakness by pawn push or weakening the King position but the drawback is, of course, Black has wasted two moves with his Bishop @@StartBracket@@ Bf8- Bb4-Bf8@@EndBracket@@ just to make White advance his pawn to e5. }

8... Ne7 { The only place for the Knight. } 9. Ne2
{ This is the standard manoeuver rerouting the Knight to the kingside and it also helps White to strengthen his centre with c3. }
9... h5
{ 9...Nb4  is met by  10.Bd2  and Black cannot capture on c2 due to  10...Nxc2  11.Rac1  trapping the piece.   And  9...Nf5  will be faced by  10.Ng3  challenging the Knight which is holding Black's position. }
10. Qh3

P.S Anish in his French defense course has recommended the move 3...Bb4. }
4. e5
{ There are some funkier tries for White to hold the pawn on e4 such as  4.Bd3  , aggressive ones like  4.Nge2  and quieter ones like  4.exd5  ,  but 4. e5 is the main principled line advancing further and gaining space. }

{ The mainline - asking questions to the Bishop on b4. } 5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3
{ White has doubled pawns on the queenside, which form the basis for Black's counterplay, they can also help White since they strengthen his centre and give him a semi-open b-file. White has a spatial advantage on the kingside, where Black is even weaker than usual because he has traded off his dark-square bishop. Combined with the bishop pair, this gives White attacking chances, which he must attempt to use as the long-term features of this pawn structure favour Black. }
6... Qc7
{ Black's idea is to take on d4 next followed by the invasion of the Queen to c3. And also to meet with the standard 7.Qg4 with f5 as the Queen on c7 protects the g7 pawn. }
7. Qg4 { Anyway we go for our standard plan with the Queen sortie to g4. } 7...
f6
{ Black challenges the centre and at the same time protects the g7 pawn by renewing communications with the Queen on c7. }
8. Nf3
{ 8.Bb5+  is also interesting as Black is forced to move the King with  8...Kf8  .   8...Bd7  9.Qxe6  9.Nf3  Qa5  is one extra option Black gets and we lose the c3 pawn after  10.Rb1  a6  11.Be2  Qxc3  , but still White is clearly better after  12.Kd1  in the ensuing complications. The text move is simpler and hence I prefer to develop immediately without this intermediate check. }
8... c4
{ Black closes the position. This is very typical in the French, because White has two Bishops and Black tries to restrict them by closing the position.  On the other hand, the tension is going out from the centre, White gets a free hand on the kingside. One can see a lot of games of Grandmaster Ponkratov here.  8...cxd4  9.cxd4  Qc3  10.Kd1  Qxa1  doesn't work due to  11.Qxg7  . }
9. Be2 { Developing the pieces quickly. } 9... Nc6 10. O-O Qf7
{ Capturing the pawn on e5 with  10...fxe5  11.Nxe5  Nxe5  12.dxe5  Qxe5  will only open up the diagonals for the Bishops after  13.Bf4  Qf6  14.Qg3  followed by Be5. }
11. a4 { And the c1 Bishop is heading to a3. } 11... Nge7
{ 11...Qg6  is met with  12.Qh3  Qxc2  13.Re1  and White is planning to take on f6 followed by Ne5 opening up the position. If Black is even more greedy and takes the pawn on c3 with  13...Qxc3  then  14.Bd2  brings White a great deal of advantage, as Black is still way behind in development and the position is soon going to get opened up. Black will unable to cope up with Whites's tremendous attack. }
12. exf6 gxf6 13. Nh4 { Paving way for the f2 pawn to come to f4. } 13... Bd7
14. Qh5 { The Queen exchange would only help White as he has two Bishops. }
14... Ng6 15. f4 { Followed by f5 and Black is suffering. } *

Combined with the bishop pair, this gives White attacking chances, which he must attempt to use as the long-term features of this pawn structure favour Black. }
6... Qa5

Apart from 14.dxc5 there are numerous interesting options for White like  14.Bd3  c4  15.Be2   and if  14...Ba6  then  15.dxc5  Qxf4  16.Rxf4  Bxd3  17.cxd3  bxc5  18.Nf3  followed by the Rook shift to a4 and the pressure is on.   There are other options like  14.c4  which also bring White some advantage. }

15. Bxf4 bxc5 16. Be3 { The c5 pawn is the target. } 16... Ndc6
{ If  16...c4  then White can play  17.Rh3  with the point to strengthen the key central pawn with f4 next and the double Bishops provides White a slightly better position. }
17. Bxc5 Nxe5
{ Black has grabbed our central pawn in return, but the two Bishops as always create some annoying problems for Black. }
18. Re3 Nd7 19. Bd6 Ke8 { Moving away from the annoying pin. } 20. Bd3
{ Preventing... Nf5. } 20... Nb6 21. Rg3
{ And after  21...Rg8  White can develop his last piece with  22.Nf3  with a slightly better endgame as Black's pieces are still not properly coordinated. }

11. Ra2

2. d4

3... Bb4
{ This is called the Winawer Variation, named after Szymon Winawer and pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik, is one of the main systems in the French apart from 3...Nf6.   The point of  3...Bb4  is that it pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve the central tension. White normally clarifies the central situation for the moment with  4.e5  ,  gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced. P.S Anish in his French defense course has recommended the move 3...Bb4. }
4. e5
{ There are some funkier tries for White to hold the pawn on e4 by  4.Bd3  ,   aggressive ones like  4.Nge2   and quieter ones like  4.exd5  but 4. e5 is the main principled line advancing further and gaining space. }
4... c5 { Challenging the centre immediately without any delay. } 5. a3
{ The mainline - asking questions to the Bishop on b4. } 5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3
{ White has doubled pawns on the queenside, which form the basis for Black's counterplay, they can also help White since they strengthen his centre and give him a semi-open b-file. White has a spatial advantage on the kingside, where Black is even weaker than usual because he has traded off his dark-square bishop. Combined with the bishop pair, this gives White attacking chances, which he must attempt to use as the long-term features of this pawn structure favour Black. }
6... Ne7 7. Qg4 O-O { This is one of the main options for Black. } 8. Bd3
{ Focusing on the kingside. } 8... Nbc6
{ Developing the Knight to put pressure on the d4 pawn. } 9. Bg5
{ Before, White players usually opted for  9.Qh5  which leads to complex variations.  9...Ng6  is the only sensible reply, as other means to protect the h7 pawn will fail miserably.   For instance,  9...g6  weakens the dark squares.   And after  9...h6  there is the  10.Bxh6  blow which kills Black.   Finally, if  9...Nf5  then we have  10.Nf3  - it's important to prevent ...Qh4 from Black and next 11. g4 is coming.  10.Nf3  Qc7  11.Be3  c4  12.Bxg6  fxg6  13.Qg4  Qf7  This position is discussed heavily in the opening book of Parimarjan Negi, Grandmaster Repertoire. There are so many options there leading to different kinds of complex positions. Hence I prefer 9. Bg5 which is more direct and cuts down a lot on Black's options. }
9... Qa5 10. Ne2 { Supporting the c3 pawn. } 10... Ng6
{ Blocking the d3 Bishop, as the immediate  10...c4  is met with  11.Bxh7  Kxh7  12.Bxe7  followed by Qh4+. }
11. O-O c4
{ Al least now Black eliminates the Bishop pair, but the problem of him being strategically worse is not solved yet. Moreover the pawn chain of c3,d4,e5 is unrivaled.   11....Qa4  12.f4  is the point and if now  12...c4  White has  13.Bxg6  fxg6  and here comes a swashbuckling break after  14.f5  cruising through Blacks camp  14...Rxf5   14...exf5  will weaken the  d5  pawn and White can exploit by  15.Qg3  followed by  Nf4  and if  14...gxf5  White has  15.Qg3  followed by  Nf4  and  Nh5  and the g-file is under fire with threats around the Blacks King  15.Ng3  and Black has to give up the exchange in order to keep the f-file intact }
12. Bxg6 fxg6
{ 12...hxg6  would be a blunder as then  13.Qh4  followed by f4, Rf3 and Rh3 is devastating for Black. }
13. a4
{ Expanding on the queenside too and not allowing even an inch of counterplay after ...Qa4. }
13... Qc7
{ This was preferred by Classic grandmasters like Bareev and Jusupow. The point is to bring the Queen to f7 to defend the Kingside and then develop the c8 Bishop to d7. It makes a lot of sense. }
14. h4 { Following the plan of breaking with h5 next. } 14... Qf7
{ Stopping h5. } 15. Bc1
{ If White is too skeptical about going into an endgame, then he can instead opt for  15.Ng3  Preventing Black from exchanging the Queen with ...Qf5.  15...Bd7  16.Bc1  A subtle positional idea, rerouting the Bishop to a3 to attack the f8 Rook. Play might continue with  16...Ne7  and perhaps Black is not much worse. Hence I prefer the direct 15. Bc1, not being concerned about the Queen exchange after ...Qf5 as White has more space and more scope to create entry points. }
15... Qf5
{ 15...Bd7  16.Ba3  Ne7  17.a5  is a nice expansion, followed by Rfb1 and Black is worse on both the Kingside and Queenside. }
16. Qxf5 Rxf5 17. h5
{ A cool tactical idea with the point that  17...Rxh5  fails to  18.Ng3  trapping the Rook. }
17... gxh5 18. Ng3 Rf7 19. Nxh5
{ And White can expand with f4 and g4. White is dominating the endgame. } *

15. Rhf1
{ Moving the Rook away from the c6-h1 diagonal in order to roll with g4. Next g4 is coming with a powerful attack and of course White should not exchange his e5 Knight for the c6 bishop as the e5 Knight creates a stir in Black's camp. Only when we are winning material or winning something concretely is it advisable to exchange the e5 Knight. Otherwise, why disturb the promising star player in the position? }

{ Black plans to exchange the dark-squared Bishop and free her position. The e7 Bishop is clearly a bad Bishop compared to the c1 White Bishop due to the fact that it is restricted by the d6 pawn. So in turn, Black loses some support of her d6 pawn. }

[Result "*"]

{ The battle of the two best specialists of the Sveshnikov Variation at that time was of great interest, and even today it is. :@@EndBracket@@ So let's check their game which corresponds with our opening suggestion. }
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5
{ At that time, this direction was not that famous. People religiously used to play the mainline with   7.Bg5  a6  8.Na3  b5  and all those forcing lines. As the theory exploded, White had to come back and seek a new direction and that's how the new trend of 7. Nd5 was revived once again. So in this old game, this was relatively new. }
7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8
{ This retreat is the main move here. The knight comes to d7, where he can choose later which direction to go: c5, e5, or f6.   Apart from 8...Nb8 there is also  8...Ne7  which is dealt with extensively in the opening section. This whole tabiya became extremely popular after the World Championship match between Carlsen and Caruana. }
9. c4 { Buidling up a formidable centre. } 9... Be7 10. Bd3 a6 11. Nc3 O-O 12.
O-O f5
{ Logical moves from both sides. For deviations and other Black options, you can always head to the opening section. Our main criteria is to learn the typical ideas and plans from the game, so let's quickly hop to the critical juncture where the opening sort of ends. }
13. f3 Bg5 14. Kh1
{ 14.Qc2  is the critical move suggested by me in the opening section creating pressure along the c2-h7 diagonal. It is more effective but the move played in the game is also natural. }
14... Nd7 15. b4
{ Both sides make 'their' moves. White traditionally seizes space on the Queenside, while Black is trying to create something in center and on the Kingside. But one point to add is that 15. b4 is imprecise here and 15. a3 has to be played, preparing the b4 push with the same notion.   So why 15.  a3  and not  15.b4?  The simple point is that Black now gets to break with  15...a5  .   After  15.a3  he has to wait for one more move as  15...a5  without us playing b4 weakens the b5 square, without any counterplay in return. So after 15. a3 we get formidable support for our b4 pawn when we push it on the next move. }
15... a5 16. a3 axb4
{ 16...e4  here is a brilliant resource and typical pawn sacrifice for Black which we have to be aware of always as after  17.fxe4  Black has a strong maneuver with  17...Bf6  18.Bd2  Be5  and the Queen is arriving to h4 with great counterplay. }
17. Bxg5 Qxg5 18. axb4 Rxa1 19. Qxa1
{ Now the position has fizzled out. That's is also one of the reasons why we should play 16. a3 and then b4, maintaining the flexibility. }
19... Qe3 20. Be2
{ Prepares 21. Qc1 next, using the fact that endgame favours White and as well the Queen is quite annoying on e3. }
20... e4
{ Krasenkow is not willing to play a passive position and is looking for immediate activity and his move 20...e4 showcases it. One of Black's typical breaks but only in this position it is not that effective as White gets Qc1 in time and Black will have to either exchange it which loses all his ambition or retract back which will slow his activity.   Instead  20...Nf6  was required:  21.Qc1  Qb6  22.Nb5  Bd7  23.c5  Qa6  and apparently Black is holding this complex game. }
21. Qc1 Qb6
{ Exchanging the Queens will only help White to a greater extent:  21...Qxc1  22.Rxc1  exf3  23.gxf3!  quite important and next White is pouncing with Nb5 and c5. }
22. fxe4
{ 23.Nb5  was necessary as the b4 pawn was hanging and White is the boss there. }
22... fxe4
{ 22...Qxb4  would have equalised easily:  23.exf5  Ne5  and Black is back in the game. }
23. Rxf8+ Nxf8 24. Nb5
{ Now Black is again in a doomed situation as his e4 pawn stands lonely. Also, c5 is a dangerous threat now. }
24... Ng6 { 24...Qf2  is faced by  25.Qf1  . } 25. c5 dxc5 26. bxc5
{ Extremely natural, but the computers don't agree. They prefer 26. Qxc5 with a huge advantage whereas 26. bxc5 simply loses all our advantage. This is such a drastic difference, but I can understand now why is that as 26. Qxc5 simply kills the active piece of Black whereas in the other case it does not.   So  26.Qxc5  Qd8  27.d6  is winning for White. }
26... Qf6
{ And once again Black is back in the game with the Knight heading to f4. } 27.
Nd6 Nf4 { Finally, Black has some activity. } 28. Nxe4
{ 28.Bc4  might be more challenging but after the only brilliant move  28...Nd3  which is tough to spot, Black is fine in the ensuing complications.  29.Bxd3  exd3  30.Nxc8  is a blunder and would allow d2 and Qf2 and Black is winning.   So after  28...Nd3  White has to play  29.Qb1  with a complex game. }
28... Qe5 29. Bf3 Nxd5
{ Black has equalised completely but he still has some things to solve before shaking hands. }
30. Nd6 Be6 31. Nxb7 Nf4 32. c6
{ The position is heating up and Black has to find only concrete moves to save the position from drowning. }
32... Nd3 33. Qf1 Ne1 { Sealing White's pieces. } 34. Be2 Nc2
{ Missing the chance to force matters:  34...Nxg2!!  would most likely have given him a draw. But it's not an easy move to spot. The line continues with  35.Kxg2  Bd5+  36  Bf3  Qg5  37.Kf2  Bxf3  38.Kxf3  Qf5+  39.Ke2  Qe5  40.Kd2  Qb2  and Black achieves a perpetual. But the text move is possible and Black is still not losing. }
35. Bc4 Ne3
{ Now comes the big blunder.  35...Bxc4  would have kept drawing chances alive after  36.Qxc4  Kh8  37.Qc5  Qa1+  38.Qg1  Qe5  and it not easy for White to advance his c pawn. }
36. Bxe6+ Qxe6 37. Qf4
{ The only winning move, with the point that  37...Qxc6  38.Qb8  Kf7  39.Nd8  is game over. }
37... h6 38. Nc5 Qe8 39. Nd3
{ Covering the e1 square as the last trap was  39.c7  Nd5  and 40... Nxc7. }

Nb3 is more accurate. }

20. Qxb6 axb6 21. Be2
{ We have only slightly better pieces as Black is in time to get his ...d6 break. Nevertheless, it is easier and more pleasant to play White in this endgame. }
21... d5

{ Welcome to the game of Anish Giri vs Nepomniachtchi 2021 Carlsen Invitational Online Rapid. Anish is always a trend maker when it comes to his opening ideas and his tweets. :@@EndBracket@@ So it always a treat to check his games @@StartBracket@@and his twitter@@EndBracket@@. :@@EndBracket@@ Let's go... }
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be3 a6 7. g4
{ So we have come to a critical juncture. 7. g4 is a new trend that is now seen in many top-level games. This tabiya was brought back into fashion by Grandmaster Nils Grandelius who used it in many of his games. He is the main pioneer of this tabiya. Magnus also has initiated this idea from different move orders after @@StartFEN@@r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6@@EndFEN@@  6.g4  a6  and then  7.Be3  back in 2017.   Instead of  7.g4  ,  7.Qd2  and  7.Qf3  have been the two main directions and in fact, I covered the latter option in my book, 'Beating the Najdorf and the Taimanov' for Thinker's Publishing Chess House. In this course 7.g4 has been the main suggestion. }
7... h6
{ It is quite evident that if Black develops his Knight to f6 then g5 is crushing, hence Black plays ...h6 in order to stop the g5 thrust. He is now planning to bring his Knight to f6 peacefully. }
8. h4 { Fighting for the g5 push which is the key target in this position. }
8... Nf6
{ Apart from 8... Nf6, there is this option  8...b5  which is dealt with extensively in the opening section. }
9. Nxc6
{ This is the standard plan which you guys will see quite often in the opening section. The point here is that White's ideal square for the Queen is f3 to castle long as it keeps a hold on the g4 square and it also prepares the g5 thrust by supporting the Rook on h1, so for that, he needs to take on c6 first, otherwise ...Ne5 will be a problem when White places the Queen on f3. }
9... bxc6
{ 9...Qxc6  10.Bg2  Ba3  11.Bc1  was one super cool variation analysed in the opening section. }
10. Qf3
{ The Queen is ideally placed here, not making long castling possible, but also supporting the Rook on h1 for g5 breaks. It is a multi-purpose move and Black is already in trouble as the g pawn is marching ahead. }
10... d5
{ Black creates counterplay in the centre but that does not help after } 11. g5
{ And White has the desired breakthrough. } 11... hxg5 12. hxg5 Rxh1 13. Qxh1
Ng4
{ 13...Nd7  is met by stunning  14.g6  damaging Black's pawn structure and exposing Black's King.  14...fxg6  15.Qg2  attacking the g6 pawn  15...Kf7  16.O-O-O  followed by Bd3 and Black is cornered. }
14. Bd2
{ Preserving the Bishop, of course, and now the Knight on g4 will be kicked. }
14... Bb7
{ 14...d4  will be met by either  15.Nd1  and then to b3-Nb2,   or  15.Na4  with the same plan.  After rerouting his Knight to b2, White will kick the g4 Knight and castle long. And as well the Knight on b2 secures a nice spot on c4. }
15. Qh3 { Go back! } 15... Ne5 16. O-O-O
{ White has completed his development and he has a promising position as the pawns are going to roll over Black's pieces next. For instance, f4 is a strong threat. }
16... d4
{ 16...O-O-O  is met by  17.f4  Ng6  18.f5  and Black is getting crushed.   Perhaps  16...Ng6  was necessary to stop White from pushing f4. Play might continue with  17.Be3  activating our Bishop with the plan to face  17...O-O-O  with  18.Na4  c5  19.exd5  and thanks to pin along the h3-c8 diagonal, Black cannot take the d5 pawn back with his e6 pawn. }
17. Nb1
{ 17.Na4  was clearly more powerful as the Knight is active on a4 and creates a huge ruckus in Black's camp.  17...Ng6   17...c5  is met by  18.f4  and Black is having troubles with his Knight  18.Bc4  Bd6  and here comes a mind-blowing shot with  19.Bxe6  fxe6   19...Nf4  20.Bxf4  Bxf4  21.Kb1  fxe6  and here comes the cold-blooded  22.Nc5  which is a killer as now  22...O-O-O  comes under  23.Nxe6  and now you can see why the Knight is useful on a4.  20.Qxe6  Ne7  21.Rh1  and Black is losing. }
17... c5
{ Giving back the momentum to White.  17...Ng6  would have kept the balance as White is not able to push his desired f4.   And here if  18.Bc4  Bd6  there is a whole difference compared to the same line which we witnessed with our Knight on a4 as now  19.Bxe6  fails to  19...Nf4  . }
18. f4 { Back in action. :@@EndBracket@@ } 18... Nc6
{ 18...Ng6  was a better retreat. Play will continue with  19.f5  with a better position for White, but the move played in the game is just losing as White gets to cash in with }
19. g6 { And Black's pawn structure is destroyed. } 19... O-O-O 20. gxf7 Qxf7
21. Bc4 Kb8 { 21...Re8  22.f5  is also over. } 22. Bxe6 Qc7 23. Bc4

{ 14.h4  was my main suggestion in the opening course but the move played in the game also looks interesting. So let's go ahead. }
14... Rc8
{ Black is trying to create some play on the Queenside before Whites storms with the pawns on the King's flank. }
15. Kb1 { Always a useful move to include so as to secure the King. } 15... g5
{ Black is fighting for the dark squares on the Kingside, but this was not the best here and he had to play  15...d5  16.e5  Ne4  with a complex game. I would still prefer White as our King is much safer than Black's King. }
16. Qh3 { A standard pin and now Black is in deep trouble. } 16... Nc5
{ This is a big mistake.  16...Nh7  has to be played, which happened in a lot of correspondence games, but of course during a game, if you are not well prepared, you don't go back with the Knight like that. It does not come to your mind as it's not at all natural. Play might continue with  17.e5  Bxg2  18.Qxg2  gxf4  19.exd6  Bxd6  20.Rhe1  and Black's position is highly dangerous. Perhaps 15...g5 is already a big opening mistake. }
17. Rhe1 { All troops in the action. } 17... h5
{ 17...gxf4  leads to forced sequence after  18.g5  Nfd7  19.g6  damaging Black's pawn structure  19...fxg6  20.Nxe6  Nxe6  21.Qxe6  Ne5  renewing communications but doesn't solve his problems after  22.Bd4  Qc4  23.Nd5  Bxd5  24.exd5  and White is dominating. }
18. Nf5
{ And that's how you do it in the Najdorf! After this killer invasion Black is busted. }
18... Ncxe4
{ Keeping control requires precision from White, but his superior coordination should inspire full confidence that there is always going to be a solution.  18...exf5  grabbing the piece leads to a highly volatile position after  19.exf5  Bxg2  20.Qxg2  and the e-line is under fire and if  20...Rg8  holding the g5 pawn, we have a calm  21.fxg5  Rxg5  22.h3  followed by Bh4 and White penetrates into Black's camp. }
19. Bxe4 Nxe4 20. Bd4 { Extremely accurate, not exposing c2. } 20... Rg8 21.
Nxe7 Kxe7 22. gxh5
{ White has transformed his initiative into one major asset: the h-pawn supported by queen and bishop. Of course, the Black King's location in the centre makes it impossible to put together a successful defence against its advance. }
22... gxf4 23. Qh4+ Kf8 24. Ka1
{ An elegant positional move. White is now challenging the Knight on e4 and is not concerned about Qxc2+ as now the King has drifted away from b1 to a1.   24.h6  is also winning, but after  24...e5  25.h7  Rh8  White had to play the brilliant  26.Ka1  .   26.Nxe4  is a blunder due to  26...Bxe4  when ...Qxc2+ is a big problem. }
24... b4 { Desperation obviously. } 25. Nxe4 Bxe4 26. Rxe4 Qxc2 27. Ree1 bxa3
28. Qxf4 { And the dust has settled with White snatching the victory soon! }
28... axb2+ 29. Bxb2 Rg5
{ For the first time all the Black pieces seem to be working together; he is aiming for an irritating rook swing, but Hikaru has it all under control. }
30. Qxd6+ Kg8 31. Rg1
{ The last precise move exchanging the key piece and Black is about to get mated. }
31... Qa4+ 32. Ba3 Rxg1 33. Rxg1+ Kh7 34. Qd3+ Kh6 35. Rg6+ Kxh5 36. Rg1 f5 37.
Qf3+

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Nb3
{ 8.Qd2  Qxb2  9.Rb1  Qa3  leads to crazy stuff which is clearly the mainline and as it is heavily explored, I wanted to probe into a new direction with 8. Nb3 and more importantly I didn't want to give away a pawn. }
8... Be7 9. Qd2
{ With the idea of long castling, in the lines of our opening section. } 9...
Qc7
{ As the Knight on b3 blocks the Queen on b6, it has no job there, so it goes back in order to induce ...b5 and ...Bb7 after ...Nbd7. }
10. O-O-O Nbd7 11. a3
{ Anticipating ...b5-b4, White sets up some prohylaxsis. } 11... b5 12. Rg1
{ The Rook on g1 is useful in the preparation of the g4 advance. } 12... Bb7
13. Bd3 { Beefing up the central pawn on e4. } 13... O-O 14. g4
{ And here I ended with the conclusion that it's full of fight, in the openings section. This game showcases how dangerous Black's position can be. }
14... h6 { Already a huge mistake. Black had to play  14...Rfc8  . } 15. Bxh6

17. Qe2
{ White has so many winning options, but this looks to be the cleanest as the White Queen is arriving on h5 to speed up the attack. }
17... hxg5 18. h4
{ The only precise move as now  18.Qh5  is met by  18...Ng7  .  White prefers to capture the g5 pawn with the h pawn and open the h-file for entry to checkmate the King. }
18... Bf6 19. Kb1
{ Just Wow, the whole board is burning, and White plays a useful waiting move, securing his King. The point is that if  19.hxg5  Bxc3  gives counter-chances. }
19... Bg7
{ 19...Bxc3  now is met by  20.bxc3  and White always has this option of Rxg5 next, operating on the g-file. }
20. hxg5 { And now White takes the pawn. } 20... Bxc3 21. Qh2
{ This is a brilliant attacking game, Simply mind blowing. White sacrifices a second piece. All that he cares about is how to give checkmate to the King. Rh1 and Qh7 mate is on the cards. }
21... Bg7 22. Nd4
{ Hahah, White is activating the Knight and in turn giving up the third piece, but taking the third piece would lose the game on the spot as  22...Bxd4  23.Rh1  is mate.   The immediate  22.Rh1  is met by  22...f5  and Black secures room for his King thanks to the g7 Bishop covering it. }
22... Nc5 23. f5
{ And now the pawns storm forward with all sorts of threats like f6 & g6. }
23... d5 24. Qh3 f6 25. g6 Bh6 26. fxe6
{ Taking the piece would also be winning, but White enjoys his position and indicates that this attack is much stronger. At any moment can he take the piece on h6. }
26... f5 27. e5
{ 27.exf5  is also winning but White paves way for the d3 Bishop. } 27... Qxe5

7. Nd2 e6

8. Nf3 Nh6 9. O-O Nf5 10. c4
{ 10.Nb3  Qb5  11.Qd1  was my main recommendation in the opening section which also happened in the game of Dominguez-Caruana. But 10. c4 is one more decent option for White here. }
10... Be7 { A logical move, targeting the h4 pawn. } 11. a4
{ A very interesting pawn sacrifice by White. His main goal is to expand on the Queenside with b4 next if Black grabs the pawn on h4. }

12. c5 { Blocking Black's pieces. } 12... Bxh4
{ Once again, a better recapture as  12...Nxh4  is met by  13.Nxh4  Bxh4  14.Nf3  followed by Bd2 and White has more than enough compensation. White also has this stunning idea with  14.b4!!  Qxb4   14...Nxb4  15.Qc3  traps the Knight.  15.Nf3  and now the Queen is cornered on b4.  15...Be7  16.Bg5  and White is unleashing a powerful attack thanks to the Black Queen placed on b4 which is far away. }
13. Nxh4 Nxh4 14. Ra3
{ Creative play by White so far. He has sacrificed a pawn for some long-term compensation and now he is bringing his Rook into the action. }
14... Qd8
{ 14...Nf5  would be a mistake here as it frees White's development by allowing  15.Nf3  and White will follow it with Bd2-b4. The text move looks logical to reroute the Queen to a safer place. }
15. Qh3 { So next White is planning to insert Nf3 to free his pieces. } 15...
Kd7
{ 15...Nf5  16.Nf3  followed by Bg5 is double-edged. The only problem in Black's position is his King, so he is rerouting it with ...Kd7. }
16. Nf3 Nf5
{ 16...Nxf3  17.Rxf3  would activate the Rook. Now you can see the subtle plan behind putting the Rook on a3. }
17. Bg5 Qb8
{ 17...Qf8  is also possible, but then White has this option of  18.b4  Nxb4  19.Rb1  a5  20.Bd2  opening up the files, not allowing Black to secure his King. }
18. Rb3
{ But now Black has a different problem as the b-file is under tremendous pressure with his queen stuck on b8. }

20... h3
{ As White was now planning to take on h4, Black tries to give it in a better way, at least trying to damage our pawn structure. }
21. g3 { Of course not  21.gxh3  as it would damage our pawn structure. } 21...

24. Kh1 Kc8
{ 24...f6  now is a mistake as  25.exf6  gxf6  26.Re1  attacks the e6 pawn. With our King safe on h1 Black cannot do anything to create chaos. }
25. Rf3 Nb4 26. Qf4 Rf8 27. Kxh2

[Result "*"]

{ Now we will see one of my own games from the French 3. Nc3 Nf6 lines. My win against Grandmaster Akobian was so special for me that I can easily regard it as one of my best games in terms of quality. And as well considering the tournament situation it was such a relief to continue the winning streak from a 0/3 horrible start in the Saint Louis Closed Event. Later I went on to win four games in a row and this win came in mid-way. So I was extremely glad not only to win this game, but also to play a positional masterpiece in the French. I have showcased this game in various chess lectures and thought it would be a nice addition here as well. So let's proceed. }
1. e4 e6
{ Akobian is an ardent French player, but in the previous event of the Fall Chess Classic in Saint Louis, he opted for the Scandinavian which is in fact analysed in my Part 1 of my 1. e4 series. :@@EndBracket@@ but after getting crushed in the previous tournament game, I can understand that this time Akobian wanted to stick to his main arsenal. }
2. d4 d5 3. Nc3
{ Lately, I have always responded with 3. Nc3 against the French and it has been my main weapon because I believe it to be the one direction that poses problems for Black theoretically. }
3... Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 { White builds up ample space. } 6... Nc6
7. Be3 a6
{ This is one of the lines apart from  7...Be7  and  7...b6  and so many others which we have dealt with in the openings section. This includes chapters 17-19 of the course. The point of 7...a6 is of course to induce ...b5. }
8. a3
{ 8.Qd2  b5  is regarded as the old mainline.   The text move with  8.a3  is the new trend and contains many interesting ideas. The point of this move  8.a3  is very subtle, namely to meet  8...b5  with  9.dxc5  and after massive exchanges on c5 White will sabotage Black's Queenside totally by playing b4. This is the key point behind a3 pawn push. }
8... cxd4
{ 8...b5  9.dxc5  Bxc5  10.Bxc5  Nxc5  and  11.b4  is the sneaky plan and Black's Queenside is sealed.  11...Nd7  12.Bd3  and White has a comfortable advantage. }
9. Nxd4 Bc5
{ On the previous move Black clarified matters in the centre in order to bring this f8 Bishop into the game. And now this bishop quite active on c5, putting pressure on the d4 Knight. }
10. Qd2 { Long castling is one of the ideas here. } 10... O-O
{ Actually, I had two games here in this particular position. The first one was against a strong Armenian Woman Grandmaster Danielian and the second one is the game we are looking at. Apparently my opponent had checked that game but I had an improvement up my sleeves. :@@EndBracket@@ }
11. h4
{ This is the key nuance and the correct move order.   In my first game against Danielian, I played  11.O-O-O  instantly without understanding the difference between first 11. h4 before long castling.   If  11.O-O-O  then Black has this option of  11...Bxd4  12.Bxd4  b5  followed by Rb8 with decent counterplay against White's King. We get more or less similar positions in the 11. h4 line too, but there our pawn will already be advanced to h5 which is definitely a better version for White. :@@EndBracket@@ So in a way, we are not hurrying up with long castle and improving our position with the battering h pawn. }
11... Nxd4
{ 11...Bxd4  12.Bxd4  b5  is not effective here as we have not castled long, and we simply retreat our Bishop to f2 by  13.Bf2  maintaining the Bishop pair. In fact, we can shift our plan to castling short. :@@EndBracket@@ That's is why 11. h4 is more flexible. }
12. Bxd4 b5 { Akobian has played natural moves so far. } 13. O-O-O Rb8
{ Once again, it looks logical to prepare ...b4 as the direct  13...b4  fails to  14.Bxc5  bxc3  15.Qxc3  . }
14. Bxc5
{ Now it's time to release the tension in order to stop Black's only counterplay with the ...b4 break. }
14... Nxc5 15. Qd4
{ Centralizing the Queen and preventing ...b4. In the openings section, I have recommended an even stronger move with  15.b4!!  which is a positional masterpiece sabotaging Black's play completely.  15...Nd7  16.Ne2  & Nd4 and White is dominating. The move played in the game is also quite good leading to a similar situation. }
15... Qc7
{ Holding the Knight on c5. We cannot pinpoint a single mistake from Black as he has played all logical moves but Black's position is already falling apart. That showcases that the direction of this line is not in the right spirit. As always the c8 Bishop gets stuck like in many French positions and we make use of this. }
16. h5 { Ok, let's advance further to create some pressure on the Kingside. }
16... Bd7
{ 16...h6  was clearly required from Black, in order to stop us from further expanding and dampening his dark squares as happened in the game. Play might have continued with the typical Rook shift  17.Rh3  followed by b4! at some point, totally sealing Black's play on the Queenside. Next we would play g4, creating some threats against the h6 pawn push. Though Black is worse, he is not lost and he can hope to survive, but after the move 16...Bd7 played in the game, he is busted. }
17. h6
{ And now White's pawn on h6 is super annoying, which is not only reflected in the middle game but also in the endgame as you can witness in this game. Allowing White to advance with h6 was a positional blunder from the Black side. }
17... g6 18. b4
{ This move is quite typical and has to be noted. And now the c5 Knight has no proper squares. }
18... Na4
{ 18...Nb7  is met by stunning tactics:  19.Nxd5  exd5  20.e6  and now you can see how annoying the pawn on h6 is as we threaten Qg7 mate.  20...f6  21.exd7  Qxd7  22.Qxd5  and we have an extra pawn with a winning position. }
19. Nxa4 bxa4 20. Bxa6 { Thank you for the pawn. :@@EndBracket@@ } 20... Bb5
21. Bxb5 Rxb5 { Black's only hope is to bring the Rook on c8 to c4 somehow. }
22. Rh3
{ Once again as you see quite often, in these structures once we have played h4, this Rook shift is always useful and protects the Queenside from a distance. }
22... Rc8 23. Rd2 Rb6
{ Black is preparing for Rc6-Rc4 and if he gets a nice outpost there, he will clearly obtain nice compensation for the pawn. However, here comes a mind-blowing and jaw-dropping masterpiece move. One of the best moves I have ever played in my whole chess career so far. }
24. c4
{ Bam! A positional killer. It reminds me of this fascinating game which happened recently between Richard Rapport and Caruana in GCT, Paris Rapid and Blitz 2021 where Rapport unleashed the move of the year with 36. d4!! moving his pawn to an unprotected square controlled by six enemies! Do check this game out. I was spellbound. :@@EndBracket@@ And similarly 24. c4 is the same story here. We give up the pawn to open the d-file or the c-file. And in fact this is the strongest move here and the top choice of Stockfish. So I was really proud of this move after the game. }
24... Qxc4+
{ 24...Rc6  25.c5  is dead for Black,   and if  24...dxc4  we gain full control over the d-file with  25.Qd7  and if  25...Qb8  26.Qe7  & Qf6 is game over. }
25. Qxc4 Rxc4+
{ 25...dxc4  26.Rd7  is devastating as well as we occupy the seventh rank and Black's Rooks are passive, lack activity and his pawns on c4 and a4 are also scattered and vulnerable. }
26. Rc2
{ Finally, thanks to this pawn sacrifice we have opened up the c-file and we also have a passed pawn on b4. Black's King is too far away and that clearly helps us. }
26... Rbc6
{ 26...Rxc2  27.Kxc2  Rc6  28.Rc3  and the pawn ending is winning as after  28...Rxc3  29.Kxc3  we follow up with b5-Kb4-Kxa4. }
27. Rxc4 Rxc4+ 28. Kb2
{ Next on the agenda is Rc3 and now you can also see that even in the endgame this pawn on h6 is annoying as it restricts the King totally. }
28... Kf8 { Trying to bring the King closer. } 29. Rc3
{ Our main goal is to seek entry into the c-file and penetrate. } 29... Rxf4
30. b5 { Now it's time to push. } 30... Ke8
{ If  30...Rf2  there is  31.Rc2  and if  31...Rxc2  32.Kxc2  the endgame is once again winning for White as we have Kc3-Kb4-Kxa4 and we have connected passed pawns. }
31. b6
{ The pawn needs two more moves to reach its destination. :@@EndBracket@@ }
31... Rf2+ 32. Kb1
{ 32.Rc2  now would be a blunder due to  32...Rxc2  33.Kxc2  Kd7  and ...Kc6 and the b6 pawn falls. Placing the King on b1 rather than on c1 has a deep subtle point. Once we deal with the lines, you guys will come to understand the whole point. }
32... Rf1+
{ 32...Kd8  33.b7  Rf1+  34.Kc2  Rf2+  35.Kd3  Rb2  36.Rc8+  wins.   And if  32...Kd7  then  33.Rc1!!  is the ethreal point behind Kb1 as now the b-pawn is unstoppable. }
33. Kc2 Kd7 34. Rc7+
{ Rook on seven is heaven. :@@EndBracket@@  The golden Quote which I have used quite often in my courses.   34.b7  is a blunder as Black gets a perpetual with  37...Rf2+  . }
34... Kd8 35. Kd3
{ Now the King is also joining the party as the Rook on f1 is tied down to the protection of the f7 pawn. }
35... Rf2 36. Ke3 Rf1 37. Ke2 Rh1
{ 37...Rf5  is met by either  38.Rc1  or  38.Rc5  and the b-pawn is unstoppable. }
38. Rxf7 { Now it's all over. } 38... Kc8 39. Rxh7 Kb8 40. Kd3 Rd1+ 41. Kc2 Rh1
42. Kc3 Rh4 43. g3 Rg4 44. Rf7
{ And my opponent resigned here. A clean and smooth win by me and I was extremely proud of this game which goes into my best game collections. :@@EndBracket@@ One can witness so many typical ideas and plans in the French from this duel. And it was also so pleasant for me to revisit this epic game. :@@EndBracket@@ }

{ This game was played very recently in an online event, The World Cup Qualifier. As we Indians were not able to play the Asian Hybrid championship due to severe lockdowns in our country, we had no choice rather than to fight for the spot to qualify World Cup through online rapid. I was having a decent start and this win was quite crucial to me to fight for the first place as only one place would qualify for the World Cup. This happened in the sixth round and thanks to this sweet win, I move on to 5/6. My opponent is an ardent French player and thanks to this course, I was really well versed with the nuances in the French Defense. }
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Qa5 7. Bd2 Qa4 8. Qg4
Kf8 9. h4
{ This move is currently scoring better than  9.Qd1  and let's quickly hop on to the critical juncture as we have witnessed all the other options in our opening section. }
9... Nc6 10. h5 h6 11. Qf4 c4
{ This was a surprise to me, although it is one of the typical French moves to close the game. I was expecting  11...Qxc2  which we analysed in-depth in the opening section. I always was of the opinion that closing the structure will give a free hand for White. }
12. Rh3
{ 12.Kd1  was really necessary but I assumed during the game that he cant take the pawn on c2 for some reason. }
12... Nge7 { 12...Qxc2  would have made me jittery. } 13. Rf3 Nd8 14. Kd1
{ And now I realized that I had made a mistake and immediately protected my c2 pawn. While on the Kingside the combination of the Rook and Queen is quite annoying for Black. }
14... Ke8 { Black is trying to escape with his King to the other side. } 15.
Ne2
{ Our main goal is to break open the Kingside with g4-g5 at the right moment. }
15... a5 16. g4 { Yes, Garry has arrived. :@@EndBracket@@ } 16... b5
{ Black is also trying hard to cash in the ...b4 break if given a chance. } 17.
g5
{ There may be some prepraratory moves like  17.Bh3  and then g5 would have been more effective, but there is nothing wrong with the immediate g5 here. }
17... Rb8
{ Black is desperately planning for the ...b4 breakthrough as reflected by his Rook sortie to b8. }
18. gxh6
{ Perhaps I could have maintained the tension right there and played in a preventative spirit by  18.Ra2  so that  18...b4  does not work due to the  19.cxb4  axb4  20.Bxb4  Rxb4  21.Nc3  trick. }
18... Rxh6 19. Qg4 Rh7 20. Ra2
{ With the same idea of preventing ...b4 as now  20...b4  loses the pawn to  21.cxb4  axb4  22.Bxb4   And if  22...Rxb4  23.Nc3  is the trick, supporting the Rook on a2 and attacking the Queen on a4 at the same time. }
20... Ndc6 21. Nc1
{ This Knight maneuver is nice, from g1-e2-c1. :@@EndBracket@@  Now Black can no longer play ...b4 as the Rook on a2 is well supported. }
21... Nf5 22. Bh3
{ I was able to develop the light-squared Bishop to h3, where it belongs as now it can wield some pressure on the f5 Knight. }
22... b4
{ Black, unable to maintain the tension, goes into desperation mode.  22...Nce7  was necessary, though he is worse after  23.Bg5  But at least he is not busted immediately. }
23. axb4 Qb5 24. bxa5 { Now White is a healthy pawn up. } 24... Qb1 25. Qg5
Nce7 26. a6 { The a pawn is marching ahead. } 26... Rb2 27. Rxb2 Qxb2 28. a7
Qa1 29. Bxf5 exf5
{ 29...Nxf5  30.Rxf5  was my intention and after  30...exf5  31.h6  Black is crushed. }
30. h6
{ Here is the moment where I started to slowly go astray.  30.a8=Q  Qxa8  31.Ne2  & Nf4 is simply positionally winning as the Rook on h7 is doomed. }
30... gxh6 31. Qf6 Qxa7 32. Rh3 f4
{ Now Black is back in the game. However, we were playing in severe time pressure for a long time as it is a rapid game. }
33. Rh4 Ng6 34. Rh1 Bg4+ 35. Ke1 Qa4 { 35...h5  was totally fine for Black. }
36. Rg1 h5
{ Here my opponent blundered and gave me another opportunity. I was so relieved after }
37. f3 Qxc2 { 37...Bxf3  38.Rxg6  fxg6  39.Qxg6  Rf7  40.e6  is game over. }
38. fxg4 hxg4 39. Qc6+ Kf8 40. Qc8+ Kg7 41. Qxg4 Rh2 42. Qxf4 Rh1 43. Qf6+ Kg8

{ And I won this game. It was an interesting strategic battle in the French. }

{ This game happened in my last OTB event of 2020, Aeroflot. In 2021 I am yet to travel to OTB events and I am waiting for it like a hungry lion. :@@EndBracket@@ Soon my wish of playing an OTB event will be fulfilled. }

g6
{ I was expecting this particular line from my strong opponent as he played this exact way in a tournament a couple of days before this game. }
9. Nf3 { 9.h4  was employed by Adhiban against him in the previous round. }
9... Nc6
{ 9...Ne7  will be met by  10.Qf4  eyeing the f6 square, utilizing the drawback of the Black Knight moving away from g8. White also threatens dxc5 next as the Queen is protected on f4. Black is worse after 10. Qf4. }
10. Be2
{ Natural developing moves. Unless Black closes the position, he cannot really take on c2. For instance, if  10...Qxc2  we have  11.dxc5  . }
10... c4
{ My opponent, unable to cope with the pressure, closes the position. } 11. Ra2
{ It's time to protect the c2 pawn. } 11... Bd7 12. Qh4
{ Controlling the dark squares and not allowing Black to castle long. } 12...
h6 13. O-O
{ White has completed his development and now his goal remains: how to gain entry to break open Black's position? }
13... b6 14. Bg5 { Squeezing in. } 14... Nce7 15. Rb1
{ White plays on both sides. His plan to play Rb4, a4 and expand on the Queenside, so that in the future the g5 Bishop can come to a3 and create a huge ruckus. }
15... Qa5 16. a4 { 16...Qxc3  17.Bd2  traps the Queen. } 16... Nf5
{ 16...Bxa4  was possible, but no one would like to put this Bishop under the wrath of the Rook on the a-file. White can continue with the  17.Bc1  & Ba3 idea. }
17. Qh3 Bxa4 { My opponent was so brave that he dared to grab the a4 pawn. }
18. Nd2 { Nb3 is a sneaky plan next. } 18... Kf8 19. Bf4
{ 19.Nb3  was possible but I was not sure about  19...cxb3  20.cxb3  hxg5  21.Qxh8  Qxc3  and the d4 pawn loses its support. }
19... g5
{ That was a big blunder. Black was hoping to create some chaos but it simply backfired on him.  19...Rc8  was necessary to prevent us from planting our Knight on b3. }
20. Bxg5 hxg5 21. Qxh8
{ Accepting the challenge as Black's King is clearly vulnerable. } 21... Qxc3
22. Nf3 g4 23. Ng5 { Sneaking in. } 23... Nxd4 24. Bxg4 Bxc2
{ And here I had to calculate a lot to find a clear-cut win in this messy position. }
25. Rba1 a5 26. h4
{ 26.Bh5  may be even simpler and more efficient, as it targets the weak spot on f7. }
26... Bb3 27. Ra3 Qd2 28. Bh5 Ke7 29. Bxf7 Qf4 30. Qh7
{ And now we brutually corner the King. } 30... Kd7 31. Bxe6+ Kc6 32. Qd7+ Kc5
