2. Nf3 d6 3. d4
{ A natural move, opening the centre and putting pressure on e5. Now taking on d4 is the only fully respectable move for Black, but you also meet other move at the amateur/club level. In this Quickstarter Guide we will check   3...Nd7  , which is seen most frequently amongst the weak moves. }
3... Nd7 { This is very popular at club level, but quite bad. } 4. Bc4
{ Very important  ! Instead,  4.Nc3  Ngf6  would transpose to the closed variation of the Philidor, which nowadays arises from 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7. This is, of course, still a bit better for White and part of our repertoire via this move order, but we should exploit Black's bad move order via 1... e5. }
4... Be7 { This is a direct blunder. } 5. dxe5 Nxe5
{ Instead  5...dxe5 ??  6.Qd5  is even worse  ! } 6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Qh5
{ And that's it for the important e5-pawn. } 7... g6 8. Qxe5 Nf6 9. Bh6

9... Qxg5 10. Bxg5 Ngf6 11. f3
{ With a great position for White. The Bishop pair and the weakened dark squares are great assets. He will play Be3, Nd2, a4, Nc4 etc. The sample game 1, Vescovi-Pelikian, Sao Paulo 2001, shows how White will exploit those advantages. }

4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6
{ This was a pet line of Danish legend Bent Larsen, but it has a somewhat shady reputation today. White's attacking formation, reminiscent of the Sicilian Dragon, is very easy to play. }
6. Be3 Bg7 7. Qd2 O-O 8. O-O-O
{ Compared to the Sicilian Dragon Black lacks the open c-file for counterplay. It's also not easy to get the Queenside pawns involved. Moving the c-pawn, for instance, would weaken d6 substantially. Note that on 8.f3 Black has the somewhat irritating 8...d5. This might still be better for White, but 8.0-0-0 prevents ...d5, due to 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Ndb5. }

{ Black temporarily gives up the centre in order to quickly castle with Nf6/Be7/O-O and then try to strike with d6-d5 at White's centre in most cases. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. g3
{ It is surprisingly difficult to prove something against 5... Be7. In fact, some natural tries lead to absolutely nothing, for example   6.Be3  O-O  7.Qd2  d5 !  gives Black a good game.  A closer inspection hinted that 6. g3 might be most promising. I was a bit reluctant to recommend this, to be honest. We almost never fianchetto in our repertoire, so it seems a bit inconsistent - but it's the best move, it seems. White immediately tries to increase control over d5 - this is very logical as Black's play is based on a quick d6-d5 in most cases.   I'd like to mention that  6.Bf4 !?  is a very sharp alternative, but it had too many crazy lines for the purpose of this repertoire. It's worth checking out if you like to analyze sharp complications. }
6... d5
{ This is the theoretically most challenging and principled move. It's the one option where we need to know some lines, while slow setups, starting with castling, will be slightly better for us without much effort. For example, after  6...O-O  7.Bg2  Re8  8.O-O  we will keep a comfortable advantage in the centre. }
7. e5 Ng4 8. Bg2
{ Here  8.e6  looks very tempting, but it is not 100% clear. Our choice is simpler to handle and still dangerous for Black. }
8... c6
{ This is dubious because the g4-Knight is lacking squares after White covers e5. We need to be precise though. }
9. Bf4 { I don't see a good reply for Black now. } 9... g5
{ Making it worse, but it is still important to check. } 10. e6
{ This is strong and absolutely necessary to refute Black's play. } 10... Nxf2
11. exf7+ Kf8 12. Kxf2 gxf4 13. Rf1 { With a great attack for White. } *

2. Nf3 Nf6
{ The Petroff has a deservedly solid reputation. Black is content with an at times slightly passive, but tough-to-crack position. }
3. Nc3
{ This is a very convenient choice as we have the Scotch Four Knights in our Repertoire. Now Black's most popular move is actually 3... Nc6, transposing to the Four Knights immediately. An additional option that fits well with our repertoire   is  3.Nxe5  d6  4.Nf3  Nxe4  5.d3  Nf6  6.d4  d5  7.Bd3  , and surprisingly we have transposed to the Exchange French  ! This was played by World Champion Magnus Carlsen multiple times, which inspired me to look at the French Exchange in the first place. }
3... Bb4
{ This is the only good option that keeps the game with the realms of the Petroff. All other sensible moves transpose somewhere else or blunder e5. With 3... Bb4 Black basically enters a Ruy Lopez Berlin a tempo down. }
4. Nxe5
{ This is the most consistent move. We grab e5 and Black needs to give up his pair of Bishops to get material equality. The resulting positions are extremely solid for Black, but also purely defensive in nature. White will either make his Bishop pair count and gain an advantage, or draw. Black has very few winning chances. }
4... O-O
{ This is the most popular move as Black needs to castle anyway, so he keeps things flexible. }
5. Nd3 Bxc3 6. dxc3 Nxe4 7. Be2
{ Black now has a crucial choice. He may play with ...d5 or with ...d6. White always retains a slight edge due to the Bishops. }
7... d5 8. O-O c6
{ Black decides on a light-squared setup. I now like the engine suggestion that is rarely played in practice. }
9. f3 Nf6 10. Be3
{ White will play Bf2, Re1 and Bf1 and then try to slowly make progress. Preparing c3-c4 is a good plan. Black has very few active ideas on his own. }

{ Black now has a crucial choice. He may play with ...d5 or with ...d6. White always retains a slight edge due to the Bishops. }
7... d6
{ This seems the most logical to me: Black has a light-squared Bishop, so he puts his pawns on dark squares. }
8. O-O Nd7
{ This setup is currently favored by the experts on the Black side of this line. One idea is to trade a Knight on c5. Black has also tried 8... Nc6, after which we will play in similar fashion as after 8... Nd7.   We go  9.Nf4  ,  heading towards d5 and getting out of the way. d3 is not an ideal square in the long run. Here White enjoys the long-term assets of the Bishop pair and more space. The usual setup involves Nd5, Be3 and c3-c4 in the next few moves. f2-f3 to kick the Black Knight away from the centre also happens frequently. }
9. Nf4
{ The best square, where else to go ? Moving it now is also a precaution against Nc5 by Black, when you need to move it anyway if you want to avoid trades. In general we like to keep pieces on due to the extra space. So it makes sense to preserve the Knight here. }
9... Ndf6
{ The most popular move and consistent with Nd7. It is quite difficult to analyze this position move by move, but in fact it is not that essential to learn moves by heart here. White has the Bishop pair and will be better if he manages to gain more space and push the Black pieces back, in particular the Knights. White's ideal scenario is to push the pawns on both sides in an endgame and suffocate Black slowly.I will show the most important line to know from here, without any alternatives for Black. Other moves don't change much what White will do: play f2-f3, c3-c4, develop the c1 Bishop on the long diagonal if possible. }
10. c4 Re8 11. f3 Nc5 12. b3
{ A logical sequence. White uses the pawn to control central squares. The only task left is to activate the Bishop on c1. Thus, b3 makes a lot of sense. }
12... Qe7
{ Black prevents  13.Bb2  due to  13...Qe3+  ,  winning the Knight on f4. Also note that ...g5 could be a problem, as the Knight needs to protect the Bishop on e2. }
13. Re1
{ White just needs to consolidate to be better as he has the Bishop pair forever. Note that the dark-squared Bishop would be fantastic without a counterpart on the long diagonal, like on b2 or c3. Re1 covers the Bishop, taking care of the ...g5 idea. }

2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ We are aiming for the Scotch Four Knights Opening after 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4. One important point worth to mention: the Scotch Four Knights may also arise after the immediate   3.d4  , after which Black's most popular continuation is indeed  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  , which transposes to our repertoire.  Once you have mastered the Scotch Four Knights via our 3. Nc3 move order, it makes a lot of sense to add the Scotch move order with   3.d4  to your repertoire. This way you get similar structures but some additional options like  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nxc6  - of course Black also has some extra choices, most notably 4... Bc5 or my favourite 4... Bb4+.  Our move order to the Scotch Four Knights is easier to learn as it cuts down options for both sides. Now after 3. Nc3 Black most of the time will play 3... Nf6, getting us to the Four Knights. The alternatives pose no problems for White. }
3... Bc5 { This is surprisingly dubious due to the standard pseudo-sac on e5. }
4. Nxe5 { An important motif you should remember. } 4... Nxe5
{ Instead  4...Bxf2+  is even worse for Black. After  5.Kxf2  Nxe5  6.d4  we have an excellent centre and the Bishop pair. We only need to be careful a bit due to the open position of our King for the moment. }
5. d4 { This fork regains the piece immediately. } 5... Bd6 6. dxe5 Bxe5 7. Bd3
d6 8. O-O Nf6 9. Ne2
{ A good move, threatening f4 to win the Bishop on e5. Playing   9.Bg5  is premature, as Black has  9...h6  10.Bh4  g5 !  ,  using the fact that he has not castled yet. This idea is important to note: the pin with Bg5 is much more effective once Black has already castled. }
9... Nd7 10. c3
{ This is a useful move that frees c2 for our Bishop if Black plays Nc5 later. }
10... O-O 11. f4 Bf6 12. Ng3
{ White is better due to his central control and some attacking chances on the Kingside. }

3... Nf6
{ This is by far the most popular move, completing the development of the four Knights. The alternatives are less reliable for Black and give White an edge without any particular problems. One move that Black plays sometimes is  3...g6  , after which we reply  4.d4  in the spirit of our repertoire. After  4...exd4  5.Nxd4  we will very likely transpose to line #4,  which we checked in this Quickstarter guide via the move order 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6. White is better with the standard attacking setup of Be3/f3/O-O-O. }
4. d4
{ The Scotch Four Knights Opening. This line enjoys a very good reputation as it features quick development for White and a very sound pawn structure. It is easier to learn and understand than the main alternatives, the Italian  (Giuoco Piano)  and Spanish  (Ruy Lopez)  Opening. Now taking on d4 is the most natural and popular move, but Black has alternatives we need to check as well. }
4... d6
{ A rare move at professional levels, but not that infrequent at club level. }
5. Bb5
{ I like this best, even though  5.dxe5  is also promising.  Now Bxc6 and dxe5 is threatened, winning the important e5 pawn. We now have transposed to the ancient Ruy Lopez Steinitz Defence, so our repertoire has some Spanish flavour as well ! }
5... exd4
{ Instead after  5...Bd7  6.Bxc6  Bxc6  7.Qd3  Black will take on  d4  after all, leading to the same position type. }
6. Nxd4 { This position may also arise from 4... exd4 5. Nxd4 d6 6. Bb5. } 6...
Bd7 7. Bxc6 bxc6
{ Or  7...Bxc6  8.Qd3  ,  intending to play O-O-O next. White has good attacking chances here, with a pawn storm on the Kingside on the agenda. }
8. Qf3 { And the coming Nf5 will give White good play. } *

{ We are aiming for the Scotch Four Knights Opening after 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4. One important point worth to mention: the Scotch Four Knights may also arise after the immediate   3.d4  , after which Black's most popular continuation is indeed  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  , which transposes to our repertoire.  Once you have mastered the Scotch Four Knights via our 3. Nc3 move order, it makes a lot of sense to add the Scotch move order with   3.d4  to your repertoire. This way you get similar structures but some additional options like  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nxc6  - of course Black also has some extra choices, most notably 4... Bc5 or my favourite 4... Bb4+.  Our move order to the Scotch Four Knights is easier to learn as it cuts down options for both sides. Now after 3. Nc3 Black most of the time will play 3... Nf6, getting us to the Four Knights. The alternatives pose no problems for White. }
3... Nf6
{ This is by far the most popular move, completing the development of the four Knights. The alternatives are less reliable for Black and give White an edge without any particular problems. One move that Black plays sometimes is  3...g6  , after which we reply  4.d4  in the spirit of our repertoire. After  4...exd4  5.Nxd4  we will very likely transpose to line #4,  which we checked in this Quickstarter guide via the move order 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6. White is better with the standard attacking setup of Be3/f3/O-O-O. }
4. d4
{ The Scotch Four Knights Opening. This line enjoys a very good reputation as it features quick development for White and a very sound pawn structure. It is easier to learn and understand than the main alternatives, the Italian  (Giuoco Piano)  and Spanish  (Ruy Lopez)  Opening. Now taking on d4 is the most natural and popular move, but Black has alternatives we need to check as well. }
4... Bb4
{ This move does not enjoy a fully sound reputation, but it's tricky if you don't know it. }
5. Nxe5
{ Now there are three moves for Black. Two of them are quite similar in nature and lead to a white edge. The third option is even worse for Black, but extremely complicated to play. }
5... Qe7
{ This move and 5... O-O are quite similar in nature. Black does not immediately take on e4, but develops. Most important is to remember the setup against it: in both cases we play Qd3 - covering e4 - Bd2 and O-O-O for a very swift development. We'll check the version with 5... Qe7 in the Quickstarter to demonstrate key ideas. As mentioned   5...O-O  is answered in similar fashion. }
6. Qd3 { The same move as after 5... O-O. } 6... Nxe5 7. dxe5 Qxe5 8. Bd2 O-O
9. O-O-O Bxc3
{ Starting forcing play, but it is not entirely convincing. After a slow move like  9...d6  we just cover e4 with  10.f3  and start a Kingside attack next  (g4,h4)  (.) }
10. Bxc3 Qf4+
{ The trickiest move. Instead  10...Qxe4 ?  11.Qg3 !  leads to a strong attack for White, as examined in the dedicated chapter. }
11. Rd2 Nxe4
{ This loses outright to a powerful response that you need to know. Black has better moves than 11... Nxe4, which are analysed in the dedicated chapter. None of them are fully satisfactory for Black, though. }
12. Qd4
{ Threatening to mate on g7 and to play f3 to win the Knight at the same time. White wins a piece at least ! }

Of the whole repertoire, this is about the only variation where you absolutely need to play super precisely to get a huge advantage. If you don't manage to do that you will very likely end up even being worse as the price of every move is extremely high. }
6. Qg4 Nxc3 7. Qxg7 Rf8 8. a3
{ A crazy position, but things will settle down quite quickly. } 8... Nxd4
{ This is the critical move that sets the Board on fire  ! Relatively best for Black is  8...Ba5  , after which  9.Nxc6  dxc6  10.Qe5+  Qe7  11.Qxe7  Kxe7  12.Bd2  wins the piece back with a nice edge for White. }
9. axb4 { This forces the next few moves. } 9... Nxc2+ 10. Kd2 Nxa1 11. Kxc3
{ Wow, quite a sight ! But it is just winning for White ! The following complications are very attractive to analyze. You should set some time aside and go through the lines shown here and add some of your own analysis, supported by a computer. This will prove to be excellent attacking training and it will help you to understand this line better. It might never appear in one of your games, but it still is instructive to study and will improve your overall abilities.Back to the actual position. White is threatening both Bh6 and Bc4, crashing through. The only moves to pose us some problems are connected to Black playing ....a5 and/ or Qe7, immediately distracting us due to our King's position on c3. }
11... a5
{ This does not save Black, but we need to be very precise to prove it. } 12.
Bc4 { Attacking f7 and preparing Re1 at the same time. } 12... Qe7
{ This is the most important defensive try. } 13. Re1

13... Qxb4+ 14. Kd3

The traditional main line was   10.Bg5  ,  but it is not clear whether White will want to take on f6 or drop the Bishop back to h4 after a later ...h6. With 10. h3 White will almost always go for Bf4 soon.  Note that White has a completely sound pawn structure and no weaknesses at all. This is the reason why this line is considered to be so solid for White: you have no structural risks to consider and easy development of your pieces, making it an ideal choice for us. }
10... c6
{ This is most common. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares a future Bd6 without Nb5 to worry about. }
11. Qf3 { Our setup involves Qf3 and Bf4, almost no matter what Black does. }
11... Bd6 12. Bf4 Qc7 { Black forces the trade on d6. } 13. Bxd6 Qxd6 14. b3
{ This is usually played only after being provoked by Rb8, but it is useful anyway, to prepare the c2-c4 lever later. }
14... Bd7 15. Qg3 { Not the only option, but I like these endgames. } 15...
Qxg3 16. fxg3 c5 17. Rxf6
{ This is not a sacrifice really... White has enough material and easy play. }
17... gxf6 18. Nxd5 Kg7 19. Rf1
{ And White has an easy game, attacking Black's pawns. } *

{ Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... e5
{ The classical reply to 1. e4 is popular on all levels, from junior events up to World Championship matches. You will face it very frequently and being equipped with a good repertoire against it is going to translate into many points scored. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ We are aiming for the Scotch Four Knights Opening after 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4. One important point worth to mention: the Scotch Four Knights may also arise after the immediate   3.d4  , after which Black's most popular continuation is indeed  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  , which transposes to our repertoire.  Once you have mastered the Scotch Four Knights via our 3. Nc3 move order, it makes a lot of sense to add the Scotch move order with   3.d4  to your repertoire. This way you get similar structures but some additional options like  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nxc6  - of course Black also has some extra choices, most notably 4... Bc5 or my favourite 4... Bb4+.  Our move order to the Scotch Four Knights is easier to learn as it cuts down options for both sides. Now after 3. Nc3 Black most of the time will play 3... Nf6, getting us to the Four Knights. The alternatives pose no problems for White. }
3... Nf6
{ This is by far the most popular move, completing the development of the four Knights. The alternatives are less reliable for Black and give White an edge without any particular problems. One move that Black plays sometimes is  3...g6  , after which we reply  4.d4  in the spirit of our repertoire. After  4...exd4  5.Nxd4  we will very likely transpose to line #4,  which we checked in this Quickstarter guide via the move order 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6. White is better with the standard attacking setup of Be3/f3/O-O-O. }
4. d4
{ The Scotch Four Knights Opening. This line enjoys a very good reputation as it features quick development for White and a very sound pawn structure. It is easier to learn and understand than the main alternatives, the Italian  (Giuoco Piano)  and Spanish  (Ruy Lopez)  Opening. Now taking on d4 is the most natural and popular move, but Black has alternatives we need to check as well. }
4... exd4 5. Nxd4 Bb4
{ The established main line for the last 500 years... Well, maybe not that long ago, but the oldest game I have with this position is from 1873. }
6. Nxc6
{ The only move. There is no other move available to make Bd3 possible, which is desirable because Bd3 will comfortably cover the threatened e4-pawn. }
6... bxc6 7. Bd3
{ We develop the Bishop and cover e4. Now Black most of the time will go for d7-d5, either immediately or after castling first. This is the most respectable way for Black to play, playing according to the motto that Black is OK in the open games if he gets in d7-d5 unpunished.The absolute main line of the Scotch Four Knights features this approach, but Black has two main ideas to avoid the main line.   1. not playing d7-d5 quickly, but rather delaying it or going for a d7-d6 setup.  2. playing d7-d5, but trying to use move order tricks or concrete tactics. }
7... O-O 8. O-O d5 9. exd5 cxd5 10. h3
{ The move that has brought new attention to the Scotch Four Knights. It was basically unknown until Kramnik played it against Aronian in 2012. After that game hundreds of games have been played, and the conclusion is that White has a low risk game with chances to play for a small edge. Black may equalize, but it is not so easy.  What does 10. h3 do, by the way ? It prepares Qf3 and keeps options open. It will be useful in almost all cases, making luft for the King and taking g4 under control. This allows a setup with Qf3 and Rd1 for instance. The traditional main line was   10.Bg5  ,  but it is not clear whether White will want to take on f6 or drop the Bishop back to h4 after a later ...h6. With 10. h3 White will almost always go for Bf4 soon.  Note that White has a completely sound pawn structure and no weaknesses at all. This is the reason why this line is considered to be so solid for White: you have no structural risks to consider and easy development of your pieces, making it an ideal choice for us. }
10... c6
{ This is most common. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares a future Bd6 without Nb5 to worry about. }
11. Qf3 { Our setup involves Qf3 and Bf4, almost no matter what Black does. }
11... Bd6 12. Bf4 Rb8 13. b3 Rb4 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 15. Qg3 Qxg3 16. fxg3
{ I think going for these endgames is good practical play. There is still enough imbalance in the position to outplay weaker opponents  (if they get that far in the first place)  and you are very solid against stronger opposition. }
16... Be6 17. a3 Rbb8 18. b4
{ This setup is a good alternative to the c2-c4 plan. White tries to fix the pawns on light squares and ideally blockade them with Na4 and Kf2-e3 etc. }
18... Nd7 19. Na4 Rfc8 20. Rfb1 Rc7 21. Kf2
{ I prefer White here, even though it can't be much objectively. As mentioned, it is a risk-free way to play. Win some, draw some, lose none. }

Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c5
{ The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1. e4, on par with the classical 1... e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2. Nf3 and 3. d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2... Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3. d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after   2...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3. Bb5.  For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.In the starting position of the Rossolimo Black has tried many different rare moves. We'll have a look at all these minor options in chapter 3. }
3... a6
{ To be honest, I always thought that this move makes little sense, but closer study revealed that it is not as bad as I thought. Against the main lines 3... e6/3... g6/3... d6 White often takes on c6 completely unprovoked on move 4, so why encourage the trade ? In addition, having the pawn on a6 is a disadvantage compared to the pawn being on a7, as b6 is weakened. As mentioned previously, things are not as simple as you might think - White is better, but needs to be precise. }
4. Bxc6 bxc6 5. O-O d5
{ This weakens c5 enormously. It looks a lot like a reversed Nimzo Saemisch but with White being two tempi up. Black has also tried   5...d6  , after which  6.e5 !  is very strong. Black needs to answer  6...d5  , as otherwise the position, and especially the e-file, will open even more quickly. After giving up the Bishop pair White will usually need compensation in the form of a structural weakness  (exploitable doubled pawns)  or a lead in development. Here the Queenside pawns are very weak and will often fall to ideas like Nc3-a4, b3 and Ba3. }
6. d3 Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. c4
{ Of course not the only way to a nice edge, but fixing the doubled pawns makes a lot of sense. }
8... dxe4
{ Trying to solve the problems with trades does not ultimately help. } 9. dxe4
Qxd1 10. Rxd1 Bxf3 11. gxf3 e6 12. Nc3 Nf6 13. Na4 Be7 14. Be3
{ A typical setup to put pressure on c5. } 14... Nd7 15. f4
{ White is much better here with simple means. Doubling on the d-file and a potential Rd3-b3 comes to mind. }

3... Qc7
{ This move is mostly played to allow a recapture on c6 with the Queen. There is one substantial drawback, however - Black further delays Kingside development and castling. }
4. O-O a6
{ The most popular and principled move. On other moves we simply go Re1/c3/d4, opening up the position while ahead in development. }
5. Bxc6 Qxc6 6. Nc3
{ White's advantage in development has reached scary proportions, but the position is not yet open. We need to play a quick d2-d4 now and accelerate the play. }
6... e6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 { 8.Qxd4  is of equal value. } 8... Qc7 9. Re1
{ This is best here. It prevents the natural move Nf6 due to e4-e5. White has excellent attacking chances here. Note that White has ideas like Qg4, preparing Bf4. An additional option is Bg5-h4-g3 to put more pressure on d6. Black's position is tough to defend. }

3... Nf6
{ This is a sideline, but somewhat underestimated in my opinion. It is not easy to prove anything against it. Usually  4.Nc3  is viewed as critical, but this might get very complicated, which I feel is not warranted for a rather rare line. }
4. e5
{ This will lead to positions that are very similar to the line starting with 3... g6 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 Nf6 6. e5. This was my main reason to go with 4. e5 here. It is easier to play and it heads to middlegames that are part of our repertoire anyway. }
4... Nd5 5. O-O Nc7 6. Bxc6 bxc6
{ This is risky as it delays development even further. } 7. Re1
{ This aims for a transposition again. Black has no good way to avoid it. }
7... g6 { What else to develop ?! } 8. Nc3 Bg7
{ A rare move that neglects development. } 9. Na4
{ This is usually reached via 3... g6 4. O-O Bg7 5. Re1 Nf6 6. e5 Nd5 7. Nc3 Nc7 8. Bxc6 bxc6 ?! 9. Na4 ! White is better, please see the main line for further info on it. This is a novelty suggested by Stockfish. Usually White plays   9.Ne4  ,  here, and is comfortable, but 9. Na4 seems even better. }
9... Ne6 10. b3 O-O 11. Bb2 d6
{ If Black does not commit with this move White has many improving moves at his disposal. A setup with pawns on d3 and c4 comes to mind, as well as Qd2-e3, Bb2-a3 to play against c5 and provoke d7-d6, after all. }
12. exd6
{ This is one major point of Na4. Now the simplifications lead to a slight, but very one-sided, advantage for White. }
12... exd6 13. Bxg7 Nxg7 14. d4 cxd4 15. Qxd4

The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2... Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3. d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after   2...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3. Bb5.  For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.In the starting position of the Rossolimo Black has tried many different rare moves. We'll have a look at all these minor options in chapter 3. }
3... e6
{ The second most popular move for Black, only surpassed by  3...g6.  Black's main idea is to go Nge7 to allow a recapture on c6 with a Knight. The other point is to support a later ...d5. }
4. O-O
{ Here White's main alternative is  4.Bxc6  ,  creating an imbalance in the position immediately. White gives up the pair of Bishops, but creates weaknesses in Black's camp. I prefer 4. O-O for our repertoire, because it is easier to learn and understand. If you'd like to expand your repertoire at a later stage I advise you to have a closer look at 4. Bxc6. }
4... Nge7
{ This is the most consistent with 3... e6. Black prepares ...a6 and/ or ...d5. }
5. Re1
{ White has to commit regarding his Bishop on  b5.  He may play  5.c3  ,  signalling his intention to drop it to b3/c2 later. This has some similarities to the Ruy Lopez. My choice is 5. Re1 in order to drop the Bishop back to f1 and then expand in the centre. Both moves are good and of roughly equal value theoretically. }
5... a6 6. Bf1
{ Preserving the Bishop.  6.Bxc6  is actually quite OK as well. After  6...Nxc6  7.d4  we would, however, get a position more in the spirit of the open Sicilian which I want to avoid in this repertoire. }
6... d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. d4
{ White tries to open the centre as he is better developed and has already castled. }
8... cxd4 { This natural move is less precise. } 9. Nxd4 Be7
{ Black accepts a pawn structure defect, but he needs to get castled. } 10.
Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nd2
{ The Knight heads towards c4. White is slightly better here due to the pawn structure. }

9. Be3 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bd7 11. c4 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Bc6 13. Nc3 Be7 14. a3
{ White tries to set his majority in motion. } 14... a5 15. Qd3 O-O 16. Rad1
{ White enjoys a small edge with his well-centralised pieces and chances to exploit the Queenside majority. This position was reached in the sample game Carlsen-Gelfand, London Candidates 2013. It is well worth studying the mentioned Carlsen game to get a better picture of this type of position. }

3... d6
{ Black intends to play Bd7 followed by a6 to question the Bishop. This plan is quite logical, but at the same time rather slow. I think that White has good prospects to get an edge against it. It is important to note that we might also get this position via 2... d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6. }
4. O-O Bd7
{ This is by far the most popular and best move. Other moves delay the development even more and are quite risky. }
5. Re1 Nf6 6. c3 a6 7. Bf1 Bg4
{ By far the most common move. In many cases Black will take on f3, giving us the Bishop pair. In return, Black gains some time to develop, as we will see in the main line. If Black tries to keep the Bishop by retreating to h5, White has excellent chances to get an early attack. }
8. h3 Bh5 { Very risky, but White needs to be very energetic now. } 9. g4 Bg6
10. d4 { The important point ! } 10... cxd4
{ Black has no good way to take e4, for example   10...Nxe4  11.d5  Nb8  12.Rxe4  Bxe4  13.Qa4+   or  10...Bxe4  11.Rxe4  Nxe4  12.d5  , using similar tactical ideas. }
11. cxd4 d5
{ Taking the pawn fails, just like it does with c-pawns on the board. } 12.
exd5
{ Instead,  12.e5  and 13. e6 ! is strong as well, shutting in the f8-Bishop. I think 12. exd5 is just as strong and more straightforward. Black will have a very hard time surviving the next moves. }
12... Nxd5 13. Nc3 e6 14. Nxd5 Qxd5 15. Bg2

3... g6
{ This is the most popular reply. Black prepares the fianchetto and tries to increase control over d4 this way. It also emphases Kingside development more than the other moves. Note that White will castle on move 4, while Black's King will be in the centre for a while. This is not a big issue yet, as the position is closed, but further delaying it might be a cause for later concerns. }
4. O-O
{ What could be more natural ? White's main alternative to 4. O-O is to play   4.Bxc6  , leading to a strategically very complicated battle. This is my recommendation if you like to expand your repertoire.  Note that against 3... e6 we also go 4. O-O, while 4. Bxc6 is the other basic option there, as well. The Rossolimo is a rather versatile line, making it an ideal choice for any repertoire. You can start with one line and later add more variety, without needing to learn something entirely new. }
4... Bg7 5. Re1
{ This move is almost always useful to play. One point of the move is to allow Bf1. In this particular case we will actually take on c6 quite frequently, so this is not as important as in other situations. }
5... e6
{ Mixing e6 and g6 does not work all that well here. White gets a solid edge now. }
6. Bxc6 { The most straightforward way. Instead  6.c3  is good as well. } 6...
bxc6
{ After  6...dxc6  7.e5 !  is very strong. White gets excellent control over the dark squares and the c8-Bishop remains a passive spectator. The next moves will be d3/Nbd2-c4 or e4. Note that f6 and d6 are tough for Black to cover. }
7. c3
{ Aiming for a full centre. This is very much comparable to the scenario we examined after 5... a6 6. Bxc6 bxc6. }
7... Ne7 8. d4 cxd4 9. cxd4 O-O 10. Nc3 d6 11. Be3
{ White is better, here, in the long term. Black's c6-pawn is not going away and the Black Bishops don't impress. }

The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.In the starting position of the Rossolimo Black has tried many different rare moves. We'll have a look at all these minor options in chapter 3. }
3... g6
{ This is the most popular reply. Black prepares the fianchetto and tries to increase control over d4 this way. It also emphases Kingside development more than the other moves. Note that White will castle on move 4, while Black's King will be in the centre for a while. This is not a big issue yet, as the position is closed, but further delaying it might be a cause for later concerns. }
4. O-O
{ What could be more natural ? White's main alternative to 4. O-O is to play   4.Bxc6  , leading to a strategically very complicated battle. This is my recommendation if you like to expand your repertoire.  Note that against 3... e6 we also go 4. O-O, while 4. Bxc6 is the other basic option there, as well. The Rossolimo is a rather versatile line, making it an ideal choice for any repertoire. You can start with one line and later add more variety, without needing to learn something entirely new. }
4... Bg7 5. Re1
{ This move is almost always useful to play. One point of the move is to allow Bf1. In this particular case we will actually take on c6 quite frequently, so this is not as important as in other situations. }
5... e5
{ The only fully respectable alternative to  5...Nf6.  Black clamps down on d4 and intends to develop with Nge7 next. }
6. Bxc6
{ This is one of the few cases where I recommend taking on c6, when still relatively unprovoked. Here I believe that White has chances for a small edge, while the alternatives are either toothless or quite complicated  (yet not fantastic)   . If you like to explore something entirely different, have a look at  6.b4 !?  This gives enough compensation and interesting play. As stated above - complicated, not fantastic, but worth a try as an additional option. }
6... bxc6 { This recapture leads to a comfortable game for White. } 7. c3
{ We have seen on multiple occasions already that this approach is best after bxc6. White opens up the centre while being better developed, and ultimately aims to target central weaknesses. Contrary to general wisdom, it is quite often an idea to open the position against the Bishop pair - it's a matter of timing and often very much dependent on concrete factors. }
7... Ne7 8. d4 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nxd4 O-O 11. Nc3
{ This sequence is basically forced after 7. c3. Black's main problem is that the pawns on d7 and c6 have problems moving to set up a reliable central structure. There will always be some square or pawn weakness that White might play against. }

{ Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c5
{ The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1. e4, on par with the classical 1... e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2. Nf3 and 3. d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2... Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3. d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after   2...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3. Bb5.

As stated above - complicated, not fantastic, but worth a try as an additional option. }
6... dxc6 { This is more reliable than bxc6. } 7. d3 Ne7
{ This looks natural, but I think White's task is easier, here, compared to  7...Qe7. }
8. Be3 b6 9. a3
{ b2-b4 is the essential plan here. White opens up the Queenside to make it easier to attack the weaknesses. }
9... a5 10. Nbd2 Qc7 11. Nc4
{ Note that Black has problems playing b5, as c5 would be fatally weakened. White's threat is b4 now. }
11... a4 12. b3
{ And White opens up the Queenside favorably. Note how ineffective the e7-Knight and g7-Bishop are. }

6... dxc6 { This is more reliable than bxc6. } 7. d3 Qe7
{ This is played to cover e5 and thus prepare Nf6. Nf6 is the first step for a possible later Nd7-f8-e6-d4. }
8. a3
{ White has quite a huge choice here. I like the direct 8. a3, but you may also go for 8. h3/8. Nbd2 etc - it's a slow position. }
8... Nf6 9. b4
{ Here we go. White immediately opens it up. Of course, a slower course of action is also possible. }
9... O-O { Taking twice on b4 is far too risky for Black. } 10. bxc5 Nd7
{ Not the only move, but the structure will be the same after the alternatives. }
11. a4 Nxc5 12. Ba3
{ And I prefer White. His position is very stable and we have some ideas on the Queenside. The pin on the c5-Knight is also quite annoying. }

6... Nd5 7. Nc3 Nc7
{ Taking on c3 is too accomodating. After   7...Nxc3  8.dxc3  O-O  9.Qd5  b6  10.Bf4  White gets nice pressure along the d-file and Black's development is lacking. Black is under severe pressure. White may also go for a Kingside attack with a later Rad1/Qd2/Bh6 setup. The e5-pawn is a huge asset that cuts the board in two. }
8. Bxc6 dxc6 9. Ne4
{ The nice post on e4 is one major motivation behind advancing the e-pawn. This Knight may play a role in future Kingside play or will be used in the centre if Black later plays f6. But first of all c5 is attacked. }
9... Ne6
{ This is the most popular and simple reply, but it forfeits the idea to develop the Bishop to g4. }
10. d3 O-O 11. Be3 b6 12. Qd2
{ White aims for the Bishop trade. We will try to make Black's life uncomfortable on the Kingside while allowing very little on the Queenside. This position type does not look like a lot for White, but the score is very good as it is much simpler to handle for us. Black is mostly just sitting there without a clear active plan. }
12... Nd4 { This is the most solid and straightforward choice. } 13. Nxd4 cxd4
14. Bh6 c5
{ Black sometimes starts with  14...Qd5  instead, but ...c5 will be played soon anyway, so it's not a big difference. }
15. Qf4 Bb7 16. h4
{ The main point of White's play is that the pawn on e5 allows this Kingside initiative, and if Black wants to solve this completely he will very likely have to play ...f6 at some point. This has to be well prepared, though, as White might double on the e-file quicker.This does not amount to all that much, but White's position is simpler to play, here. This is also supported by the scores that favour White quite heavily. Note that Black has no active ideas at all, and this means White's position is very safe. }

2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
{ This is the Moscow variation. I briefly tried to find out why this name is used, but came up empty. This line always had a somewhat lame reputation, but this has changed lately. As White got more and more frustrated with battling the Najdorf this move gained more popularity and is now used regularly by almost all elite players, including World Champion Magnus Carlsen. }
3... Nd7
{ This is the usual choice of ambitious players. They avoid the immediate Bishop trade, but development is delayed. This variation usually leads to complex middlegames with oftentimes all pieces and pawns on the board. }
4. c3
{ This is my suggestion, at this point, but White has some interesting alternatives. The most principled move is  4.d4  , but this was too close to an open Sicilian for this repertoire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, it just does not fit well with our purposes.   Also, there is  4.O-O  , going for  4...a6  5.Bd3  !?. This is quite interesting as well but a tad too artificial for a 'Keep it Simple' repertoire. Again, nothing wrong with it, but it didn't work out for me in this context.  My chosen move opens up the c2-square for the Bishop and leads to position types that are more typical of the Ruy Lopez than anything else. One important point to remember is that Black intended to play a Dragon or Najdorf, most likely, and might not be well versed in defending a Ruy Lopez structure. }
4... Nf6 5. Qe2
{ Now, and on the next couple of moves, Black has many options. He may play b5/e5 for the typical Ruy Lopez setup  (most popular and our main line)  , but there is also ...e6 or some combination of Qc7 and g6. Fortunately, White's responses are all very natural - d4, O-O etc. It is easy to play. It is impossible to cover all the move orders, so I will just give some sample lines. }
5... a6 6. Ba4 e6 7. O-O b5 8. Bc2 Be7 9. d4
{ This is very similar to 5... e6 earlier. If/ when to play e4-e5 is a key point. White however has lots of useful moves to play  (Re1/d1, Nbd2-f1-g3 etc)  and may wait for a good moment. He has more space after all. }

{ This is the usual choice of ambitious players. They avoid the immediate Bishop trade, but development is delayed. This variation usually leads to complex middlegames with oftentimes all pieces and pawns on the board. }
4. c3
{ This is my suggestion, at this point, but White has some interesting alternatives. The most principled move is  4.d4  , but this was too close to an open Sicilian for this repertoire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, it just does not fit well with our purposes.   Also, there is  4.O-O  , going for  4...a6  5.Bd3  !?. This is quite interesting as well but a tad too artificial for a 'Keep it Simple' repertoire. Again, nothing wrong with it, but it didn't work out for me in this context.  My chosen move opens up the c2-square for the Bishop and leads to position types that are more typical of the Ruy Lopez than anything else. One important point to remember is that Black intended to play a Dragon or Najdorf, most likely, and might not be well versed in defending a Ruy Lopez structure. }
4... Nf6 5. Qe2
{ Now, and on the next couple of moves, Black has many options. He may play b5/e5 for the typical Ruy Lopez setup  (most popular and our main line)  , but there is also ...e6 or some combination of Qc7 and g6. Fortunately, White's responses are all very natural - d4, O-O etc. It is easy to play. It is impossible to cover all the move orders, so I will just give some sample lines. }
5... a6 6. Ba4 b5 7. Bc2 Bb7 8. d4 e5
{ This stops any White ambitions to push e4-e5 and leads to a very Ruy Lopez like position. }
9. O-O Be7 10. Rd1 Qc7 11. d5
{ Not strictly necessary yet, but grabbing space makes sense. } 11... c4 12. b3
{ 12.a4  is less promising here due to  12...Nc5  and a later Qd7. } 12... Nb6
13. Nfd2
{ Not the most natural move ever, but it is strong. White increases the pressure on c4 and, compared to the more natural Nbd2, keeps c3 covered. }
13... cxb3 14. axb3 O-O 15. Nf1
{ And White is better here as well. Playing c3-c4 will be the long term plan. }

{ Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c5
{ The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1. e4, on par with the classical 1... e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2. Nf3 and 3. d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
{ This is the Moscow variation. I briefly tried to find out why this name is used, but came up empty. This line always had a somewhat lame reputation, but this has changed lately. As White got more and more frustrated with battling the Najdorf this move gained more popularity and is now used regularly by almost all elite players, including World Champion Magnus Carlsen. }
3... Bd7
{ This is the most solid reply for Black as it does not clog up development that much. We will trade on d7 and later set up a Maroczy Bind with c4 in most cases. }
4. Bxd7+
{ The normal move and the main line by a mile. Only after I had completed work on this repertoire did I learn that  4.c4  is currently in fashion. It shares some similarities with our main line and is a good choice for a later addition to your repertoire. }
4... Nxd7 5. O-O Ngf6 6. Qe2 g6 7. c3 Bg7 8. d4
{ White is quite comfortable here. Note that e5-e6 is an immediate idea as Black is weak on the light squares. }
8... e5
{ This is quite accommodating, but it is useful to know how to react to it as similar situations might occur in other lines. }
9. dxe5
{ This makes a lot of sense here, as White quickly exploits the weak d5-square which is not defended by a light-squared Bishop anymore. This trade would be far less promising with, for example, White having a Bishop on g2 and Black one on c8. }
9... dxe5 10. Rd1 Qc7 11. Bg5 { Trading off a defender of the weak square d5. }
11... O-O 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. a4
{ And White has two Knights to exploit the weak light squares, in particular d5. Black's Bishop on f6 is pretty useless. }

4... Nxd7 5. O-O Ngf6 6. Qe2 e6 7. d4
{ Here a c3-based approach makes less sense as Black will manage d5, leading to a French like structure without the c8-Bishop. We instead want the Maroczy Bind instead. This can be started with c4 and d4 later or d4 immediately. Against   7.c4  there is the irritating move  7...Ne5  ,  so we start with 7. d4. }
7... cxd4 8. Nxd4
{ Black will play Be7/O-O/Rc8/a6 on the next moves with the move order not being particularly important. I will go with just one and not point out the maze of different move sequences. }
8... Be7 9. c4 O-O 10. Nc3 a6 11. b3
{ Without the light-squared Bishop, the Queen is well placed on the e2-square, and the fianchetto of the c1-Bishop becomes more attractive. Without the Bishop trade White's Bishop will be on e2 and Queen on d2, where it covers c3 as well. In that situation e3 is the most natural post for the dark-squared Bishop. Here b2 is fine as it covers c3, and there are also some attacking chances against the King using the long diagonal. }
11... Rc8 12. Bb2 Re8 13. Rad1
{ White may go for f2-f4, with a possible Rook lift to g3. I prefer White's chances here, but of course Black is quite solid. }

4... Qxd7
{ This move signals that Black will play Nc6 most of the time to emphasize control over d4. This is most often combined with a Kingside fianchetto. }
5. c4
{ A strategically very sound choice. White places his pawns on light squares after this Bishop has been traded off. We are aiming for a Maroczy Bind structure, giving White comfortable control. }
5... Nf6
{ This is the most popular move on the top level nowadays. There are some concrete lines where delaying Nc6 is relevant, as an early Rf8-c8 will attack the c4 pawn. You also meet   5...Nc6  often, but it is just a transposition to lines we will examine via 5... Nf6. Black's move ...Nf6 will just follow after 5... Nc6 soon, where else to develop this piece ? }
6. Nc3
{ Black now has three basic approaches. He needs to develop the f8-Bishop soon, so the first two approaches are to play 6... e6 or 6... g6 now or after inserting 6... Nc6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4. The third approach is to try some concrete play after 6... Nc6, based on the Queen sortie ...Qd7-g4 !? to attack the still unprotected g-pawn. This ...Qg4 idea is rare and examined in the dedicated chapter, but not analysed in the Quickstarter. }
6... e6
{ Black chooses to develop the Bishop to e7, setting up a pawn formation with both d6 and e6 being played, very typical of many open Sicilian lines like the Scheveningen Variation. }
7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4
{ Note that ...e6 and Be7 look more passive than ....g6 and Bg7, but there is a very important upside: Black controls d5, so White's Knight is not coming to d5. In g6-formations this is always an idea, as Black cannot easily kick it away with a later ...e6 as this weakens d6 considerably. }
8... Nc6 9. O-O Be7 10. Be3
{ 10.b3  is also quite good, but, with the Knight on c6, it is useful to cover d4 with Be3, so that Qe2 and Rad1 can be played next. }
10... O-O 11. Qe2 a6 12. Rad1
{ Very natural play. Black will lose some time with the Queen, leaving the d-file. }
12... Qc7 13. f4 Rac8 14. b3
{ And I like White here with a good centre and chances on the Kingside. } *

6... g6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nc6
{ Instead the move  8...Bg7  is also possible, going for a quick Kingside castling. Just as after 8... Nc6 it is important to play  9.f3 !  O-O  10.Be3  first and only castle later.   The problem with  8...Bg7  9.O-O ?!  is  9...Nc6  ,  when the the threat 10... Nxe4 ! forces  10.Nde2. }
9. f3
{ This is an important move order detail ! We want to play Be3 and f3 to support the centre anyway, but it is important to start with this immediately and not waste a tempo on castling. After   9.O-O  Bg7  Black threatens Nxe4 ! and it is too late to play f3. Instead, we need to go  10.Nde2  which is less testing for Black than the f3 setups. }
9... Bg7 10. Be3
{ We need to lend some protection to the Knight and develop the Bishop to the most natural square. }
10... O-O 11. O-O
{ It is quite difficult to analyse these positions on a move by move basis. Black has different Rook setups  (Rfc8, Rac8+Rad8)  and moves like ...a6, Qd8-a5 etc, that may be played in various move orders. White is quite happy to consolidate his space advantage and prevent the pawn breaks like b7-b5 or be ready for e7-e6 and d6-d5 by Black. We will centralize and often base our play on the Knight coming to d5. This will be a key idea for changing the pawn structure, as after Nxd5 White retakes with a pawn. cxd5 will often lead to a better endgame. exd5 might be an option to play against the e7-pawn.The Maroczy centre is generally regarded as slightly favorable for White, but it requires patience, building up slowly. It is very useful to study some complete games in order to get a better feel for the position.It is important to note that the play is quite strategical and slow in nature, a type of position that, in many cases, the Black player did not intend to reach when he learned his main line open Sicilian theory. Defending the Black side of the Maroczy is quite different to a Dragon or Najdorf main line. }
11... Rfc8
{ This move is usually a sign that Black aims for Queenside play. Often, the next moves will be Qd8-a5 and a7-a6, supporting b7-b5. }
12. b3 Qd8 13. Qd2 Qa5 14. Rfd1
{ This is most popular, but it is equally good to play  14.Rac1.  Again, it is not so move-order-critical as long as you address the breaks that Black may have. Here we need to keep an eye on b7-b5 of course. }
14... a6 15. a4
{ Stopping the b-pawn by radical means. Weakening b4 is not ideal, but keeping a grip on the position is more important. }
15... Nd7 16. Nde2
{ This is an interesting idea. White avoids further trades and tries to play Rab1 and Nd5 soon. If Black covers d5 with ...e6 the d6-pawn is a potential target. Black is quite solid, here, but I still think White has the easier game. }

After   9.O-O  Bg7  Black threatens Nxe4 ! and it is too late to play f3. Instead, we need to go  10.Nde2  which is less testing for Black than the f3 setups. }
9... Bg7 10. Be3
{ We need to lend some protection to the Knight and develop the Bishop to the most natural square. }
10... O-O 11. O-O
{ It is quite difficult to analyse these positions on a move by move basis. Black has different Rook setups  (Rfc8, Rac8+Rad8)  and moves like ...a6, Qd8-a5 etc, that may be played in various move orders. White is quite happy to consolidate his space advantage and prevent the pawn breaks like b7-b5 or be ready for e7-e6 and d6-d5 by Black. We will centralize and often base our play on the Knight coming to d5. This will be a key idea for changing the pawn structure, as after Nxd5 White retakes with a pawn. cxd5 will often lead to a better endgame. exd5 might be an option to play against the e7-pawn.The Maroczy centre is generally regarded as slightly favorable for White, but it requires patience, building up slowly. It is very useful to study some complete games in order to get a better feel for the position.It is important to note that the play is quite strategical and slow in nature, a type of position that, in many cases, the Black player did not intend to reach when he learned his main line open Sicilian theory. Defending the Black side of the Maroczy is quite different to a Dragon or Najdorf main line. }
11... a6
{ Against this move we need to be precise. Black has the simple idea to take on d4 and then go b7-b5 right away. }
12. Qd3
{ This is not a very common square for the Queen, but here it is most important to keep an eye on b5, thus preventing the b-pawn push. Note that   12.Qe2 ?  blunders to  12...Nxe4 ! }
12... Ne5 13. Qe2 Rac8 14. b3 b5
{ It looks like Black has reached his goal, but White still retains a slight pull. }
15. Nd5
{ This is available and saves the day. The Knight now threatens the fork on b6 and b5 is hanging, so Black has to take it. }
15... Nxd5 16. cxd5 Qb7 17. Rac1
{ And White is better here, f4 and Nc6 being the main idea. Black is under pressure. }

{ Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c5
{ The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1. e4, on par with the classical 1... e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2. Nf3 and 3. d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
{ This is the Moscow variation. I briefly tried to find out why this name is used, but came up empty. This line always had a somewhat lame reputation, but this has changed lately. As White got more and more frustrated with battling the Najdorf this move gained more popularity and is now used regularly by almost all elite players, including World Champion Magnus Carlsen. }
3... Bd7
{ This is the most solid reply for Black as it does not clog up development that much. We will trade on d7 and later set up a Maroczy Bind with c4 in most cases. }
4. Bxd7+
{ The normal move and the main line by a mile. Only after I had completed work on this repertoire did I learn that  4.c4  is currently in fashion. It shares some similarities with our main line and is a good choice for a later addition to your repertoire. }
4... Qxd7
{ This move signals that Black will play Nc6 most of the time to emphasize control over d4. This is most often combined with a Kingside fianchetto. }
5. c4
{ A strategically very sound choice. White places his pawns on light squares after this Bishop has been traded off. We are aiming for a Maroczy Bind structure, giving White comfortable control. }
5... Nf6
{ This is the most popular move on the top level nowadays. There are some concrete lines where delaying Nc6 is relevant, as an early Rf8-c8 will attack the c4 pawn. You also meet   5...Nc6  often, but it is just a transposition to lines we will examine via 5... Nf6. Black's move ...Nf6 will just follow after 5... Nc6 soon, where else to develop this piece ? }
6. Nc3
{ Black now has three basic approaches. He needs to develop the f8-Bishop soon, so the first two approaches are to play 6... e6 or 6... g6 now or after inserting 6... Nc6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4. The third approach is to try some concrete play after 6... Nc6, based on the Queen sortie ...Qd7-g4 !? to attack the still unprotected g-pawn. This ...Qg4 idea is rare and examined in the dedicated chapter, but not analysed in the Quickstarter. }
6... g6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nc6
{ Instead the move  8...Bg7  is also possible, going for a quick Kingside castling. Just as after 8... Nc6 it is important to play  9.f3 !  O-O  10.Be3  first and only castle later.   The problem with  8...Bg7  9.O-O ?!  is  9...Nc6  ,  when the the threat 10... Nxe4 ! forces  10.Nde2. }
9. f3
{ This is an important move order detail ! We want to play Be3 and f3 to support the centre anyway, but it is important to start with this immediately and not waste a tempo on castling. After   9.O-O  Bg7  Black threatens Nxe4 ! and it is too late to play f3. Instead, we need to go  10.Nde2  which is less testing for Black than the f3 setups. }
9... Bg7 10. Be3
{ We need to lend some protection to the Knight and develop the Bishop to the most natural square. }
10... O-O 11. O-O
{ It is quite difficult to analyse these positions on a move by move basis.

Defending the Black side of the Maroczy is quite different to a Dragon or Najdorf main line. }
11... Rac8 12. b3 { The pawn on c4 needs some cover. } 12... Rfd8
{ This signals that Black is trying to play in the centre with e6 and d5 to come. }
13. Qd2 e6 14. Rad1
{ After Black has revealed his plan we know how to place this Rook. White needs more control over the d-file as we will see in the coming sequence of moves. }
14... d5 15. cxd5 exd5 16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. e5 Ne8 18. f4
{ Here it is clear why the Rook is needed on d1 and why Rad1 was more appropriate than Rfd1, in this specific situation. White is better here with the superior pawn structure and more active pieces. }

2. Nf3 g6
{ The Hyper-accelerated Dragon with 2... g6 is mostly played in order to reach a Dragon setup while avoiding the Rossolimo after 2... Nc6 3. Bb5 or the Moscow after 2... d6 3. Bb5+. It is the most common among the second tier options for Black. }
3. c3
{ White now has two main tries for an advantage: the first is going for a Maroczy Bind with  3.c4  ,  followed by 4. d4. This is probably most critical for Black, but White needs to study quite a body of theory, as Black chooses the setup. This means that you need to be ready for a range of lines. I decided against covering this complex option here as 2... g6 is a line you won't face very frequently.  Fortunately, there is a second option in 3. c3, which fits nicely with our repertoire choices against 2... e6 and 2... a6. After 3. c3 we again get a c3-Sicilian while avoiding the most respectable setups available to Black. In this version of the Alapin Black is committed to ...g6 and has trouble equalising completely. Black now needs to choose when to play ...d5: right away, in order to recapture with the Queen, or wait until White has played d4. }
3... d5 { This is Black's best option I think. } 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. d4 Bg7 6. Nbd2
{ This is a rare move at this point, but it is not worse than the more popular moves and probably less likely to be expected by the Black player. It is mentioned in Raja Panjwani's book, about the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon, as one reason why he prefers the 5... Nc6 line over 5... Bg7... It is also what Stockfish recommends after a while, so why not go for this fresh move ? }
6... cxd4
{ This looks like the critical choice. Taking on d4 after Nc3 is out of the picture makes a lot of sense. If Black plays a different move, Bc4 and O-O are easy moves to make. White should be fine there with excellent development. }
7. Bc4 Qh5 8. Qb3
{ A good Zwischenzug, forcing  Nh6.  Panjwani likes  8.O-O  even more, but I think White is somewhat better in both cases. }
8... Nh6 9. Nxd4
{ White is slightly better due to the more active pieces and quicker development. O-O and N2f3 are coming next. }

2. Nf3 e6
{ This is Black's third most popular move, right after 2... d6 and 2... Nc6. In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6, have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against 2... e6 we need a different approach. }
3. c3
{ My recommendation is to go 3. c3 in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to c3 on move 2 Black is committed to an early ...e6. This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system. }
3... Nc6
{ A natural developing move that will very often transpose to lines examined via  3...d5. }
4. d4 cxd4
{ This is the only independent option and regarded as imprecise, as White should benefit from the trade. The c3-square is now available to White's Knight. }
5. cxd4 d5 6. e5
{ This is the theoretical argument against Black's move order. We get to an advance French with an early trade on d4 that benefits White, as he is able to play Nc3 early on. However, it needs to be said that it is not a situation where White is clearly better and just needs to learn some moves to prove it. In fact, I am unsure if White has anything better than in a regular French if Black is precise.  If you feel uncomfortable in this structure, after 6. e5, you also have the option to simply take on d5 which is playing for a tempo edge in a symmetrical position, or go   6.Nc3  ,  which very likely gets to an IQP after Black takes on e4. I don't want to examine all this in detail as this move order, for Black, is quite rarely seen.   If you want to keep it very simple,  6.exd5  is the way to play. }
6... Qb6 7. Nc3
{ This is possible now compared to the French advance where there are still pawns on c5 and c3. }
7... Bd7 8. a3 Nge7 9. Na4 Qc7 10. Bd3
{ And White enjoys a nice space advantage. } *

The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 e6
{ This is Black's third most popular move, right after 2... d6 and 2... Nc6. In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6, have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against 2... e6 we need a different approach. }
3. c3
{ My recommendation is to go 3. c3 in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to c3 on move 2 Black is committed to an early ...e6. This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system. }
3... d5 4. exd5
{ Now we will quite often reach an IQP position. After  4...exd5  Black often goes for the IQP,   while after  4...Qxd5  we will play with the isolated pawn in many cases. }
4... Qxd5
{ Black avoids the IQP with this move and in fact White could be the one with a  (favorable)  IQP soon. Most of time however we play with an early Na3, intending to harrass the Queen with Nb5, leading to an open centre without an isolated pawn. }
5. d4 cxd4
{ This is a quite clear concession, giving White the good c3 square for the Knight. White will easily get a comfortable IQP position. }
6. cxd4
{ The IQP structure has been discussed a lot in chess literature or media so I only want to give a quick summary of what is most important. The side with the IQP enjoys fluent piece development and does not have any problem pieces. With many pieces on the board the weakness of the isolated pawn is not that pronounced as it is difficult to attack it multiple times. This is not the case after trading minor pieces, when the Rooks and Queen may focus on attacking the pawn. Following this logic the IQP side should keep minor pieces on, and if there are no active opportunities for the Rooks, allow them to be traded. The square in front of the pawn is very important as it may serve as an outpost for the opponent. If the IQP side manages to push the pawn forward and break this potential blockade it is often favorable as piece activity persists, while the weakness gets removed. This is just a brief intro to the IQP, please see some classical examples or books on strategy for more information. }
6... Nf6 7. Nc3 Qd8
{ This is probably the wisest decision. Other squares offer additional tempo gaining possibilities, for White. }
8. Bd3 Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Re1 Nc6 11. a3
{ This is a rather favorable IQP position, but it is useful for your general chess knowledge to study these structures to understand it better. I will give a typical move sequence to illustrate the dangers for Black, but further study of classical games is very beneficial, here. }
11... b6 12. Bc2 Bb7 13. Qd3 Rc8
{ This normal looking move already puts Black in grave danger. } 14. d5 exd5
{ 14... Na5 is the most resilient, but still very bad for Black. After 14... exd5 it's just over immediately. }
15. Bg5 g6 16. Rxe7 Qxe7 17. Nxd5 { And Black loses decisive material. } *

5. d4 Nf6
{ This is the main line by a mile. This follows the logic that this Knight will be best on f6 with almost 100% certainty, while the optimal position of the other Knight is not as obvious and Bishop moves makes little sense at the moment. }
6. Na3 Nc6 { With this move Black keeps the Queen on d5 as long as possible. }
7. Be3
{ Very natural play, but it is important to note that instead  7.Nb5  Qd8  8.dxc5  is less promising than it looks due to  8...Bxc5  9.Qxd8+  Kxd8  ,  and this endgame does not lead to much. It is, of course, an option if you like a quiet game, but I think 7. Be3 is objectively more promising. }
7... cxd4 8. Nb5 Qd8 9. Nbxd4 Nxd4
{ White retains a good game with simple moves. } 10. Bxd4 Be7 11. Bd3 O-O 12.
Qc2
{ And White is better both with O-O or O-O-O next. Choose according to taste. }

6. Na3 Qd8 7. Nc2
{ The Knight on c2 will recapture on d4 if Black takes this pawn. Here both   7.Nc4   and  7.Bf4  are very decent alternatives if you like to vary your play. I went for 7. Nc2 as the next moves are simple to play and yet still good for a comfortable game. We have the general development plan to go for: Bd3, O-O, Qe2, Bf4 or g5 and then centralize the Rooks. This will work pretty much regardless of what Black does. }
7... Nc6 8. Bd3 Be7 9. O-O
{ Very natural, but White does not always need to commit his King early on. I'd also like to refer you to the game Godena-Ter Sahakyan, Plovdiv 2013. In this game White delayed castling in a very similar position and managed to reach a promising position. }
9... O-O 10. Qe2 b6
{ This is seen most often, but Black has tried some other moves. I don't think we needs to examine them all, as White will go Bg5 and Rad1 anyway and be a bit better. }
11. Bg5
{ As mentioned before, this standard setup is always possible. Note that  11.dxc5  is also fine and should be slightly better for White as well. }
11... Bb7 12. Rad1 cxd4 13. Ncxd4 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Qd5
{ This is Black's most active setup. } 15. f4
{ With an interesting game. White has some attacking chances on the Kingside, but Black is quite solid. }

Bb5+
{ White does not mind trading this Bishop against his c8-counterpart or pinning the Knight on c6 if Black avoids the trade. Playing against the IQP by trading minor pieces is a fine approach. }

{ Black quickly closes the e-file before it is too late. } 9. dxc5 Nxc5 10. Be3
O-O 11. Nbd2
{ This position is roughly equal, but is easy to play with the white pieces. You go Qc2, centralize Rooks and maybe go for Bd4 and Nf1-e3, to put pressure on the IQP. Black has active pieces of course, so we cannot count on any substantial edge. }

{ This and Bd6 are of roughly equal value. Bb6 looks more principled, though, as it still connects with the d4-square. In any case White would like to trade this Bishop. This follows the general rule to trade minor pieces when playing against the IQP and gets rid of Black's better Bishop. }
11. Re1
{ Be3 is a key idea to trade the Bishop, making Re1 a very natural choice. }

{ Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c5
{ The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1. e4, on par with the classical 1... e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2. Nf3 and 3. d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5  (+)  and a delayed c3  (Alapin)  , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire. }
2. Nf3 e6
{ This is Black's third most popular move, right after 2... d6 and 2... Nc6. In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6, have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against 2... e6 we need a different approach. }
3. c3
{ My recommendation is to go 3. c3 in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to c3 on move 2 Black is committed to an early ...e6. This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system. }
3... Nf6
{ This is best in my opinion. Of course, 3... d5 is very respectable as well but I feel that White has more chances for an edge against this move. After 3... Nf6 there is no path to a White advantage, according to modern theory. }
4. e5 Nd5 5. g3
{ White's big main line is  5.d4  of course, but it is rather complicated and Black gets to choose the course of play at important junctions. My choice, 5. g3, is a rather modest move but it is easy to play and learn. If you want to sharpen up your repertoire, 5. d4 is the way to go. }
5... Nc6 { Black quickly tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn. } 6. Bg2 Qc7 7.
O-O
{ Offering the e5-pawn for excellent compensation. Black should probably decline, but we need to check the capture, of course. }
7... Nxe5
{ This is extremely risky, giving White a great initiative. Instead  7...d6  leads to similar positions as after 5... d6, the main line. }
8. Nxe5 Qxe5 9. Re1 Qd6
{ Instead ...Qf5 would leave the Queen even more exposed. } 10. Na3
{ Instead,  10.d4  is fine as well. Just open it up as White is so much ahead in development. }
10... Be7 11. Qb3 Nf6 { Essentially forced as Bxd5/Nb5 was in the air. } 12. d4
{ With excellent compensation for the pawn. } *

5... d6 6. exd6 Bxd6 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. O-O O-O 9. d4
{ White's idea, in this line, is to use the better Bishop position on g2 - better, that is, than his counterpart on c8. We will also try to make use of the Queenside pawn majority, which is often nicely supported by the g2-Bishop. }
9... cxd4 10. Nxd4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4
{ White recaptures with pieces on  d4  in order to avoid the IQP. After  11.cxd4  Black easily develops with Bd7-c6 and blockades the pawn. }
11... Qc7 12. c4
{ This is a rare move, but I like it more than the more popular  12.Nd2  ,  which is, of course, not bad either. I simply feel that I would rather have the Knight on c3 in this position. }
12... Nf6 13. Nc3 Bd7 14. Rd1 Bc5 15. Qd3 Bc6 16. Qe2 Rfd8 17. Bf4
{ This is an equal position. White will try to exploit his majority on the Queenside in the endgame. }

It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c6
{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }
2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3
{ This is the starting position of the Two Knights Variation. It used to be a favorite of Bobby Fischer, but fell out of fashion for a long time. In recent years there has been renewed interest in the line and many strong players use this variation, at least occasionally. Nowadays, top players play a lot more games than decades ago and everybody needs backup lines or systems that are not applied every single game.The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. Black has three main answers to the Two Knights that are of about equal value and popular on all levels. }
3... Bg4
{ This has been the main line for ages and was played almost exclusively in the times of Fischer and the Botvinnik-Tal matches. It has retained its solid reputation, but has lost some ground recently to the alternatives. }
4. h3
{ Recently the alternative  4.d4  has been played as well. This is also a good option for varying your play. The main difference between this, and our choice of h3, is that we force a decision immediately about whether Black wants to keep his Bishop  (risky)  or stay solid, taking on f3 but giving up the Bishop pair. }
4... Bh5
{ This is actually a somewhat dubious line, but it is still played quite frequently as it leads to difficult positions in which White may go wrong. If White knows what to do Black will be the one in trouble. }
5. exd5
{ This initiates a forced sequence aimed at playing against the soon-to-be offside Bishop on g6. }
5... cxd5 6. Bb5+ Nc6 7. g4 Bg6 8. Ne5 Rc8
{ This is almost forced, as  8...Qd6  already puts Black in danger of suffering a drastic loss. }
9. d4 e6 { The most logical and best move. } 10. Qe2
{ White has an important choice here. We may play 10. Qe2, as I recommend, or go for 10. h4. The move   10.h4  after  10...f6 !  11.Nxg6  hxg6  12.Qd3  Kf7  13.Bxc6  Rxc6  14.Bd2  leads to a complicated middlegame where Black's chances are not worse. It is interesting, though, so if you dislike my long main line that leads to an edge for White, this is worth checking out. I recommend 10. Qe2 !  (because it is objectively better, but the arising positions are maybe not to everybody's taste, so mentioning an alternative seems like a good idea. Please check the dedicated chapter for more information.) }

4... Bxf3 5. Qxf3
{ So after just 5 moves we have a long term asset: the pair of Bishops. This is nice, but the position is closed at the moment and Black's setup is very sound with e7-e6 to come. It is very important to understand that pushing e4-e5, in these sets of lines, is rarely a good idea as White is not well equipped to hold that pawn centre. Black will push c6-c5 and Knights on d7 and c6 put pressure on the central pawn. Our Knight is misplaced on c3 for that scenario and we don't have the pawn move c2-c3 to support d4. So be very careful with this advance; it is almost always bad. }
5... e6
{ Black's main moves here are  5...Nf6  and 5... e6. These two moves have some subtle differences depending on the setup that White goes for. I have selected a line where it makes no difference whether Black starts with the pawn or the Knight. }
6. Be2
{ A good alternative against the 5... e6 move order is   6.d4.  I am going for 6. Be2 instead as this is playable against both 5... Nf6 and 5... e6, so we reduce the amount of theory to learn. That being said, going for 6. d4 setups is a worthy alternative to explore if you'd like to expand your repertoire. }
6... Nf6 7. O-O { With a transposition to 5... Nf6. } 7... Be7
{ The main move, modestly preparing to castle. } 8. Rd1
{ This is quite ambitious as White wants to play d2-d4 comfortably. It allows 8... d4, though, which might not be to everybody's taste, as the Rook is clearly not optimally placed in this pawn structure. It is still interesting to play, so I choose to give it as the main line. If you dislike it, you may also go   8.d4  , but after  8...dxe4  you need to play  9.Qe3  and recapture on e4 later. This basically loses a tempo, compared to 8. Rd1, if Black chooses not to push 8... d4. This tempo is not terribly important though... Go 8. d4 if you don't like allowing Black to push d5-d4. It is easy to play. }
8... d4 9. Nb1
{ This leads to a complicated strategic battle. I also analysed the wild  9.e5  Nfd7  10.Qg3  , but it was a bit to complicated for the purposes of this repertoire. But it is very interesting to analyze, so go ahead, if you are after some unusual complications. }
9... O-O
{ It is not so easy to analyze a position of this type, as the opponent has many possible moves, and play is not forcing at all. However, I think that Black playing c6-c5 to go Nc6 makes a lot of sense, so this is my main line. }
10. a4 { 10.d3  first will lead to the same thing. } 10... c5 11. Na3 Nc6 12.
d3
{ White's idea is to play f4 and expand on the Kingside. It will be a complicated game with most pieces still left on the board. }

8... O-O
{ The routine move by Black, but it allows us to reach an optimal version of d2-d4. }
9. d4 dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Qxe4
{ We have reached the standard comfortable position from the Two Knights, with the Bishop pair and some space advantage. Note that White often plays modestly with c2-c3, not weakening d4 early on. You can always play it to c4 later, according to circumstances. There are many ways to reach this structure and piece distribution. I recommend to study the sample game played between Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Alexander Riazantsev in Doha 2016. It is an excellent showcase on how to handle these situations. }

3... Nf6
{ This is the move of recent years. It offers Black a bit more excitement compared to the other options, but White has no reason to complain about the complex positions either. }
4. e5 Ne4 5. Ne2
{ Not the most obvious move, maybe, but it is the most testing choice. This prepares play against the Knight on e4 by going d2-d3 without allowing the capture on c3. Also note that with a closed structure it is useful to have c3 later, to support the centre. The Knight will also do a good job on the Kingside, as we will see. }
5... Qb6
{ Threatening Mate in one ! The main point is that White is forced to go 6. d4 to cover this threat, and in turn loses the option of d2-d3 to kick the Knight away. }
6. d4 e6 7. Ng3
{ This looks very normal, but usually  7.Nfg1 !?  is viewed as the critical line. I do agree, this is a test for Black, but I didn't find all that much for White in these lines. Considering that it is a huge effort to learn and understand everything there, I checked the more natural move 7. Ng3 and decided to go with that. It does not lead to an objective advantage, but it is a good practical decision. }
7... c5 8. c3 Nc6 9. Bd3
{ Forcing some action by the e4-Knight. Black will have to trade on g3 or allow a transformation in the centre. }
9... Nxg3 10. hxg3 cxd4 11. cxd4 Bd7 12. Kf1
{ This is important to remember. This sidestep actually protects the d4-pawn, as we will see. With the h-file open we don't need to castle, anyway. }
12... Nxd4 13. Be3 Bc5 14. Rc1
{ White threatens Rxc5 with a winning position - Black is helpless against this idea. In this particular situation   14.b4  Qxb4  15.Bxd4  Bxd4  16.Rh4 !  would also win, but it is good to remember this Rc1 idea as it might happen in similar cases where b4 is not available, like after 12... h6 13. g4, where the 4th rank is blocked and Rh4 at the end is not effective anymore. }

{ This is the move currently preferred by the top players. It looks a bit strange, but it has some interesting points, as we will see. That being said, just taking on f6 with the Knight is also fine, of course. }
5... Nxe4
{ The most popular move. Black keeps his pawn structure sound and simplifies a bit. You will win games with  5...Nbd7  6.Nd6#  (MATE !)  (, not only in Blitz - look forward to it.) }
6. Qxe4 Nd7
{ Black also plays  6...Qd5  here, after which  7.Qf4  avoids the Queen trade for the moment. After 6... Nd7 we need to remember one idea to keep an advantage. }
7. Bc4 { An important nuance in move order, as we will see. } 7... Nf6 8. Ne5
{ This Zwischenzug forces a concession. } 8... e6 9. Qe2
{ White is slightly better here with more space and a nicely placed Knight on e5. }

It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... c6
{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }
2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3
{ This is the starting position of the Two Knights Variation. It used to be a favorite of Bobby Fischer, but fell out of fashion for a long time. In recent years there has been renewed interest in the line and many strong players use this variation, at least occasionally. Nowadays, top players play a lot more games than decades ago and everybody needs backup lines or systems that are not applied every single game.The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. Black has three main answers to the Two Knights that are of about equal value and popular on all levels. }
3... dxe4
{ This is the most natural move, intending to reach the typical Caro-Kann pawn structure right away. This option is quite popular on the club level and involves some pitfalls that Black quite freqently falls for. }
4. Nxe4 Bf5
{ Yes, this natural move is somewhat dubious - still, it is played very frequently as most Caro-Kann players have 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 in their repertoires, so going Bf5 here as well looks very useful. Let's check why Bf5 is questionable here. }
5. Ng3 Bg6
{ Instead 5... Bg4 is objectively better but rarely played. If Black intended to play ...Bg4, he would have done so one or two moves earlier. After 5... Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 we get a position similar to 3... Bg4, enjoying the Bishop pair. }
6. h4 h6 7. Ne5 Bh7 { After this it is basically over. } 8. Qh5 g6 9. Qf3
{ Instead, the attractive  9.Bc4  is also very favorable for White. We are spoilt for choice at this point  ! }
9... Nf6 10. Qb3 { The point: a deadly double attack. } 10... Qd5 11. Qxb7
Qxe5+ 12. Be2
{ And Black has no way to save his Rook on a8. However, there is one line where knowing an important point is necessary. }
12... e6 13. a4
{ Not intuitive at all, but it is very strong. If White grabs the Rook immediately, with  13.Qxa8  , Black has  13...Qc7 !  and it will be very tricky to get the Queen out.  13. a4 ! actually prepares for this scenario by intending to play the pawn up to a6 and then go Qb7. In addition, Black now has problems finding a move without serious drawbacks. For example,   13...Be7  does not prepare O-O, as then e7 would hang.   13...Bd6  simply allows  14.Qxa8  without any problems. }
13... Bc5
{ This also leads to a lost position, but it is at least somewhat messy. } 14.
c3 O-O 15. d4 Bxd4 16. cxd4 Qa5+ 17. Bd2 Qb6 18. Qxb6 axb6 19. Bxh6
{ And White is winning. Note how bad the h7-Bishop is. } *

It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5
{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice.  The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after, for example after   3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5.  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvers that Black will most likely know better than we do.  Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines - 3. Nc3, 3. Nd2, 3. e5 - the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3. Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion.Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail. They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks.So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4. Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well.  The main alternatives are 4. Bd3 and 4. c4, aiming for IQP play. The drawback of the immediate 4. c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  ,  which is fine for him. We play 4. Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment, in particular after 4... Bd6 we go 5. c4 - this way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.   Let's have a look at  4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5  - note the similarities to our idea to play 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. c4 -   or the simpler  4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4-pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive   and  5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4. Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later. In general, a Black setup with Nc6, Bd6, Nge7 and Bf5 or Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems.  After 4. Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Bd6 { Against Bd6 we go for the IQP with } 5. c4 dxc4
{ A bit of a concession, but it is not terrible for Black. } 6. Bxc4 Nf6
{ This position is reached quite often via a totally different move order, starting with the Queen's Gambit Accepted  !  1.d4  d5  2.c4  dxc4  3.e3  e5  4.Bxc4  exd4  5.exd4  Nf6  6.Nf3  Bd6  are the concrete moves. }
7. Qe2+
{ This is a very important idea that makes this line more attractive, for White. There is nothing wrong with just developing with  7.Nc3  - and in fact this is part of our repertoire after 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 dxc4 7. Bxc4, but the Queen check is tougher to meet for Black. }
7... Qe7
{ This is more natural compared to Be7, but White retains an unpleasant pull. }
8. Qxe7+
{ Why does White trade pieces when having the IQP ? Isn't that a weird way to play ? The reasoning, here, is that the arising position is not so well coordinated for Black, and tough to organize. Looking at some moves will show the issues that Black faces. }
8... Bxe7
{ This way Black keeps castling rights, but he has lost time with the Bishop and will lose even more time. }
9. O-O O-O 10. Re1 Bd6 11. Nc3 a6
{ Stopping Nb5, but allowing very fluent development for White. } 12. Bg5 Nbd7
13. Ne5 Nb6 14. Bb3
{ White is in good shape here and has easy moves to play. The pressure on f7 is very annoying to handle for Black. }

Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Bd6 { This is one of Black's tries to reach the Ne7/Bf5 trade. } 5. c4 Nf6
{ Probably the most natural move. You will also encounter  5...Ne7 ??  , which allows  6.c5  , winning the Bishop. }
6. Nc3 dxc4 7. Bxc4
{ This position is very similar to 5. c4 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Nf6 when I recommend 7. Qe2+ !. If White plays 7. Nc3 instead we would reach exactly the same situation here. So in some way 5... Nf6 6. Nc3 is a more precise move order by Black. That being said, White still has chances to play for an advantage. }
7... O-O 8. O-O Nc6
{ This is actually quite an important move for Black. It sounds a bit weird, maybe, but other setups seem to be problematic for him. One frequently seen issue is  8...Bg4  9.h3  Bh5  10.g4 !  , which is very good for White. }
9. h3
{ This is a very useful move, preventing Bg4, now that White can no longer answer Bg4 with the mechanism of h3/g4/Ne5 due to Black's increased control over e5, after he played Nc6. }
9... h6 { Black also fears Bg5, so he answers in symmetrical fashion. } 10. Qc2
{ I think this is interesting because of the attacking ideas shown below. The lines after 10. Qc2 go exceptionally deep for this repertoire, but they were interesting to explore, so I decided to include them. Again, if you don't feel like going there:   10.Re1  or any other active move is fine. }
10... Nb4 11. Qb1 c6
{ This normal looking move allows White to realize his attacking idea connected to Qc2. Instead   11...Be6  stops the sacrifice at the cost of some structural damage. }
12. Bxh6
{ Computers evaluate this as equal at the end, but White has all the fun. }
12... gxh6 13. Qg6+ Kh8 14. Qxh6+ Nh7 15. Ne4 Be7 16. Ne5
{ Black is under huge pressure. Engines find their way around this, but it is very unpleasant for humans to play Black. }

6. Nc3 O-O
{ A clever move order by Black. Now simply going  7.Bd3  leads nowhere, so White is more or less forced to take on d5.   7.c5  is playable by the way, but I don't like to advance while still being underdeveloped. 7. cxd5 also does not develop immediately, but it frees c4 for the Bishop and Black will have to spend time getting the pawn back. }
7. cxd5
{ We will try to hang on to this pawn ! This is not so much due to the idea that an extra pawn is useful, but more because d4 and d5 control some good squares. }
7... Nbd7 8. Bg5
{ This is played in accordance with the 'Keep it simple' approach. Instead, 8. Bc4 is interesting to check as well. After   8.Bc4  (the move we would like to play for sure !)  Black goes  8...Re8+  9.Be3  Ng4  and these complications are unexplored territory that you might want to analyze. }
8... h6 9. Bh4 Nb6 10. Be2 Be7 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. Qb3

12... a5 { Trying to provoke 13. a4 probably makes sense for Black. } 13. O-O

13... a4 14. Qb5 Bd7 15. Qd3 Ra5 16. b4 axb3 17. axb3 Rxa1 18. Rxa1

Nf3 Bd6 5. c4 -   or the simpler  4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4-pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive   and  5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4. Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later. In general, a Black setup with Nc6, Bd6, Nge7 and Bf5 or Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems.  After 4. Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Bd6 { This is one of Black's tries to reach the Ne7/Bf5 trade. } 5. c4 Nf6
{ Probably the most natural move. You will also encounter  5...Ne7 ??  , which allows  6.c5  , winning the Bishop. }
6. Nc3 c6 { A solid choice, simply covering the d5-pawn. } 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O
dxc4 9. Bxc4
{ Compared to 5. c4 dxc4 or 5... Nf6 6. Nc3 dxc4 Black is a full tempo up, but he has spent it on ...c6, which is quite passive in this setup. }
9... Bg4
{ As usual this is not advisable if Black does not have enough control over e5. }
10. h3 Bh5 11. g4 Bg6 12. Ne5
{ With f4-f5 ideas. Black is struggling here already. } *

It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5
{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice.  The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after, for example after   3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5.  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvers that Black will most likely know better than we do.  Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines - 3. Nc3, 3. Nd2, 3. e5 - the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3. Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion.Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail. They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks.So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4. Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well.  The main alternatives are 4. Bd3 and 4. c4, aiming for IQP play. The drawback of the immediate 4. c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  ,  which is fine for him. We play 4. Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment, in particular after 4... Bd6 we go 5. c4 - this way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.   Let's have a look at  4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5  - note the similarities to our idea to play 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. c4 -   or the simpler  4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4-pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive   and  5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4. Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later. In general, a Black setup with Nc6, Bd6, Nge7 and Bf5 or Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems.  After 4. Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Nc6
{ This is an ambitious move, often used to unbalance the game. Black has the already mentioned setup with ...Bd6 and ...Nge7 in mind. }
5. Bb5
{ This is the only testing move. White needs to have something concrete against Bd6/Nge7. A lame move like   5.Bd3  Bg4  leads nowhere. }
5... Bd6 { The most natural move, sticking to the initial plan of Bd6/Nge7. }
6. c4
{ This is one point of the Bb5 sortie. This move initiates an almost forced sequence of moves that leads to a very unconventional pawn structure. }
6... dxc4 7. d5 a6 8. Ba4 b5 9. dxc6 bxa4 10. O-O Ne7
{ This sequence is almost forced after 6. c4 dxc4. It's a rather uncommon pawn formation with Black's Queenside completely shattered - he's got an extra pawn, though, that White still needs to recover, and the Bishop pair. This, however, is quite often just a short-lived point as Nd2-c4xd6 is a common idea. }
11. Nbd2
{ This is not yet very popular, but it is better than  11.Qxa4.  I think that White retains a small edge after this move. It is nothing special, but the kind of position you will win sometimes and should never lose. }
11... O-O 12. Nxc4 Nxc6 13. Qxa4 Bb7 14. Rd1
{ This natural move is a novelty. White simply intends to take on d6 with a comfortable pull. }
14... Ne7 15. Nd4 { 15.Nxd6 ?!  Bxf3  should be avoided. } 15... Bc5
{ The cold-blooded engine move, not worried about Knight discoveries. } 16. Be3
{ White is slightly better again. We have the better structure and Black will most likely not be able to keep the Bishop pair. }

This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well.  The main alternatives are 4. Bd3 and 4. c4, aiming for IQP play.

Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Bg4
{ Probably Black's most ambitious move. Black has Queenside castling in mind, but after White's best reply Black is struggling. }
5. h3 Bh5
{ The only logical option. Taking on f3 just gives up the Bishop pair and there is no other decent square to retreat to. }
6. Qe2+
{ This is what I referred to as 'concrete play'. This disruptive check is the reason why 4... Bg4 is considered risky for Black. }
6... Qe7
{ Not the most natural looking move, but the alternatives are worse.  6...Ne7  7.g4 !  Bg6  8.Nc3  is bad for Black  (How to develop ?)   and  6...Be7  7.Qb5+  loses a pawn for insufficient compensation. }
7. Be3
{ This avoids the Queen trade and prepares O-O-O. White is better here due to the edge on the Kingside, with g4 to come. }
7... Nc6 8. Nc3 O-O-O 9. g4 Bg6 10. O-O-O
{ This is the position that arises most often after 4... Bg4, if White goes for the most critical line, like we do. Now Black has tried some moves that we need to check briefly. }
10... Nf6 { This simply ignores White's idea to play Ne5. } 11. Ne5 Nxe5
{ Of course Black should not take, but I'd like to show the idea. Better is  11...Qe6  12.Bg2  , limiting the damage to 'just' an advantage for White. }
12. dxe5 Qxe5 13. f4 Qe8 14. f5 { And White wins a piece and the game. } *

{ Very natural play, but Black gives up on the mentioned idea to play a later Ne7 and Bf5. In this symmetrical line Black stays very solid, but we can still pose problems. }
5. Bd3
{ Here  5.c4  is again answered by  5...Bb4+  , which is fine for Black. } 5...
Be7
{ Placing the Bishop on e7 means that any unpleasant checks on the e-file are avoided, but quite often Black will move the piece again to d6 after all. Against these Be7 setups I recommend playing with a standard setup of O-O/Bg5/Nbd2/c3 and Qc2 in most cases. It is important to mention that White should play these moves first and avoid an early Re1. We will see in the main line why this natural move should be played only later. Another key point is that Black will play Bg4, after which we should not play h3, as Bh5 is useful for Black as trading the Bishops with Bg6 is part of Black's agenda. }
6. O-O O-O
{ Black may also start with  6...Bg4  , but it will transpose after our standard reply of  7.Bg5  and Nbd2. }
7. Bg5
{ This should be played first, keeping Re1 until it is better timed. We'll see in a couple of moves why saving this move is important. I would also like to mention that   7.h3  is a very decent alternative, but Black may also start with 5... Bg4 6. O-O Be7 and we would need to transpose to 7. Bg5, anyway. So we go for a line that is usable against all Be7 setups and this means that we don't need to learn two separate lines. }
7... Bg4 { Very natural and the most popular by far. } 8. Nbd2 Nbd7 9. c3 c6
10. Qc2
{ This is the position that shows why it is useful to delay Re1 in favor of quick Queenside development. Now Black is not able to play ...Bd6 or ...Qc7, copying White's setup. }
10... Re8 11. Rfe1
{ Inserting the Rook move has not helped Black. There is still no obvious constructive move, as Bd6 and Qc7 fail to Bxh7+. }
11... h6 12. Bf4 Nh5
{ Otherwise, White goes h3 and Re3, doubling on the e-file with nagging pressure. }
13. Be5
{ This was played in Vishy Anand - Hou Yifan, Isle of Man 2017. White obtained a typical edge and managed to win a fine game. }

5. Bd3
{ Here  5.c4  is again answered by  5...Bb4+  , which is fine for Black. } 5...
Bd6
{ This symmetrical move is certainly the most principled one. Black claims that copying White's moves will equalize, as there is little tension in the position. Logic tells you that he is probably correct in this assumption, but we will see that there are some problems for Black to solve. I think that White can play for an edge in some cases, in others it's just equal with almost zero losing chances. }
6. Qe2+

1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5
{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice.  The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after, for example after   3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5.  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvers that Black will most likely know better than we do.  Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines - 3. Nc3, 3. Nd2, 3. e5 - the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3. Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion.Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail. They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks.So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4. Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well.  The main alternatives are 4. Bd3 and 4. c4, aiming for IQP play. The drawback of the immediate 4. c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  ,  which is fine for him. We play 4. Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment, in particular after 4... Bd6 we go 5. c4 - this way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.   Let's have a look at  4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5  - note the similarities to our idea to play 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. c4 -   or the simpler  4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4-pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive   and  5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4. Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later. In general, a Black setup with Nc6, Bd6, Nge7 and Bf5 or Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems.  After 4. Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Nf6
{ Very natural play, but Black gives up on the mentioned idea to play a later Ne7 and Bf5. In this symmetrical line Black stays very solid, but we can still pose problems. }
5. Bd3
{ Here  5.c4  is again answered by  5...Bb4+  , which is fine for Black. } 5...
Bd6
{ This symmetrical move is certainly the most principled one. Black claims that copying White's moves will equalize, as there is little tension in the position. Logic tells you that he is probably correct in this assumption, but we will see that there are some problems for Black to solve. I think that White can play for an edge in some cases, in others it's just equal with almost zero losing chances. }
6. Qe2+
{ This move poses the most problems for Black. Without this check White's opening would be rather toothless, as Black would equalize by simply copying everything. }
6... Qe7
{ This is the most popular move, but it is actually the easiest to play against. White keeps a nagging edge. }
7. Qxe7+ Bxe7 8. Bf4 { This is very awkward to meet. } 8... c6 9. O-O O-O 10.
Re1
{ This position is just very uncomfortable for Black to play. White is quicker on the e-file and has easy moves to increase the pressure. It is not necessary to analyze a maze of lines here. Let's look at a good sample game for some moves. }
10... Re8 11. Nbd2
{ This is the strongest move here. I have played  11.h3  in a recent league game, which also led to a nice position, but Bg4 is not worth preventing. }
11... Bg4 12. Ne5 Be6 13. Nb3 a5 14. Nc5 Bxc5 15. dxc5 Nbd7 16. Nxd7 Bxd7 17.
f3
{ White was clearly better in Magnus Carlsen - Georg Meier, Pro Chess League Rapid. }

1... d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e5
{ This is the modern way to reach the closed Philidor's Defence. There are move order issues with the tradional 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6, as examined in this Quickstarter. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }
4. Nf3
{ Trading on e5 and exchanging Queens is not very dangerous for Black. The King in the centre is no huge issue with Queens traded. Instead, we will simply put pressure on e5 by developing naturally.A general, important point: Taking on e5, later, is only good if there is a very concrete reason for it, like material gains or a very favorable piece trade etc. d4 is a better pawn than d6 - it is not an equal trade. Also, note that the f8-Bishop will benefit enormously from trading as well.Another important point is that ...c6, by Black, should always be answered with a4, stopping ...b5 advances. Just allowing Black to expand on the Queenside is usually not a good idea. }
4... Nbd7 5. Bc4
{ The Bishop is best placed on this diagonal, eyeing the f7-pawn. } 5... Be7
{ The most popular move by a mile. Black prepares castling, which is very sensible play. }
6. O-O O-O 7. Re1 { Universally useful to support the centre. } 7... c6 8. a4
{ No huge bonus points for guessing that one. b7-b5 has to be prevented. Now Black has tried many moves, and studying these lines is actually a bit tricky because the move orders are flexible for Black. Moves like Qc7, Re8, h6, a5, b6 can be played in many permutations.In fact, we need to distinguish between two different Black approaches here. The first one is to continue to hold the centre with moves like h6/Re8/Qc7, and still try to play for b5 ultimately, with b7-b6,a7-a6 as preparatory moves. The second approach is to take on d4 and initiate concrete play. This intention is usually signalled by the move 8... a5, which secures c5 for the d7-Knight after a subsequent capture. If Black goes for the slow waiting game of Plan 1 we should keep the central tension and improve our central support with moves like Ba2 and h3. Moving the Knight to f5 is an important idea as well. Plan 2 requires more concrete play, as we will see. }
8... a5
{ This is usually the start of the exd4 plan. With ...a5 Black gives up on playing ...b5 and instead secures the c5 square for the Knight, after capturing on d4. }
9. Ba2 h6
{ Combining ....a5 with waiting is not so common. Our play is quite standard for waiting game setups. }
10. h3 Re8 11. Be3 Qc7 12. Qd2
{ A good move, but instead,  12.Qe2   or  12.Nd2  , improving central support, is also fine.   Note that  12.Nh4 ?!  is not that promising here as f5 is covered after the reply  12...Nf8. }
12... Nf8 13. Rad1 { White must be somewhat better here. } 13... Be6
{ This is not that great, but it is instructive to see why. } 14. d5 Bd7 15.

11... Nxe4

14. Nd6 Qc7
{ After this, instead of being clearly worse, Black loses immediately. } 15.

{ This is the Pirc Defence. Black allows White to take space in the centre and gives us a wide choice of setups. }
4. Be3
{ Against the Pirc and Modern I recommend a dangerous sideline that will often catch Black players unawares. I think this line, involving Be3 and h3, is a serious test for Black's cause anyway, so an unprepared Black player might struggle with his defensive task quite quickly. White still keeps his options open regarding pawn structures, but most of the time White will play with f2-f4, after having seen Black's setup. Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3.It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that playing Be3 first makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. }
4... c6
{ Black delays Bg7 because he expects White to go for Qd2 and Bh6. In this case he would save a tempo. This is one of the upsides of a flexible move like Be3. We still have many options and Black needs to take these into account and sometimes will play against ideas that are not that high on our agenda in the first place. 4... c6 is a good idea against the mentioned Qd2 idea, but less valuable versus a setup with f2-f4. }

Against f4-based setups this strike is often the right recipe, for instance after  1.e4  d6  2.d4  Nf6  3.Nc3  g6  4.f4  Bg7  5.Nf3  the move  5...c5 !  has the best theoretical reputation.

It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... g6
{ This is the 'Modern Defence'. I always felt this is one of the weirdest opening names. Will it still be called like that in 50 years time ? Anyway, let's look at the actual moves.The main difference between this opening and the Pirc Defence is that Black does not put his Knight on f6 early on. This makes a difference in many ways. One important point is that White is not able to operate with an early Be3/Qd2/Bh6 manoeuver. Black also retains the option of developing the Knight to e7, or even h6 in some cases. The downside of Black's game is clearly the lack of development and neglect of central control.Against the Modern, we will opt for a similar setup as against the Pirc. Note that whenever Black plays Nf6 in the next few moves we will transpose to the Pirc. }
2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3
{ We are using the same setup as against the Pirc. Quite often, a quick ...Nf6 by Black will indeed transpose to the Pirc. In general, the whole complex with d6/g6 is full of transpositions. Don't be too intimidated by this fact - White has a strong centre and will have at least a decent position with common sense moves. }
4... Nd7 5. f4
{ And we will transpose after Black goes ...a6 or ...c6. Nd7 has little independent value. One setup, that may occur via various move orders, is the Hippopotamus  (or just Hippo)  , which involves e6/d6, Knights to d7 and e7 and a Queens Bishop Fianchetto. Let's have a look at this via the 4... Nd7 move order, though Black might also start with ...e6, a6, b6 etc. - it is more of a setup than a concrete line. }
5... e6 6. Nf3 Ne7 7. Bd3
{ This is the setup that White should go for against the Hippo. We build a strong centre and support it with the Bishops. }
7... b6 8. O-O Bb7 9. f5
{ In this concrete position f4-f5 is already quite strong. Note that Black may go for different move orders, so you are not guaranteed to get precisely this on the board. But against the Hippo this is a standard idea. Another plan might be Qe1-h4, especially if Black has started with an earlier Kingside build-up and castled already. }
9... exf5 10. exf5 O-O 11. Qd2
{ And White has good attacking chances on the Kingside. } *

4... c6
{ Preparing either b7-b5 or Qb6. This move allows us to gain lots of central space. }
5. f4
{ The move h2-h3 is only useful when a Knight, on f6, is threatening to jump to g4, harassing our Bishop. So we might as well push f2-f4 immediately after Black has declared his intentions to play somewhat passively, with c7-c6. }
5... b5
{ A good point to know is that after  5...Qb6  here or in similar situations the move  6.a3 !  is a good reply. It tactically covers b2, as  6...Qxb2  7.Na4  wins the Queen. The move a3 is more useful than Rb1 to cover the pawn. }
6. a3
{ A tempo worth spending. Black's slow setup gives White enough time to play this. Our setup involves a future Nf3, Bd3 and probably e4-e5, pushing in the centre. }
6... Nd7 7. Nf3

1... d5
{ The Scandinavian is quite popular at club level, but not seen frequently in top events. What is the reason ? Well, the top players usually just want to force a draw with Black or, in some concrete cases, play for a win if the tournament situation demands it. The Scandinavian is unsuitable for either scenario: Black will often simply get a position that is just very slightly worse and that cannot be immediately drawn by some forced line. On the other hand it is not particularly suited for drumming up some crazy complications, either. An additional issue is that Black will give up the Bishop pair, frequently, which is an important factor for strong players.These considerations are not as relevant at club level where Black will usually get a playable, if slightly worse position, without much learning effort. With White we will get a comfortable position against the Scandinavian most of the time, but don't expect too large of an advantage - Black's structure is quite solid. }
2. exd5 Nf6
{ Black intends to capture on d5 with the Knight  (most of the time)   . Now  3.c4  keeps the pawn but Black has  3...c6   and even  3...e6  , both interesting gambit style moves.  The main move is, of course, 3. d4, but I think my suggestion 3. Bb5+ is just a bit better for White and avoids the murky   3.d4  Bg4 !?  lines. Let's have a look. }
3. Bb5+
{ A disturbing check. In this line all you need to know is that White will retreat the Bishop to e2 soon and then go for a setup with c4,d4, Nc3,Nf3,O-O and often h2-h3 to prevent any Bg4 ideas. White is always slightly better with this pawn centre. }

2. exd5 Qxd5
{ I think this is probably better than  2...Nf6.  Against the Knight move White gets a slightly better position without any effort at all. }
3. Nc3
{ The most natural and probably best move. It has one drawback: White places the Knight in front of the c-pawn, so White does not manage to get the d4/c4 pawn duo early on - compare with 2... Nf6. I always had some interest in   3.Nf3  ,  trying to delay Nb1-c3 until White has played c2-c4 first. However, nowadays this approach seems to be defanged by  3...Bg4  4.Be2  Nc6  etc. as also demonstrated in John Bartholomew's Scandinavian Repertoire on Chessable.  After 3. Nc3 Black has a choice of Queen moves. We will play with d2-d4 and Nf3 against all of them, in most cases followed by Bc4. A common theme is that Black develops with Bg4 or Bf5, against which we will often try to play with Kingside expansion. }
3... Qd6
{ This move enjoyed some sparks of popularity some years ago, but White seems to have worked out what to do by now. The most popular Queen moves to a5 and d8 are covered in the following two chapters. }
4. d4 Nf6
{ Black sometimes starts with 4... c6 or 4... a6, but Nf6 will be played soon, so these don't have any independent value. }
5. Nf3
{ After 5. Nf3 Black has a wide choice. Unfortunately, there is no simple recipe that we can use against all of them. Let's have a look at the details for each Black try. }
5... a6 6. Bd3
{ Not very intuitive to me, but experience and the engines suggest it is the strongest move. A closer inspection shows why it is good. White intends to play Ne4 soon, which would be in particular effective against   6...b5. }
6... Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. O-O Nc6 9. Ne4
{ The key idea, trading the unimpressive Knight on c3 for his vital colleague on f6. }
9... Nxe4 10. Bxe4
{ White now has a great piece on e4 and is able to support the centre with c3 if necessary. This also prepares a swift attack with b4 after a likely Queenside castling by Black. }

6. Bc4
{ The most active square for the Bishop. Note that against early Bf5 moves we go Ne5, intending Bc4 and g4. If Black delays the Bishop move to f5 we should start with Bc4, as the immediate   6.Ne5  may be answered with 6  ...Be6  ,  as played by Anand vs Kasparov in the only ever World Championship game that started with the Scandinavian. This line seems to be less challenging for Black, in my opinion. }

It is such a great game that I needed to mention it, even though I'd rather recommend a different move at this point. Anand's choice leads to very sharp play where 'Keep it Simple' does not really apply, but maybe once you looked at the game you want to give it a try, anyway ? }
12... Bd5 13. Nxd5 cxd5 14. Bd3 Bd6 15. Bd2 Qc7 16. Qf3
{ We need to cover f4, preventing Bf4 by Black. I prefer White here, but it is quite clearly a complicated position. Don't be afraid of the seemingly open position of our King. Black does not have any attacking pieces to threaten us directly, so it is not particularly risky. That being said, it's not like being completely safe as in a typical castling scenario. }

From our White perspective it is nothing to complain about either - we have preserved a small edge. }

Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... Nf6 { My choice against the Alekhine is to play } 2. e5
{ This must be best, but I need to mention that I checked  2.Nc3  as well. The main reason to consider this alternative is that we play the position after 2... e5 3. Nf3 anyway, arising from the Petroff/Russian Defence move order. However, the issue is  2...d5  , after which I don't see anything too promising. You can investigate  3.e5  , but after  3...Nfd7  I didn't see anything better than to allow a transposition into the French Defence - and this is a line we don't have in our repertoire. Long story short - just push the e-pawn ! }
2... Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4
{ Theoreticians usually view  4.Nf3  as the critical move, and I agree. The practical problem behind 4. Nf3 is that Black chooses the defensive setup, so you need to be prepared for a wide range of lines. In the 'Playing 1. e4' book by John Shaw the author devotes a huge chunk of the book to fighting the Alekhine's with this line, but I don't think it is very practical to learn all the details when you will get the Alekhine's once in a blue moon. Our choice still carries some punch while being easier to learn. }
4... Nb6 5. exd6
{ White has good chances for an edge with this line while being reasonable in terms of study time. It still puts some considerable pressure on Black without being overly theoretical. Now Black has a very fundamental choice between recapturing with either c-pawn or e-pawn. There is a general consensus that taking with the e-pawn is solid for Black, but White usually should have a slight pull. On the other hand, taking with the c-pawn is sharper, but has been under a cloud for quite a while due to a certain setup that we will investigate soon. I think this is actually quite playable for Black, but White can still pose some serious problems, of course. Let's have a look. }

{ The solid, conservative move. The symmetrical structure should be a little bit better for White, as we have more space and the more active pieces. A way to view this position type is to call it a Petroff/Russian Defence structure with Black's Knight being slightly offside on b6. }
6. Nc3
{ Our setup includes Nc3/ Bd3/Nge2. The main point of this setup is to make Black's c8-Bishop look a bit silly. Black usually tries to pin the f3-Knight with Bg4, so we avoid Nf3 completely. The Nge2-based setup has some more concrete ideas that we will investigate now. }
6... Be7
{ The most popular move, preparing to castle. Instead  6...Nc6  will often just transpose to the same positions. }
7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Nge2
{ Instead,  8.Be3  would transpose to the lines we looked at via 6... Nc6 7. Be3. Keeping the Bishop flexible is even more promising for White here. }
8... Bg4
{ A key idea is to realize is that  8...Nb4  is met by  9.Bb1 !  , keeping the Bishop. Black can't take with  9...Nxc4 ??  due to  10.Qa4+. }
9. Be3
{ Protecting the d4-pawn, which was just attacked, due to the pin on the e2-Knight. }
9... O-O { Again  9...Nb4 ?  10.Bb1  is strong for White. } 10. b3
{ This is an important finesse. Alternatives don't convince as much:  10.f3  is not so great because of  10...Bh4+  , disrupting White's setup.   Instead,  10.O-O  allows  10...Nb4  , as  11.Bb1  is not working now - Black just takes on c4. }
10... Bf6 11. O-O Re8 12. h3 Bh5 13. Qd2
{ Unpinning the Knight and threatening to go Ne2-f4, netting the Bishop pair. }
13... Bg6 14. d5 Ne5 15. Bxg6 Nxg6 16. Ng3
{ White enjoys a very easy game. We have more space and ideas to push the f-pawn. This whole line with exd6 promises White a small, but very comfortable edge. The game Gelashvili-Berkes, Minsk 2017 is our sample game for this line and well worth studying to better understand how this variation is played properly. }

1. e4
{ Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves ! }
1... Nf6
{ One of the most original openings - Alekhine's Defence. It is actually not easy at all to get an edge against this provocative move that aims to lure the White central pawns forward in order to attack them later. }
2. e5
{ This must be best, but I need to mention that I checked  2.Nc3  as well. The main reason to consider this alternative is that we play the position after 2... e5 3. Nf3 anyway, arising from the Petroff/Russian Defence move order. However, the issue is  2...d5  , after which I don't see anything too promising. You can investigate  3.e5  , but after  3...Nfd7  I didn't see anything better than to allow a transposition into the French Defence - and this is a line we don't have in our repertoire. Long story short - just push the e-pawn ! }
2... Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4
{ Theoreticians usually view  4.Nf3  as the critical move, and I agree. The practical problem behind 4. Nf3 is that Black chooses the defensive setup, so you need to be prepared for a wide range of lines. In the 'Playing 1. e4' book by John Shaw the author devotes a huge chunk of the book to fighting the Alekhine's with this line, but I don't think it is very practical to learn all the details when you will get the Alekhine's once in a blue moon. Our choice still carries some punch while being easier to learn. }
4... Nb6 5. exd6
{ White has good chances for an edge with this line while being reasonable in terms of study time. It still puts some considerable pressure on Black without being overly theoretical. Now Black has a very fundamental choice between recapturing with either c-pawn or e-pawn. There is a general consensus that taking with the e-pawn is solid for Black, but White usually should have a slight pull. On the other hand, taking with the c-pawn is sharper, but has been under a cloud for quite a while due to a certain setup that we will investigate soon. I think this is actually quite playable for Black, but White can still pose some serious problems, of course. Let's have a look. }
5... cxd6 6. Nc3
{ The recapture with the c-pawn is far more ambitious compared to the symmetrical choice. Black intends to fianchetto his Bishop on g7, putting pressure on White's central pawn formation. White now has a very dangerous setup available, based on early Queenside development with Nc3/Be3/Rc1 and b3. The idea of this so-called Voronezh variation is to clear the long diagonal and prepare to play d4-d5 at the right moment. With a Black Bishop on g7 this advance needs to be prepared properly. }
6... g6 7. Be3 Bg7 8. Rc1
{ The main point is to prepare d4-d5, often in combination with b2-b3, which keeps the Knight offside  (control of c4)  . }
8... O-O 9. b3 Nc6
{ This is played most often. The alternatives 9... Bf5 and 9... e5 are examined in the dedicated chapter. }
10. d5 Ne5 11. Be2 { Preparing to play f2-f4, kicking the Knight again. } 11...
f5
{ This is the most popular move with more than 200 games in Megabase 2018. I think this is quite remarkable as the strongest reply leads to a terrible position for Black. }
12. Nh3
{ Just waiting to push f4 for a moment, until we have developed completely. }
12... Nbd7
{ This may be best, but I think Black is in dreadful shape anyways. } 13. O-O
Nf6 14. f4 Neg4 15. Bd4
{ White is a lot better. The plan is Nf2 next, with pressure mounting on the e-file. Black has many weaknesses, like e6 and e7. }

9... Ndf6
{ The most popular move, and consistent with Nd7. It is quite difficult to analyze this position move by move, but in fact it is not that essential to learn moves by heart here. White has the pair of Bishops and will be better if he manages to gain more space and push the Black pieces back, in particular the Knights. White's ideal scenario is to push the pawns on both sides in an endgame, and suffocate Black slowly. I will show the most important line to know from here, without any alternatives for Black.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
{ We are aiming for the Scotch Four Knights Opening. This line enjoys a very good reputation as it features quick development for White and a very sound pawn structure. It is easier to learn and understand than the main alternatives, the Italian  (Giuoco Piano)  and Spanish  (Ruy Lopez)  Opening.   The Scotch Four Knights may also arise after the immediate  3.d4  , after which Black's most popular continuation is indeed  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  ,  which transposes to our repertoire.   Once you have mastered the Scotch Four Knights via our 3  Nc3  move order, it makes a lot of sense to add the Scotch move order with  3.d4  to your repertoire. This way you get similar structures but some additional options like  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6   Of course Black also has some extra choices, most notably  4...Bc5.   Or my favourite  4...Bb4+.  5.Nxc6  Our line, the Scotch Four Knights, is easier to learn as it cuts down options for both sides. }
3... Nf6
{ This is by far the most popular move, completing the development of the four Knights. The alternatives are less reliable for Black and give White an edge without any particular problems. }
4. d4 exd4
{ Most natural and best. The alternatives are passive or slightly unsound. } 5.
Nxd4 Bb4
{ The established main line for the last 500 years... well, maybe not that long, but the oldest game I have with this position is from 1873. }
6. Nxc6
{ The only move. There is no other move available to make Bd3 possible, desirable because Bd3 will comfortably cover the threatened e4 pawn. }
6... bxc6 7. Bd3 d5
{ Black strikes out in the centre immediately. This is the most respectable way for Black to play, playing according to the motto that Black is OK in the open games if he gets in d7-d5 unpunished. We will see, however, that Black still needs to be precise against our repertoire choice. }
8. exd5 cxd5 9. O-O O-O 10. h3
{ The move that has brought new attention to the Scotch Four Knights. It was basically unknown until Kramnik played it against Aronian in 2012. After that game hundreds of games have been played, and the conclusion is that White has a low risk game with chances to play for a small edge. Black may equalize, but it is not so easy. What does 10 h3 do, by the way ? It prepares Qf3 and keeps options open. It will be useful in almost all cases, making luft for the King and taking g4 under control. This allows a setup with Qf3 and Rd1 for instance.   The traditional main line was  10.Bg5  , but it is not clear whether White will want to take on  f6  or drop the Bishop back to  h4  after a later  ...h6.  With 10 h3 White will almost always go for Bf4 soon. Note that White has a completely sound pawn structure and no weaknesses at all. This is the reason why this line is considered to be so solid for White: you have no structural risks to consider and easy development of your pieces, making it an ideal choice for us. }
10... h6
{ Black prevents Bg5  (a move that we rarely go for anyway)  and does not commit yet to ...c6. We will now check the lines where ...c6 is not played. For c6-based setups please see c6. }
11. Qf3
{ After this  11...c6  is by far the most common move.  The c6-based lines are discussed via the 10...c6 move order, so we will just look at non-c6 lines here. }
11... Re8 12. Bf4 Rb8
{ Instead  12...c6  is the main and best move, leading to positions we discuss after  c6. }
13. Rfe1

{ We are aiming for the Scotch Four Knights Opening. This line enjoys a very good reputation as it features quick development for White and a very sound pawn structure. It is easier to learn and understand than the main alternatives, the Italian  (Giuoco Piano)  and Spanish  (Ruy Lopez)  Opening.   The Scotch Four Knights may also arise after the immediate  3.d4  , after which Black's most popular continuation is indeed  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  ,  which transposes to our repertoire.   Once you have mastered the Scotch Four Knights via our 3  Nc3  move order, it makes a lot of sense to add the Scotch move order with  3.d4  to your repertoire. This way you get similar structures but some additional options like  3...exd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6   Of course Black also has some extra choices, most notably  4...Bc5.   Or my favourite  4...Bb4+.  5.Nxc6  Our line, the Scotch Four Knights, is easier to learn as it cuts down options for both sides. }
3... Nf6
{ This is by far the most popular move, completing the development of the four Knights. The alternatives are less reliable for Black and give White an edge without any particular problems. }
4. d4 exd4
{ Most natural and best. The alternatives are passive or slightly unsound. } 5.
Nxd4 Bb4
{ The established main line for the last 500 years... well, maybe not that long, but the oldest game I have with this position is from 1873. }
6. Nxc6
{ The only move. There is no other move available to make Bd3 possible, desirable because Bd3 will comfortably cover the threatened e4 pawn. }
6... bxc6 7. Bd3 d5
{ Black strikes out in the centre immediately. This is the most respectable way for Black to play, playing according to the motto that Black is OK in the open games if he gets in d7-d5 unpunished. We will see, however, that Black still needs to be precise against our repertoire choice. }
8. exd5 cxd5 9. O-O O-O 10. h3
{ The move that has brought new attention to the Scotch Four Knights. It was basically unknown until Kramnik played it against Aronian in 2012. After that game hundreds of games have been played, and the conclusion is that White has a low risk game with chances to play for a small edge. Black may equalize, but it is not so easy. What does 10 h3 do, by the way ? It prepares Qf3 and keeps options open. It will be useful in almost all cases, making luft for the King and taking g4 under control. This allows a setup with Qf3 and Rd1 for instance.   The traditional main line was  10.Bg5  , but it is not clear whether White will want to take on  f6  or drop the Bishop back to  h4  after a later  ...h6.  With 10 h3 White will almost always go for Bf4 soon. Note that White has a completely sound pawn structure and no weaknesses at all. This is the reason why this line is considered to be so solid for White: you have no structural risks to consider and easy development of your pieces, making it an ideal choice for us. }
10... c6
{ This is most common. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares a future Bd6 without Nb5 to worry about. }
11. Qf3 { Our setup involves Qf3 and Bf4, almost no matter what Black does. }
11... h6 { Stopping Bg5, but we prefer the Bishop on f4 anyway. } 12. Bf4 Bd6
13. Rfe1
{ Very natural.   But White also has moves like  13.Ne2   Or  13.Rad1.  It is not a very forcing position where just one line of play is possible and others fail tactically. }
13... Bxf4
{ This was played in the well known game Wang,H  (2752)  -Anand,V  (2772)  Wijk aan Zee 2013. This is a game well worth studying as it shows how easily Black can drift into a worse position. }
14. Qxf4 Be6 15. Ne2 { Potentially heading for d4 and preparing c2-c4. } 15...
Qb8 16. b3 Qxf4 17. Nxf4 Rfe8 18. Nxe6 fxe6 19. Bg6 Re7 20. c4

This allows a setup with Qf3 and Rd1 for instance.   The traditional main line was  10.Bg5  , but it is not clear whether White will want to take on  f6  or drop the Bishop back to  h4  after a later  ...h6.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4.   At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after  ...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3  Bb5.  For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire. }

{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4.   At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after  ...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3  Bb5.  For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble.

{ This move is a relative of 3. ..Qc7, but a bit more challenging as we are provoked to play an early Nc3, which limits our options. Still, Black has problems equalizing, again, due to his sluggish development. }
4. Nc3 e6 5. Bxc6
{ This is important and a bit surprising at first, but you will see how dangerous it is to take now. If we wait until Nge7 is played it will be much more difficult to come up with an aggressive play to open up the position. }
5... Qxc6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Qc7 8. O-O a6
{ This transposes to a line usually arising from Qc7. Going ...a6 looks very slow, but Black can hardly allow Ndb5 ideas. }
9. Re1
{ This position is identical to a line starting with Qc7. Black is under serious pressure. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4.   At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after  ...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3  Bb5.  For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire. }
3... Nd4
{ This move is somewhat premature. The Knight jump to d4 is quite common in positions where White already has a Knight on c3 . In these cases, taking on d4 loses time as c3 is immediately attacked. Here White has not committed to anything, yet, so he can adapt perfectly to the pawn structure change that Black initiates. }
4. Nxd4 cxd4 5. O-O
{ White has more than one decent plan now. One idea is to go for a d3/f4 plan and play on the kingside. The Bishop often drops back to b3, then. The alternative option is to play c3, trying to open the position. }
5... g6 6. c3 { As mentioned, there is also d3 etc. } 6... Bg7 7. cxd4 Bxd4 8.

10... O-O 11. Na3 b6 12. Nc4 Nd7 13. b3
{ White's idea is to play f2-f4 in the very long run. Before this is possible, we need to either trade the dark squared Bishops or provoke f7-f6, by Black. Note that the trade of Bishops makes sense, as after a later f2-f4 break the dark squares will be weak in Black's camp. The Bishop on g7 looks weaker than the Be3, but Black's Bishop is an important defender. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4.   At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after  ...Nc6  is the Sveshnikov variation after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5.  White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3  Bb5.  For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire. }
3... g6
{ The most popular reply. Black prepares the fianchetto and tries to increase control over d4 this way. It also emphases kingside development more than the other moves. Note that White will castle on move 4, while Black's King will be in the centre for a while. This is not a big issue yet, as the position is closed, but further delaying it might be a cause for later concerns. }
4. O-O
{ What could be more natural ?  White's main alternative to 4 O-O is to play   4.Bxc6  , leading to a strategically very complicated battle. This is my recommendation if you like to expand your repertoire.  Note that against ...e6 we also go 4 O-O, while 4 Bxc6 is the other basic option there, as well.

Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire. }
3... g6
{ The most popular reply. Black prepares the fianchetto and tries to increase control over d4 this way. It also emphases kingside development more than the other moves. Note that White will castle on move 4, while Black's King will be in the centre for a while. This is not a big issue yet, as the position is closed, but further delaying it might be a cause for later concerns. }
4. O-O
{ What could be more natural ?  White's main alternative to 4 O-O is to play   4.Bxc6  , leading to a strategically very complicated battle. This is my recommendation if you like to expand your repertoire.  Note that against ...e6 we also go 4 O-O, while 4 Bxc6 is the other basic option there, as well. The Rossolimo is a rather versatile line, making it an ideal choice for any repertoire. You can start with one line and later add more variety, without needing to learn something entirely new. }

My chosen move opens up the c2-square for the Bishop and leads to position types that are more typical of the Ruy Lopez than anything else.

4. c3
{ This is my suggestion, at this point, but White has some interesting alternatives.   The most principled move is  4.d4  , but this was too close to an open Sicilian for this repertoire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, it just does not fit well with our purposes.   Also, there is  4.O-O  , going for  4...a6  5.Bd3  !?. This is quite interesting as well but a tad too artificial for a 'keep it simple' repertoire. Again, nothing wrong with it, but it didn't work out for me in this context.  My chosen move opens up the c2-square for the Bishop and leads to position types that are more typical of the Ruy Lopez than anything else. One important point to remember is that Black intended to play a Dragon or Najdorf, most likely, and might not be well versed in defending a Ruy Lopez structure. }

{ Without the light squared Bishop, the Queen is well placed on the e2 square, and the fianchetto of the c1 Bishop becomes more attractive. Without the Bishop trade White's Bishop will be on e2 and Queen on d2, where it covers c3 as well. In this situation e3 is the most natural post for the Bishop. Here b2 is fine as it covers c3, and there are also some attacking chances against the king using the long diagonal. }
11... Rc8 12. Bb2 Re8 13. Rad1
{ White may go for f2-f4, with a possible rook lift to g3. I prefer White's chances here, but of course Black is quite solid. }

5... Nf6
{ This is the most popular move on the top level nowadays. There are some concrete lines where delaying Nc6 is relevant, as an early Rf8-c8 will attack the c4 pawn. More about that later. }
6. Nc3
{ Black now has three basic approaches. He needs to develop the f8 Bishop soon, so the first two approaches are:   To play  6...e6  or  ...g6  now.   Or, after inserting  6...Nc6  7.d4  cxd4  8.Nxd4.   The third approach is to try some concrete play after  6...Nc6  , based on the Queen sortie  ...Qd7-g4 !?  to attack the still unprotected g-pawn. }

White is stuck with  10.Nde2  , which is not terrible for White, but there is little incentive to allow this if the immediate 7  d4  is a simple transposition.   10.Be3  Ng4  is awkward.  The lines allowed by 7 d4 involving ...Qg4 are not great for Black, so we don't mind these additional options for our opponents. }

9. Qxg4 Nxg4 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bf4

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
{ This is the Moscow variation. I briefly tried to find out why this name is used, but came up empty. This line always had a somewhat lame reputation, but this has changed lately. As White got more and more frustrated with battling the Najdorf this move gained more popularity and is now used regularly by almost all elite players, including World Champion Magnus Carlsen. }
3... Bd7

4. Bxd7+

4... Qxd7
{ This move signals that Black will play Nc6 most of the time to emphasize control over d4. This is most often combined with a kingside fianchetto. }
5. c4

9... Nxd4 10. Qxd4 Bg7 11. Be3 O-O 12. Qd3
{ With a standard Maroczy position that is slightly better for White. We will try to prevent Black pawn breaks like b7-b5 and maintain a space advantage. Nd5 will be a key idea for changing the pawn structure, as after Nxd5 White retakes with a pawn. cxd5 will often lead to a better endgame, exd5 might be an option to play against the e7-pawn. }

White is quite happy to consolidate his space advantage and prevent the pawn breaks like b7-b5 or be ready for e7-e6 and d6-d5 by Black.

This will be a key idea for changing the pawn structure, as after Nxd5 White retakes with a pawn. cxd5 will often lead to a better endgame. exd5 might be an option to play against the e7-pawn. The Maroczy centre is generally regarded as slightly favorable for White, but it requires patience, building up slowly. It is very useful to study some complete games in order to get a better feel for the position. It is important to note that the play is quite strategical and slow in nature, a type of position that, in many cases, the Black player did not intend to reach when he learned his main line open Sicilian theory. Defending the Black side of the Maroczy is quite different to a Dragon or Najdorf main line. }
11... Rac8 12. b3 { The pawn on c4 needs some cover. } 12... Rfd8
{ This signals that Black is trying to play in the centre with e6 and d5 to come. }
13. Qd2 e6 14. Rad1

White is quite happy to consolidate his space advantage and prevent the pawn breaks like b7-b5 or be ready for e7-e6 and d6-d5 by Black. We will centralize and often base our play on the Knight coming to d5. This will be a key idea for changing the pawn structure, as after Nxd5 White retakes with a pawn. cxd5 will often lead to a better endgame. exd5 might be an option to play against the e7-pawn. The Maroczy centre is generally regarded as slightly favorable for White, but it requires patience, building up slowly. It is very useful to study some complete games in order to get a better feel for the position. It is important to note that the play is quite strategical and slow in nature, a type of position that, in many cases, the Black player did not intend to reach when he learned his main line open Sicilian theory. Defending the Black side of the Maroczy is quite different to a Dragon or Najdorf main line. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
{ This is the Moscow variation. I briefly tried to find out why this name is used, but came up empty. This line always had a somewhat lame reputation, but this has changed lately. As White got more and more frustrated with battling the Najdorf this move gained more popularity and is now used regularly by almost all elite players, including World Champion Magnus Carlsen. }
3... Bd7
{ This is the most solid reply for Black as it does not clog up development that much. }
4. Bxd7+
{ The normal move and the main line by a mile.   Only after I had completed work on this repertoire did I learn that  4.c4  is currently in fashion. It shares some similarities with our main line and is a good choice for a later addition to your repertoire. }
4... Qxd7
{ This move signals that Black will play Nc6 most of the time to emphasize control over d4. This is most often combined with a kingside fianchetto. }

{ A strategically very sound choice. White places his pawns on light squares after this Bishop has been traded off. We are aiming for a Maroczy Bind structure, giving White comfortable control. }

{ This is the most popular move on the top level nowadays. There are some concrete lines where delaying Nc6 is relevant, as an early Rf8-c8 will attack the c4 pawn. More about that later. }
6. Nc3
{ Black now has three basic approaches. He needs to develop the f8 Bishop soon, so the first two approaches are:   To play  6...e6  or  ...g6  now.   Or, after inserting  6...Nc6  7.d4  cxd4  8.Nxd4.

If you know beforehand that your opponent will play this line you might want to prepare 3  d4  in detail for such a game.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6
{ This is Black's third most popular move, right after ...d6 and ...Nc6.   In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nc6  , have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any  Bb5  lines with this move order. Our repertoire features  Bb5  against  ...d6  and  ...Nc6  , but against  e6  we need a different approach.   My recommendation is to go  3.c3  in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to  c3  on move 2 Black is committed to an early  ...e6.  This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system.   Other interesting choices here, besides the Open Sicilian of course, are  3.b3   Or  3.g3.  These are worth considering if you want to expand the repertoire. I didn't choose them as my main lines because I felt they did not fit into the general concept of this repertoire as well as 3 c3. }

In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nc6  , have become very popular.  The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against e6 we need a different approach.   My recommendation is to go  3.c3  in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to  c3  on move 2 Black is committed to an early  ...e6.  This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system.   Other interesting choices here, besides the Open Sicilian of course, are  3.b3   Or  3.g3.  These are worth considering if you want to expand the repertoire. I didn't choose them as my main lines because I felt they did not fit into the general concept of this repertoire as well as 3 c3. }
3. c3
{ With Black committed to ...e6 he will usually play ...d5 on move 3 or 4. The only other very serious alternative is Nf6, attacking the pawn and unbalancing the pawn structure, as White needs to advance the e-pawn. }
3... d5 4. exd5 exd5 5. d4 Nc6
{ This is the most popular move, placing the Knight on the most logical square, looking at the crucial d4 spot in front of the future IQP. }
6. Bb5 Bd6

7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. O-O Ne7 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. Nb3 Bb6
{ This and Bd6 are of roughly equal value. Bb6 looks more principled, though, as it still connects with the d4 square. In any case White would like to trade this bishop - it follows the general rule to trade minor pieces vs the IQP and gets rid of Black's better bishop. }
11. Re1
{ Be3 is a key idea to trade the bishop, making Re1 a very natural choice. }
11... Nf5 { Directed against Be3. } 12. Bd3
{ Against Nf5 setups the battery with Bc2/Qd3 is usually a good idea. } 12...

{ An important point. The Nf5 is basically pinned, so Be3 is possible now.   Note that  15.g4  is answered by  15...Qg6 !  and White gets nothing out of this weakening pawn push. }
15... Bxe3 16. Rxe3 g6 17. Re2
{ This is no fun for Black. He is quite passive and has no dynamic chances to compensate for the IQP weaknesses. }

The IQP structure has been discussed a lot in chess literature or media so I only want to give a quick summary of what is most important. The side with the IQP enjoys fluent piece development and does not have any problem pieces. With many pieces on the board the weakness of the isolated pawn is not that pronounced as it is difficult to attack it multiple times. This is not the case after trading minor pieces, when the rooks and Queen may focus on attacking the pawn. Following this logic the IQP side should keep minor pieces on, and if there are no active opportunities for the rooks, allow them to be traded. The square in front of the pawn is very important as it may serve as an outpost for the opponent. If the IQP side manages to push the pawn forward and break this potential blockade it is often favorable as piece activity persists, while the weakness gets removed. This is just a brief intro to the IQP, please see some classical examples or books on strategy for more information. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6
{ This is Black's third most popular move, right after ...d6 and ...Nc6.   In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nc6  , have become very popular.  The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against e6 we need a different approach.   My recommendation is to go  3.c3  in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to  c3  on move 2 Black is committed to an early  ...e6.  This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system.   Other interesting choices here, besides the Open Sicilian of course, are  3.b3   Or  3.g3.

We will get mostly French type positions that I think are slightly favorable for White, but Black has chances as well. Compared to some lines with Bg4 Black has more counterplay. Currently, there is no way for a White advantage, as it is the case with most main line openings. I suggest that we head for a complicated middlegame that is difficult to handle for both sides and offers some chances for Black to go wrong. }

{ @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  The position after Nc6 is usually reached with Black to move. This happens via   1.e4  e6  2.d4  d5  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5  Nfd7  5.Nce2  c5  6.c3  Nc6  7.Nf3.  So we are getting an extra move now.  I suggest playing 8 a3. This is useful in many ways, like preventing a check on b4, and preparing b2-b4, in some cases. We will play on the Kingside, and Nf4 is coming. }

{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation.

We will get mostly French type positions that I think are slightly favorable for White, but Black has chances as well. Compared to some lines with Bg4 Black has more counterplay. Currently, there is no way for a White advantage, as it is the case with most main line openings. I suggest that we head for a complicated middlegame that is difficult to handle for both sides and offers some chances for Black to go wrong. }
4. e5 Ne4 5. Ne2
{ Not the most obvious move, maybe, but it is the most testing choice. This prepares play against the Knight on e4 by going d2-d3, without allowing the capture on c3. Also note that with a closed structure it is useful to have c3 later, to support the centre. The Knight will also do a good job on the Kingside, as we will see. }
5... Qb6
{ Threatening Mate in one ! The main point is that White is forced to go 6 d4 to cover that, and in turn loses the option of d2-d3 to kick the Knight away. }
6. d4 e6 7. Ng3
{ This looks very normal.   But usually  7.Nfg1 !?  is viewed as the critical line. I do agree, this is a test for Black, but I didn't find all that much for White in these lines.  Considering that it is a huge effort to learn and understand everything there, I checked the more natural move 7 Ng3 and decided to go with that. It does not lead to an objective advantage, but it is a good practical decision. }
7... c5 8. c3
{ Well, it does not really deserve an exclamation mark, as it looks perfectly normal. But there is a reason:  I tested this line in a league game and without thinking blitzed out   8.Bd3  here, simply confusing the move order. My opponent just took on d4  8...cxd4  and was fine - so this exclamation mark is for me to remember it next time ! }
8... Nc6 9. Bd3
{ Forcing some action by the e4 Knight. Black will have to trade on g3 or allow a transformation in the centre. }
9... Nxg3 10. hxg3 cxd4 11. cxd4 Bb4+
{ This is quite questionable as it provokes a move that White likes to play anyway. }
12. Kf1
{ As we will see in the main line this is quite a normal setup for White. However, the Bishop is misplaced on b4, as White may, at least, get a useful tempo with a3. }

1. e4 c6
{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }
2. Nc3
{ Instead   2.Nf3  will lead to the same thing almost all of the time. However Black may omit ...d5 and go for a ...g6/...d6 based setup when we have forfeited the option of pushing f4.  See the Pirc/Modern chapter for details. }

In recent years there has been renewed interest in the line and many strong players use this, at least occasionally.

The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. }

{ With an interesting struggle. One idea for White is to take on h5 and then regroup the Knight to f4, trying to win h5. Black has pressure on d4, though, so this is most likely an idea for the endgame. This is an interesting position to analyze further, but you need to make a cut somewhere and say: ' OK, let's go for it !'. Still, it is always a good idea for a training session to continue to analyze from the final position of your prep to get a better feel for the arising positions. }

Note that Black can't castle short, so any pawn play on the Queenside is very trick for Black to go for if O-O-O is on the agenda. }
13... Na5 14. Rb1
{ White does not need to play 14 b4 just yet. Rb1 is useful, anyway, and we rather want Black to commit to something first. }
14... Bb5 { Not the only move, but the most direct one. } 15. b4 Qa6 16. Bxb5+
Qxb5+ 17. Kg1 Nc4 18. a4 Qd7 19. Qc2
{ And we have reached a typically complicated scenario for this line. I always like to have space, so I prefer White. But the engines evaluate it as equal. This is fair enough, Black has his ideas as well - it will be a tough battle to look forward to. }

1. e4 c6
{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }
2. Nc3
{ Instead   2.Nf3  will lead to the same thing almost all of the time. However Black may omit ...d5 and go for a ...g6/...d6 based setup when we have forfeited the option of pushing f4.  See the Pirc/Modern chapter for details. }
2... d5 3. Nf3
{ This is the starting position of the Two Knights Variation. It used to be a favorite of Bobby Fischer, but fell out of fashion for a long time. In recent years there has been renewed interest in the line and many strong players use this, at least occasionally. Nowadays, top players play a lot more games than decades ago and everybody needs backup lines or systems that are not applied every single game. The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. }
3... Bg4
{ This is the traditional main line. Nowadays Nf6 is a more fashionable move as it offers Black more chances for a fight while Bg4 is very solid, but not very active by comparison. With 3....Bg4 Black usually signals his intention to take on f3 and give up the pair of Bishops. Retreating the bishop is possible, but has a dicey reputation, as we will see later. }
4. h3
{ Recently, the alternative   4.d4  has been played, as well. This is also a good option for varying your play.  The main difference between this, and our choice of h3, is that we force a decision immediately about whether Black wants to keep his Bishop  (risky)  or stay solid, taking on f3 but giving up the Bishop pair. }
4... Bh5
{ This is actually a somewhat dubious line, but it is still played quite frequently as it leads to difficult positions in which White may go wrong. If White knows what to do Black will be the one in trouble. }

1. e4 c6
{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }
2. Nc3
{ Instead   2.Nf3  will lead to the same thing almost all of the time. However Black may omit ...d5 and go for a ...g6/...d6 based setup when we have forfeited the option of pushing f4.  See the Pirc/Modern chapter for details. }
2... d5 3. Nf3
{ This is the starting position of the Two Knights Variation. It used to be a favorite of Bobby Fischer, but fell out of fashion for a long time. In recent years there has been renewed interest in the line and many strong players use this, at least occasionally. Nowadays, top players play a lot more games than decades ago and everybody needs backup lines or systems that are not applied every single game. The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. }
3... Bg4
{ This is the traditional main line. Nowadays Nf6 is a more fashionable move as it offers Black more chances for a fight while Bg4 is very solid, but not very active by comparison. With 3....Bg4 Black usually signals his intention to take on f3 and give up the pair of Bishops. Retreating the bishop is possible, but has a dicey reputation, as we will see later. }
4. h3
{ Recently, the alternative   4.d4  has been played, as well. This is also a good option for varying your play.  The main difference between this, and our choice of h3, is that we force a decision immediately about whether Black wants to keep his Bishop  (risky)  or stay solid, taking on f3 but giving up the Bishop pair. }

22. Qe2
{ This is actually a novelty. Up till now White players have traded Queens on c2. This leads to an endgame where Black's sole idea is to get rid of the White a-pawn and draw while being a Bishop down. Note the wrong color of the corner for the Bishop, if it's about the h-pawn at the end. This is a super safe option to go for - you have winning chances and can't lose, given you don't blunder a rook or something like that ! }
22... Qxe2+
{ Of course, Black can keep Queens on, but it's important to show the difference to taking on c2. If Black keeps the Queens on, White will post the Bishop on d3 to cover c2. Black does not get anything against White's King and the Bishop is stronger than the pawns. }
23. Kxe2 Rc2+ 24. Rd2
{ This way it is a bit more difficult for Black to get the a-pawn. White has a freeroll to play for a win. }

Black will push c6-c5 and Knights on d7 and c6 put pressure on the central pawn. Our Knight is misplaced on c3 for that scenario and we don't have the pawn move c2-c3 to support d4. So be very careful with this advance; it is almost always bad. }

The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. }
3... Bg4
{ This is the traditional main line. Nowadays Nf6 is a more fashionable move as it offers Black more chances for a fight while Bg4 is very solid, but not very active by comparison. With 3....Bg4 Black usually signals his intention to take on f3 and give up the pair of Bishops. Retreating the bishop is possible, but has a dicey reputation, as we will see later. }
4. h3
{ Recently, the alternative   4.d4  has been played, as well. This is also a good option for varying your play.  The main difference between this, and our choice of h3, is that we force a decision immediately about whether Black wants to keep his Bishop  (risky)  or stay solid, taking on f3 but giving up the Bishop pair. }
4... Bxf3 5. Qxf3
{ So after just 5 moves we have a long term asset: the pair of Bishops. This is nice, but the position is closed at the moment and Black's setup is very sound with e7-e6 to come. It is very important to understand that pushing e4-e5, in these sets of lines, is rarely a good idea as White is not well equipped to hold that pawn centre. Black will push c6-c5 and Knights on d7 and c6 put pressure on the central pawn. Our Knight is misplaced on c3 for that scenario and we don't have the pawn move c2-c3 to support d4. So be very careful with this advance; it is almost always bad. }
5... d4
{ This is just a mistake as it allows an attractive tempo-gaining move. } 6.
Bc4 e6 7. Ne2 c5 8. d3
{ With a vastly improved version of the main lines, as the Bishop is on c4 outside of the pawn chain, and after Qg3 White can aim for f2-f4. }

{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }

6. Be2

With 3....Bg4 Black usually signals his intention to take on f3 and give up the pair of Bishops. Retreating the bishop is possible, but has a dicey reputation, as we will see later. }
4. h3
{ Recently, the alternative   4.d4  has been played, as well. This is also a good option for varying your play.  The main difference between this, and our choice of h3, is that we force a decision immediately about whether Black wants to keep his Bishop  (risky)  or stay solid, taking on f3 but giving up the Bishop pair. }
4... Bxf3 5. Qxf3
{ So after just 5 moves we have a long term asset: the pair of Bishops. This is nice, but the position is closed at the moment and Black's setup is very sound with e7-e6 to come. It is very important to understand that pushing e4-e5, in these sets of lines, is rarely a good idea as White is not well equipped to hold that pawn centre. Black will push c6-c5 and Knights on d7 and c6 put pressure on the central pawn. Our Knight is misplaced on c3 for that scenario and we don't have the pawn move c2-c3 to support d4. So be very careful with this advance; it is almost always bad. }
5... e6
{ Black's main moves here are Nf6 and e6. These two moves have some subtle differences depending on the setup that White goes for. I have selected a line where it makes no difference whether Black starts with the pawn or the Knight. }
6. Be2
{ A good alternative against the 5...e6 move order is   6.d4.  I am going for 6 Be2 instead as this is playable against both 5...Nf6 and 5...e6, so we reduce the theory to learn. That being said, going for 6 d4 setups is a worthy alternative to explore if you like to expand your repertoire. }

1. e4 c6
{ The Caro-Kann Defence is a very well respected choice for Black. For many years it had a very solid, but also somewhat dull reputation. This has changed a lot in recent years, as White players have recognized that the safe options don't promise much - so they have sharpened up the game. The main weapon of the top GMs is the Advance Variation, but this is not an easy choice for us as it requires intensive study. I decided to go for the Two Knights Variation. This line sets some pitfalls for Black and the best lines are not all that well known. }
2. Nc3
{ Instead   2.Nf3  will lead to the same thing almost all of the time. However Black may omit ...d5 and go for a ...g6/...d6 based setup when we have forfeited the option of pushing f4.  See the Pirc/Modern chapter for details. }

In recent years there has been renewed interest in the line and many strong players use this, at least occasionally. Nowadays, top players play a lot more games than decades ago and everybody needs backup lines or systems that are not applied every single game. The Two Knights is a good line because it is relatively simple to learn and still contains some poison. }

It is still interesting to play, so I choose to give it as the main line.  If you dislike it, you may also go   8.d4  ,  but after  8...dxe4  you need to play  9.Qe3  and recapture on e4 later. This basically loses a tempo, compared to 8 Rd1, if Black chooses not to push d4. This tempo is not terribly important though.  Go 8 d4 if you don't like allowing Black to push d5-d4. It is easy to play. }

9. e5
{ A rare case of e4-e5 being fine for White. Here it is quite favorable as Black cannot push c6-c5 easily due to b5 hanging. Black needs to lose some time to cover b5, enough for us to support the centre and enjoy a nice edge. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5
{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play   4.Nf3  and keep the option of playing  c4  at a better moment. In particular, after  4...Bd6  we go  5.c4  .  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... c6
{ This is not frequently played, but quite solid. Black supports the centre and is still flexible regarding Kingside development. }
5. c4
{ This is most ambitious.  But there is nothing particularly wrong with   5.Bd3  ,  either. Black will very likely play ...Bd6, ...Ne7, ...Bf5, but White may go with a setup involving b3 and c4, later, to grab some space. It is a good alternative if you like to vary your play. }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play   4.Nf3  and keep the option of playing  c4  at a better moment. In particular, after  4...Bd6  we go  5.c4  .  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Nf6
{ Black just stays symmetrical. Unsurprisingly this move is the most solid and reliable choice that Black has. I always thought this simple approach is the main argument against the Exchange French, as White get's nowhere. However, it turned out to be not as simple, after a closer look. White has some ideas that Black needs to answer precisely - let's check some details. }
5. Bd3
{ Here  5.c4  is again answered by  5...Bb4+  , which is fine for Black. } 5...
Be7
{ This is an a very conservative approach by Black. Placing the Bishop on e7 means that any unpleasant checks on the e-file are avoided, but quite often Black will move the piece again to d6 after all. Against these Be7 setups I recommend playing with a standard setup of O-O/Bg5/Nbd2/c3 and Qc2, in most cases. It is important to mention that White should play these moves first and avoid an early Re1. We will see in the main line why this natural move should be played only later. Another key point is that Black will play Bg4, after which we should not play h3, as Bh5 is useful for Black as trading the Bishops with Bg6 is part of Black's agenda. }
6. O-O O-O 7. Bg5
{ This should be played first, keeping Re1 until it is better timed. We'll see in the couple of move why saving this move is important.   I would also like to mention that  7.h3  is a very decent alternative.   @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5@@EndFEN@@ But Black may also start with  5...Bg4  6.O-O  Be7  and we would need to transpose to  7.Bg5  , anyway.  So we go for a line that is usable against all ...Be7 setups and this means that we don't need to learn two separate lines. }
7... Bg4 { Very natural and the most popular by far. } 8. Nbd2 Nbd7 9. c3 c5
{ Against this ...c5 approach I like to just keep the tension, as   10.dxc5  Nxc5  does not look ideal. }
10. h3 Bh5 11. Re1

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... Qxd5
{ This is a Scandinavian with a pawn on e6, forfeiting the option of developing this piece outside of the pawn chain. It is a very rare move, but one thing is good to know: going Nc3 immediately is less promising than delaying this move. }
4. Nf3 Nf6 5. c4 Qd8 6. Nc3
{ This is the best way of handling the situation. The Knight is better placed behind the c-pawn than in front of it. This way the pawn on c4 controls important squares. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks.

He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ?

The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ?

Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Bg4
{ This is probably Black's most ambitious line on move 4. He pins the White Knight immediately and has a setup with Nc6/Qd7, and even O-O-O, in mind. The good news is that White will be better with precise and  (very important !)  concrete play. Just playing schematic moves leads to nothing. }
5. h3 Bh5
{ The only logical option. Taking on f3 just gives up the Bishop pair and there is no other decent square to retreat to. }
6. Qe2+
{ This is what I referred to as 'concrete play'. This disruptive check is the reason why Bg4 is considered risky for Black. }
6... Qe7 { Not the most natural looking move, but the alternatives are worse. }
7. Be3
{ This avoids the Queen trade and prepares O-O-O. White is better here due to the edge on the Kingside, with g4 to come. }
7... Nc6 8. Nc3 O-O-O 9. g4 Bg6 10. O-O-O
{ This is the position that arises most often after Bg4, if White goes for the most critical line, like we do. Now Black has tried some moves that we need to check briefly. }
10... f6
{ This is the most popular move, covering e5 and opening some squares for the Bishop on g6. The alternative lines clearly show the dangers of a Knight coming to e5. }
11. a3
{ This is a useful move in the long run. Black might have Nb4 or Bb4 available after a later Queen move. White also intends to go Nd2, after which Nb4 cannot be answered with Rd2 anymore. }
11... Qd7 12. Nd2
{ This prepares the push of the f-pawn and heads towards b3, and possibly Nc5 later. }
12... f5
{ This was played in the stem game of this line, Kasparov-Short, Tilburg 1991. Black has other options, but White will play with Bg2, f4, Nb3 in all cases. He is better because of the space advantage on the Kingside and better mobilization, as Black needs some moves to get the Kingside untangled. }
13. Nf3
{ This engine suggestion improves White's play considerably. Kasparov played 13 Nb3 and obtained a better game nevertheless, but heading with the Knight back to use the weakened e5 square is a lot more forceful. }
13... a6
{ The engine likes this relatively best, but not an easy choice to make over the board. }
14. Ne5 Qe6 15. Bg2 Nf6 16. Bg5 { With a very nice advantage for White. } *

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5
{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Nc6
{ This is one of the more ambitious lines Black has available. He intends the typical Nc6/Bd6/Nge7 setup, but wants to have Bb4+ still available in case White pushes 5 c4. }
5. Bb5
{ This is the only testing move. White needs to have something concrete against ...Bd6/...Nge7.   A lame move like  5.Bd3  Bg4  leads nowhere. }
5... Bd6
{ The most natural move, sticking to the initial plan of ...Bd6/...Nge7. } 6.
c4
{ This is one point of the Bb5 sortie. This move initiates an almost forced sequence of moves that leads to a very unconventional pawn structure. }
6... dxc4 7. d5 a6 8. Ba4 b5 9. dxc6 bxa4 10. O-O Ne7
{ This sequence is almost forced after 6 c4 dxc4. It's a rather uncommon pawn formation with Black's queenside completely shattered - he's got an extra pawn, though, that White still needs to recover, and the Bishop pair. This, however, is quite often just a short-lived point as Nd2-c4xd6 is a common idea. }
11. Nbd2
{ This is not yet very popular, but it is better than  11.Qa4.  I think that White retains a small edge after this move. It is nothing special, but the kind of position you will win sometimes and should never lose. }
11... c3
{ A frequently seen idea is to return the pawn while damaging the opponent's structure. White has a stronger move than taking, though. }
12. Ne4
{ An important point and key difference to 11 Qa4, when White needs to take on c3 with the pawn in similar scenarios. }
12... O-O 13. Qxa4 Qe8
{ This was played in the only sample game, Maier-Bluebaum, Dresden 2017. White kept a nagging edge is this game. }
14. Nxd6 cxd6 15. Nd4 { Of course - We need to keep c6 as long as possible. }
15... Bb7 16. Re1 Bxc6 17. Qa3 Qd7 18. Qxc3
{ This happened in the mentioned Meier-Bluebaum game. White is slightly better. He's got the better pawn structure and will get a very nice Bishop on c3/d4. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }
3... exd5 4. Nf3
{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

{ Black just stays symmetrical. Unsurprisingly this move is the most solid and reliable choice that Black has.

Be7
{ This is an a very conservative approach by Black. Placing the Bishop on e7 means that any unpleasant checks on the e-file are avoided, but quite often Black will move the piece again to d6 after all. Against these Be7 setups I recommend playing with a standard setup of O-O/Bg5/Nbd2/c3 and Qc2, in most cases. It is important to mention that White should play these moves first and avoid an early Re1. We will see in the main line why this natural move should be played only later. Another key point is that Black will play Bg4, after which we should not play h3, as Bh5 is useful for Black as trading the Bishops with Bg6 is part of Black's agenda. }

Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

{ Black just stays symmetrical. Unsurprisingly this move is the most solid and reliable choice that Black has.

Be7
{ This is an a very conservative approach by Black. Placing the Bishop on e7 means that any unpleasant checks on the e-file are avoided, but quite often Black will move the piece again to d6 after all. Against these Be7 setups I recommend playing with a standard setup of O-O/Bg5/Nbd2/c3 and Qc2, in most cases. It is important to mention that White should play these moves first and avoid an early Re1. We will see in the main line why this natural move should be played only later. Another key point is that Black will play Bg4, after which we should not play h3, as Bh5 is useful for Black as trading the Bishops with Bg6 is part of Black's agenda. }
6. O-O O-O 7. Bg5
{ This should be played first, keeping Re1 until it is better timed. We'll see in the couple of move why saving this move is important.  I would also like to mention that   7.h3  is a very decent alternative.  But Black may also start with 5... Bg4 6 O-O Be7 and we would need to transpose to 7 Bg5, anyway. So we go for a line that is usable against all ...Be7-setups and this means that we don't need to learn two separate lines. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point.

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }
4... Nf6
{ Black just stays symmetrical. Unsurprisingly this move is the most solid and reliable choice that Black has. I always thought this simple approach is the main argument against the Exchange French, as White get's nowhere. However, it turned out to be not as simple, after a closer look. White has some ideas that Black needs to answer precisely - let's check some details. }

I think that White can play for an edge in some cases, in others it's just equal with almost zero losing chances. }
6. Qe2+
{ This move poses the most problems for Black. Without this check White's opening would be rather toothless, as Black would equalize by simply copying everything. }

7... O-O { This is yet untested, but certainly interesting to play. } 8. c5
{ We have to play this, otherwise Black would take on c4 twice and get a good anti-IQP position, because our important light squared Bishop is traded. }

{ With a complicated position. As mentioned, this is all untested, so it is unclear how deep you will want to analyze it. I'll stop here, being content with a 'let's play chess' position. }

{ Really ? Yes, I am recommending the French Exchange ! Isn't that line just very boring and drawish ? This is the usual objection that people have when learning that I advocate trading on d5. Let me explain my rationale behind this choice. The French Defence usually features a pawn structure with White advancing the pawn to e5, either now on move 3  ('Advance French')  , or soon after.   For example after  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5   Or  3.Nd2  Nf6  4.e5  This pawn structure is usually even called 'French structure'. The Black player will get this structure in most of his French Defence games and will know the basic plans quite well, having this type of game over and over again. He will break with ...c5 and/or ...f6, plans like that are well known. The White player, however, does not face the French as often and will be less experienced in the arising positions. The French player AIMS for this structure with his choice of opening, so with the Exchange French we are going for the spoilsport option, preventing a closed game with typical manoeuvres that Black will most likely know better than we do.Before we discuss the Exchange French in detail, I need to mention one important point. Due to the often closed nature of the positions after the other main lines  (3 Nc3, 3 Nd2, 3 e5)  the game is not very forcing, but rather slow. This means that Black has a huge choice of lines to go for, which makes it difficult to prepare for. Of course, within the main lines, like 3 Nd2, there are ways to cut down on the theoretical workload, but these 'second-rate' versions of the main lines promise no more opening advantage than the Exchange in my opinion. Also, don't underestimate the nuisance value of playing the Exchange - oftentimes Black players will be annoyed, because they don't get to play the closed type of game they planned and maybe learned in detail.They will also often believe you are just playing for a draw, which is not the case at all ! This sometimes tempts Black players to underestimate the White game and encourages them to take unwarranted risks. So what we are doing is: We play for a very slight edge and accept equality if Black does a good job, but we will punish overambitious play and pose Black some problems that he often will not expect to happen in the first place - isn't White just playing for a draw ? No, we are not ! }

{ This is already important: We need to play 4 Nf3, it is the only move to pose some problems. Why is that ? On a very general level you could claim that f3 is the best square for the Knight anyway, so we should do this now and only later decide what to do with the Bishop on f1, for example. This is true to some extent, but there are concrete considerations as well. The main alternatives are 4 Bd3 and 4 c4, aiming for IQP play.  The drawback of the immediate 4 c4 is that Black may opt for an active setup involving an early ...Bb4, for example after   4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Bb4 !  , which is fine for him.  We play 4 Nf3 and keep the option of playing c4 at a better moment.  In particular, after   4...Bd6  we go  5.c4.  This way Bb4 is not an attractive option anymore.  Let's have a look at   4.Bd3.  This is a common move, but actually imprecise. Black has the interesting option of playing  4...c5.  Note the similarities to our idea to play 4 Nf3 Bd6 5 c4  Or the simpler   4...Nc6  ,  after which the d4 pawn is attacked. Now  5.c3  is very passive.  And   5.Nf3  allows the pin with  5...Bg4  ,  which is a lot stronger now than after 4 Nf3 Bg4, as we will examine later.  In general, a Black setup with ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 will be OK for Black. We should always try to prevent such a setup in order to pose Black more problems. After 4 Nf3 Black has many moves available. Note that it pays to learn the details for each, but if you forget some detail your position will still be very sound and solid. It is tough to get into trouble with White early on in the Exchange French. }

1. e4 g6
{ The Modern Defence. The main difference between this opening and the Pirc Defence is that Black does not play his Knight to f6 early on. This makes a difference in many ways. One important point is that White is not able to operate with an early Be3/Qd2/ Bh6 manoeuvre. Black also retains the option of developing the Knight to e7, or even h6 in some cases. The downside of Black's game is clearly the lack of development and neglect of central control. Against the Modern, we will opt for a similar setup as against the Pirc. Note that whenever Black plays Nf6 in the next few moves we will transpose to the Pirc. }
2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 a6
{ This looks quite exotic, but without any direct contact between both armies Black is quite flexible with move orders. ...a6 is part of Black's agenda quite often and here starting with this flank action early on is possible.

1. e4 g6
{ The Modern Defence. The main difference between this opening and the Pirc Defence is that Black does not play his Knight to f6 early on. This makes a difference in many ways. One important point is that White is not able to operate with an early Be3/Qd2/ Bh6 manoeuvre. Black also retains the option of developing the Knight to e7, or even h6 in some cases. The downside of Black's game is clearly the lack of development and neglect of central control. Against the Modern, we will opt for a similar setup as against the Pirc. Note that whenever Black plays Nf6 in the next few moves we will transpose to the Pirc. }
2. d4 Nf6
{ The North Sea Defence ! It is dubious, but White needs to know it and must avoid one single line. Let's have a look. }
3. e5 Nh5 4. Nf3
{ The only important point to know about this line is that  4.Be2  d6 !  5.Bxh5  gxh5  6.Qxh5  dxe5  leads, amazingly, to some compensation for Black. White should avoid this and just develop normally. }
4... d6 5. Bc4 d5 6. Be2

2. d4 d6 3. Nc3 c6
{ Instead  3...Bg7  leads to the 2...Bg7 lines.   While  3...Nf6  is a Pirc.  With 3...c6 Black further delays any development. }
4. Be3
{ I always recommend this setup against ...d6/...g6. It is always playable and easy to learn. Now it is hard for Black not to transpose. }
4... b5
{ Instead,  4...Bg7   Or  4...Nf6  would transpose to Modern/Pirc standard move orders. }
5. a3
{ We also use this approach in the Pirc move order to stop b5-b4. We will continue with f2-f4 and go h2-h3, if Black plays Nf6, preventing any Ng4 irritations. From here play will likely transpose elsewhere, as it feels silly for Black to delay normal moves like Bg7 and Nf6 any further. }

1. e4 d6
{ With d6 Black signals his intentions to go either for a King's Fianchetto later, which will lead to the Pirc or Modern Defence, or develop the Bishop to e7 after...e7-e5, which is a refined move order to reach the ancient Philidor's Defence. In general, the whole complex with d6/g6 is full of transpositions. Don't be too intimidated by this fact - White has a strong centre and will have at least a decent position with common sense moves. Against the Pirc/Modern I recommend a dangerous sideline that will often catch Black players unawares. I think this line, involving Be3 and h3, is a serious test for Black's cause anyway, so an unprepared Black player might struggle with his defensive task quite quickly. Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3. It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }

Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3. It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }

1. e4 d6
{ With d6 Black signals his intentions to go either for a King's Fianchetto later, which will lead to the Pirc or Modern Defence, or develop the Bishop to e7 after...e7-e5, which is a refined move order to reach the ancient Philidor's Defence. In general, the whole complex with d6/g6 is full of transpositions. Don't be too intimidated by this fact - White has a strong centre and will have at least a decent position with common sense moves. Against the Pirc/Modern I recommend a dangerous sideline that will often catch Black players unawares. I think this line, involving Be3 and h3, is a serious test for Black's cause anyway, so an unprepared Black player might struggle with his defensive task quite quickly. Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3. It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }

The first one is to continue to hold the centre with moves like h6/Re8/Qc7, and still try to play for b5 ultimately, with b7-b6,a7-a6 as preparatory moves. The second approach is to take on d4 and initiate concrete play. This intention is usually signalled by the move a5, which secures c5 for the d7 Knight after a subsequent capture.

The first one is to continue to hold the centre with moves like h6/Re8/Qc7, and still try to play for b5 ultimately, with b7-b6,a7-a6 as preparatory moves. The second approach is to take on d4 and initiate concrete play. This intention is usually signalled by the move a5, which secures c5 for the d7 Knight after a subsequent capture. If Black goes for the slow waiting game of Plan 1 we should keep the central tension and improve our central support with moves like Ba2 and h3. Moving the Knight to f5 is an important idea as well. Plan 2 requires more concrete play, as we will see. }
8... a5
{ This is usually the start of the exd4 plan. With ....a5 Black gives up on playing ...b5 and instead secures the c5 square for the Knight, after capturing on d4. }
9. Ba2 exd4 10. Nxd4
{ 10.Qxd4  is not bad either, but  10...Nc5  ,  with ...Be6 to come, seems fine for Black. }
10... Nc5 { Black tries to get counterplay against e4. } 11. Bf4
{ A natural developing move, looking at the d6 pawn, as well. } 11... Qb6 12.
Qd2 Re8 13. h3

1. e4 d6
{ With d6 Black signals his intentions to go either for a King's Fianchetto later, which will lead to the Pirc or Modern Defence, or develop the Bishop to e7 after...e7-e5, which is a refined move order to reach the ancient Philidor's Defence. In general, the whole complex with d6/g6 is full of transpositions. Don't be too intimidated by this fact - White has a strong centre and will have at least a decent position with common sense moves. Against the Pirc/Modern I recommend a dangerous sideline that will often catch Black players unawares. I think this line, involving Be3 and h3, is a serious test for Black's cause anyway, so an unprepared Black player might struggle with his defensive task quite quickly. Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3. It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }
2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3

3... Nbd7 4. Nf3
{ This will just transpose to a regular Philidor. This is my recommendation to keep things simple when facing a rare line.  If you actually suspect, before the game, that your opponent is going to play 3...Nbd7, it is worth checking out the aggressive   4.g4 !?  , which is quite dangerous for Black. It is quite complicated, though, so I feel it is easier to transpose to calmer lines, if you are surprised by this system. }

{ With d6 Black signals his intentions to go either for a King's Fianchetto later, which will lead to the Pirc or Modern Defence, or develop the Bishop to e7 after...e7-e5, which is a refined move order to reach the ancient Philidor's Defence. In general, the whole complex with d6/g6 is full of transpositions. Don't be too intimidated by this fact - White has a strong centre and will have at least a decent position with common sense moves. Against the Pirc/Modern I recommend a dangerous sideline that will often catch Black players unawares. I think this line, involving Be3 and h3, is a serious test for Black's cause anyway, so an unprepared Black player might struggle with his defensive task quite quickly. Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3. It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }

There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }
2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3
{ This is a good, flexible move. White still keeps his options open regarding pawn structures, but most of the time White will play with f2-f4, after having seen Black's setup.   The Austrian Attack with  4.f4  is more direct, but also better known to Black players.  Note the Bishop on e3 will make c7-c5 harder to play. }
4... Bg7 5. h3

{ This is a good, flexible move. White still keeps his options open regarding pawn structures, but most of the time White will play with f2-f4, after having seen Black's setup.   The Austrian Attack with  4.f4  is more direct, but also better known to Black players.  Note the Bishop on e3 will make c7-c5 harder to play. }
4... c6
{ Black delays Bg7, because he expects White to go for Qd2 and Bh6. In this case he would save a tempo. This is one of the upsides of a flexible move like Be3. We still have many options and Black needs to take these into account and sometimes will play against ideas that are not that high on our agenda in the first place. 4...c6 is a good idea against the mentioned Qd2 idea, but less valuable versus a setup with f2-f4. }

1. e4 d6
{ With d6 Black signals his intentions to go either for a King's Fianchetto later, which will lead to the Pirc or Modern Defence, or develop the Bishop to e7 after...e7-e5, which is a refined move order to reach the ancient Philidor's Defence. In general, the whole complex with d6/g6 is full of transpositions. Don't be too intimidated by this fact - White has a strong centre and will have at least a decent position with common sense moves. Against the Pirc/Modern I recommend a dangerous sideline that will often catch Black players unawares. I think this line, involving Be3 and h3, is a serious test for Black's cause anyway, so an unprepared Black player might struggle with his defensive task quite quickly. Note that quite often we will play f2-f4 right after Be3 and h3. It should be mentioned that starting with f2-f4, usually on move 4, is possible as well. So why don't we start with that ? There are two good reasons: the first one is that Be3, first, makes it more difficult for Black to strike at the centre with c7-c5, a strategy that is very common after the early f2-f4. The second and more practical reason is that Black players will have likely looked at the early f2-f4 more, as it is perceived as the main line. Against the Philidor, I suggest playing the main line. It is easy to remember and quite comfortable for White, even though Black is certainly very solidly placed. }

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian Defence. Black immediately defines the central pawn structure by forcing the trade of d-pawn against White's e-pawn. The coming pawn structure is quite typical for other openings as well, in particular there are similarities with the Caro-Kann. The Scandinavian is quite popular at club level, but not seen frequently in top events. What is the reason ? Well, the top players usually just want to force a draw with Black or, in some concrete cases, play for a win if the tournament situation demands it. The Scandinavian is unsuitable for either scenario: Black will often simply get a position that is just very slightly worse and that cannot be immediately drawn by some forced line. -On the other hand it is not particularly suited for drumming up some crazy complications, either. An additional issue is that Black will give up the Bishop pair, frequently, which is an important factor for strong players. These considerations are not as relevant at club level where Black will usually get a playable, if slightly worse position, without much learning effort. This is also the reason why Chessable Co-Founder IM John Bartholomew recommends the Scandinavian and has released a popular repertoire about it.

{ There are some interesting ideas here in delaying or omitting this move altogether, but I like to recommend something more classical for our repertoire. Going d2-d4, and Nf3 later, certainly makes a lot of sense. }
4... e5
{ Black ignores some opening principles in the first 4 moves - moving the Queen around and then opening up the position in the centre feels wrong. }
5. Nf3 Bg4
{ This is the most popular move here and worth checking, as the refutation is not well known and rarely played. }
6. Bc4
{ This quite logical developing move has only been played 5 times out of 128 total games with this position. Stockfish already evaluates this as winning for White, which is probably true for engine standards. In human play it is still tricky, but Black certainly has the tougher task ahead of him. The simple threat is now to take on f7, followed by Ng5+. }

{ This was the second serious threat, besides Bxf7+. The knight jump to d5 will be deadly now. }

{ The Scandinavian Defence. Black immediately defines the central pawn structure by forcing the trade of d-pawn against White's e-pawn. The coming pawn structure is quite typical for other openings as well, in particular there are similarities with the Caro-Kann. The Scandinavian is quite popular at club level, but not seen frequently in top events. What is the reason ? Well, the top players usually just want to force a draw with Black or, in some concrete cases, play for a win if the tournament situation demands it. The Scandinavian is unsuitable for either scenario: Black will often simply get a position that is just very slightly worse and that cannot be immediately drawn by some forced line. -On the other hand it is not particularly suited for drumming up some crazy complications, either. An additional issue is that Black will give up the Bishop pair, frequently, which is an important factor for strong players. These considerations are not as relevant at club level where Black will usually get a playable, if slightly worse position, without much learning effort. This is also the reason why Chessable Co-Founder IM John Bartholomew recommends the Scandinavian and has released a popular repertoire about it. With White we will get a comfortable position against the Scandinavian most of the time, but don't expect too large of an advantage - Black's structure is quite solid. }
2. exd5 Qxd5
{ I think this is probably better than Nf6. Against the Knight move White gets a slightly better position without any effort at all. }
3. Nc3
{ The most natural and probably best move. It has one drawback: White places the Knight in front of the c-pawn, so White does not manage to get the d4/c4 pawn duo early on  (compare with Nf6)  .   I always had some interest in  3.Nf3  ,  trying to delay Nb1-c3 until White has played c2-c4 first. However, nowadays this approach seems to be defanged by  3...Bg4  4.Be2  Nc6  etc. as also demonstrated in John Bartholomew's Scandinavian Repertoire on Chessable.  After 3 Nc3 Black has a choice of Queen moves. We will play with d2-d4 and Nf3 against all of them, in most cases followed by Bc4. A common theme is that Black develops with Bg4 or Bf5, against which we will often try to play with Kingside expansion. Let's check all the Queen moves, one by one. }

{ The Scandinavian Defence. Black immediately defines the central pawn structure by forcing the trade of d-pawn against White's e-pawn. The coming pawn structure is quite typical for other openings as well, in particular there are similarities with the Caro-Kann. The Scandinavian is quite popular at club level, but not seen frequently in top events. What is the reason ? Well, the top players usually just want to force a draw with Black or, in some concrete cases, play for a win if the tournament situation demands it. The Scandinavian is unsuitable for either scenario: Black will often simply get a position that is just very slightly worse and that cannot be immediately drawn by some forced line. -On the other hand it is not particularly suited for drumming up some crazy complications, either. An additional issue is that Black will give up the Bishop pair, frequently, which is an important factor for strong players. These considerations are not as relevant at club level where Black will usually get a playable, if slightly worse position, without much learning effort. This is also the reason why Chessable Co-Founder IM John Bartholomew recommends the Scandinavian and has released a popular repertoire about it. With White we will get a comfortable position against the Scandinavian most of the time, but don't expect too large of an advantage - Black's structure is quite solid. }

{ The Scandinavian Defence. Black immediately defines the central pawn structure by forcing the trade of d-pawn against White's e-pawn. The coming pawn structure is quite typical for other openings as well, in particular there are similarities with the Caro-Kann. The Scandinavian is quite popular at club level, but not seen frequently in top events. What is the reason ? Well, the top players usually just want to force a draw with Black or, in some concrete cases, play for a win if the tournament situation demands it. The Scandinavian is unsuitable for either scenario: Black will often simply get a position that is just very slightly worse and that cannot be immediately drawn by some forced line. -On the other hand it is not particularly suited for drumming up some crazy complications, either. An additional issue is that Black will give up the Bishop pair, frequently, which is an important factor for strong players. These considerations are not as relevant at club level where Black will usually get a playable, if slightly worse position, without much learning effort. This is also the reason why Chessable Co-Founder IM John Bartholomew recommends the Scandinavian and has released a popular repertoire about it. With White we will get a comfortable position against the Scandinavian most of the time, but don't expect too large of an advantage - Black's structure is quite solid. }
2. exd5 Qxd5
{ I think this is probably better than Nf6. Against the Knight move White gets a slightly better position without any effort at all. }
3. Nc3
{ The most natural and probably best move. It has one drawback: White places the Knight in front of the c-pawn, so White does not manage to get the d4/c4 pawn duo early on  (compare with Nf6)  .   I always had some interest in  3.Nf3  ,  trying to delay Nb1-c3 until White has played c2-c4 first. However, nowadays this approach seems to be defanged by  3...Bg4  4.Be2  Nc6  etc. as also demonstrated in John Bartholomew's Scandinavian Repertoire on Chessable.  After 3 Nc3 Black has a choice of Queen moves. We will play with d2-d4 and Nf3 against all of them, in most cases followed by Bc4. A common theme is that Black develops with Bg4 or Bf5, against which we will often try to play with Kingside expansion. Let's check all the Queen moves, one by one. }
3... Qd8
{ This is currently Black's most respectable choice. Black just retreats the Queen on the safest square and argues that the lost time is compensated by White's slightly misplaced Knight. In many cases Black gets very close to equality, but White, more often than not, keeps a slight edge. This is mostly due to Black giving up the Bishop pair by trading on f3. The Qd8-variation is IM John Bartholomew's choice for his Chessable repertoire, so let's have a look at how our respective recommendations fare against one another. }
4. d4 c6
{ This has a subtle point. If we go  5.Nf3  Black may now play  5...Bg4  , and after  6.h3  Bxf3  7.Qxf3  grab on  7...Qxd4 !  This is risky for Black, but I think just going 5 Bc4 instead is trickier for Black to handle anyway. }
5. Bc4 Bf5
{ This is the natural looking move that is, in fact, rather questionable. } 6.
g4
{ Here  6.Bxf7+ !?  Kxf7  7.Qf3  leads to a very strong attack, but is tough to analyze.  It's not a very practical line to learn for a rather rare move order, so I suggest something aggressive that is less dependent on move-by-move knowledge. }
6... Bg6 7. Nge2
{ This is played to answer h7-h5 with the annoying Knight jump to f4. } 7...
Nf6 8. Nf4 e5 { Otherwise h2-h4 will be very annoying to meet. } 9. Nxg6 hxg6
10. Be3
{ And White is comfortably better, the Bishop on c4 is particularly strong. } *

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian Defence. Black immediately defines the central pawn structure by forcing the trade of d-pawn against White's e-pawn. The coming pawn structure is quite typical for other openings as well, in particular there are similarities with the Caro-Kann. The Scandinavian is quite popular at club level, but not seen frequently in top events. What is the reason ? Well, the top players usually just want to force a draw with Black or, in some concrete cases, play for a win if the tournament situation demands it. The Scandinavian is unsuitable for either scenario: Black will often simply get a position that is just very slightly worse and that cannot be immediately drawn by some forced line. -On the other hand it is not particularly suited for drumming up some crazy complications, either. An additional issue is that Black will give up the Bishop pair, frequently, which is an important factor for strong players. These considerations are not as relevant at club level where Black will usually get a playable, if slightly worse position, without much learning effort. This is also the reason why Chessable Co-Founder IM John Bartholomew recommends the Scandinavian and has released a popular repertoire about it. With White we will get a comfortable position against the Scandinavian most of the time, but don't expect too large of an advantage - Black's structure is quite solid. }
2. exd5 Qxd5
{ I think this is probably better than Nf6. Against the Knight move White gets a slightly better position without any effort at all. }
3. Nc3
{ The most natural and probably best move. It has one drawback: White places the Knight in front of the c-pawn, so White does not manage to get the d4/c4 pawn duo early on  (compare with Nf6)  .   I always had some interest in  3.Nf3  ,  trying to delay Nb1-c3 until White has played c2-c4 first. However, nowadays this approach seems to be defanged by  3...Bg4  4.Be2  Nc6  etc. as also demonstrated in John Bartholomew's Scandinavian Repertoire on Chessable.  After 3 Nc3 Black has a choice of Queen moves. We will play with d2-d4 and Nf3 against all of them, in most cases followed by Bc4.

{ This is an important point. Against the Hippo we should always try to put 3 pawns in the centre c/d/e, like here, or d/e/f, against the Pirc Defence move orders. The main point of having three pawns in the centre is to support the advance of the d or e pawn. If you intend to play d4-d5 it is excellent to have c4 to support this. If you want to play e4-e5, it is the mirror image situation with the f-pawn. It is tough to analyze the Hippo move-by-move, but I want to show a typical sample sequence. }

On the other hand, taking with the c-pawn is sharper, but has been under a cloud for quite a while due to a certain setup that we will investigate soon.

1. e4 Nf6
{ This is the most important opening amongst the rare lines - Alekhine's Defence. It is actually not easy at all to get an edge against this provocative move that aims to lure the White central pawns forward in order to attack them later. }
2. e5
{ This must be best.   But I need to mention that I checked  2.Nc3  as well. The main reason to consider this alternative is that we play the position after  2...e5  3.Nf3  anyway, arising from the Petroff/Russian Defence move order.   However, after  2.Nc3  , the issue is  2...d5  , after which I don't see anything too promising. You can investigate  3.e5  , but after  3...Nfd7  I didn't see anything better than to allow a transposition into the French Defence - and it is a line we don't have in our repertoire.  Long story short - just push the e-pawn ! }
2... Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4
{ Theoreticians usually view  4.Nf3  as the critical move, and I agree.  The practical problem behind 4 Nf3 is that Black chooses the defensive setup, so you need to be prepared for a wide range of lines. In the 'Playing 1 e4' book by John Shaw the author devotes a huge chunk of the book to fighting the Alekhine's with this line, but I don't think it is very practical to learn all the details when you will get the Alekhine's once in a blue moon. Our choice still carries some punch while being easier to learn. }
4... Nb6 5. exd6
{ The Exchange Variation of the Alekhine is our repertoire choice. It still puts some considerable pressure on Black without being overly theoretical. Now Black has a very fundamental choice between recapturing with either c-pawn or e-pawn. There is a general consensus that taking with the e-pawn is solid for Black, but White usually should have a slight pull. On the other hand, taking with the c-pawn is sharper, but has been under a cloud for quite a while due to a certain setup that we will investigate soon. I think this is actually quite playable for Black, but White can still pose some serious problems, of course. Let's have a look. }
5... exd6
{ The solid, conservative move. The symmetrical structure should be a little bit better, for White, as we have more space and the more active pieces. A way to view this position type is to call it a Petroff/Russian Defence structure with the Black Knight being slightly offside, on b6. }
6. Nc3
{ Our setup includes Nc3/ Bd3/Nge2. The main point of this setup is to make the Black c8 Bishop look a bit silly. Black usually tries to pin the f3 Knight by Bg4, so we avoid Nf3 completely. The Nge2 based setup has some more concrete ideas that we will investigate now. }
6... Be7
{ The most popular move, preparing to castle. Instead Nc6 will often just transpose to the same positions. }
7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Nge2
{ Instead,  8.Be3  would transpose to the lines we looked at via 6... Nc6 7 Be3. Keeping the Bishop flexible is even more promising for White here. }

1. e4 Nf6
{ This is the most important opening amongst the rare lines - Alekhine's Defence. It is actually not easy at all to get an edge against this provocative move that aims to lure the White central pawns forward in order to attack them later. }
2. e5
{ This must be best.   But I need to mention that I checked  2.Nc3  as well. The main reason to consider this alternative is that we play the position after  2...e5  3.Nf3  anyway, arising from the Petroff/Russian Defence move order.   However, after  2.Nc3  , the issue is  2...d5  , after which I don't see anything too promising. You can investigate  3.e5  , but after  3...Nfd7  I didn't see anything better than to allow a transposition into the French Defence - and it is a line we don't have in our repertoire.  Long story short - just push the e-pawn ! }
2... Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4
{ Theoreticians usually view  4.Nf3  as the critical move, and I agree.  The practical problem behind 4 Nf3 is that Black chooses the defensive setup, so you need to be prepared for a wide range of lines. In the 'Playing 1 e4' book by John Shaw the author devotes a huge chunk of the book to fighting the Alekhine's with this line, but I don't think it is very practical to learn all the details when you will get the Alekhine's once in a blue moon. Our choice still carries some punch while being easier to learn. }
4... Nb6 5. exd6
{ The Exchange Variation of the Alekhine is our repertoire choice. It still puts some considerable pressure on Black without being overly theoretical. Now Black has a very fundamental choice between recapturing with either c-pawn or e-pawn. There is a general consensus that taking with the e-pawn is solid for Black, but White usually should have a slight pull. On the other hand, taking with the c-pawn is sharper, but has been under a cloud for quite a while due to a certain setup that we will investigate soon. I think this is actually quite playable for Black, but White can still pose some serious problems, of course. Let's have a look. }
5... cxd6 6. Nc3
{ The recapture with the c-pawn is far more ambitious compared to the symmetrical choice. Black intends to fianchetto his Bishop on g7, putting pressure on White's central pawn formation. White now has a very dangerous setup available, based on early Queenside development with Nc3/Be3/Rc1 and b3. The idea of this so-called Voronezh variation is to clear the long diagonal and prepare to play d4-d5 at the right moment. With a Black Bishop on g7 this advance needs to be prepared properly. }
6... Nc6 7. d5
{ Of course  7.Be3  is not bad either.  But here 7 d5 is just excellent for White. }
7... Ne5 8. f4 Ned7 9. Nf3 g6 10. Be2 Bg7 11. Nd4
{ White has a dominant position in the centre. } 11... O-O 12. O-O Nc5 13. f5

At least there is no immediate disaster, but playing against the Bishop pair and with weak dark squares is no fun. I selected this game to annotate because it shows very nicely how to exploit these long term advantages. }
10... Ngf6
{ Instead   10...Nc5  was played in Anand-Ivanchuk, Monte Carlo Rapid 1996. Sometimes even top players mess up move orders and stumble into bad lines.  11.f3  Be6  12.Be2  Nf6  13.Nd2  Nfd7  14.Nc4  f6  15.Be3  Bxc4  16.Bxc4  White is better, but Black managed to hold a draw. }
11. f3

11... b5
{ This makes things even worse for Black as Vescovi nicely demonstrates in the game.   11...Nc5  was making it more difficult for White.  12.Nd2  Now Black should just wait with a move like 12... Ne6. If he plays  Be6 ?!  13.b4 !  is a nice idea to take note of.  b5  14.Bxb5  cxb5  15.bxc5  Nd7  16.Be3  Rc8  17.Rab1  a6  18.c4  And White will be up a pawn in this endgame. }
12. Be2 Nb6 13. Nd2 Be6 14. Rfc1
{ This is the key concept to remember. The pawn push c2-c4 will open up the Queenside to White's advantage, making full use of the Bishop pair.  By the way: this position had been reached before and the later World Championship challenger Veselin Topalov went for a similar approach.   14.b3  Nfd7  15.Rfc1  f6  16.Be3  Ke7  17.c4  bxc4  18.Nxc4  Nxc4  19.Bxc4  Bxc4  20.Rxc4  With a clear advantage in V.Topalov - Z.Franco Ocampos,Z, Pamplona 1994. }

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ I recommend to reach the Scotch Four Knights via 3. Nc3, but the 'regular' Scotch move order is an excellent option to expand your repertoire once you have gained some experience with the Scotch Four Knights. }
3... exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6
{ The main line.   But  4...Bc5  enjoys a good reputation as well. Against this move White has a wide range of options, including the solid  5.Nxc6.   And the sharper idea to play  5.Nb3  ,  intending to play Nc3/Qe2/Be3 soon to castle long. }
5. Nc3
{ This transposes to our repertoire. Here White has the additional option to play   5.Nxc6  bxc6  and now White has a choice between the sharp and heavily analysed  6.e5.   The tricky move  6.Qe2   And  6.Bd3  , which is quite similar in nature to the Scotch Four Knights. }
5... Bb4 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O d5 9. exd5 cxd5 10. h3 c6
{ This is the main line by far. It is very logical to protect the d5 pawn and thus add more flexibility to the pieces. Covering the b5 square is also very useful as Black will most likely improve his Bishop with Bd6 later and wants to avoid Nb5 in response. }
11. Qf3 Bd6 12. Re1
{ I recommend to play  12.Bf4  , but the difference is minor. In fact, we will transpose to a position examined in the theoretical section very soon. }
12... h6 13. Bf4
{ @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b6/2NB1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 11@@EndFEN@@  This position is part of our repertoire via   11...h6  12.Bf4  Bd6  13.Re1.  White is happy to trade the Bishops in these structures.  There are multiple reasons for that. On a very general note White's pawn structure is favorable and trading minor pieces should emphasize that  (similar to traiding in IQP and hanging pawns scenarios)  . More concretely, White may be able to fix the pawns on light squares and use the c5 square for a Knight - this is only imaginable without the Bishop on d6. Another common scenario is White pushing c2-c4 and taking on d5 later to give Black the IQP. Again this is more favorable without the Bishops, with better control over the key squares d4, c5 and e5. }
13... Bxf4
{ The main continuation is   13...Rb8  , as examined in the theoretical section. I think this is more precise than Anand's move which gives White more control over the dark squares. It is not a serious mistake of course, but little things tend to add up to real problems for Black in the main line Scotch Four Knights. }
14. Qxf4 Be6 15. Ne2
{ The Knight is clearly misplaced on c3, so regrouping it is a standard manouvre. By removing the Knight the pawn lever c2-c4 also comes into play.  Stockfish suggests   15.b4  instead, aiming for a blockade on the dark squares. This is also going to be eternally better for White, but only very, very slightly. Wang Hao's move is more flexible regarding the pawn structure, keeping the option c2-c4. Nevertheless, let's look at 15 b4 some more.  Qb8  16.Qd4  Qd6  17.Na4  a5  18.a3  axb4  19.axb4  This is the type of position White will get after 15 b4. Black is limited to just sitting in a slightly passive position, but it is difficult for White to improve with a straightforward plan. Still, this position type is extremely safe for White and excellent if you want to play with the draw in hand. }
15... Qb8
{ 15...c5  A principled move, but Black's pawn structure remains vulnerable.  16.c3  This is not the only option of course, but I like the regrouping illustrated by the following line.  Re8  17.Qd2  a5  It is not clear that this move is necessary, but Black has to watch out for b2-b4 and often prefers to make this harder to play for White.  18.Nf4  This was White's intention. The Knight looks at d5 and e6 now.  Bd7  19.Rxe8+  Bxe8  20.Be2  This Bishop is directed to f3, putting more pressure on the centre. White is still exerting some pressure while running no risks at all. }
16. b3 Qxf4
{ This feels a bit rushed.   16...Re8  was keeping the tension and is more precise.  17.Qxb8  Not forced obviously. You may also play with Qd2, Nf4 and later aim for c2-c4.  Raxb8  18.Nf4  Compared to the game Black has gained time. It is still not clear if he has equalized completely though. }
17. Nxf4 Rfe8
{ 17...Bd7  18.c4  This typical pawn lever will improve White's structural edge even more. Black will get a second isolated pawn, either on d5 or c6. This coming endgame is very one-sided and gives excellent chances to press for a win. }
18. Nxe6
{ Keep it simple ! After this trade the remaining minor pieces favor White - the Bishop is just a lot stronger than the Knight. }
18... fxe6
{ The alternative   18...Rxe6  does not improve Black's task.  19.c4  Again this move to attack the pawn on d5. White's Bishop is a lot stronger here, with its ability to support play on both sides of the board. An additional bonus is the protection of the possible entry square c2 and e2 - not so relevant at the moment, but it might matter later. }
19. Bg6 { An inviting post for the Bishop. } 19... Re7 20. c4
{ White plays this anyway, even without the White Bishop being able to recapture on c4. }
20... Nd7
{ 20...dxc4  A clear concession that leads to an excellent position for White.  21.bxc4  White has ideas like Ra1-d1-d6 and Re5 to improve and increase the pressure on Black's pawns. }
21. Rac1 { The c-file will open up in short oder. } 21... Nf8 22. Bd3 Kf7 23.
cxd5 cxd5
{ A good moment to asses the current situation. White has some pluses that add up. Better pawn structure  (two pawn islands vs. three)  with the prospect to create an outside passed pawn, better minor piece and control of the only open file. Black should still be able to defend the position, but it is not fun to play at all. }
24. b4
{ Moving the majority makes a lot of sense of course.   But I think  24.f4  would have been good as well. It helps to fix the Black centre and enables Kf2-e3 etc. }
24... Nd7 25. Rc6 Nf6
{ This natural looking move is Black's first serious mistake. He was under some nagging pressure, but it was not yet a serious issue.   25...Nb6 !  This was the better defence, stopping the a-pawn for the time being. White is still for choice, but at least there is no obvious way forward. White should improve with moves like  26.Kf1  and be patient. }
26. a4
{ Now White's play is a lot quicker on the queenside while Black has no good counterplay. }
26... e5
{ It is very understandable that Anand does not want to wait forever and goes for an active looking move.   Still it seems that not moving the pawns in the centre was more tenacious, for example with  26...Rb8. }
27. f3 { This allows Kf2 and makes ...e4 less attractive for Black. } 27... Rd8
28. Kf2
{ Here   28.a5  was even stronger. After  e4  29.fxe4  dxe4  30.Bc4+  Kf8  31.b5  White's advantage is nearing decisive proportions. }
28... e4 29. fxe4 dxe4
{ 29...Nxe4+  30.Kg1  This will be very hard to defend for Black - Knights are notoriously bad at fighting outside passers... and this scenario will occur. }
30. Bc4+ Kg6
{ 30...Ke8 !  was a better try. After  31.Ke3  now  Nd5+  is possible, forcing the minor pieces off. This certainly helps Black, but it is still a long way to draw after for instance  32.Bxd5  Rxd5  33.Rc8+  Kf7  34.Rf1+  Kg6  35.Rc6+  Kh7  36.Rc3  and the more active King is a serious plus for White. }
31. Ke3
{ 31.a5  This was a better choice, but Black's possible counterplay was tough to anticipate. After 31 a5 White should win comfortably. }
31... Kh7
{ 31...Kg5 !  This engine suggestion is surprisingly strong. Black's idea is to simply invade with Kh4-g3 ! Not the most natural plan ever and difficult to find in what was likely a time trouble scenario.  32.Rc5+   32.a5  Nd5+  33.Bxd5  Rxd5  should also draw for Black.  32...Kh4  33.Kf2  Rd2+  34.Be2  e3+  And again Black's sudden activity should secure the draw. }
32. Rc5 { In order to avoid the check on d5. White is back in control. } 32...
Red7
{ 32...Rb7  was a bit tougher, but I don't think Black will hold in the end. It is just too difficult to defend.  33.b5  Nd7  34.Rd5  Rc8  35.Rd4  Nf6  36.Rb1  This is a possible continuation after 32... Rb7. White is still clearly better. }
33. a5 Rd2 34. Re2 Rd1 35. a6 { Fixing the target on a7. } 35... Nd7 36. Rc7
Ne5 37. Be6 Kg6 38. Rxa7
{ Finally White has transformed his strategic advantage into material - now the a-pawn will decide the game quite easily for White. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ Boris Gelfand played the Sveshnikov in his 2012 World Championship Match against Vishy Anand very successfully. In fact Anand quickly switched to the Rossolimo and managed to pose more problems. }
3... e6 4. O-O
{ 4.Bxc6  bxc6  5.b3  was Anand's choice in the match and a good alternative if you like to add something new once you mastered the lines presented here. }
4... Nge7 5. Re1 a6 6. Bf1 d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. d4 Nf6 9. Be3 cxd4
{ Some months after this game Gelfand tried to improve with   9...Be7  in V.Anand - B.Gelfand, Tal Memorial 2013.  Anand played  10.c4  , while   10.dxc5  is my recommendation in the theoretical section. Both moves are fine and give White chances for a small pull. }
10. Nxd4 Bd7 11. c4 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Bc6 13. Nc3
{ This setup is very common in the 6 Bf1 line. White has some space advantage and his Queenside majority is a bit easier to utilize than Black's extra pawn on the Kingside/centre. Objectively speaking Black is about equal, but I think White's ideas are clearer and thus he has the easier task ahead. Carlsen beautifully uses White's assets in this game. }
13... Be7 14. a3 a5
{ The type of decision that you can burn serious time on. Pawns don't go backwards, so Black had to decide if it was worth to weaken the Queenside in order to stop White's b2-b4 push.  I would have been reluctant to play ....a5, but the alternative   14...O-O  15.b4  is also more comfortable for White. The following idea is worth remembering: after for example  Qd7  16.Ra2 !?  Rad8  17.Rd2  is an elegant way to use the Rook in the centre. }
15. Qd3 { Connecting rooks and preparing to go to g3. } 15... O-O
{ 15...a4  This looks interesting, trying to freeze the White Queenside and maybe use the a5 square for the Queen. There are some issues though.  16.Rad1  O-O  17.Qg3  Qa5 ?  This fails. Black should play 17... Qc8 and limit the damage to a slight disadvantage.  18.Nd5 !  and Black is close to lost here. }
16. Rad1 Qc7 17. Be5 Qb6 18. Qg3 Rfd8 19. Rxd8+ Qxd8 20. Rd1
{ The play has developed quite logically so far. White has the more active pieces and Black tries to trade down to reduce the pressure. }
20... Qb6
{ This turns out to be a serious mistake.  Black should have played   20...Qf8  according to the engines. However the coming complications are very difficult for a human player to assess.  21.b4  This is critical of course.  axb4  22.axb4  Nh5  Otherwise b4-b5 will be very annoying. Black needs to go for the coming sequence.  23.Qh3  Bxb4  24.Qxh5  f6  Black will get the piece back, but White has more than one critical test now.  25.Bd3   25.Bd4  e5  26.Bxe5  fxe5  27.Qxe5  is a different way to be a pawn up against the Bishop pair. Black has enough compensation here.  25...g6  26.Qh3  fxe5  27.Qxe6+  Kh8  28.Qxe5+  Qg7  29.Qxg7+  Kxg7  30.Ne4  Ra3  31.f3  And again Black has enough for the pawn to hold. }
21. Bd4 Qb3 { this is forced as   21...Qa6  22.b4  is awful for Black. } 22.
Rd3 { Nd5 is the threat now- Black has no choice. } 22... Qc2 23. b4 axb4 24.
axb4 Nh5
{ Again the only move.  After something slow like   24...h6  White wins.  25.b5  Be8  26.Ne4  Kh7  27.Rf3  with a deadly attack. }
25. Qe5 Bf6 26. Qxh5 Bxd4 27. Rxd4 Qxc3
{ There was no real alternative along the way after Black had played 20... Qb6. Is Black's position all that bad ? }
28. Qa5
{ It is bad ! What a shot - Black's weak back rank is exploited nicely with this Queen sacrifice. }
28... Rf8
{ The rook is forced back into this passive position, no other move available. }
29. Qb6 e5 30. Rd1
{ Here   30.Rd8  g6  31.b5  Be4  32.Rd7  was more precise. Black is in dire straits and will very like lose a pawn soon. }
30... g6 31. b5 Be4 32. Qf6
{ 32.Rd7  would have been stronger, transposing to the note to move 30. } 32...
h5
{ Gelfand should have played   32...Bf5  here. White has excellent winning chances anyway, but this is not so easy to convert.  33.h3  The obvious   33.Rd5  might fail to do the job.  Be6 !  34.Qxe5  Qxe5  35.Rxe5  Rc8  36.c5  Kf8  and Black will hold.  33...Be6  34.Qe7  Qc2  35.Rd8  Rxd8  36.Qxd8+  Kg7  37.Qd6  Qe4  38.c5  Bd5  this is the important defensive resourse.  39.c6  bxc6  40.b6  c5  41.Qxc5  Bb7  I am not sure if White is able to win this. b7 is very safely blockaded. }
33. h4 Bf5 34. Rd5 Qc1
{ Black has to give up the e5 pawn.  just covering it won't help as White just pushes the c-pawn.   34...Re8  35.c5  Qb2  36.c6  and so on. }
35. Qxe5 Be6 36. Rd4 Ra8 37. Qe2 Kh7 38. Rd1 Qc3 39. Qe4 Ra1
{ 39...Ra7  puts up more resistance, but after  40.Qf4  , with Rc1 and c5 next in mind, White should win anyway. }
40. Rxa1 Qxa1 41. c5 Qc3 42. Qxb7 Qe1
{ Gelfand tries for some play on the back rank. After   42...Qxc5  43.b6  White wins in a purely technical way, for instance  Kg7  44.Qb8  Bd5  45.Qe5+  f6  46.Qc7+  Qxc7  47.bxc7  Bb7  48.Bb5  Bc8  49.Be8 }
43. b6 { 43.Qe7  was quicker, but the result is not in doubt. } 43... Bc4 44.
Qf3 Qxf1+
{ 44...Bxf1  45.Qxf7+  Kh8  46.Qf6+  Kh7  47.Kh2  also wins convincingly for White. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Bd7
{ Some months before Anand had tried   3...Nd7  against Sergei Tiviakov and lost a true nightmare of a game.  4.d4  I rejected this move for the repertoire because it is too close to an open Sicilian for my taste. There are no objective drawbacks to Tiviakov's choice.  cxd4  5.Qxd4  a6  6.Bxd7+  Bxd7  7.c4  e5  8.Qd3  h6  9.Nc3  Nf6  10.O-O  Be7  11.a4  b6  12.b3  And White had excellent control in S.Tiviakov-V.Anand, German Bundesliga 2012. }
4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 g6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bg7 9. f3 Qc7
{ At the time when this game was played this move was still quite rare. In recent years there have been some new games that didn't change the assement much. This line is between slightly better for White and equal. I'd always prefer White because of the space, but Black is very solid of course. }
10. b3 Qa5 11. Bb2 Nc6 12. O-O O-O 13. Nce2
{ 13.Kh1  is a good alternative that has been tried in some games. With the Bishop being on b2 the a7-g1 diagonal is more vulnerable than usual. The more common position is on e3, where this is less of a problem. Carlsen plays Kh1 just two moves later, it just is part of White's general setup at some point. }
13... Rfd8 { Anand aims for a d6-d5 break. } 14. Bc3
{ This is actually a crucial decision as the following sequence is quite forced.  Again going for   14.Kh1  was a way to prevent the d6-d5 break that Black manages in the game. }
14... Qb6 15. Kh1 { No choice as e7-e5 was threatened. } 15... d5
{ Black has managed his key break with some nice tactics to support it. } 16.
Nxc6
{ 16.exd5  Nxd5  17.cxd5  Rxd5  was the justification of the d5 break. Black will win the piece back with a good game due to the Rook vs Queen situation on the d-file. Carlsen's move is the only way to ask some questions. }
16... bxc6 17. Qe1
{ The crucial move to gain a tempo. White removes the Queen off the d-file and threatens Ba5 at the same time. }
17... Rdc8
{ It is tough to say why Anand rejected to play the more normal looking   17...a5  If White plays in a similar fashion to the game it will be much easier to defend.  18.e5  Ne8  Instead   18...Nd7  is probably less precise.  19.e6  d4  20.Bd2  Nc5  21.exf7+  Kxf7  22.f4 !  An instructive move, combining f4-f5 ideas with improving the Knight via g1 to f3 in some cases. I'd rather be White here, but things are not clear as Black has some assets as well.  And now  19.e6 ?!  is actually dubious because of  f5 !  The rook is just so much better on d8 now instead of c8. It supports the d-pawn and might even help to win e6 soon. White should avoid the e6-push here and rather play a slow move like 19 f4, with about equal chances. }
18. e5 Ne8 19. e6
{ Going for it ! Carlsen also could have played the calm   19.f4  with a comfortable, slightly better game. }
19... fxe6
{ After this Black's defensive task becomes very difficult in a practical game, as we will witness.  The engine still evaluates   19...f5  as roughly equal. It is a tough call to allow the pawn to stay on the board, but White has no clear idea how to drum up play connected to it.  20.cxd5  cxd5  21.Bxg7  Nxg7  22.Nf4  Qd6  and it's about equal. }
20. Nf4 Bxc3 21. Qxc3
{ The doubled pawns are problematic for Black in more than one way. They are weak themselves, they leave weak squares  (like e5)  open for White and they disturb the communication between both sides of the board. The Black King is on the Kingside and it is not so easy to get defenders closer to it as the pawns are in the way. }
21... d4 22. Qd2
{ It is quite likely that Carlsen at this point already had seen the key ideas about to occur in the next moves. The Queen aims for h6. }
22... c5 23. Rae1 Ng7 24. g4
{ Not a difficult move, but a very aesthetically pleasing one. Black's Knight is on a dead end. }
24... Rc6
{ The most resilient defence was probably   24...Rf8  Now the attacking plan seen in the game is not winning anymore.  25.Nh3  Qc6  26.Qh6  Rxf3  27.Kg1  Rxf1+  28.Rxf1  Qe4  And Black is holding. White is still somewhat better after  29.Qxh7+  Kxh7  30.Ng5+  Kg8  31.Nxe4  but it's not over yet. It needs to be mentioned that 25 Nh3 is not mandatory of course. Moves like 25. Nd3 or 25. Re5 are promising as well, keeping the pressure up. }
25. Nh3
{ Black's king is in deep trouble now. It's too late to save the game. } 25...
Ne8 26. Qh6 Nf6 27. Ng5
{ White is going to pile up on the e6-pawn next with Re5. At the same time, Nxh7 becomes a serious idea as well. }
27... d3 28. Re5 Kh8
{ After a non-move like   28...a5  White wins with  29.Nxh7  Nxh7  30.Qxg6+  Kh8  31.Rh5 }
29. Rd1 { Just picking up the lone d-pawn. } 29... Qa6 30. a4
{ The direct  30.Rxd3  was winning as well.  But Black is entirely defenceless after the game move. White will win d3, next e6 and has an attack on the King on top. Anand resigned at this point, somewhat early for most people's standards. He is, however, without any active ideas and Carlsen has easy winning moves, so it is quite understandable. }

{ Black has quite a wide choice of move orders here. One upside for White in this line is that you have a standard setup, almost regardless of what Black is doing. You place the Queen on e2, Bishop to f4 or g5 and usually castle short and centralize the Rooks - the most natural placement you can imagine. }
9... b6 10. Bf4 { White is still not committing to castling to either side. }
10... Bb7 11. dxc5
{ The White d-pawn will very likely be exchanged against Black's c-pawn anyway, so White goes ahead and gives Black the choice how to recapture. }
11... bxc5
{ A surprising decision, at least in my eyes. There are positions where the Black formation with a,c and e-pawn are fine, because the open files provide counterplay. Here however White will have an excellent Knight on c4 that covers b2 and Black's inferior structure is not easily repaired.  I would have expected   11...Bxc5  12.Rd1  Nbd7  13.O-O  and I'd slighty prefer White but Black is solid. }
12. Rd1 Qa5
{ The Black Queen will be offside in some moves, but this still looks like the most natural move.  Instead   12...Nbd7  13.O-O  Qc8  Looks quite passive and White has the simple plan to shift pieces to the Kingside, for example starting with  14.Ne3 }
13. Na3 Nbd7 14. O-O
{ Black now has to worry about Nc4, but at the same time he does not want to move the d7 Knight as it guards the e5 square as well. }
14... Nb6
{ Black decides to concede the e5 square.  Against   14...Bd5  the engine points out the excellent resource  15.Nd2 !  Now grabbing on a2 leads to serious problems.  Bxa2  16.Nac4  Bxc4  17.Nxc4  Qd8  18.Ne5  and White is much better. The threat is to win material on the d-file. In fact Black only has one way to avoid an immediate loss.

15. Ne5 Nbd5 16. Bg3 Rac8 17. Nac4
{ White's opening concept was successful. He's got very active pieces and the excellent posts on c4 and e5 for his Knights. }
17... Qa4
{ 17...Qd8  is not a happy move to play, but Black needs defenders near the King. }
18. Rfe1
{ Getting the rook centralized is very natural, but there was an even better alternative.   18.f4 !  White's play in this opening is mostly based on piece play, so pawn pushes like that are not very common. Here f4 is very strong, as f4-f5 would open up the kingside for the attack while the Black Queen is not well placed at all.  g6  stops f4-f5, but  19.Bh4  allows g2-g4 next for a strong attack. }
18... Ba8
{ This has a tactical problem.  After a move like   18...Rcd8  White is better, but it is nothing decisive.  One risk-free option  (probably not the best one though)  is to play  19.Qc2  when Black can't avoid the trade.  Qxc2  20.Bxc2  Now plans with Ba4 and Na5 are very annoying for Black to meet. }

{ White certainly calculated   19.Nxf7 !  , but must have missed something. In fact this Knight sacrifice is close to winning for White.  Rxf7  20.Qxe6  One key point is the unprotected Rook on c8. Black's last move was Ba8, undefending this piece.  Rcf8   20...Qd7  21.Bf5 !  is a complete disaster.  21.Ne5  White will get more than enough material just by taking on f7, but the main problem is Black's uncoordinated piece placement.  Nb6  22.b3  Qe8  23.Nxf7  Rxf7  24.Qh3  Black is helpless against Bd6 and Bf5 ideas. }
19... Qa6 20. Bd3 Qb7
{ It looks like Black has spotted the Nxf7 idea. He prevents it and even threatens himself now. ...Nxc3 is on. }
21. Qf3 Qa6 22. Qe2 Qa4 { Black allows the strike again. } 23. Bc2
{ No, thank you. } 23... Qe8
{ Maybe Black needed a win in this game ? He avoids a repitition but misplaces the Queen in the process. }
24. Bd3
{ So White allows black to repeat again. Maybe he was thinking that Black will avoid it anyway, given how he played the last moves ? In any case, White could have avoided this possibility with many possible moves, he is still comfortably better.  For example   24.Bb3  was a way to continue.  Rd8  25.Na5  , intending Qa6. This is tough to stop, as  Rd6  26.Nxf7  Qxf7  27.Bxd6  Bxd6  28.Qxe6  Is better for White as well. }
24... g6
{ Black wants/needs to win it seems.  He could have claimed a draw with   24...Qa4  , allowing Nxf7 again - but White wouldn't get the chance to play it after the claim. Objectively speaking he should be happy with the draw. }
25. Ne3 Nc7
{ 25...Nxe3  was neccessary, but no fun either.  26.Bb5  Bc6  27.Bxc6  Rxc6  28.fxe3  Rc8  29.e4  and the pressure is mounting. }
26. h3
{ This is very strong, thinking about prophylaxis in the middle of a brewing attack. }
26... Nh5 27. Bh2 { White now threatens Nd7 ! } 27... f6
{ 27...Nf6  28.Bf4  and Bh6 is the next threat. Black is on the ropes. } 28.
N5c4 e5 29. Ng4 Qc6 30. f3 Rfd8 31. Ncxe5 { and the floodgates open finally. }
31... fxe5 32. Bc4+ Nd5 33. Nxe5 Qe6 34. Nxg6 Qxe2
{ 34...Qxg6  35.Qxe7  Nhf6  36.Qxa7  also falls apart. } 35. Nxe7+ Qxe7 36.

Rd7 39. Rxd7 Nxd7 40. Bd6+ Ne7 41. Re1 Re8 42. Bb5
{ In the ...e6 Alapin White has a simple, yet effective setup as demonstated in this game. All pieces are well placed and the superior activity might become the starting point of an attack on the Black King. }

1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Bg4
{ This is the traditional main line, but it has lost some ground in recent years.  The more fashionable lines are   3...dxe4  4.Nxe4  Nf6  and in particular   3...Nf6  One of the reasons for this shift is the frequently seen position type that we will examine in this game. It is very solid for Black, obviously, but also somewhat passive as we will see. }
4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 Nf6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O Nbd7
{ As discussed in the theoretical section I think that this move is more interesting for Black. White does not get in d2-d4 so easily now.   7...Be7 }
8. d4 dxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxe4 10. Qxe4
{ This is the type of position you'll get quite often in the Two Knights Caro. White has the pair of Bishops and more space, but Black has no pawn weakness and with two minor pieces already traded his position is not all that cramped. The white strategy is to slowly expand and while doing so keeping and eye on Black's pawn breaks with the c- or e-pawn. Those pawn breaks are the only real plan that Black has in terms of changing the pawn structure. If we make sure they are not possible at all or at least unattractive our play will be much easier. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave does an excellent job in this game to demonstrate White's possibilities. }
10... Nf6 11. Qd3 Bd6
{ A natural development move, but there is more to it. Black would love to trade this bishop, getting rid of the long term concern of facing the Bishop pair. One way to trade is via f4, so Black intends to go Qc7 and Bf4. }
12. Rd1
{ I like MVL's concept of dealing with the Bc7-f4 idea.  A different approach is   12.g3  O-O  13.Bf3  , but I prefer to have the Bishop on c4 later, as we will see in the game. }
12... Qc7 13. Bd2
{ Of course   13.Qf3  was fine as well, preventing the trade on f4 differently. This is a bit more natural than the game continuation and probably more precise. }
13... Bh2+ 14. Kh1 Bf4 15. Be1
{ I know it might look odd, but placing Bishops on the back rank for later use is not rare at all. This is mostly applied in closed positions that are later opened up. }
15... O-O 16. a4
{ This is often useful to gain some space and possibly provoke a concession on the queenside. I am doubtful of the timing though.  I probably would have gone for   16.g3  first, clarifying the situation with the Bishop on f4.  Bd6  17.Kg2  Rfe8  18.Qf3  This is very similar to the game, just without a4 for the moment. This is important in some lines.  c5  The position type after the superior   18...e5  is examined in the note to move 16.  19.dxc5  Bxc5  20.b4  Bd6  21.c4  and White manages to get his pawn majority rolling. A moving majority combined with the Bishop pair can be a very powerful asset. }
16... Rad8
{ We need to check the very principled   16...e5  transforming the pawn structure to complete symmetry. One important aspect of this move: Black opens up the diagonal towards f7, which is an argument of keeping the white kings's bishop flexible  (see the note to move 12)  .  17.dxe5  Bxe5  18.c3  Rfe8  19.Qf3  I think it is equal here. White has lost a bit of time in the last moves and it is not clear that having played a4 actually helps. The bishop on f1 likes to be on the a2-g8 diagonal and often has a good, protected spot on b3, now this is not a stable square anymore. Still the game is not a draw of course, as White may still push his queenside pawns later. }
17. Qf3 Rfe8
{ Black has centralized and all pieces are dveloped, but what is the plan to make any progress ? Pushing e6-e5 was better timed the move before. }
18. a5 a6
{ That's the almost automatic response.  If Black allows the a-pawn further with a move like   18...Bd6  , we happily oblige.  19.a6  b6  20.g3  a6 will be an asset in any endgame and c6 looks like a weakness Black should rather avoid. It is nothing terribly bad for Black, but the game move is natural and better. }
19. Bc4 Nd5
{ Black from now on adopts a sit-and-wait strategy. I am very sceptical that this is a good solution, but maybe he evaluated ...e6-e5 as just too unattractive ? As Black you'll absolutely never win after the e-pawn push, while the game is worse for Black but it remains more complicated.   19...Bd6  20.g3  e5  was the way to go for the 'central clearance'. }
20. Bb3 Bg5 21. c4
{ Forward ! Still pushing c2-c4 is a choice that needs to be very carefully considered. There is one drawback: White weakens the d4-pawn quite seriously and we need to check that we have enough support for it or may advance it further. Note that once c2-c4 is played any Black pawn push c6-c5 or e6-e5 might be answered with d4-d5. }
21... Ne7 22. Bc2 Bf6 23. Bc3 Nc8 24. Rd2 Nd6 25. b3 Rd7 26. Rad1
{ By now the pawn pushes will never happen as White has too much control. Black is in full waiting mode now. }
26... Qd8 27. Bb4 g6 28. g3 Bg7 29. Kg2 Qc7 30. h4
{ Bent Larsen once said something to the effect that you should push the rook pawns if you don't know what else to do. In fact here it is very sound strategy as Black either has to allow the potential opening of the h-file or weaken himself. }
30... Red8
{ I think he should have played   30...h5  making it more difficult for White to find a straightforward plan. It's not easy to play the g-pawn and open up the kingside. White should manouvre slowly and probably try to get a later d4-d5 push going. While Black is passive his position is still a tough nut to crack. }
31. h5 Ne8 32. Bc3 Nd6 33. g4 Ne8 34. Qe3 Qd6 35. hxg6 hxg6
{ The first open file on move 36. } 36. Rh1 Qe7 37. Rdd1
{ White needs both rooks on the h-file. We need to keep in mind that this is a rapid game and now some inaccurate moves creep in. }
37... Qf6
{ This allows a strong continuation for White. Black had to wait with a different move. His situation is not very enviable, but there is no clear win for White in sight yet. }
38. Rh3
{ Here   38.Bb4 !  was strong, controlling the f8 square ! Now Black does not have anything better than  Rxd4  39.Qh3  R4d6  giving up the exchange with a large, probably winning advantage for White.  If Black tries to avoid this and goes   39...Nd6  he runs into problems on the d-file.  40.Rxd4  Qxd4  41.Rd1  Qe5  42.Qg3 !  This is very strong.  Qxg3+  43.fxg3  c5  44.Bxc5  Bf8  45.Bb6  Ra8  46.Bc7  Ne8  47.Bf4  And White is winning. }
38... Qe7 39. Rhh1
{ Being able to correct your mistaken decisions is very important. Black threatened to play e6-e5, so d1 needed cover.  Of course MVL checked the natural   39.Rdh1  , but Black has one defence. Only ONE, but it is enough !  Rxd4 !  40.Bxd4  Rxd4  And here I start to like Black's chances. He is not going to get mated anymore and e6-e5 and a Knight tour to e6 looks scary. White can prevent that but the game has turned around. }
39... Qf6 { Trying to repeat, which is very understandable. } 40. g5
{ We checked   40.Bb4 !  already on move 38. } 40... Qe7 41. f4
{ That's the point of MVL's play. He tries to establish a full pawn bind, preventing all breaks. }
41... Nd6
{ Here Black absolutely needed to play   41...c5 !  , all other moves lose ! It is not a trivial calculation at all though - in a rapid game this is very hard to do when you are low on time.  42.dxc5  Rxd1  43.Bxd1  Bxc3  44.Qxc3  and this is moment where you probably stop in your calculation. White threatens mate and after  Ng7  45.b4  keeps the pawn. However...  e5 !  saves the day for Black !  46.Qxe5  Rd2+  47.Kf3  Qd7  will end in a perpetual ! Easy for engines, but close to impossible to find and evaluate correctly with short time available. }
42. Qh3
{ Now there is no rescue anymore. The threat is d4-d5, looking all the way to the h8 mating square. }
42... Nf5 { 42...f5  43.Qh7+  Kf7  44.Rh6  doesn't help either. } 43. Bxf5 exf5
44. Rde1 Qa3 45. d5 { Finally this Bishop has its say ! } 45... Qa2+ 46. Kf1
{ And Black resigned, being unable to prevent the mate. This position type is a frequent guest in this line of the Caro-Kann. White always has a slight pull and needs to patiently improve his position. It seems that Black at best manages to simplify to a symmetrical position where he is claiming that the Bishop pair is not enough to win. It's all rather comfortable for White, being in no risk at all. }

This position is identical to the one after  1.e4  e6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  exd5  4.Nf3  Nf6  , just with an added move count  (it took 6 moves instead of 4)  . Against the Petroff I suggest to play  3.Nc3  , but the line chosen by Anand in this game is a good alternative that fits with our repertoire. There is no worrying deviation along the way.  Black could avoid the very natural 6... d5 and play something like   6...Be7  instead, but this is answered by natural development like  7.Bd3  ,  followed by O-O, Bg5 etc., quite similar to the scheme used in the game. Quite often a later d6-d5 will transpose to the French Exchange after all. }
7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Re1
{ As mentioned in the theoretical section I think that this very natural looking move is not the most precise one. I recommend to play Bg5/Nbd2 first to avoid the Black setup shown in the note to move 11. }
9... Bg4 10. Bg5 Nbd7 11. Nbd2 Re8
{ I think Black should play   11...c6 !  first in order to get Bd6 and Qc7 in.  12.c3  Bd6  13.Qc2  Qc7  White now has the extra move Re1 in a symmetrical position. Unfortunately it is not possible to make anything out of it. There is no control over e5 in particular. Most likely there will be trades on the e-file and nothing much happens in a very equal position. }
12. c3 c6 13. Qc2 h6
{ It is too late now for Qc7 or Bd6 due to the pressure on h7. One important small detail to mention: playing ...h6 has a lot of relevance for the centre as ...f6 is hardly possible anymore now. A Knight appearing on e5 will be very annoying this this way as there is no good way to force it to back up. This motiv we will witness in the game. }

8. Nf3
{ I think that   8.Bd3  is somewhat more precise and thus recommended in the theoretical section. Black does not exploit the Knight move in the game, so we transpose to normal positions where Nf3/Bd3 was just played in a different order. }
8... Qc7
{ This is very slow.  The reason why I preferred to start with the Bishop move is   8...d5  9.e5  Ne4  White is still better after this, but I prefer to have complete control like in the game.  Now  10.Nxe4  dxe4  11.Nd2  Nd5  12.Qe2  f5  13.exf6  exf6  14.Nxe4  Bg7  is almost forced and it looks too murky for my taste, even though the engine likes White. }
9. Bd3 Nc4
{ This sends the Bishop back home, but the Knight is on a vulnerable square.  If Black continues to develop like   9...Bg7  10.O-O  O-O  11.Qe1  his position is quite passive. The simple attacking plan of f4-f5, Qe1-h4, Be3-h6 etc. is very dangerous to face. }

After the natural  Bb7  13.O-O  O-O  14.e5  Nd5  15.Nxd5  cxd5  White can strike with  16.e6  , highlighting the weak light squares after the Bishop left c8. Stockfish already evaluates this a clean win for White, so Black has to deviate earlier, but there is nothing great available. White is much better after 12 a4 !  White absolutely had to avoid   12.Bxc4 ?  bxc4  13.Qxc4  Nxe4 !  which gives Black good play after  14.Nxe4  d5  15.Qe2  dxe4  16.Qxe4  O-O  17.O-O  Bf5 }

20... Bd7 21. Ra2 Qb6 22. Rfa1 f6
{ Bauer does not want to wait passively anymore and decides to strike against the cramping e5 pawn. This is a very understandable and human decision, but it ultimately backfires. This kind of development is very common if you strive for positions with a space advantage and no clear active plan for the opponent - they want to 'break out' and worsen their situation in the process.  A patient move like   22...Ra7  is better. Here White needs to find more complex solutions to increase the advantage. Stockfish finds the clever  23.c4 !  here. Now after  Qxb3  24.Be3  dxc4  25.Bxc4  Qb6  26.d5  Nc5  27.dxe6  Bxe6  28.Bxe6  fxe6  29.Ng5  White has a strong initiative and clear advantage as well. }

{ At first I thought that   42...Bd6  wins here, but now I think it is a draw as well.  43.Qg1  that looks very passive, but it may be a fortress.  If White opts for   43.Kg1  , his King needs to go for a walk.  Qh2+  44.Kf2  Bc5+  45.Kf3  Qe5  46.g4  Bd6  Now Black wins a second pawn. There are still drawing chances for White though as many endings without the Queens will be a draw.  43...Kh6  44.Ba6  White can only mark time with the Bishop. Is there a win for Black ? The engine does not find one and looking a bit myself I don't see anything convincing either. One important line goes  g5  45.Bc4  f5  46.Ba6  g4  47.Be2  gxh3  48.Bf1 !  This is a clean draw !  hxg2+   48...h2  49.Qd4  will either lead to a perpetual or a Queen trade, which is also an easy draw.  49.Qxg2  and again there is no way forward. The 'wrong colored bishop' draw is one of those odd things in chess. Isn't it unfair that you can't win with such a huge material edge ? }

Bd4+ 50. Ke1 Qg1+ 51. Kd2 Qa1 52. Qc4 Bf6 53. Qc2 Bg5+ 54. Kd3
{ The White King is exposed, but Black can't control any light squares so there is no mate. The Black pawns are also under control by the Bishop on f3. Black tried for a bit but it is a draw. }

{ This game provides an excellent example how easy White's position is to play once Black has settled for the passive setup without pushing e7-e5 in the centre. If White manages to play his pawn to e5 he will have a huge advantage in space and Black lacks serous counterplay. }

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3
{ One main task for White against 3... Qd6 is this position where Black has a choice of lines. They are all quite comfortable for White, but require entirely different responses. Unsurprisingly the 15th World Champion is up to the task. }
5... a6 6. Bd3
{ This move and the connected idea to play Ne4 is key to remember against 5... a6. }
6... Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. O-O Nc6 9. Ne4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4
{ White has accomplished something: He traded his badly placed Knight on c3 against the well placed Knight on f6. Why is c3 a bad square for the Knight ? Well, it is not so much that the Knight would be 'offside', but it blocks the c-pawn. This is important, as the c-pawn is a natural defender of the d4-pawn and also might be used more actively with pushing c2-c4. At the same time. An additional accomplishment is of course the strong Bishop on e4, looking at both sides of the board. }
10... e6 11. c3 Bg6
{ Black quite often emphasizes Queen side development in the Scandinavian, which makes castling long quite a frequent guest in this opening. Here it is very dubious though as White quickly launched the attack.   11...O-O-O  12.b4  This is both dangerous and simple to play - quite a terrible situation for Black. }
12. Bxc6+
{ A very interesting decision. White is giving up the Pair of Bishops because he is gaining lots of time to increase his initiative.  Something more standard like   12.Bxg6  hxg6  13.Re1  was also quite good for White, but less forceful. Note that Black has some King position issues here as well. Going long is questionable due to the hook on a6, while going short will also not be completely safe in view of a Knight possibly appearing on g5. }
12... Qxc6 13. Ne5 Qb6
{ This is more or less mandatory.  Instead   13...Qe4  14.Re1  Qf5  15.Qa4+  b5  16.Qb3  Bd6  17.a4  is excellent for White. }
14. c4
{ This is the most direct and aggressive move.  White had a good alternative in   14.a4  Black now should stop this pawn with  a5  Castling into it cannot be recommended.   14...O-O-O  15.b4  is awful for Black.  If Black plays something slow like   14...Bd6  the problem is  15.a5  Qa7  16.Qa4+  And Black is in bad shape again.  After 14.. ..a5 White may just play  15.Re1  correctly claiming that Black's position is not harmonious. It's tough to play c7-c5 and obtain counterplay. }
14... O-O-O
{ This is risky, but very principled. It immediately points at d4, the pawn weakness White just created. }
15. Be3
{ This is a critical position early in the game. Black now had the fundamental choice between allowing c4-c5 and stopping it. }
15... c5
{ Let's check alternatives.  First we need to get   15...Qxb2 ?  out of the way. This fails due to  16.Nxg6  hxg6  17.Rb1  Qxa2  18.Qf3  and Black is falling apart.  However a playable aternative was   15...Be7  16.c5  Qxb2  This is also quite risky, obviously, but things are not entirely clear and for sure not simple to play.  17.Nxg6  The tempting   17.c6  b6  18.a4  threatens to take on g6 and play Qd3, invading on a6. Black has only one defence.  Rd6 !  This surprisingly seems to hold.  19.Qf3  f6  20.Nxg6  hxg6  21.Rfc1  Rh4 !  is a possible line that is OK for Black.  17...fxg6   17...hxg6  18.Qf3  is worse as f7 is just hanging in addition to Rb1 being threatened.  18.Qg4  Qb5  19.Qxe6+  Qd7  20.Qb3  and White keeps the better chances, using the open b-file to attack. }
16. d5
{ Here Anand had a stronger move, one that he would have played for sure if he had more time to consider his options. It's a rapid game after all.   16.b4 !  The kind of move that makes you smile when you are allowed to play it. White gets an extremely strong attack now.  Qxb4  This is relatively best.  Other lines like   16...cxb4  17.c5  Qa5  18.Bf4  or   16...cxd4  17.c5  Qxb4  18.Bd2  Qb2  19.Rc1  crumble quickly.  17.Nxg6  hxg6  18.Rb1  Qxc4  19.Qf3  Qd5  20.Qxf7  Qd7  21.Qf4  and White is much better. }
16... Bd6
{ Now White is allowed to transform his dynamic advantage into a long term, static one.  Black should have taken the pawn it seems.   16...Qxb2  17.Bf4  Bd6  18.Re1  And White has compensation for sure, but no big advantage. Of course it is not easy to figure out, in particular in a rapid game. }
17. Nxg6 hxg6 18. Qg4
{ Strong ! Now White retains the clearly better position long term. The next moves are quite forced. }
18... Rhe8 19. b3 Kb8 20. Rad1
{ White is better due to the ongoing pressure and the awkward Bishop on d6. There is also a potential weak square on d5, ideal for White's rook. }
20... e5
{ 20...Qc7  21.dxe6  Rxe6  22.Rd5  is a possible line to illustrate the White rook on d5. There is pressure in this middlegame, but the endgames might be depressing for Black as well, with c5 and g7 being on dark squares. In the game Black decides to close everything down, but giving White a protected passed pawn is a concession. }
21. f4
{ Anand's move is very consistent, but   21.Rb1  was also very strong. White aims for b4, as happens after  Qc7  22.Rfc1  Ka8  23.b4  With a great attack. }
21... exf4 22. Bxf4 Re7 23. Qg3 Bxf4 24. Qxf4+ Qd6 25. Qxd6+ Rxd6
{ A very one-sided endgame is on the board now. White is enjoying a huge advantage. }
26. Rfe1 Rdd7 27. Rxe7 Rxe7 28. Kf2 Kc8 29. Re1 Rxe1
{ This move loses, but the alternative was not great either.   29...Rc7  30.Re8+  Kd7  31.Rg8  And White should win this as well, it just takes longer. }
30. Kxe1 Kd7 31. Ke2 Kd6 32. Kf3 Ke5 33. Ke3 Kf5 34. Kf3
{ Here there was a much more direct win.   34.b4  b6   34...cxb4  35.Kd4  is quite easy.  35.bxc5  bxc5  36.Kd3  and the King walks to the a-pawn. Anand's move does not spoil anything though. }
34... Ke5 35. Kg4 b6 36. a4
{ This spoils the win. King and Pawn endings are very tough to play with little time as they rely to heavily on move by move calculation. Intuitive play, typical in Blitz and Rapid, is not much help here. Well, this is not a book on endings, so I don't provide extensive analysis here but keep it short with just some key lines.  White keeps the win with   36.h4  Kd6  37.Kf4  Kd7  38.Ke5  Ke7  39.d6+  Kd7  40.Kd5  a5  41.a4  f6  42.g3  f5  43.Ke5 }
36... f6
{ One important line to check is   36...Kd6 ?  37.a5 !  , which wins for White.  bxa5  38.Kf4  Kd7  39.h4  Kd6  40.g4  Kd7  41.Ke5  f6+  42.Kf4  Kd6  43.h5  gxh5  44.gxh5  Ke7  45.Kf5  Kf7  46.d6 }

Ke7 44. Kg6 Kf8
{ The difficult part is already done, but now Anand errs. Even with very little time it is easy for such a strong player to calculate this, so this is quite surprising. }
45. g4 { 45.g3  Kg8  46.g4  Kf8  47.Kh7  Kf7  48.g5  Was the way to win. }
45... Kg8 46. Kg5 { 46.g5  Kf8  47.Kh7 ??  Kf7  even loses for White ! } 46...

[Result "*"]

1. e4 Nf6
{ The Alekhine's Defence is an opening you won't face very often. When you do, it might happen against a specialist who knows it well or against someone who wants to surprise you. For both cases it makes sense to learn a setup that is simple to handle. }
2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. exd6
{ See the note to move 1. The Exchange variation leads to clearer positions compared to the messy Four Pawns attack or the strategic complexities after 4 Nf3, where Black has a wide range of options. }
5... exd6
{ This was the choice of danish legend Bent Larsen. The symmetrical recapture is the solid option for Black, but it poses very few problems for us to solve. The White setup used in the game is easy to remember and not very move order critical. }
6. Nc3 Be7 7. Bd3 O-O
{ In the theoretical section I didn't check this move order, but we quickly transpose. Black's moves are Nc6/ Bg4/Bf6 and O-O anyway, there is nothing else available. }
8. Nge2 Nc6 9. O-O Bf6 10. b3
{ One o the few move order finesses to remember. White needs to deal with the Nb4 idea properly. For more about this point please check the theoretical section. }
10... Re8 11. Be3 Bg4 12. Qd2
{ In the theoretical Section I went for   12.h3  , which leads to similar positions and is of equal value. The main decision for Black is to decide between allowing White to play d4-d5 or pushing the d-pawn himself. }
12... Bxe2
{ Black does not have any clear purpose for this Bishop and just takes the Knight. This is one positive point about the Bd3/Nge2 setup - there is no pin on the f3-Knight. }
13. Nxe2 d5
{ This is strategically very sound play. Black places the pawn on a light square and fixes the pawn on d4, the target of Black's f6 Bishop. He should try to increase the pressure on this pawn, maybe with the help of a Knight regrouping to f5. This is not easy to do, as we will see in the game. If Black does not play d6-d5 our plan is to push our d-pawn after moving the a1 rook first. }
14. c5
{ Grabbing useful space. Black may have a target on d4, but we have space and the pair of Bishops. }
14... Nd7
{ Black intends to manouvre this Knight to e6 via f8.   14...Nc8  is a frequently seen idea in the Alekhine's. The Knight has Ne7-f5 in mind, but here this is difficult to realize.  15.b4  a6  16.a4  and now  N8e7  17.b5  Nb8  is just too passive. }
15. b4 a6
{ This is an important resource for Black.  instead   15...Nf8  16.b5  Ne7  17.f4  is awful for Black. White is better on both sides of the board and will probably push g2-g4 next. }
16. Rae1
{ It is premature to play   16.a4 ?!  due to  a5 !  17.b5  Nb4  And now Black is able to trade material. The d3 Bishop can't be saved with  18.Bb1 ?  due to  Nxc5 !  The a4 ?! a5 ! sequence is important to remember. }
16... Nf8 17. Bb1
{ 17.Bc2  was fine as well. One idea is to direct this Bishop against d5. In the game White goes for a2-a3, followed by Bb1 and a possible Ba2 later. Bc2 is a bit quicker, but playing the pawn to a3 is useful to cover b4 and free up the Queen to move. The second plan to go for is to gain space on the Kingside with pushing the f and possibly g-pawn. }
17... Qd7
{ 17...Ne6  is also answered by  18.a3  This is very similar to 18... Ne6 below. }
18. a3 b6
{ This is not the best it seems.  The straightforward   18...Ne6  looks better. After for example  19.Bf5  g6  20.Bh3  Bg7  21.g3  White still is for choice, but Black is quite solidly placed. }
19. h3
{ 19.cxb6  cxb6  20.Rc1  is the computer's suggestion, but the play in the actual game is fine as well. }
19... bxc5 20. bxc5
{ 20.dxc5  was the sharper choice and also quite promising. Gelashvili goes for the symmetrical recapture, intending the awkward pin after Bb1-c2-a4. }
20... Rab8 21. Bc2 Ne7
{ Black can't allow the pin with Ba4, so there is no real alternative. } 22.
Qa5
{ Stockfish wants to play more aggresively with   22.Nf4  g6  23.g4  This is not an attacking move, but prophylaxis against Nf5. Qd1 followed by Ba4 is an idea to take note of - Black is under heavy pressure. }
22... Qb5
{ Maybe White underestimated this move. The Queen has to go back now. } 23. Qd2
{ 23.Qxc7 ?!  Ne6  24.Qg3  Qc4  leads to trouble for White. } 23... Qd7
{ Black decides to retreat as well, offering a repetition. White now has the promising Nf4 option again, just like on move 22.  If Black tries to stay on b5 he will face something like   23...g6  24.Nf4  Bg7  25.Rb1  and White stays on top. }
24. Nc3
{ We looked at Nf4 above. Gelashvili's move is a bit less precise as we will see. }
24... Nf5
{ Black blunders the most important pawn on the board.  Black should play   24...g6  After  25.g4  we may compare this position to the one analyzed for 22 Nf4. The difference is that Black now has  h5  , which is impossible with the Knight on f4.  With  26.f3  White is still better, but it's a game of course. }
25. c6 Qc8 { Black is unable to cover both d5 and f5. } 26. Nxd5
{ White has not just gained one pawn, but domination with the monster on d5. Black is lost and Gelashvili converts easily. }
26... Bd8 27. Bf4 Ne7 28. Qd3 Rb5 29. Nc3 Ra5 30. a4 Nfg6 31. d5 Kf8 32. Bg3
Qb8 33. h4 h5 34. Re3 Qb4 35. Rfe1 Qg4 36. Re4 Qf5 37. Qd4
{ Qb4 is the concrete thread. Black had seen enough and resigned. The symmetrical response to the Alekhine Exchange leads to a slight edge for White and an easy to play position. In the game White had good control when Black blundered the d5-pawn and with it the game. }
