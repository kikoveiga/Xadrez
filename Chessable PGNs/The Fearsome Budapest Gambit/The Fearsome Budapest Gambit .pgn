{ Welcome to Budapest - the world capital of paprika and tokay wine.  Firstly, I just want to say that this repertoire is not for faint-hearted! Most of the positions are crazy and complicated  (either strategically or tactically)  and you must accept that those unbalanced positions will result in many wins but also in more losses.  Secondly, I hesitated how I want to organise the chapters, but I finally decided to start from the sidelines. The reason for that is that in those first chapters, where White doesn't take on e5, we have many strategic and tactical themes that will be repeated throughout the course. Also, those sidelines are a great introduction and it is good to know that taking on e5 is the only sensible option, and that in many cases White will have great trouble equalizing in many of those lines.  Thirdly, the course consists of 10 theoretical chapters, but the #11th one is devoted to   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e5  3.dxe5  Ng4  4.Bf4  g5!?  - a maverick approach that will fit only the bravest! This chapter might be skipped, because my main recommendation is 4... Nc6.  Fourthly, don't expect to get equality! If White plays the correct moves, it won't be possible to equalize and I can't promise that. Instead of that, I can promise great practical changes, a ton of novelties and improvements over the existing theory and most importantly, a great amount of fun.  Fifthly, I decided that I want this course to be devoted purely to the Budapest Gambit. That means that you won't see here any trainable variations after 2. Nf3, 2. Bf4, 2. Bg5 etc. Still, I decided to include a very brief coverage of different ideas that you might analyse on your own and I also mention what lines White deprives himself of by choosing 2. Nf3 in favour of 2. c4.  The last and most important point is that I wish you good luck with those lines. The Budapest Gambit is characterized by the fact, that most of your games will reach the critical moment between 10 - 20 moves and around the move 25 you will usually be able to tell which side will win the game. This is a very provocative opening, but it brings great joy and immediately changes the character of the game.  Good luck!  Kamil Plichta }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ Let's start our Budapest tour ! We put immediate pressure on White's centre, and there is only one sensible solution for White - the pawn has to be taken ! However, not everybody will play according to the 'rules', and from time to time you will meet opponents who won't capture on e5 on move 3.   In this and the next chapter, we will learn how to not only equalize, but how to put pressure on our opponents in most of the lines ! The first chapter is devoted to all of White's minor tries on move three, while the move 3. d5 is analysed in the 2nd theoretical chapter of this course.   Some statistics: In my 2000+ ELO database, the move 3. dxe5 has been played 2582 times, while all of the other 3rd moves combined appeared in 84 games. That means that if you are 2000+ player, you should expect to meet the lines from the first two chapters in around 3-4% of your games.   However, if we lower the level a little, those numbers will drastically increase ! For example, in my standard database, the move 3. dxe5 appeared in 28025 games, while different 3rd moves have been played in around 4150 games. That means that once in every 7 games you might expect to see those alternatives ! The last example is taken from the Lichess online database - 366 000 dxe5 and more than 200 000 of alternatives ! That means that the lower the level of your opposition, the higher the chance of meeting the lines from the first two chapters !   Enough talking, let's go ! }
3. e3
{ The most popular alternative to 3. d5 and 3. dxe5. White modestly solidifies the d4-pawn, but blocks the c1-Bishop in the process and also gives us free hand in the centre.   3.Nc3  allows  3...exd4!  4.Qxd4  Nc6  and whenever the Queen goes we will have at least equal chances.   3.Nf3  e4!  is also excellent for Black. Now  4.Nfd2  is the trickiest and we have to play  4...c6!  with ... d5 to follow and a great version of reversed Advanced French. }
3... exd4
{ We will be forced to go for this one sooner or later, so I advocate to clarify the situation immediately. Especially that White's most popular reply to our next move is a mistake ! }
4. exd4 Bb4+ 5. Bd2
{ By far the most popular move, but my opinion is that Black will be better now.   It was necessary to prioritize  5.Nc3  O-O  6.Nf3  d5  when Black attacks the centre and will take on c4 after White develops the light-squared Bishop. }
5... Qe7+ { This disruptive check is a key idea in this variation. } 6. Qe2
{ White won't experience problems with the King in this variation but Black's longterm prospects will be preferable.   6.Be2  O-O  7  Nf3  Re8!  stopping White from castling. }
6... Bxd2+
{ As I've mentioned in the 5. Nd2 line, the Knight belongs on c3, so we should lure it into d2 ! }
7. Nxd2 d5
{ Black is already slightly better, since White's position lacks harmony and we can put pressure on our opponent's centre easily. }
8. Ngf3 Be6 { Keeping the tension and preparing ... dxc4 or just ... Nc6. } 9.
c5 O-O
{ ... Re8 and ... b6 are next and I have no idea how White can survive this position. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. d5
{ If White refrains from taking on e5, this is the move we will usually see. White decides that the tension in the centre is already too much for him, and pushes the d-pawn. However, this move breaks a fundamental rule of not moving the same piece twice in the opening, and also, that the pawns don't go backwards. I consider 3. d5 to be an inaccuracy - same as all of the other 3rd moves besides 3. dxe5. }
3... Bb4+
{ It surprises me that this move is chosen in approximately 1/8 of all games that have reached this position. I find the check to be the most logical move and the one that will provoke a lot of mistakes from White.   Usually, Black plays  3...Bc5  , which might look like a logical move, but after  4.e3  I am far from impressed of Black's Bishop's position.  By playing 3... Bb4+, we develop the Bishop before playing ... d6, and keep the newly weakened c5-square for the other piece - the Knight! I find this approach to be the most flexible and objectively the strongest. }
4. Nc3
{ This move is awful. White shows a complete misunderstanding of the Budapest Gambit positions and allows his pawn structure to be permanently damaged. }
4... Bxc3+
{ The doubled c-pawns aren't White's biggest problem. The biggest issue is a newly created outpost on c5, which will be under our eternal control. }
5. bxc3 d6
{ We have many different plans at our disposal. The first one is to place the Knight on e4 and follow it up by ... f5. The second one is to play ... b6 followed by ... Ba6 pressurizing the c4-pawn. There is also an option to put the Knight on c5, and sometimes pushing the e-pawn up the board will grab space and be a good idea - but be careful with this one, since it gives away the d4-square ! One thing to remember - we would love to grab the c4-pawn, but we will usually refrain from grabbing the c3-one. The reason for that is simple - if we take the c3-pawn, we create a long diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop. }
6. e3
{ The most logical move trying to finish development, but the e3-pawn blocks the dark-squared Bishop, whose future is now quite questionable. }
6... Nbd7
{ A logical move. The Knight not only looks at c5, but in some cases ... e4 followed by ... Ne5 will be a good option. That's why we choose ... Nbd7 over ... Na6 in this case. }
7. Bd3
{ White develops the Bishop but gives us a free tempo to carry out one of our standard plans. }
7... e4 8. Bc2 b6
{ The c4-pawn is a target which we will hit by playing ... Ba6. } 9. Ne2 Ba6
10. Bb3 Nc5
{ It is possible to play  10...Ne5 !?  targetting the c4-pawn, but White's pieces are so clumsily placed, that I want to get the maximum from this position. }
11. O-O Nfd7 { The other Knight marches towards e5. } 12. f3 exf3 13. gxf3 f5
{ Discouraging e4 and planning ... O-O ... Ne5 and ... Qh4. } *

4. Nd2
{ This move is objectively worse than 4. Bd2 - and much better than 4. Nc3 at the same time - but we should pay extra attention to it. White's score is 85% from this position ! Not because of some drawbacks of Black's position, but usually due to the fact that our position has been terribly misplayed. }
4... c6 { Targetting White's centre on the first possible occasion. } 5. a3
{ Only this move has been played in practice. } 5... Bxd2+
{ A very strong novelty. In all of the games, Black retreated with the Bishop. }
6. Qxd2
{ Taking with the Queen allows the d5-pawn to be saved, but it obstructs the dark-squared Bishop's development. }
6... cxd5 7. cxd5 d6
{ We would like to play  7...Na6 ?!  eyeing the c5-square, but after  8.b4 !  our Knight looks stupid on the rim. }

{ Note that in many cases in the Budapest we will delay castling in favour of fast development - we didn't sacrifice the pawn on move 2 to play slowly ! The Knight marches towards c5. }

10. Qd1 { 10.Qc2 ?  Nxd5   10.Rb1 ??  Bf5  -+ } 10... a5

4. Bd2
{ This move is 4 times more popular than two of the other options combined. Understandably so ! White avoids placing the Knight on d2 and doesn't allow his pawn structure to be ruined as in the 4. Nc3 line. }
4... a5
{ I like this move the most.   4...Qe7 !?  is another option but the text is stronger.  By playing 4... a5 !, we discourage Bxb4 due to ... axb4 opening up the a-file. Also, if White ever goes a3, we can safely retreat without fearing b4. The third point is that the c5-square is already secured for our Knight. }
5. Nc3 { The most natural move developing the Knight. } 5... d6
{ We strengthened our centre and plan to take on c3 followed by ... Ne4 - a plan that we should be already acquainted with ! }
6. Qc2
{ White stops our ... Bxc3 ... Ne4 plan by overprotecting the e4-square. } 6...

{ White might stop our Knights from jumping to e4, but the White Knight doesn't have a decent square to hop into. }
9... O-O
{ Castling is the best option.   9...e4 ?!  10.b4  gives White some time to regroup and Black is only slightly better.   The same goes for  9...Bd7 ?!  10.b4 }
10. e3
{ White keeps developing. Putting the pawn on e4 would be less accurate due to ... Nh5 ... f5 coming. }
10... Bd7
{ If you like adventures, then  10...b5 !?  might catch your attention.  With the text move, Black prepares both ... Ba4 and ... b5. }

{ Finally, we can devote some time to this move - definitely the best move in the position. The only way to try to refute the Budapest Gambit is to accept it ! However, in this chapter we will take a look at all of White's minor tries after our next move. }
3... Ng4
{ Definitely the best move. I myself tried the Fajarowicz on multiple occasions, both online and over the board in rapid/blitz games, but my conclusion is that it leads to a very poor position for Black.   3...Ne4 ?!  4.a3 !  d6  5.Qc2 !  is the refutation. }
4. e4
{ Starting from this line, we will analyse White's most sensible and popular options on move 4. Firstly, we will cover the move 4. e4.   White's intentions are crystal clear - our opponent wants to build a big pawn centre and force our Knight to do a little dance, similarly to the Alekhine Defence. However, things are far from simple. White is moving pawns only, and having the pawns on c4 and e4, weakens the d4-square. Normally, allowing the so-called Maroczy pawn structure in the ... cxd4 positions would be suboptimal, but with ... exd4 it is not as big of a problem.  Here I present to you some examples of White's rare tries on the 4th move:   4.Qd4?!  d6  5.exd6  Nc6!  is excellent for Black.   4.f4?  Bc5  is horrible for White. The only thing to remember is that  we play ... d6 next  after both  5.Nh3  d6   and  5.e3  d6!   4.Qd5  d6  5.exd6  Nc6  is similar  to 4.Qd4. }
4... Nxe5
{ Of course, we don't support the Knight with moves such as ... h5 or ... d6, because White didn't do anything wrong and any pawn sacrifice from Black would be dubious at best. }
5. f4
{ This is by far the most popular and the most logical move. White builds a big pawn centre and prepares to put his pieces on the most natural squares. }
5... Nec6
{ 5...Ng6 ?!  is worse and one sample line might go  6.Nf3  Bc5  7.f5 !  Nh4  8.Ng5 !  which is more or less crushing. The Knight can't find a safe square so we should play my suggested 5th move. Funnily, this sequence has been played by myself back in 2010, but with the white pieces this time  !  8...Qe7  9.Nc3  c6  10.Qg4  f6  11.Nh3  g5  12.Nxg5  h6  13.Nh3  Nxf5  14.Qxf5  d6  15.Qxc8+  was a quick 1-0 in Plichta - Sokolowski, Mazovia Team Championship 2010.   The Knight on c6 seemingly blocks the other Knight's development, but it is not so simple. The other Knight will usually go to a6 and then c5. Black is ready to play ... Bc5 which White usually stops with 6. Be3. }
6. Nc3 { Letting the Bishop to c5 is the best strategy for our opponent. } 6...
Bc5
{ 6...Bb4 ?!  doesn't make too much sense when White can safely defend the Knight. }
7. Nf3 d6
{ We postpone castling in favour of quick piece play. it is one of the most typical patterns that you might see in the whole course. }
8. Bd3
{ The most popular move. White plans to play Qe2 and Be3 next challenging our strong Bishop, and preparing to castle kingside. }
8... O-O
{ Against all sensible moves we will play ... Nd4. Against those non-sensible ones, we might consider ... Bg4. }
9. Qe2 Nd4
{ This move is a novelty but I like its simplistic nature. We force the Knights exchange making sure that our lack of space won't be a big problem. Also, White will be forced to abandon his standard plans for the moment. }
10. Nxd4 Bxd4 11. Be3
{ White plays according to his plan, but forgets about our typical Budapest ideas ! }
11... Bxc3+ { Whenever possible we should go for this one ! } 12. bxc3 Qh4+
{ And this is the accurate reaction! White's only hope for compensation for his shattered structure is to go for some kind of attack. Here, we more or less force the Queens exchange. }
13. Qf2 { 13.g3  Qh3  and White is forced to castle queenside. } 13... Qxf2+
14. Kxf2 Nd7
{ An extremely important move. Let's stop here for a second to discuss why it is so strong. Let's imagine that our Knight is on b8. What is White's move ? Of course, c5 ! Our opponent wants to undouble his bad pawns as fast as possible. We can't allow that ! We worked hard to get a superior pawn structure and we can't let this advantage slip away with one inaccurate move !   So why 14... Nbd7, not 14... Na6 ? Because sometimes White might consider e5 and the Knight from d7 stops both of them ! ... b6 ... Bb7 and ... f6 are next, bolstering the dark squares and keeping our position harmonious. One thing to remember, whenever a4 happens we go ... a5. }

{ This is the only independent try for White, although my opinion is that if we refrain from ... g6 it doesn't make any sense.   7.Nc3  g6  8.Bd3  Bg7  gives Black good counter chances. Our plan is usually ... Nd7 - c5 targetting the c3-Knight with the Bishop. The other plan is ... b6 ... Bb7. }

{ The position that we will cover can be also reached via the  4.Nh3  Nxe5  5.e3  move order. }
4... Nxe5 5. Nh3
{ By playing Nh3, White prepares to put the Knight on f4 eyeing d5. Then after Be2 and O-O, our opponent wants to claim that he won't do anything extraordinary and keep his structural advantages. }
5... d5
{ Only the 6th most popular move and a huge blow to this line! White should not expect this one and trust me - Black will have immense attacking chances no matter what White does! Also, note that if White goes for this line, he wants to avoid huge theoretical discussions and play some calm positions, where positional understanding will be necessary. Here, we do a 180-degree turn and start a tactical skirmish. }
6. cxd5
{ This is the most obvious choice. White decides to eliminate the pawn and avoid exposing his own Queen. The biggest drawback is that our next move is allowed. }
6... Bxh3
{ By damaging White's pawn structure we make sure of two things: Black will have a longterm positional advantage due to a more fluid pawn structure; Black will have great attacking chances vs the White King. }
7. gxh3 Bd6
{ Black will safely castle kingside and start different attacking ideas. Now some thought about the timing of our different moves. Whenever the Bishop lands on e2, we should be able to respond with ... Qh4. Usually, we will prioritize castling, but if White starts developing the queenside instead of the kingside, then we switch to ... Nbd7 to prioritize developing the minor pieces. }
8. Nc3
{ 8.Bg2  allows Black typical counterplay with  8...O-O  9.O-O  Ng6   8.Be2  Qh4  9.O-O  Nf3+!  10.Kg2  - Any other move allows ... Qxh3.  10...Nxh2  with favourable complications for Black. }
8... Nbd7
{ Remember, that if White proceeds with the queenside development, we should switch to this move.   If we play  8...O-O  , then  9.Be2  Qh4  10.O-O !  is very strong with the point  10...Qxh3  11.f4 !  and White is better. }
9. Bg2 O-O
{ Since the pawn on h3 won't be our target, we switch our attention to the ... O-O ... Ng6 ... f5 plan. }
10. O-O Ng6
{ ... Nh4 and/or ... f5 are next. Black has excellent attacking chances. A rule of thumb is that if White tries to play with the pawns in the centre, we will reply with ... f5 and if our opponent moves the piece we will play ... Nh4. }
11. e4
{ A logical move. White wants to seize space in the centre and play f4 next. We should deny it immediately. }
11... f5 { Only this way! We threaten ... f4 with a devastating attack. } 12.
exf5
{ 12.f4  is better but it allows  12...Qe7!?  with the point  13.e5?  Ndxe5  14.fxe5?  Qxe5  and Black is winning. }

Here, we do a 180-degree turn and start a tactical skirmish. }
6. Qxd5
{ This move is similar in popularity to 6. cxd5, but I consider it to be more theoretical. The character of the game will be similar, but here we will have more of a development advantage than the structural one. }
6... Qe7
{ Played only once. Black has full compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The first and most obvious idea is ... Bxh3 which more or less forces White's next move. }
7. Nf4 c6
{ We kick the Queen winning a tempo. Our lead in development might not be too visible, but we managed to open all of the necessary lines and will strike with immense power. White has two sensible retreats now. }
8. Qd1
{ The Queen doesn't obstruct any pieces and won't be hit with any developing moves from us. However, this move makes our lead in development significant. The biggest drawback is that after ... Bf5 ... Nbd7 and ... O-O-O we will have excellent attacking chances.   8.Qe4  g6!  with the idea ... Bf5  9.Nd3  Bg7  10.Nxe5  Bf5!  is a nice intermezzo which secures us the advantage. }
8... Bf5 { A very important move. We prepare ... Nbd7 and long castling! } 9.
Be2
{ White plans quick castling. We continue with our original plan.   After  9.Nc3  preparing e4  we should change gears and continue  9...Na6  with the idea  10.e4  g5!  - with the advantage for Black. }
9... Nbd7
{ 9...Na6?!  here is dubious.  10.O-O  and White is better.  We need the Knight on d7 to be able to castle long ! }
10. O-O O-O-O
{ Let's stop for the moment. Black has already 5 developed pieces, compared to two pieces for White. We have the Rook on the open d-file, which 'looks' at the White Queen. Also, the Knight on f4 begs to be hit by ... g5 with an attack on the kingside. All of those conditions sum up giving Black a big edge at this point ! }
11. Qa4 Kb8
{ We are ready to expel the White Queen with ... Nc5 and continue with ... g5 with a strong attack. }

However, this line has a big drawback as compared to the 4.

4... Bc5
{ Note that  4...Nc6  transposes to  5.Bf4  Bb4+  but I see no reason to give White this opportunity.  By playing 4... Bc5, we force White to play e3, which means that White has to look for an alternative route for the locked c1-Bishop. }

If our opponent avoids Be2 in favour of let's say Nc3, we will continue developing with ... O-O ... Re8 and only then take the guy on e5. See comments to Black's next move for a specific line. }
6. Be2
{ This is the most popular move. White develops the kingside and delays Nc3 for the moment. Still, those lines - 6. Be2 and 6.

7... Nxe5 8. Nc3 { 9.O-O  O-O  9.Nc3  Re8  is the same. } 8... O-O 9. O-O Re8
{ This move is characteristic for this variation. We simply develop the Rook and wait for White to show his hand. }
10. Kh1 { A useful prophylactic move, preparing to play f4 next. } 10... d6
{ With the White pawn on b2 and the Bishop on c1, we abandon plans connected with ... a5 and ... Ra6, which are going to be a usual guest in the 4. Nf3 variation. }
11. Na4
{ White might go for the Bishop, but allowing Nxc5 is actually good for Black. }
11... Qh4 12. Nxc5 dxc5
{ ... Bf5 followed by ... Rad8 is coming. Note that with the White Bishop being on f4 instead of c1, Black's position would be very shaky. But with the Bishop closed on c1, it is Black who has a slight edge. }

10... a5
{ This is the most standard plan for Black. We plan ... Ra6. A few words about the best timing for this plan. It works very well with the White Bishop on b2 for two reasons: A. - White won't have f4 ideas due to the hanging pawn on e3; B. - We can safely play ... Rh6 without being worried about the Bishop on c1. }
11. Na4
{ Out of White's 11th moves, I think this is the least threatening. One thing has to be remembered - we usually drop the Bishop back to  f8  except the  11.Bb2  Ra6  12.Ne4  line when  12...Ba7  will be mandatory! }

{ A greedy approach played once by IM Vitali Koziak.   14.Bxe5  also backfires due to  14...Rxe5!  15.Qxe5  Bd6  and White has to part with the Queen to avoid being mated. }
14... b5
{ A beautiful move keeping the Queen out of play and preparing to develop the Bishop to b7 with tempo. White is more or less lost now ! Let's check three possibilities for White. }
15. Qxb5
{ This is the most obvious move.   15.cxb5  Qh4  16.h3  Bb7  is game over. White can prevent  ... Bxg2 only by playing  17.f3  but after  17...Rg6  White collapses.   15.Nc3  also loses to  15...Qh4  16.h3  d5!   But not  16...Bb7??  17.Nd5  and White still breathes. }
15... c5
{ That's it ! We keep the White Queen out of play. We had to start with ... b5, because if the Queen would be on a6, then ... c5 ? would allow Qxd8 exchanging Queens. }

{ This is White's main move. Our opponent simply threatens to take the pawn on a5 ! }
14... b6 { Just calmly defending the pawn. } 15. Rad1 Bc5
{ A nice prophylactic move. Black prepares ... Qh4 but stops Qd4 as a response. ... Qh4 or/and ... d6 ... Bd7 - c6 are next with the attack on the kingside. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3
{ This is White's 2nd most popular move. Many players who are dealt with the Budapest Gambit on the White side go for this, seemingly the most natural continuation. However, there is a big drawback to the mainline 4. Bf4 which will be analysed in the next three chapters - Black is able to cage the c1-Bishop and gain attacking chances in many variations ! }
4... Bc5
{ Note that  4...Nc6  transposes to the next chapters, but I see no reason to grant White this opportunity.  By playing 4... Bc5, we force White to play e3, which means that the c1-Bishop has to look for an alternative route for this piece. }
5. e3 { The only move. } 5... Nc6
{ We make sure that the e5-pawn will be consumed just in time. White threatened to play h3 so it is necessary to start with this active continuation. A few things about the timing of my recommended capture ... Ncxe5 - we want to take on e5 only after White plays Be2. If our opponent avoids Be2 in favour of let's say Nc3, we will continue developing with ... O-O ... Re8 and only then take the guy on e5. See comments to Black's next move for a specific line. }
6. Be2
{ This is the most popular move. White develops the kingside and delays Nc3 for the moment. Still, those lines - 6. Be2 and 6. Nc3 will usually transpose to each other. }
6... Ncxe5
{ The best timing. Whenever the Bishop lands on e2 we can automatically take on e5 with the c6-Knight. }
7. Nxe5
{ Note that  7.O-O  Nxf3+  8.Bxf3  Ne5  9.Be2  O-O  10.Nc3  Re8  will transpose to the same variation but a tempo down for both sides. }
7... Nxe5 8. Nc3 { 9.O-O  O-O  9.Nc3  Re8  is the same. } 8... O-O 9. O-O Re8
{ This move is characteristic for this variation. We simply develop the Rook and wait for White to show his hand. }
10. b3
{ This is by far the most popular move, preparing to develop the last minor piece on the long diagonal. The disadvantage is that we will be able to carry out a typical Rook lift via the 6th rank. }
10... a5
{ This is the most standard plan for Black. We plan ... Ra6. However, there are some lines where White will create some problems. That's why I give you the alternative line 10... d6 which can be found at the end of this chapter. The character of the game is similar, but we completely abandon the ... a5 ... Ra6 plan in favour of quick ... Bf5. Note that the Rook might be lifted to the kingside via e6. To check more details see the last alternative lines of this chapter ! }
11. Bb2
{ This is by far the most common move, although in my opinion, not the most accurate one. And don't get me wrong ! It is a good move, but White has a better way to pose us problems. }
11... Ra6
{ If you want to go for the  11...d6 !?  line, it is the last moment to do so. }
12. Ne4 { This is the most popular move for White. } 12... Ba7
{ This is the only case in all of those ... Ra6 lines where we can't retreat to f8.   12...Bf8 ?  13.f4  Ng4  14.Bxg4  Rxe4  15.Be5  - the Rook is caged. }
13. c5
{ A tricky move that discourages ... d6 and stops ... Rd6 for eternity. On the positive side, it does nothing to protect the kingside and Black immediately gets excellent attacking chances. }
13... Rh6
{ White has to treat this position with extreme care to survive the upcoming complications. }
14. f4 { 14.Qd4 ?!  Qh4 !  15.h3  d6  with a superior position for Black. }
14... Qh4
{ Black will be better in all lines. It is up to White how much better our position will be ! }

{ It is essential to kick the Bishop from e5 before taking on h2. Also, cxd6 is not an option due to ... Bxe3+. }
16. h3 { 16.cxd6  Bxe3+  with a mate to come. } 16... dxe5

If Black plays  10...d6 ?!  then White can introduce one of the key ideas for this line which is  11.c5 !  with a big advantage for our opponent. The problem is that White managed to undouble his pawns and we land in a much worse position. }

{ I consider this to be the best chance for Black, although some sources claim that White will be clearly better ! It is not true, and we should be able to get decent chances !   12...Bg4 !?  is also playable, but I think that the text move should be resurrected  ! Still, after  13.O-O  Rae8  14.Rfe1  Kh8  Black should have a more or less playable position.   However,  12...Bg4!?  13.h3 !  Bh5  14.c5  dxc5  15.O-O  looks extremely unpleasant to my eyes and I consider it to be the line's refutation.  I also need to share a secret with you - this position after White's 12th move is what I consider to be the closest of a refutation of the Budapest Gambit. That means that we should stop thinking about crazy attacks, but rather how to get a decent position which is close to equality. By playing 12... Re8, Black pressurizes the e2-pawn and tries to stop our opponent from castling. }
13. O-O
{ This pawn sacrifice is White's most promising move.   13.e3  in inaccurate due to  13...h6!  Black threatens ... g5.   13.Nd4  Ne5!  is also great for Black.   So is  13.Be3  Rb8  with ... b6 ... Bb7 to come is also great. }
13... Qxe2 14. Qxe2 Rxe2 15. Nd4 Nxd4 16. cxd4 Be6
{ This is my suggested move, that has been played only 6 times in practice. White has a pair of Bishops and mobile pawn structure, so we need to start creating some threats on our own - defending passively won't work ! You can check more about that endgame starting from this line. }

7... Ngxe5
{ In the 4. Nf3 lines we always took with the c-Knight. In this chapter, we always taker with the g-Knight, because we virtually never manage to attack the White King. }
8. Nxe5 { White usually starts with this move. } 8... Nxe5 9. Be2
{ This is what White usually chooses in practice. } 9... d6
{ What I really like about the Budapest Gambit it that we very often delay castling in favour of some other active operations. }
10. O-O
{ Virtually the only move played in practice, chosen in around 96% of games.   10.a3  once again doesn't have any independent value and will transpose after  10...Bc5.   or  10...Bxd2+  11.Qxd2  b6   10.Bxe5 ?!  dxe5  is just equal. }
10... a5
{ A deep strategic concept. Black delays castling in favour of fighting to keep the b4-Bishop on the board. We safeguard the c5-square and keep ... a4 as an option to grab space on the queenside.   We might witness why castling is premature in this line  10...O-O  11.a3  and we are more or less forced to play  11...Bxd2  - the move that we avoided throughout the whole chapter  !   11...Bc5  12.b4 !  is not what we want. }
11. Nb3
{ For some time this has been considered as a refutation of the whole line. White cages our Bishop taking away the retreating c5-square and prepares to attack it with a3. }
11... a4
{ This is the obvious move - we grab space and plan to introduce another amusing Bishop move for this chapter ! }
12. a3
{ Have we been tricked ?! Do we have to part with our precious dark-squared Bishop under White's conditions ?! }
12... Bc3
{ Not at all ! This star move keeps the whole line together and secures Black excellent chances. What makes matters better for us is that usually in practice, White chooses the wrong plan immediately and lands in a worse position ! But what is this ?! Why we put the Bishop on c3 ?! We know that White will be able to capture our Bishop, so we want to sell it for the highest price possible - this time, it will be weakening White's queenside structure. }
13. Qc2
{ A less popular option, but it might be dangerous if you don't know what to do. }
13... Bxb2 { A mandatory move. We have to spoil White's pawn structure ! } 14.
Qxb2 axb3 15. c5
{ Only this move is acceptable for White.   15.Qxb3 ?!  Nd7  is similar to what we will see in the  13.bxc3  line, but with the White c3-pawn missing  ! }
15... Be6
{ Another important move to remember and Black has a good position. We are temporarily a pawn up, and it is not obvious how White will want to capture on b3. }
16. Bb5+ { One of the two decent options for White. } 16... Kf8
{ There is nothing else. } 17. cxd6 cxd6 18. Rac1

That means that if you are 2000+ player, you should expect to meet the lines from the first two chapters in around 3-4% of your games.   However, if we lower the level a little, those numbers will drastically increase ! For example, in my standard database, the move 3. dxe5 appeared in 28025 games, while different 3rd moves have been played in around 4150 games. That means that once in every 7 games you might expect to see those alternatives ! The last example is taken from the Lichess online database - 366 000 dxe5 and more than 200 000 of alternatives !

We can't play  5...Be7  due to  6.Bxf6  leaving us with no choice but to exchange Queens on move 5 leading to an equal position. We don't like equal positions. We don't play the Budapest to get equal positions, and we don't even want to talk about equal positions.

After  4.Bxf6  Qxf6  5.dxe5  Bb4+  6.Nd2  Qxe5  7.a3  Be7  8.Qc2  Black should have the slightest of edges due to the pair of Bishops, but I think that the text move enables us to fight for more  ! }

I hope that you know what to do if White puts the Queen on d2, which leaves us with the coverage of 4. Nd2 to be done !   4.Nd2 ?  exd4  5.a3  Be7  with a clear extra pawn for Black. }

4. Nc3 { This is the most common move in practice. } 4... h6

5... Qxf6 6. e3 Nc6 7. Nf3 Bxc3+
{ This is one of the key strategic concepts of the Budapest Gambit. We will very often take on c3 to weaken White's pawn structure. We see similar strategies in the Nimzo-Indian Defence and if we reverse the colours, in the Rossolimo Sicilian. }
8. bxc3 O-O

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ Let's start our Budapest tour ! We put immediate pressure on White's centre, and there is only one sensible solution for White - the pawn has to be taken ! However, not everybody will play according to the 'rules', and from time to time you will meet opponents who won't capture on e5 on move 3.   In this and the next chapter, we will learn how to not only equalize, but how to put pressure on our opponents in most of the lines ! The first chapter is devoted to all of White's minor tries on move three, while the move 3. d5 is analysed in the 2nd theoretical chapter of this course.   Some statistics: In my 2000+ ELO database, the move 3. dxe5 has been played 2582 times, while all of the other 3rd moves combined appeared in 84 games. That means that if you are 2000+ player, you should expect to meet the lines from the first two chapters in around 3-4% of your games.   However, if we lower the level a little, those numbers will drastically increase ! For example, in my standard database, the move 3. dxe5 appeared in 28025 games, while different 3rd moves have been played in around 4150 games. That means that once in every 7 games you might expect to see those alternatives ! The last example is taken from the Lichess online database - 366 000 dxe5 and more than 200 000 of alternatives ! That means that the lower the level of your opposition, the higher the chance of meeting the lines from the first two chapters !   Enough talking, let's go ! }

However, not everybody will play according to the 'rules', and from time to time you will meet opponents who won't capture on e5 on move 3.   In this and the next chapter, we will learn how to not only equalize, but how to put pressure on our opponents in most of the lines ! The first chapter is devoted to all of White's minor tries on move three, while the move 3. d5 is analysed in the 2nd theoretical chapter of this course.   Some statistics: In my 2000+ ELO database, the move 3. dxe5 has been played 2582 times, while all of the other 3rd moves combined appeared in 84 games. That means that if you are 2000+ player, you should expect to meet the lines from the first two chapters in around 3-4% of your games.   However, if we lower the level a little, those numbers will drastically increase ! For example, in my standard database, the move 3. dxe5 appeared in 28025 games, while different 3rd moves have been played in around 4150 games. That means that once in every 7 games you might expect to see those alternatives ! The last example is taken from the Lichess online database - 366 000 dxe5 and more than 200 000 of alternatives ! That means that the lower the level of your opposition, the higher the chance of meeting the lines from the first two chapters !   Enough talking, let's go ! }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. d5
{ If White refrains from taking on e5, this is the move we will usually see. White decides that the tension in the centre is already too much for him, and pushes the d-pawn. However, this move breaks a fundamental rule of not moving the same piece twice in the opening, and also, that the pawns don't go backwards. I consider 3. d5 to be an inaccuracy - same as all of the other 3rd moves besides 3. dxe5. }
3... Bb4+
{ It surprises me that this move is chosen in approximately 1/8 of all games that have reached this position. I find the check to be the most logical move and the one that will provoke a lot of mistakes from White.   Usually, Black plays  3...Bc5  , which might look like a logical move, but after  4.e3  I am far from impressed of Black's Bishop's position.  By playing 3... Bb4+, we develop the Bishop before playing ... d6, and keep the newly weakened c5-square for the other piece - the Knight ! I find this approach to be the most flexible and objectively the strongest. }
4. Nc3
{ This move is awful. White shows a complete misunderstanding of the Budapest Gambit positions and allows his pawn structure to be permanently damaged. }
4... Bxc3+
{ The doubled c-pawns aren't White's biggest problem. The biggest issue is a newly created outpost on c5, which will be under our eternal control. }
5. bxc3 d6
{ We have many different plans at our disposal. The first one is to place the Knight on e4 and follow it up by ... f5. The second one is to play ... b6 followed by ... Ba6 pressurizing the c4-pawn. There is also an option to put the Knight on c5, and sometimes pushing the e-pawn up the board will grab space and be a good idea - but be careful with this one, since it gives away the d4-square ! One thing to remember - we would love to grab the c4-pawn, but we will usually refrain from grabbing the c3-one. The reason for that is simple - if we take the c3-pawn, we create a long diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop. }

{ White would love to play g4 or Nh3 getting some fresh air, but we will decline even that option. }
10... g4
{ Both g4 and Nh4 are stopped and it will be a tough nut to crack for White how to develop the kingside. }
11. c5
{ White plays a pawn break which is one of the most common for him in the Budapest. Note that we virtually never take that pawn for multiple reasons ! Firstly, we would lose time. Secondly, our pawn structure on the queenside would be weakened. The third point is that it opens up some lines for White on the queenside.   If  11.Qd2  just  11...Qf6  with ... Na6 - c5 or ... Nd7 - c5 to come next. }
11... Na6
{ Simply ignoring the White pawn, securing the c5-square for us and forcing White to take on d6 which will open up the c-file for us. Note that after we play ... Nc5 and ... Bd7, our King belongs on the queenside - or in the centre in the worst-case scenario. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. d5
{ If White refrains from taking on e5, this is the move we will usually see. White decides that the tension in the centre is already too much for him, and pushes the d-pawn. However, this move breaks a fundamental rule of not moving the same piece twice in the opening, and also, that the pawns don't go backwards.

{ Starting from this line, we will analyse White's most sensible and popular options on move 4. Firstly, we will cover the move 4. e4.   White's intentions are crystal clear - our opponent wants to build a big pawn centre and force our Knight to do a little dance, similarly to the Alekhine Defence. However, things are far from simple. White is moving pawns only, and having the pawns on c4 and e4, weakens the d4-square. Normally, allowing the so-called Maroczy pawn structure in the ... cxd4 positions would be suboptimal, but with ... exd4 it is not as big of a problem. }
4... Nxe5
{ Of course, we don't support the Knight with moves such as ... h5 or ... d6, because White didn't do anything wrong and any pawn sacrifice from Black would be dubious at best. }
5. Nf3
{ It is possible for White to omit the move f4 and play more modestly, but it puts smaller pressure on Black. }
5... Nbc6
{ The best move, supporting the Knight and developing more forces.   I pondered about the move  5...Bb4+  , but I don't like one specific variation.  6.Bd2  Nxf3+  7.Qxf3  Bxd2+  is OK for Black.   However,  7.gxf3  !N  Bxd2+  8.Qxd2  d6  9.Rg1  g6  10.Nc3  Be6  11.f4  is a problem. Our position is passive and White has free play in the centre. Still, taking with the g-pawn has never been played, so this line might be a nice practical choice. }

{ This is the most natural and the most popular approach, but it gives Black an easy game. }

{ Starting from this line, we will analyse White's most sensible and popular options on move 4. Firstly, we will cover the move 4. e4.   White's intentions are crystal clear - our opponent wants to build a big pawn centre and force our Knight to do a little dance, similarly to the Alekhine Defence. However, things are far from simple. White is moving pawns only, and having the pawns on c4 and e4, weakens the d4-square. Normally, allowing the so-called Maroczy pawn structure in the ... cxd4 positions would be suboptimal, but with ... exd4 it is not as big of a problem. }
4... Nxe5
{ Of course, we don't support the Knight with moves such as ... h5 or ... d6, because White didn't do anything wrong and any pawn sacrifice from Black would be dubious at best. }
5. Nf3
{ It is possible for White to omit the move f4 and play more modestly, but it puts smaller pressure on Black. }
5... Nbc6
{ The best move, supporting the Knight and developing more forces.   I pondered about the move  5...Bb4+  , but I don't like one specific variation.  6.Bd2  Nxf3+  7.Qxf3  Bxd2+  is OK for Black.   However,  7.gxf3  !N  Bxd2+  8.Qxd2  d6  9.Rg1  g6  10.Nc3  Be6  11.f4  is a problem. Our position is passive and White has free play in the centre. Still, taking with the g-pawn has never been played, so this line might be a nice practical choice. }
6. Nxe5
{ The best move. The Knights will be exchanged anyway and it is better for White to force our Knight to e5 and keep his Bishop on e2. }
6... Nxe5 7. Nc3 { The most natural developing move. } 7... Bc5 8. Bf4
{ 8.Be2  transposes to the 5th line of this chapter.   8.Na4  allows  8...Bb4+  and the Knight is misplaced. }
8... d6
{ Not the most popular, but the best move. Having the Bishop on f4, White deprived himself the option of hitting the Knight with f4. That means that we should keep the strong Knight in the centre, especially that taking on e5 is a positional suicide. }
9. Be2
{ 9.Bxe5 ?  dxe5  10.Qxd8+  Kxd8  11.O-O-O  Bd7  is much better for Black.  We will play ... c6 and ... Kc7 next with a dominant position on the dark squares. }
9... Be6 { White already has some problems with the c4-pawn. } 10. O-O
{ This is the best move, but not an obvious one. White seemingly sacrifices a pawn on c4, but there is always Qa4+ in the air. }
10... Qf6 { We shouldn't capture on c4 due to aforementioned Qa4+ ideas. } 11.
Bg3 c6
{ Initially, I wanted to suggest  11...h5  with the idea  12.b4  Bd4 !  but there is a bigger problem.   11...h5  12.Bxh5 !  Brave and correct  !  12...Nxc4  13.Be2  c6  14.e5 !  is highly unpleasant.  By playing 11... c6, we improve our position by covering the d5-square and prepare to execute the idea of ... h5 on the next move. After any sensible move from White, we will continue with ... h5 - h4. The other point of 11... c6 is that the pawn on c4 is really hanging since there are no Qa4+ ideas anymore. }
12. Na4 { Only this move requires accurate reaction from us. } 12... Bd4
{ That's the big point of having the Queen on f6 ! The Bishop is taboo due to ... Nf3+. Black is ready to take on c4 or launch an offensive starting with ... h5 ... g5 etc. White has to play extremely precisely to be able to equalize ! }

Remember, that the threat is usually stronger than the execution.  14...a6  15.Nc3  Rag8 !  16.Rad1  Kc8  gives Black great coordination and we are ready to take on  f4.   Note that after  14.g3  the immediate  14...gxf4 ?  is weak due to  15.Qxf4  and we are forced to play  15...Qg7  with unclear consequences. }

White's intentions are crystal clear - our opponent wants to build a big pawn centre and force our Knight to do a little dance, similarly to the Alekhine Defence. However, things are far from simple. White is moving pawns only, and having the pawns on c4 and e4, weakens the d4-square.

14. Kxf2 Nd7
{ An extremely important move. Let's stop here for a second to discuss why it is so strong. Let's imagine that our Knight is on b8. What is White's move ? Of course, c5 ! Our opponent wants to undouble his bad pawns as fast as possible. We can't allow that ! We worked hard to get a superior pawn structure and we can't let this advantage slip away with one inaccurate move ! So why 14... Nbd7, not 14... Na6 ? Because sometimes White might consider e5 and the Knight from d7 stops both of them ! ... b6 ... Bb7 and ... f6 are next, bolstering the dark squares and keeping our position harmonious.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. e4
{ Starting from this line, we will analyse White's most sensible and popular options on move 4. Firstly, we will cover the move 4. e4.   White's intentions are crystal clear - our opponent wants to build a big pawn centre and force our Knight to do a little dance, similarly to the Alekhine Defence. However, things are far from simple. White is moving pawns only, and having the pawns on c4 and e4, weakens the d4-square. Normally, allowing the so-called Maroczy pawn structure in the ... cxd4 positions would be suboptimal, but with ... exd4 it is not as big of a problem. }
4... Nxe5
{ Of course, we don't support the Knight with moves such as ... h5 or ... d6, because White didn't do anything wrong and any pawn sacrifice from Black would be dubious at best. }
5. f4
{ This is by far the most popular and the most logical move. White builds a big pawn centre and prepares to put his pieces on the most natural squares. }
5... Nec6
{ 5...Ng6 ?!  is worse and one sample line might go  6.Nf3  Bc5  7.f5 !  Nh4  8.Ng5 !  which is more or less crushing. The Knight can't find a safe square so we should play my suggested 5th move. Funnily, this sequence has been played by myself back in 2010, but with the white pieces this time  !  8...Qe7  9.Nc3  c6  10.Qg4  f6  11.Nh3  g5  12.Nxg5  h6  13.Nh3  Nxf5  14.Qxf5  d6  15.Qxc8+  was a quick 1-0 in Plichta - Sokolowski, Mazovia Team Championship 2010.  The Knight on c6 seemingly blocks the other Knight's development, but it is not so simple. The other Knight will usually go to a6 and then c5. Black is ready to play ... Bc5 which White usually stops with 6. Be3. }
6. a3
{ This modest continuation has more venom than it seems. We have to abandon our plans connected with ... Bc5 and ... a5 and go for something else. }
6... g6
{ Here I hurry with explanations why I discard  6...a5.  After  7.Be3!  there are some arguments to play  7...Na6  , but after something like  8.Nf3  Bc5  9.Qd2  our position is too passive.  The problem with the move 6... a5 is that it is too slow. Note that if White starts with 6. Be3, then we have ... Bb4+ as a response - see variations starting from this one. But with a3 played, we should abandon plans connected with ... Bb4 and ... Bc5 completely, because we won't be able to plant the Bishop on one of those two squares anyway - or like in the 6... a5 line, with a very passive position. By playing 6... g6, we solve the problem of this Bishop, simultaneously claiming that 6. a3 is a waste of tempo. }
7. Nf3 { Virtually the only move played by White. } 7... Bg7 8. Bd3 d6
{ I will repeat myself that we very often postpone castling in favour of quick development ! }
9. O-O Bg4
{ White has two ways to react - either ignore the Bishop or challenge it immediately. }
10. Nc3 { Ignoring the Knight is a better try. } 10... Nd4
{ But the disadvantage of White's approach is that this is now possible. Our main positional threat is ... Nxf3+ followed by ... Bh3 and ... Bxc3 ! with ... Nd7 to come. White has one sensible way to defend against it. }
11. Kh1 Nbc6
{ 11...Nxf3+ ?!  is not so strong now due to  12.gxf3  Bh3  13.Rg1  Bxc3  14.bxc3  Nd7  15.f5 !  and our Bishop won't go back home.  It wouldn't be so strong with the King on g1, since the Rook wouldn't have the g1-square available. }
12. Be3 { The most natural move. } 12... Nxf3 13. gxf3 Bxc3
{ We go for this exchange anyway ! } 14. bxc3 Bd7
{ We have a typical double-edged position that arises quite often in the Budapest. White has two Bishops and the centre, Black has a better pawn structure and clear plans. Our plan is to play ... b6 stopping c5 and then ... Qe7 ... O-O-O. }
15. c5 { Of course, White should rush with this one. } 15... dxc5 16. Bxc5 Qf6
{ The pawn on f4 is hanging and ... O-O-O is next. Black has a great position. }

That means that all plans connected with ... Bc5 don't make any sense now and we have to play something else. On the other hand, the Bishop on c1 is blocked and White might have a tough time bringing this piece into the game. }
4... Nxe5
{ This is the best move. We take the pawn and avoid blundering the Knight after Qxg4. Let me mention that in this chapter we will take a look at all of White's options besides 5. Nh3 which is analysed in the next chapter. The reason why I decided to split this 4. e3 chapter in two is that 5. Nh3 has a completely different character than the rest of White's 5th moves, so I think it is logical to first learn the lines which are less chaotic, and then switch to more tactical stuff ! }
5. Nc3 d6
{ This is the plan that I recommend following. As I've mentioned, putting the Bishop on c5 doesn't make any sense with the White pawn on e3.   5...Bb4 ?!  is also dubious due to  6.Bd2  and White will expel our Knight.  Going back to 5... d6, Black's idea is to fianchetto the dark-squared Bishop. I could also suggest starting with ... g6, but in some of the lines in this chapter, the move order is crucial and always playing ... d6 first should help with memorization ! }
6. b3
{ The only independent try.   6.f4  Nec6  transposes to the main lines of this chapter. }
6... g6
{ Both sides will fianchetto their dark-squared Bishops on the long diagonal. Usually, White should have a slightly better position, but where in the Budapest aren’t our chances objectively slightly worse?! What we want are PRACTICAL chances to outplay our opponent. }
7. Bb2 Bg7 8. Be2 a5
{ Starting with ... O-O is also possible. We want to secure the c5-square for our b8-Knight. }
9. Nf3 Nbd7 10. O-O O-O
{ We will play ... Nc5 and ... Re8 next followed by ... c6. One additional idea to remember is a well-timed ... a4 to be able to respond to b4 with ... a3 ! We have a very good version of the ... exd4 King's Indian - speaking of which, I will mention  (completely by accident)  that I created a course on! Still, White's chances should be rated as veeery slightly higher. }

7... Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2
{ The Knight is still misplaced on d2 ! That was the biggest point of giving the check on d2 - no matter what White does, he will have to misplace one of his pieces or allow the pawn structure to be ruined. The fact that the Queen is on f3 deprives White of the Qxd2 option. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3
{ This is White's 2nd most popular move. Many players who have to deal with the Budapest Gambit on the White side go for this, seemingly most natural continuation. However, this line has a big drawback as compared to the 4. Bf4 mainline, which will be analysed in the next three chapters - Black is able to cage the c1-Bishop and gain attacking chances in many variations ! }
4... Bc5
{ Note that  4...Nc6  transposes to the next chapters, but I see no reason to grant White this opportunity.  By playing 4... Bc5, we force White to play e3, which means that White has to look for an alternative route for the locked c1-Bishop. }
5. e3 { The only move. } 5... Nc6
{ We make sure that the e5-pawn will be consumed just in time. White threatened to play h3 so it is necessary to start with this active continuation. A few things about the timing of my recommended capture ... Ncxe5 - we want to take on e5 only after White plays Be2. If our opponent avoids Be2 in favour of let's say Nc3, we will continue developing with ... O-O ... Re8 and only then take the guy on e5. See comments to Black's next move for a specific line. }
6. a3
{ This is the third most popular move for White and it is not without logic. Our opponent covers the b4-square and prepares to play b4 himself. }
6... a5
{ A typical and necessary reaction. We solidify the Bishop and stop b4. } 7.
Nc3 O-O
{ Remember that we can't take on e5 yet, because White hans't put the Bishop on e2 yet !   7...Ncxe5 ?!  8.h3  Nxf3+  9.Qxf3  Ne5  10.Qg3  Ng6  11.h4  is similar to the previous line. }
8. b3
{ White speeds up the development of the queenside and delays Be2. But going for the fianchetto gives us a nice additional option, which we have discussed in the previous line. }
8... Re8
{ I think I don't have to repeat myself about the timing of ... Ncxe5. White delays Be2 so we delay capturing. Now, with our whole army ready for ... Ncxe5 we can safely take on e5 next. }
9. Bb2 Ncxe5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Be2 Ra6
{ It usually works very well with our Bishop on c5 and White's Bishop on b2 - no f4 for White due to e3-hanging ! Castling is now extremely risky for White, who will run into ... Rh6 or ... Rg6. }

{ White has a pair of Bishops and a superior pawn structure, so he has to stand better right ?! Somebody is indeed better here, but it is not White, but Black ! Why is that ? We need to look at this position from a more dynamic perspective. White's pieces are still sleeping on the starting positions. We have an open d-file which will be used immediately by going ... Rad8 next. Also, the d3-square is weak which might be painful for White after ... Rad8 and ... Bd3. All of those factors combined give Black an edge ! }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3
{ This is White's 2nd most popular move. Many players who have to deal with the Budapest Gambit on the White side go for this, seemingly most natural continuation. However, this line has a big drawback as compared to the 4. Bf4 mainline, which will be analysed in the next three chapters - Black is able to cage the c1-Bishop and gain attacking chances in many variations ! }
4... Bc5
{ Note that  4...Nc6  transposes to the next chapters, but I see no reason to grant White this opportunity.  By playing 4... Bc5, we force White to play e3, which means that White has to look for an alternative route for the locked c1-Bishop. }
5. e3 { The only move. } 5... Nc6
{ We make sure that the e5-pawn will be consumed just in time. White threatened to play h3 so it is necessary to start with this active continuation. A few things about the timing of my recommended capture ... Ncxe5 - we want to take on e5 only after White plays Be2. If our opponent avoids Be2 in favour of let's say Nc3, we will continue developing with ... O-O ... Re8 and only then take the guy on e5. See comments to Black's next move for a specific line. }
6. Be2
{ This is the most popular move. White develops the kingside and delays Nc3 for the moment. Still, those lines - 6. Be2 and 6. Nc3 will usually transpose to each other. }
6... Ncxe5
{ The best timing. Whenever the Bishop lands on e2 we can automatically take on e5 with the c6-Knight. }
7. Nxe5
{ Note that  7.O-O  Nxf3+  8.Bxf3  Ne5  9.Be2  O-O  10.Nc3  Re8  will transpose to the same variation but a tempo down for both sides. }
7... Nxe5 8. Nc3 { 9.O-O  O-O  9.Nc3  Re8  is the same. } 8... O-O 9. O-O Re8
{ This move is characteristic for this variation. We simply develop the Rook and wait for White to show his hand. }
10. b3
{ This is by far the most popular move, preparing to develop the last minor piece on the long diagonal. The disadvantage is that we will be able to carry out a typical Rook lift via the 6th rank. }
10... a5
{ This is the most standard plan for Black. We plan ... Ra6. However, there are some lines where White will create some problems. That's why I give you the alternative line 10... d6 which can be found in the previous three variations 1,2,3. The character of the game is similar, but we completely abandon the ... a5 ... Ra6 plan in favour of quick ... Bf5. Note that the Rook might be lifted to the kingside via e6. }
11. Na4
{ I think that out of all White's 11th moves, this one is the least threatening.   One thing has to be remembered - we usually drop the Bishop back to  f8  except the  11.Bb2  Ra6  12.Ne4  line when  12...Ba7  will be mandatory  ! Check out the  aforementioned line. }
11... Bf8
{ The Bishop goes to f8, because on a7 it would obstruct the ... Ra6 manoeuvre. }
12. Bb2 { This does nothing to prevent our standard plan from happening. }
12... Ra6
{ Now we can take a closer look at this continuation. The next few lines will be devoted to showing you different attacking ideas at Black's disposal. }
13. f4 { Aggressive, but the Knight isn't forced to retreat immediately ! }
13... Rd6 { That's the other point of having the Rook on a6. } 14. Qc2 Nc6
{ The Knight goes back home but the Rook on d6 isn't closed - as it would be on a6... Rxe3 is threatened . }
15. Rf3 { The most popular and obvious move. } 15... Rh6
{ Creating a funny positional threat of ... Qh4 and if Rh3 then ... Qe7 back - Rxh6 doesn't work due to ... Qxe3+. The other idea is ... d5. }
16. a3
{ Amazingly, this has been played in most of White's games, including the game GM Dziuba - IM Zwardon, Wroclaw 2020. }
16... d5
{ The most dynamic option.   16...Qh4  17.Rh3  Qe7  18.Rg3  is less clear. }
17. Rd1 { This move might be the reason why no one has ever played 16... d5 ! }

{ This is the move I like the most. } 19. cxd5
{ 19.Rxd5  Rxe3  with mutual chances. } 19... Rxe3
{ Tactics work beautifully for Black. Let's analyse two possibilities for White. }
20. Rf3 { I think that this is inaccurate. } 20... Qe7 21. dxc6
{ Of course not  21.Rxe3 ??  Qxe3+  22.Kh1  Qxf4  and White can safely throw the towel. }
21... Rxe2 22. Rxd7 Rxc2 23. Rxe7 b5

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3
{ This is White's 2nd most popular move. Many players who have to deal with the Budapest Gambit on the White side go for this, seemingly most natural continuation. However, this line has a big drawback as compared to the 4. Bf4 mainline, which will be analysed in the next three chapters - Black is able to cage the c1-Bishop and gain attacking chances in many variations ! }
4... Bc5
{ Note that  4...Nc6  transposes to the next chapters, but I see no reason to grant White this opportunity.  By playing 4... Bc5, we force White to play e3, which means that White has to look for an alternative route for the locked c1-Bishop. }
5. e3 { The only move. } 5... Nc6
{ We make sure that the e5-pawn will be consumed just in time. White threatened to play h3 so it is necessary to start with this active continuation. A few things about the timing of my recommended capture ... Ncxe5 - we want to take on e5 only after White plays Be2. If our opponent avoids Be2 in favour of let's say Nc3, we will continue developing with ... O-O ... Re8 and only then take the guy on e5. See comments to Black's next move for a specific line. }
6. Be2
{ This is the most popular move. White develops the kingside and delays Nc3 for the moment. Still, those lines - 6. Be2 and 6. Nc3 will usually transpose to each other. }
6... Ncxe5
{ The best timing. Whenever the Bishop lands on e2 we can automatically take on e5 with the c6-Knight. }
7. Nxe5
{ Note that  7.O-O  Nxf3+  8.Bxf3  Ne5  9.Be2  O-O  10.Nc3  Re8  will transpose to the same variation but a tempo down for both sides. }
7... Nxe5 8. Nc3 { 9.O-O  O-O  9.Nc3  Re8  is the same. } 8... O-O 9. O-O Re8
{ This move is characteristic for this variation. We simply develop the Rook and wait for White to show his hand. }
10. b3
{ This is by far the most popular move, preparing to develop the last minor piece on the long diagonal. The disadvantage is that we will be able to carry out a typical Rook lift via the 6th rank. }
10... a5
{ This is the most standard plan for Black. We plan ... Ra6. However, there are some lines where White will create some problems. That's why I give you the alternative line 10... d6 which can be found in the previous three variations 1,2,3. The character of the game is similar, but we completely abandon the ... a5 ... Ra6 plan in favour of quick ... Bf5. Note that the Rook might be lifted to the kingside via e6. }
11. Na4
{ I think that out of all White's 11th moves, this one is the least threatening.   One thing has to be remembered - we usually drop the Bishop back to  f8  except the  11.Bb2  Ra6  12.Ne4  line when  12...Ba7  will be mandatory  ! Check out the  aforementioned line. }
11... Bf8
{ The Bishop goes to f8, because on a7 it would obstruct the ... Ra6 manoeuvre. }
12. f4
{ The most direct and popular move. The Knight is forced to go back to the 6th rank making the ... Ra6 lift less appealing. The positive side for Black is that White permanently weakens his position. }
12... Ng6
{ I prefer this square for the reason that if White goes Bf3 we have ... Nh4 as a response ! Against most of White's moves, we can go ... b6 and ... Bb7 next. If after ... b6 we get Bf3, then ... Rb8 with ... Nh4 to follow. }
13. Qd3 d5
{ This is a novelty. Usually, when I see several options that are equally good, I prefer to go for the most challenging ones, and especially the ones that have never been played. }
14. Qxd5 { A more critical approach. } 14... Bd7
{ Black has a double idea - 1... Nh4; 2... Qf6 Bb2 Qe7 ! } 15. g3
{ Stopping ... Nh4. } 15... Ne7
{ The Knight has done its job and now Black will play ... Nf5 followed by ... Bc6 or ... Bxa4. }
16. Qd3 Bxa4 17. bxa4 Nc6 { Even the resulting endgame is good for Black. } 18.
Qxd8 Raxd8
{ Black will play ... Nb4 and ... Bc5 with adequate compensation. I think it is White who has to play some correct moves - Black's moves are very simple. }

13. c5

14. f4
{ This is one of two inaccurate moves.   The other one is  14.Qd4 ?!  Qh4 !  15.h3  d6  with a superior position for Black. }

{ We make sure that the e5-pawn will be consumed just in time. White threatened to play h3 so it is necessary to start with this active continuation. A few things about the timing of my recommended capture ... Ncxe5 - we want to take on e5 only after White plays Be2. If our opponent avoids Be2 in favour of let's say Nc3, we will continue developing with ... O-O ... Re8 and only then take the guy on e5. See comments to Black's next move for a specific line. }

15... gxf6 16. Qf5

16... Bb8
{ Improving The Bishop, stopping Qf4, threatening ... Bxh2+ and planning ... d5.   16...d5 ?  17.Qf4  is excellent for White. }

Firstly and most importantly, White has a damaged pawn structure on the queenside that will never be repaired - if we play carefully! Secondly, we have a slight lead in development and our next moves are obvious. We will - usually! - castle kingside and then implement one of the following plans: A. We will play ... b6 and ... Bb7; B. ... Ne4 - c5 - the Knight is excellent on this square; C. ... Bg4 followed by ... Rae8. Note that White's basic idea is to play c5 and we should always pay attention to this pawn break. Also, after we play ... b6, when White plays Nd4, we should have ... Ne5 as a response - or ... Na5 in the worst-case scenario. The reason for that is that if we are forced to take on d4, we repair White's pawn structure which results in losing our compensation. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Bf4
{ In the last three chapters of this course we will take a look at White's most popular move 4. Bf4. This is, in my opinion, the most logical and the best move in the position. Our opponent defends the pawn with the Bishop, making sure that this piece won't be blocked by the e3-pawn in the future. }
4... Nc6
{ Simply attacking the pawn.   Note that ideas connected with  4...Bc5 ?  are just wrong due to  5.e3  and our Bishop on c5 looks stupid looking at the e3-pawn while the White Bishop is nicely developed on f4.   Let me also mention that the crazy-looking  4...g5 !?  is analysed in the #11th chapter of this course. }
5. Nf3
{ White should try to make it as hard as possible for Black to take the e5 pawn. }
5... Bb4+ 6. Nc3
{ This chapter is devoted to this continuation.   The next chapter will be about the modern main move  6.Nbd2. }
6... Bxc3+
{ Amazingly, this is not the most popular move in this position !   Black usually plays  6...Qe7 ?!  but it gives White an additional option of  7.Qb3 !  which is great for our opponent.  By playing 6... Bxc3+! we eliminate the option of Qb3 for White. That means that White's pawn structure will be permanently damaged. }
7. bxc3 Qe7
{ The pawn on e5 is ready to be taken ! Now White has to make a choice - defend it or not ?! }
8. Qd5
{ The correct move. The pawn on e5 is White's asset and our rival shouldn't give it away as cheaply as in the previous variations. }
8... f6
{ This is my suggested line.   8...Qa3 ?!  is played quite often, but after  9.Rd1 !  Qxc3+  10.Qd2  Qxc4  11.e3  White has a dangerous initiative. I recommend avoiding this line  ! }
9. exf6 { The only sensible option. } 9... Nxf6
{ White has no less than 5 different moves, but only one poses some problems for Black. }
10. Qd1
{ We will start analysing White's retreating moves with this modest line. As usual, the Queen won't be harassed on d1, but it is not too active here. }
10... d6
{ A necessary move. White threatened Bxc7 so we should parry this threat while developing at the same time. Let's stop for the moment and ponder where Black's compensation for the missing pawn lies. Firstly and most importantly, White has a damaged pawn structure on the queenside that will never be repaired - if we play carefully! Secondly, we have a slight lead in development and our next moves are obvious. We will - usually! - castle kingside and then implement one of the following plans: A. We will play ... b6 and ... Bb7; B. ... Ne4 - c5 - the Knight is excellent on this square; C. ... Bg4 followed by ... Rae8. Note that White's basic idea is to play c5 and we should always pay attention to this pawn break. Also, after we play ... b6, when White plays Nd4, we should have ... Ne5 as a response - or ... Na5 in the worst-case scenario. The reason for that is that if we are forced to take on d4, we repair White's pawn structure which results in losing our compensation. }
11. e3
{ Plans connected with  11.g3  are not ideal here, because of  11...Be6  targetting the c-pawn. }
11... O-O 12. Be2 { The most modest approach for White. } 12... Ne4
{ There is no point in delaying this move, especially that the White Queen is on d1 and c3 is a target. }
13. Rc1
{ 13.Qc2  Bg4  14.O-O  Rae8  with ... Nc5 and ... Bf5 to come, Black has adequate counterplay. Note that lines like this are very intuitive and easy to play for Black. On the other hand, White doesn't have an obvious plan. }
13... Bg4 14. O-O Rae8
{ Black has a nice and active position.   A sample line might go  15.Nd4  Bxe2  16.Nxe2   16.Qxe2 ?!  is even worse due to  16...Nxc3  17.Rxc3  Nxd4  and Black stands better.  16...Qf7  17.Qd5  Nc5  and it is White who has to be careful not to be worse.  Black's main plan is ... Na5. }

Our opponent defends the pawn with the Bishop, making sure that this piece won't be blocked by the e3-pawn in the future. }
4... Nc6
{ Simply attacking the pawn.   Note that ideas connected with  4...Bc5 ?  are just wrong due to  5.e3  and our Bishop on c5 looks stupid looking at the e3-pawn while the White Bishop is nicely developed on f4.   Let me also mention that the crazy-looking  4...g5 !?  is analysed in the #11th chapter of this course. }
5. Nf3

5... Bb4+ 6. Nc3

6... Bxc3+
{ Amazingly, this is not the most popular move in this position !   Black usually plays  6...Qe7 ?!  but it gives White an additional option of  7.Qb3 !  which is great for our opponent.  By playing 6... Bxc3+! we eliminate the option of Qb3 for White. That means that White's pawn structure will be permanently damaged. }
7. bxc3 Qe7
{ The pawn on e5 is ready to be taken ! Now White has to make a choice - defend it or not ?! }
8. Qd5
{ The correct move. The pawn on e5 is White's asset and our rival shouldn't give it away as cheaply as in the previous variations. }
8... f6
{ This is my suggested line.   8...Qa3 ?!  is played quite often, but after  9.Rd1 !  Qxc3+  10.Qd2  Qxc4  11.e3  White has a dangerous initiative. I recommend avoiding this line  ! }
9. exf6 { The only sensible option. } 9... Nxf6

10. Qd3

Our opponent avoids problems seen in the previous variations, where the Queen was hit with different tricks. Also, both c4 and c3 are securely defended and White can go on with his life ! }
10... d6 { Simply defending c7 and preparing to castle. } 11. g3
{ This is definitely the most problematic move. The Bishop will be excellent on the long diagonal and the King's position will be strengthened. }
11... O-O
{ For some time I pondered over the move  11...b6 ?!  , but after  12.Bg2  Bb7  13.O-O  O-O  14.Nd4  Na5  White has  15.Bd5+ !  and Black's position is unacceptable to my eyes. }
12. Bg2 Re8
{ I consider this to be the best chance for Black, although some sources claim that White will be clearly better ! It is not true, and we should be able to get decent chances !   12...Bg4 !?  is also playable, but I think that the text move should be resurrected  ! Still, after  13.O-O  Rae8  14.Rfe1  Kh8  Black should have a more or less playable position.   However,  12...Bg4!?  13.h3 !  Bh5  14.c5  dxc5  15.O-O  looks extremely unpleasant to my eyes and I consider it to be the line's refutation.  I also need to share a secret with you - this position after White's 12th move is what I consider to be the closest of a refutation of the Budapest Gambit. That means that we should stop thinking about crazy attacks, but rather how to get a decent position which is close to equality. By playing 12... Re8, Black pressurizes the e2-pawn and tries to stop White from castling. }
13. Be3
{ This is the direct option of blocking the e-file. Still, it misplaces the Bishop a little. }
13... Rb8
{ This move is another novelty I managed to find when working on this course. Black's idea is simple - play ... b6 but firstly, we need to step away from the h1 - a8 diagonal. }
14. O-O b6 15. Rfe1 h6
{ It is useful to stop Ng5 and Bg5 before continuing with our plan. Black's idea is to play ... Bb7 ... Ne5 and ... Qf7 targetting the light squares. }

Note that ideas connected with  4...Bc5 ?  are just wrong due to  5.e3  and our Bishop on c5 looks stupid looking at the e3-pawn while the White Bishop is nicely developed on f4.   Let me also mention that the crazy-looking  4...g5 !?  is analysed in the #11th chapter of this course. }
5. Nf3
{ White should try to make it as hard as possible for Black to take the e5 pawn. }
5... Bb4+ 6. Nc3
{ This chapter is devoted to this continuation.   The next chapter will be about the modern main move  6.Nbd2. }
6... Bxc3+
{ Amazingly, this is not the most popular move in this position !   Black usually plays  6...Qe7 ?!  but it gives White an additional option of  7.Qb3 !  which is great for our opponent.  By playing 6... Bxc3+! we eliminate the option of Qb3 for White. That means that White's pawn structure will be permanently damaged. }
7. bxc3 Qe7
{ The pawn on e5 is ready to be taken ! Now White has to make a choice - defend it or not ?! }
8. Qd5
{ The correct move. The pawn on e5 is White's asset and our rival shouldn't give it away as cheaply as in the previous variations. }
8... f6
{ This is my suggested line.   8...Qa3 ?!  is played quite often, but after  9.Rd1 !  Qxc3+  10.Qd2  Qxc4  11.e3  White has a dangerous initiative. I recommend avoiding this line  ! }
9. exf6 { The only sensible option. } 9... Nxf6
{ White has no less than 5 different moves, but only one poses some problems for Black. }
10. Qd3
{ If I was forced to pick one position from the whole course that is the most problematic for Black it would be this position. In my opinion, d3 is the best place for the Queen. Our opponent avoids problems seen in the previous variations, where the Queen was hit with different tricks. Also, both c4 and c3 are securely defended and White can go on with his life ! }
10... d6 { Simply defending c7 and preparing to castle. } 11. g3
{ This is definitely the most problematic move. The Bishop will be excellent on the long diagonal and the King's position will be strengthened. }
11... O-O
{ For some time I pondered over the move  11...b6 ?!  , but after  12.Bg2  Bb7  13.O-O  O-O  14.Nd4  Na5  White has  15.Bd5+ !  and Black's position is unacceptable to my eyes. }
12. Bg2 Re8
{ I consider this to be the best chance for Black, although some sources claim that White will be clearly better ! It is not true, and we should be able to get decent chances !   12...Bg4 !?  is also playable, but I think that the text move should be resurrected  ! Still, after  13.O-O  Rae8  14.Rfe1  Kh8  Black should have a more or less playable position.   However,  12...Bg4!?  13.h3 !  Bh5  14.c5  dxc5  15.O-O  looks extremely unpleasant to my eyes and I consider it to be the line's refutation.  I also need to share a secret with you - this position after White's 12th move is what I consider to be the closest of a refutation of the Budapest Gambit. That means that we should stop thinking about crazy attacks, but rather how to get a decent position which is close to equality. By playing 12... Re8, Black pressurizes the e2-pawn and tries to stop White from castling. }
13. O-O { This pawn sacrifice is White's most promising move. } 13... Qxe2 14.
Qxe2 Rxe2 15. Nd4 Nxd4 16. cxd4
{ This position was considered to be highly inferior for Black, although I hope that the evaluation changes a little after my analysis is published ! True, White will remain slightly better, but I don't think our opponent can count on anything bigger than the slight edge ! }
16... Be6
{ This is my suggested move, that has been played only 6 times in practice. White has a pair of Bishops and mobile pawn structure, so we need to start creating some threats on our own - defending passively won't work ! }
17. Bxb7 { This is the most critical move. } 17... Rb8 18. Bf3
{ The most dangerous option. } 18... Rc2
{ Black's position holds by the skin of our teeth, but - it holds ! There are two decent ways forward for White. }
19. d5 { Let me mention that this is not a strong option. } 19... Bg4 20. Bxg4
Nxg4 21. Rac1 Rbb2 22. Rxc2 Rxc2

Secondly, this line might be used from time to time as a surprise weapon, especially against positional or strategic players. The third point is that in must-win situations, it might be a very good practical weapon.

My opinion on this variation is that it is objectively dubious, but there are a few reasons that made me devote a whole chapter to this variation: Firstly, I am pretty sure that if someone is going to buy the Budapest Gambit course, he will expect to see this line inside ! Secondly, this line might be used from time to time as a surprise weapon, especially against positional or strategic players. The third point is that in must-win situations, it might be a very good practical weapon. And the fourth point is that I managed to find some improvements in the existing theory, so this course is the place where those novelties see the daylight ! Still, don't be surprised that most variations end with the += evaluation, because those positions are very risky. One can't expect to equalize being a pawn down and launching the g-pawn ! But, as in the whole Budapest Gambit philosophy, we don't play this opening to equalize, but to have fun and win games ! The last piece of advice - don't try this line in correspondence chess ! Let's go ! }
5. Bg3
{ This is a critical choice. White keeps the pawn on e5 defended and the Bishop will support the h4 break in many lines. }
5... Nc6
{ This is the 2nd most popular move for Black after 5... Bg7. The reason for prioritizing the Knight move is that... we need g7 for the Queen... I know that sounds ridiculous, but in some lines, it will be the key ! White will go h4, and after hxg5 Qxg5 we will often retreat to g7. So for now, we develop as if nothing happened and will adjust accordingly to White's play.   5...Bg7  6.h4  Nxe5  7.hxg5  Qxg5  8.Nh3  is a problematic line - we need  g7  to be free for our Queen  ! }
6. Nf3
{ This is definitely the most popular move. White defends the pawn while developing the Knight. }
6... Bg7
{ With the Knight on f3, we can no longer delay playing this move. Attacking e5 is our priority. The good news is that the 6. h4 line wasn't too dangerous in our 5... Nc6 move order, and now we land back in the main lines of 4... g5. }
7. Nc3
{ This is the main option for White. White avoids any skirmish on the kingside and just develops. }
7... Ngxe5 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. e3
{ The most modest move. Once again White forgets about h4 or postpones it in favour of fast development. It is a logical approach, because it is usually hard to go wrong when you simply keep developing.   9.h4  h6  transposes to this line. }
9... d6
{ There are some games that went  9...h5  , but I would prefer to keep this idea as a possibility, not commit to it immediately. }
10. c5
{ This is one of the most common themes in the Budapest Gambit. We should ignore the pawn and continue developing. 10. c5 is usually the choice of correspondence players, so the chance of meeting it over the board is low. }
10... O-O 11. cxd6 cxd6 { We want to continue with ... Be6 and ... Rc8. } 12.
h4 Be6
{ This is even stronger than pushing the pawn to g4. Note that White is still two moves from castling which justifies our fast-paced strategy. }
13. hxg5 Qxg5 14. Bf4 Qg6 15. Nd5 Rae8
{ White is slightly better but the position is murky as usual and we should have good chances to outplay our opponent in the middlegame. }

[Black "2.Bg5 2.Bf4 2.Nc3 2.Nf3 - Fast guideline"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3
{ I wanted this course to be dedicated to the Budapest Gambit, and I decided to focus purely on that topic. I think that adding a hundred or so variations to learn when we analyse completely different positions and structures would be sub-optimal. However, I think it is worth taking a very brief look at White's different possibilities on move no 2. Instead of providing a full coverage of those openings, this guideline will offer some hints about what to strive for and where to look at when meeting those alternatives in practice. Before we stick to 2. Nf3 I want to mention a few different tries from White.   2.Nc3  is harmless after  2...d5!  and I'm going to claim that Black can't ever be worse in a position like this. The Knight on  c3  is misplaced and we have a fair share of the centre. After  3.Bf4  I recommend playing  3...c5  4.e3  cxd4!   All you have to know is to avoid  4...Nc6??  5.Nb5!  which consumed too many souls.  5.exd4  a6  and we are ready to play ... Nc6 with a great position.   2.Nc3  d5  3.Bg5  is a Veresov Attack, but Black gets a great game after  3...Nbd7!  with ... h6 or ... c5 next.   The other option for White is  2.Bf4  and I will suggest the same line as in my KID repertoire.  2...c5  and here White has two main options.  3.e3   3.d5  is also possible, but after  3...b5!  Black has a strong counterplay.  4.a4   4.c4  is a very strange Benko with the Bishop on f4, and it can't be challenging for Black.  4...b4  and Black will develop by playing ... g6 ... Bg7 etc.  3...Nd5!?  4.Bg3  Qb6  and White has to deal with pressure on the queenside. It is not easy with the Bishop being on  g3.   There is also the Tromp starting with  2.Bg5  - my beloved opening! I suggest  2...d5  3.e3   3.Bxf6  is more direct and I suggest  3...exf6  4.e3  Bd6  5.c4  dxc4  6.Bxc4  O-O  We will play ... Nbd7 and ... f5 next with good counter chances.  3...c6  and  after White's most popular moves which are Bd3 or Nd2, we will play ... Bg4.  Going back to 2. Nf3, White might start with this move to avoid the Budapest Gambit - it indicates that it is an unpleasant opening to face over the board! However, this approach has pros and cons. If White starts with 2. Nf3 and you want to transpose to some normal opening, there are some lines that are not possible to be played now:  A. 2... g6 - White can't play variations with f3 and f4 so no Samisch and Four Pawns Attack. Also, systems with Be2 Be3 or Be2 Bg5 are not possible, because the Knight is already on f3! Not to mention lines such as Bd3 Nge2 or Ne2 - g3 - those are not possible for White to implement with the Knight on f3. That means that the only two sensible options that White might have at his disposal are the Classical System and the Fianchetto System. If your opponent doesn't play those on his daily basis - great! - you tricked him!  The same goes for the Grunfeld. After 2... g6 there is no 3. f3 which is usually annoying and also the mainline 7. Bc4 followed by Nge2 is avoided.  B. 2... e6 - White can't play the Nimzo because the Knight is committed to f3. However, the Catalan or Queen's Indian will still be viable options.  C. 2... d5 - Here you avoid lines such as a quick e4 in the Queen's Gambit Accepted, and White won't be able to reach Nge2 lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined. }
2... c5
{ If I would recommend a direct way of punishing White's last move, it would be this idea. Very often we kick our opponent out of his comfort zone, because it is Black who starts the initiative. Note that we want to adopt a type of Benko approach now.   If you want to keep a mad-man approach, and complicate your opponent's life on every occasion, then  2..b5!?  might be for you. }
3. d5
{ This is the most common move. White wants to play c4 transposing to some kind of Benoni/Benko positions, or even play 4. Nc3.   3.c4  is the most common alternative. After  3...cxd4  4.Nxd4  there are two good ways for Black to play.  4...e5!?  is an old gambit line, that has never been actually refuted!   4...e6  is calmer and after  5.Nc3  we will play  5...d5  and Black shouldn't have problems reaching equality.  5.Nb5  d5!  6.cxd5  Bc5!   But not  6...Nxd5??  7.Qxd5  1-0  Black will castle short and then play for ... e4 ... Nbd7 - e5 with an attack. I think it is a great weapon for people who love to play the Budapest Gambit - which means us! }
3... b5
{ And now if White wants to play the Benko, we will reach the line that is not too common. }
4. Bg5
{ The most popular move for White.   There is also  4.c4  which transposes to the Benko Gambit  with 4. Nf3  but I consider this line to be OK for Black after  4...Bb7. }
4... g6 5. Bxf6 { White usually takes. } 5... exf6 6. e4 b4
{ A strong move, stopping Nc3 and preparing ... Bg7 ... O-O ... d6 etc. Eventually, we want to strike with ... f5.  So this is a very short coverage on my suggestions about what to do if White sidesteps 2. c4. I don't recommend to play the Budapest as the main weapon vs 1. d4, so having some main opening prepared should help you navigate those sidelines. }

{ We should start analysing all those model games with the memory of where and when it all started. Back in 1896  (when most of us didn't know how to play chess yet)  , two guys were paired against each other. About the player handling the White pieces, we know that his 2nd name was Adler, but the one having Black was the legendary Geza Maroczy. The same Maroczy who invented the e4 - c4 pawn duo against the Accelerated Dragon. In this game, which was played completely by accident in Budapest, he faced 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4. We should treat this moment as the birth of the whole Budapest gambit concept. If only Maroczy knew how many followers this system would have in the 21st century ! }

Nc6 6. Qd5
{ Adler decided to fight for the hanging pawn on e5. The problem for White is that Black will get huge compensation for the missing pawn. }
6... Qe7
{ Maroczy developed four pieces in only six moves. Also, the White Queen is prone to some ... Nf6 or ... d6 ... Be6 ideas. }
7. Nc3 Ngxe5
{ Taking with the other Knight was, as usual, the most aggressive move, keeping the active Knight on g4. }
8. Be2 d6 { White played pretty well up to this moment. } 9. Ne4
{ Moving the same piece twice is wrong. White was obliged to finish development. }
9... Be6 { Black is already much better. The c4-pawn falls next. } 10. Qd1 Bb4+

{ The name Paul Keres shouldn't need an introduction. The most famous Estonian chess player, whose face can be seen nowadays on the bill of 5 Estonian Koronas was a true gentleman of the game and one of the strongest players of his time. One of my memories with Mr Keres is when I played the team tournament in Pardubice, one of the teams called themselves 'Who Keres ?' - creativity level 100. Going back to the game, this was a correspondence duel where Keres was White and he had to face the Budapest Gambit. }

{ 10...Na6  11.Nf3  b6  was preferable. I would keep the pawn on d7 for the moment. }

11... Nd7 { Preparing ... Nc5 or sometimes even ... Nf6. } 12. Nf3 Nc5

{ With the Knight on f3, White would have Re1 ideas in store, while now, the e-file is blocked by three of White's units. }
12. Ng3 g6
{ Stopping Nf5 is logical, but allows White to grab control over some of the dark squares.   12...Bb7  However, this was very interesting. Black completely ignores White's threat and goes on with his life on the queenside.  13.Nf5  Qf8  14.Bd4  Rg8  =+  and Black might castle queenside and start expelling White's pieces. }

{ Black managed to get this typical setup with both Knights placed actively in the centre. My general understanding of this position is that Black has a very good version of the King's Indian, because White's pieces are not too active and we might create active counterplay with ... c6 ... Re8 and a well-timed ... a4. }
12. a3 Re8 13. b4 Ne6 14. Qd2 b6
{ It is hard to criticize this move, because the Bishop is usually very well placed on b7 in the Budapest, but creating those light-squared weaknesses will tell in the long run.   14...c6  15.Rfd1  Nxf4  16.exf4  axb4  17.axb4  Rxa1  18.Bxa1  Nd7  would lead to a position with chances for both sides.   14...Nxf4  15.exf4  Nd7  was also quite good. }
15. Nfd5 Ba6 16. b5 Bb7
{ This was Miezis's idea - the c5-square is under Black's control, but on the other hand White gets the Knight on d5 and c6 is weak. }

12. Kh1 Nh4 13. Rg1 Qe7 14. Bd2 Rae8

{ A sensible move, but I would prefer to put the Knight on f6 instead. Still, 16... Nc5 is a good move. }
17. b4 Nxg2
{ 17...Ne4 !  was even stronger.  18.Nxe4  Nxg2  19.Qxg2  Qxe4  Black has a stable advantage thanks to White's ruined pawn structure. Also, all of our pieces are more active and the e4-square is under our control. }

{ So we have a material imbalance of two minor pieces for the Rook. Normally in the middlegame, it would highly benefit the side with the minor pieces, but here, things are far from simple. White's pieces are not too active, and it will take a few moves to improve them. Note that White is ready to consolidate with something like Qb1, so Black has to play actively. }

{ Returning the favour.   24...b3 !  When you think about this position purely from a logical point of view, without calculating anything, it will be obvious that the b3-pawn is much more valuable than the one on d5.  25.Nc3  b2  ... c6 and ... Rb8 are next with a large advantage for Black. }

{ Akiba Rubinstein was one of the strongest players in the world of his times. He was considered to be the greatest Rook endgames specialist and his technique in simple positions was superb. The same style was developed later by the "Iron" Tigran Petrosian. Not everyone knows that in Poland we have a yearly Rubinstein Memorial held in Polanica Zdroj. In this game Rubisntein was paired against a very creative Austrian - Carl Schlechter. Baadur Jobava was once asked who is his favourite player ever, and he answered with no hesitation that it is Carl Schlechter. No wonder that Baadur enjoys playing the same types of positions ! }

14. Nd4 Ne5

15. O-O Bd7

{ White didn't allow Rf3 Bxf3# - shame ! A superb game by the Dutch International Master. }

Rxc3 h6
{ It is essential to play this move immediately. Note that the pawn on h7 is a backward one so Black should exchange it as fast as possible.   Delaying it with something like  17...a6 ?  is wrong due to  18.Bd3  h6  and now White has  19.g6 !  Of course, ... a6 is a bad move but I wanted to demonstrate a concept.   17...Be6 ?!  is also wrong due to  18.Bc4  and Black will have problems keeping everything under control. }
18. gxh6 Rxh6 19. Rxh6 Bxh6 20. Bc4
{ It is crucial to notice that White threatens Rf3 and after ... Be6 Bxe6 fxe6 Rf6 ! he will pick up a key pawn. }

[Result "*"]

{ This is one of the most famous games in which the Budapest Gambit was involved, that was played in modern times. My compatriot GM Radoslaw Wojtaszek was paired against the ever-creative GM Baadur Jobava. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Bf4 g5
{ Typically for his style, Jobava goes for the most maverick approach ! } 5.
Bg3 Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. h4 Ngxe5 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Nc3 g4
{ As I've mentioned several times in the #11th chapter, this move should be played only with the White pawn on e3 !   9...h6 !  is the best move and my main recommendation. }
10. e3
{ Going back to normality.   10.h5 !  was a way to punish Black. See comments to Black's 9th move in #11. }
10... d6 11. Be2 Be6 12. Rc1 O-O 13. b3 c6
{ The position should be slightly favourable for White, but it is complicated so any of three results shouldn't surprise anyone. }
14. h5 f5
{ It was possible to stop the h-pawn by playing ... h6, but Jobava prefer to go for maximum activity. }
15. h6 Bf6
{ Ok, White is better but what to play ?! Would you castle kingside or keep the King in the centre ? That's why this variation is quite popular ! Even when you get a worse position you will get chances for a complicated game. }
16. Qd2
{ 16.Kf1  Trust me or not, but this is the best move for White. The King has to be protected somehow. Still, a quite inhuman way of playing. }
16... Qe7 17. f4
{ This is the start of a wrong plan. White should prioritize the King's safety.   17.Bd3  freeing the e2-square for the Knight was necessary. The other option was Kf1. }
17... gxf3 18. gxf3 Kh8
{ White is under serious pressure. ... Rad8 and ... Rg8 are coming next. } 19.
f4 Rad8 { Jobava is not the type of guy who will even think about retreating. }
20. Qc2
{ 20.fxe5 ?  would be self-destructive.  dxe5 -+  with ... f4 to come next. }
20... Ng4
{ The most aggressive move. ... Nd7 or ... Nf7 was even more preferable, but don't forget that Georgian top player never retreats ! }
21. Bxg4 Rg8
{ One of White's Bishops will be consumed anyway, so it is useful to activate the Rook in the process. }
22. Ne2 { 22.Bf3  Rxg3  23.Kf2  was White's best chance to stay in the game. }
22... Rxg4 23. Kf2 d5
{ Opening up the position is usually in favour of the side with a pair of Bishops. }
24. Rcd1 Re8 25. c5
{ Equal to resignation.   25.Nd4  was the best try, although Black would be winning anyway. }
25... Bf7 26. Qc1 Qe4 { White is defenceless. } 27. Nd4
{ 27.Nc3  I also want to mention that this doesn't save White.  Qxe3+ !  28.Qxe3  Rxe3  29.Kxe3  Rxg3+  Black picks up all of White's minor pieces. }
