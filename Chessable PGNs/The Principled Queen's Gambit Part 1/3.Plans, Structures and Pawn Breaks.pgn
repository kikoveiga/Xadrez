 Introduction  The idea behind this chapter is to give you a very general, 'birds-eye' view of what both sides are trying to achieve in the opening and middlegame for each of the major openings and structures in this course. I think understanding this is vital to being able to play the opening and middlegame successfully. Having this knowledge means that even if you are taken out of theory or don't know White's exact line, you will still have a general idea of what your goal is and what you should be trying to achieve.  Probably the most important aspect to understand is the concept of the pawn break, also referred to as a 'pawn lever' in Axel Smith's great book 'Pump Up Your Rating'. In this chapter I'll be giving a quick rundown of what pawn breaks both White and Black are looking to achieve in each opening, as well as any other general plans both sides have.  Queen's Gambit AcceptedWhite's Plans   Maintain the 'perfect' d4-e4 pawn centre for as long as possible. Develop quickly, castle etc.   React accordingly to how Black decides to attack the centre. Against ...c5 and ...Nc6, we'll play d5 sooner or later. Against ...Nf6, we go e5. And against the main move, ...e5, we play Nf3 and let Black take on d4.   In the ...e5 line, f7 is a weakness. Piece play is the most important thing there. In the ...e5 line though, after ...exd4, we can often march our e-pawn forwards with e4-e5.  Black's Plans   Fight back in the centre in one of a number of different ways: ...e5, ...Nf6, ...Nc6 and ...c5.  Queen's Gambit DeclinedWhite's Plans   Minority attack with b4-b5. This is usually supported by a rook on b1. Once the pawn ends up on b5, Black will most likely be left with some kind of weakness. After bxc6, if Black recaptures with the pawn, the c6 pawn will be left weak and backward, while the c5 outpost can be exploited by our knight with Na4-c5. If Black takes on b5 or recaptures on c6 with a piece, then b7 and d5 are left weak.   The central e4 break. This is prepared with Bd3, Nge2, 0-0, Qc2, f3. Once we have all those moves played, it's important to still not rush the e4 breaks. Two important preparatory moves to throw in first are usually Rad1 (defending the d4 pawn which is important once we play e4) and h3 (to cover the g4 square) . Black's Plans   Play solidly, without creating any weaknesses. Develop and trade off pieces.   ...Ne4 to trade off pieces.   ...Nh5 to trade off pieces.  Exchange SlavWhite's Plans  The pawn structure here is symmetrical, but White is obviously slightly better due to his more active pieces and extra tempo. To exploit this, we should be looking at unbalancing the position in one of a number of ways:   Nf3-e5. A standard knight hop. If Black takes it, we will often recapture with the d-pawn since this gives us a space advantage, kicks the knight on f6 away and gives us the d4 outpost for our knight. The goal is to support the knight on e5 with a pawn on f4 and then launch a very easy and crushing kingside attack.   The Na4-c5 maneuver. If Black takes on c5, we recapture with the d-pawn and get a queenside pawn majority and space advantage.   The e4 break. This is a little more risky and situational. It only works well when Black is completely unprepared for it and White is much more active - otherwise it can backfire and leave the IQP on d4 weak.  Black's Plans   Trade off pieces, in particular the passive bishops.   Queenside play with ...a6 and ..b5, followed by maybe ...Na5-c4.  Slav DefenceThe Slav defence encompasses a wide variety of different structures and lines, so the plans for both sides are highly situational.  White's Plans   The e4 break. If Black plays slowly, with ...a6, ...e6, ...Nbd7, etc. then we should look to carry out the e4 break - preparing it with Bd3, b3, Bb2, 0-0 etc.   Against 4...a6 with 5...g6: at some point, if ...e5 isn't a real possibility, we can play c5 to close the queenside and give us a space advantage there, and then look to play the b4-b5 pawn break.   Ne5 is the standard plan we should be aiming for in lines with 4...g6 and 4...a6 whenever e4 isn't a great possibility, which is typically when Black can play ...dxe4 followed by ...c5.   It's not a pawn break, but one of the key ideas is to meet the majority of Black's light bishop moves, like ...Bf5, with cxd5 followed by Qb3.  Black's Plans   Meet a premature e4 break with ...dxe4 followed by ...c5.   Black plays for the ...e5 break.    Sometimes, Black plays for the ...c5 break as well.  Semi-Slav DefenceWhite's Plans   If Black doesn't take on c4, the plan is similar to the Slav Defence: we prepare e4. This is particularly effective if the Black dark bishop is on d6, since after ...dxe4 Nxe4 the dark bishop is attacked.   If Black doesn't take on c4 but puts his bishop on e7, the e4 is less effective since Black can usually just play ...dxe4 followed by ...c5. In this case, we play Ne5 followed by f4 typically.   If Black does play ...dxc4, play becomes more concrete and I recommend learning those lines and the nuances contained within well. Our play depends on what plan Black goes for - 9...e5, 9...a6 or 9...b5. There are fewer obvious pawn breaks for White to make, since they depend on what Black does.   Against 9...e5, we will usually play prophylactically with h3, a3, Ba2 etc. Once Black goes ...h6, then we play Nf3-h4-f5.   Against 9...a6, there are two very important things to remember. Firstly, the standard counter to ...c5, once Black plays it is Ne4. Secondly, if Black goes ...c5-c4, we want to break down the pawn chain by playing the b3 break.   Against 9...b5, play becomes particularly concrete. The plan I advocate goes for 11.e4 and after ...e5, we play dxe5 followed by Nd4 aiming to get the knight to f5.  Black's Plans   The ...e5 pawn break is one of Black's key ideas. That's one of the reasons he put his bishop on d6 - to prepare it.   The ...dxc4, ...a6, ...b5, ...c5 plan is very dangerous. If Black can get the ...c5 break in under good circumstances where White doesn't know what he's doing, he can equalise or even get an edge very easily.  Dutch DefenceWhite's Plans  Our general plan is dependent on what Black chooses on move 2.   White will often long castle and prepare the e4 break, with Qd2, Bd3, 0-0-0, f3 and eventually, e4.   Fighting for the f4 outpost in the ...h6 ...g5 line is important with the h4 break.   Against 2...g6, we are invited to rush our h-pawn down the board with h4-h5.   Sometimes, in addition to the e4 break, we have the g4 break. This can be another very strong idea for White - take a look at some of the 2...g6 lines for example.  Black's Plans   Try not to get mated.    If Black succeeds with the first point, he might want to launch a queenside counterattack if we castle long or prepare the ...e5 break with ...d6.  1.-- *
