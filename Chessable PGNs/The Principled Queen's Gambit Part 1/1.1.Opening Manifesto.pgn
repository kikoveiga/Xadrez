 In this relatively short section I want to briefly explain the 'philosophy' or 'theme' behind this repertoire.  This repertoire is based on mainlines. I've tried to pick challenging variations that will put Black under pressure both in theory and in practice. It has been my belief for a long time that this is the best way to play not just to get better results, but to improve as a player. We will be trying to get at least a slight edge against everything Black throws at us - of course, this is not always possible since chess is a draw. However, simply by 'trying' and playing ambitious, principled chess, we ensure that Black's path to equality is a long and difficult one.  My thoughts on this (mainlines vs sidelines) have been heavily influenced from a young age by Quality Chess books (the publishing house), which espoused the philosophy of playing mainlines so vehemently that it became their tagline. When I was 9, I was gifted Playing the Queen's Gambit by Lars Schandorff - a fantastic book which shaped much of my White repertoire for years to come. Now, over 10 years later, most of my White repertoire has changed, but the principles behind it remain.   Besides picking ambitious lines, I wanted to have a structural 'theme' underlying the repertoire. In other words, I wanted the pawn structures to be relatively similar so that plans could be transferable and you get a better feel for the entire repertoire. Examples of such themes would be the kingside fianchetto theme which runs through the 1.d4 books by Avrukh and Keep it Simple: 1.d4 by Sielecki, which I'm a big fan of.   I decided to go in a different direction - we will be playing f3 whenever it is decent, in order to prepare to get that 'perfect centre' of e4 and d4. Compared to g3 lines, which are obviously very good but often require subtle play and strategic understanding to play optimally, f3 variations I think are more direct, forcing and maybe even more ambitious.  I haven't tried to shoehorn f3 in whenever it is possible (chess is concrete and I'm suspicious of 'universal' setups), but only when I think it is actually good. You will see this theme appear more prominently in the 2nd Part of the course, where we will deal with the KID/Grunfeld with 3.f3, the Nimzo-Indian with 4.f3 and Modern Benonis will feature a structure with f3 as well. In this 1st part of the course, you'll see f3 feature prominently against the QGD to prepare e4 (and sometimes g4) and also often in certain Dutch lines to prepare e4 as well.  Hopefully this sheds some light on what you can expect from the rest of chapters -  we will be playing ambitious mainlines which put Black under as much pressure as possible, and do this with f3 lines where applicable.1.-- *
