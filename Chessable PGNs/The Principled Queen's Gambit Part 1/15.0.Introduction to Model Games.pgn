 Model Games IntroductionIn this chapter, I've provided 15 annotated Model Games. I think Model Games are useful to have in any opening repertoire, with some of the benefits being:   A better illustration of the ideas and plans in the middlegames and endgames which can arise from the opening repertoire.   More confidence in the lines and 'inspiration' in your own games, since you can see how top players have utilised the variations with success.   It helps you remember the lines you learnt in the previous chapters, since you can now relate a game and player names to each variation. I find this helps a lot - for example, if you face the 9...e5 variation of the Semi-Slav, you might recall the fantastic Karpov - Anand game and this will help guide your play.  
I've tried to choose games for their instructive value, theoretical importance and also simply aesthetics. I haven't generally gone for quick, crushing wins, but instead have picked games where Black has put up significant resistance and where White had to play well to win.  These are the Model Games we will be examining:   Model Game 1: Svane - Sprenger. Queen's Gambit Accepted with 3...e5. Illustrates the weakness of the c7 pawn and the power of White's central advance with f4.   Model Game 2: Svidler - Mamedyarov. Queen's Gambit Declined with 3...Be7. Illustrates the long-term weakness of the c6-pawn after ...b5 and how easy it is to play against the IQP.    Model Game 3: Carlsen - Kramnik. Queen's Gambit Declined with 3...Nf6 and 6...Bf5. Illustrates the 'Carlsen Plan' against the 6...Bf5 endgame.   Model Game 4: Sasikiran - C. Hansen. Queen's Gambit Declined with 3...Nf6 Mainline. Illustrates how to prepare the e4 break, and just how easy the ensuing positions are for White once that break is played successfully.    Model Game 5: Moiseenko - Hellers. Tarrasch Defence. Shows how to convert a typical endgame for our line where we are playing against isolated c- and a-pawns.   Model Game 6: Aravindh - Sjugirov. Exchange Slav. Shows that the Exchange Slav isn't a dead draw even at 2600+ level - moreover, it illustrates how dangerous Black's position becomes once we get a knight on e5 and support it with f4.   Model Game 7: Tomashevsky - Ni. Slav with 4...a6. Illustrates the fantastic e4 break to free the dark bishop, and two monster White knights.   Model Game 8: Epishin - Gulko. Slav with 4...g6. Shows how to slowly, but surely, grind out a win in endgames where Black has met Qb3 with ...Qb6, leaving him with double b-pawns.   Model Game 9: Sadler - Ernst. Slav with 4...Bf5. Shows how to deal with the passive 6...Bc8 - land a knight on e5, cement it in with f4 and then attack.   Model Game 10: Gledura - Anand. Semi-Slav with 8...e5. Shows that even seemingly dead-equal endgames still have life in them - a good example of how to use your more active pieces in the endgame to extract the full point.    Model Game 11: Karpov - Anand. Semi-Slav Mainline with 9...e5. A classic encounter from the 90s which pioneered many of the ideas which are now standard against 9...e5.    Model Game 12: Bukavshin - Artemiev. Semi-Slav Mainline with 9...a6. Illustrates the power of the bishop pair in the long-term.   Model Game 13: Fressinet - Ragger. Semi-Slav Mainline with 9...b5. Shows how to convert a better endgame where White has huge compensation for the pawn after the popular 14...Bxg3.   Model Game 14: Delchev - Beerdsen. Dutch Defence with 2...h6. Illustrates the e4 break and the long-term danger that Black's king is in.   Model Game 15: Bartel - Rendle. 1...e6 with 2...f5. A powerful demonstration of the typical c5 and d5 breaks, and how to convert the ensuing better endgame.  1.-- *
