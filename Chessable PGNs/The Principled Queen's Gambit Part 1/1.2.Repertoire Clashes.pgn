 Repertoire ClashesIn this section, I'm going to do something which I really wish became more prevalent in chess literature, as I think it's incredibly useful and saves readers a lot of time. I'm going to mention what I consider some of the best chess books, courses and repertoires for Black against 1.d4 and then show where our recommendations clash, as well as give a brief and honest opinion of what I think of the line in general. It should go without saying that none of this is intended as an attack on other courses or books, but simply something that I think helps save readers a significant amount of time.   I hope to keep this file updated in the future as new books and courses are released for Black against 1.d4. If you want something specific covered or added to this file, please let me know in the discussion forums and I'll see what I can do.  Queen's Gambit Accepted   Understanding the Queen's Gambit Accepted by Delchev and Semkov. In this book, the authors recommend the line with 3...Nc6. They don't however, mention the rare line I recommend with 6.Nc3 here and the follow-up idea with Be3 which I look at here.  Queen's Gambit Declined   Playing 1.d4 d5: A Classical Repertoire by Ntirlis. Ntirlis features twice in this chapter. His more recent work was on the Queen's Gambit Declined for Black, where he advocates for an approach with ...Nh5. Once again, his analysis is incredibly thorough and accurate, but I think I found a weakness in his proposed repertoire. In his mainline, I believe he underestimates a critical variation and dismisses it as 'fine' for Black, but I think this isn't the case at all. I expanded and analysed this variation a bit further and I think White can claim a healthy advantage here. I think that Black's best equalising attempt objectively-speaking is in the mainline with 11...Ng6 and 12...h6.   Queen's Gambit Declined: A Grandmaster Explains by Colovic. In this Chessable course, Colovic recommends a very solid and positional line based on 3...Be7 and 6...Bd6, exchanging pieces. His analysis is very solid of course, but I found an improvement on move 17 that goes unmentioned by Colovic which puts Black under some pressure in an endgame where White is playing for only 2 results.  Tarrasch & Semi-Tarrasch   Grandmaster Repertoire 10 - The Tarrasch Defence by Ntirlis & Aagaard. I was very impressed by the work of Aagaard and Ntirlis on the Tarrasch Defence. For a book published in 2011, the analysis is remarkably accurate and they are refreshingly honest about Black's chances and what White's best lines are. I chose a line which they admitted was challenging for Black. Their analysis was exceptionally deep and thorough in order to try to prove equality, but I think they were ultimately let down by the fact that the Tarrasch is simply not the greatest opening. I think I found a promising continuation for White which isn't mentioned in the book where Black has to suffer a bit in an endgame with 2 weak, isolated pawns - White's edge is slight and Black should hold with good defence of course, but I'd take the White side of that endgame any day. Practically, White has scored very well in this line with 6.dxc5 and I think White can definitely claim an edge in all variations here.  Slav  GM Avrukh's recommendations in The Classical Slav clash three times with my own, since we both gave alternatives - I give the Exchange Slav as a backup weapon, while Avrukh recommends both 4...Bf5 and 4...a6 against my main recommendation of 3.Nc3 4.e3.   The Exchange Slav analysis basically follows the same line until move 17. Avrukh assesses it as roughly equal, but I'd marginally prefer White there. I think White has easy play with 0-0, Kh1, Rac1, Na4-c5 etc.   Avrukh's first recommendation is 4...a6 followed by 5...g6. I don't like this line too much for Black, as I think Black's winning chances are rather limited if White plays his cards right in this line. I think his second recommendation is more combative.   Avrukh's second recommendation advocates sacrificing a pawn with 4...Bf5 and 6...Nc6. I personally think this is a better practical try than his first recommendation since Black gets some decent activity as compensation for the pawn. I tried to deviate from Avrukh's thorough analysis as early as possible with 15.Ndb5, and in the complex resulting positions I think White has a slight edge, but Black has good practical chances. Credit to Avrukh for helping popularise this line with 4...Bf5 and 6...Nc6, as it was pretty rare prior to his book's release.   The Practical Slav Defense by Bartell. In this Chessable course, IM Bartell recommends a line which is similar to Avrukh's first recommendation except he gives 11...Bxd7 with the idea of ...Ng4-h6. I think this is a better implementation of the 4...a6 5...g6 line since it avoids the doubled f-pawns as in Avrukh's line, which makes it very tough for Black to get active play with the ...e5 break. My recommendation of 13.h3 isn't mentioned though and it throws a spanner in the works here by cutting out the ...Ng4-h6 plan. I think White gets a slight edge here too.  Semi-Slav   A Practical Black Repertoire with d5, c6 by Kornev. GM Kornev recommends what I consider one of Black's absolute best lines against this repertoire with 4...e6, 5...a6 and 6...c5!. This was played by Anand in his 2012 World Championship match against Gelfand, and the game ended in a draw. We followed that game until move 21 here. Black is very close objective equality, but White still retains slightly more active pieces meaning that our position remains marginally preferable. Moreover, there is an interesting unexplored alternative which we can consider, all the way back with 8.g3!? if you aren't satisfied with this line.   The Semi-Slav by Schandorff. GM Schandorff gives the absolute mainline of my Semi-Slav chapter. In this line, I give the move tried by a handful of correspondence players, 24.Bxc4, which results in a drawn but marginally more pleasant rook and opposite coloured bishop endgame for White. White does have a number of good alternatives though, such as 24.Bd1, 24.a4 and 24.Qc1, which aren't analysed by Schandorff. I think all of these moves give White the slightly better side of a very complex position, thanks to his bishop pair and safer king. In an alternative line, I give the very strong 24.a4 instead.  Dutch   The Killer Dutch Rebooted by Williams. In his Chessable course, GM Simon Williams, aka the GingerGM, recommends 2...h6. I'm not the biggest fan of the Black side of the Dutch to be honest, and I feel like White can get an edge in a number of ways. I think that both the rare 7.Be2 that goes unmentioned by the GingerGM which I recommend in the theoretical section and 7.hxg5 which was played by GM Delchev in one of our model games are good for White.  1.-- *
