 In this section, I intend to give you a quick rundown of how I choose my lines, how I analyse them and what resources I use. In my mind, this serves two purposes:   It provides full transparency and a better understanding behind my reasoning for choosing some lines and how I choose them.   It might help those who have the intention of doing their own analysis by perhaps giving some new ideas on how to analyse or how to pick your variations.  
If you don't have any interest in either of these things, then feel free to skip this section.  I've used a number of resources in the creation of this course:   Statistics  Statistics from over-the-board (OTB) games is a vital indicator of how a variation fares in practice. It is one of the first things I look at when comparing variations. I'm careful not to rely on statistics too much though - they can be very misleading, so I often use statistics simply to confirm or reinforce whatever my findings might be. An example of game statistics being misleading is a position where one move might score very well for White - let's say 70% - but the reason for this is that in the vast majority of games before 2015, Black players opted for a bad response where White scored 80%. However, in all the games since then, Black players have found the right move to neutralise White's position and in that situation White only scores 40%. As a result, the statistics would be misleading here since most players would by now know what the right move is and White wouldn't score nearly as well as it might seem.   Elite Players and Correspondence Games  Super-GMs obviously know what they're doing in the opening. If they all go for one specific line, there generally is a very good reason for it. I use correspondence games in a similar way - correspondence games are arguably the most 'perfect' variant of chess as it combines computer analysis with human insight, so using these games as a guide can be invaluable. However, over-reliance on correspondence games can be very dangerous - those games are played with the assumption that the opponent will defend at an incredibly high level, meaning that dangerous lines in OTB games where the defender should equalise with best play are often overlooked. One needs to look at human games as well of course, as correspondence games alone can be misleading.   Popularity  If Move A and Move B are objectively similar, but Move A is rarer, I'll almost always go for Move A. The reason is simple - the rarer a move is, the less it is known/expected, and the higher your chance is of surprising your opponent by playing something that you know but he/she doesn't.    Stockfish 10/11  Of course, every analyst and author uses Stockfish - to varying extents. It has been the undisputed strongest engine in the World for years (until the emergence of LeelaChess/Lc0) . It is strong in all positions of course, but it is particularly strong in sharp, complex positions where 'calculation' is of paramount importance. I run development versions of Stockfish in parallel with Leela in order to get a more balanced evaluation of the position.   LeelaChess  The emergence of AlphaZero and Neural Network (NN) engines has been nothing short of revolutionary for the chess world and effectively signals the beginning of a new era of chess. Shortly after AlphaZero arrived on the scene, chess enthusiasts desired to replicate its successes but on the home PC, which resulted in the development of LeelaChess, or also known as Lc0. From the start, I was very excited to use it in my own analysis and purpose-built a new desktop PC in order to take full advantage of Lc0's capabilities. The vast majority of my analysis is based on Lc0's findings - it was my primary engine, while Stockfish served more as a secondary engine. Over the last year of chess analysis, in the vast majority of cases when a 'disagreement' existed between the two engines, it was Lc0 that was proven correct after a deeper inspection of the position. The reason for this is simple: Lc0 positional understanding of chess far surpasses that of Stockfish. Even though Stockfish is a great 'calculator', Lc0 'sees' further since it has a deeper "understanding". As a result, it is ideal in situations where sacrifices, long-term positional compensation and where normal, fairly non-forcing lines are involved.   Human Judgement and Personal Preference  This, is ultimately what everything boils down to though - human judgement. I've used all the above resources in order to pick what I think the best variations and moves are in order to give us the best chance of winning the game. Besides just picking the best move objectively, I've considered plenty of other factors - including surprise value, complexity (how theoretical it is), how thematic it is (whether we get a similar structure/plan to other variations) and simply whether or not I like it.  
So, in summary, this is generally how the process would go:  I'd look at various possible options that White has at his disposal. I'd compare them, using a combination of Statistics, Popularity, Elite Games and Correspondence Games and use these, together with my own judgement, to pick the line I like. Then I'd analyse that line deeply with Lc0 and Stockfish (with Lc0 doing the majority of the grunt work and Stockfish acting as a helper) . After analysing the variation, I'd cut down the lines to a manageable size which I think is worth learning and then go through everything a few more times, adding comments and explanations wherever possible.1.-- *
