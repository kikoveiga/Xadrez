 In this section, I'll try to anticipate some questions I think might crop up in the future, as well as add any questions which actually are asked frequently :-   Q: When is the second part being released? A: Hopefully in May some time. It's in the final stages of production (i.e. import, proofreading etc.) .   Q: Will this course be updated? A: Yes. This is my own repertoire, so I intend to keep it as up-to-date as possible. I've committed to quarterly updates at least for the first year.   Q: What should I do if I spot a bug, typo, or any other mistake? A: Please, please let me know - either on the discussion forums or under the relevant position. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.   Q: Is the video content the same as the written content? A: For the most part, yes, however two chapters in particular where easier to cover in a video format: the Quickstarter guide and Plans, Structures and Pawn Breaks, especially the later chapter. I've tried to provide an adequate text summary of the latter chapter though.   Q: A new book has come out which offers a Black repertoire against 1.d4. What to do? A: Let me know and I'll take a look. I want to try to keep the 'Repertoire Clashes' file as up-to-date as possible.  1.-- *
