{ Hello and welcome to the first part  (of two)  of my complete repertoire with 1.d4, based on the Queen's Gambit!  This project is the culmination of close to a year of work and I think does qualify as a labour of love - I've played 1.d4 pretty much as long as I've played tournament chess - 14 years. The Queen's Gambit has formed the backbone of my White repertoire throughout. As this will most likely be my last opening course on Chessable, I want to make this my best one yet.  As a result, a huge amount of effort has gone into this course - I've tried to provide as much content and material as possible, while trying to make use of all the incredible features that Chessable has to offer.   In this Introduction chapter, I'll go over my 'Opening Manifesto'  (the theme or 'philosophy' behind this repertoire)  , the Repertoire Clashes  (a summary of how this course matches up against some of the best Black repertoires available)  , my Analysis Methodology  (basically just a summary of how I chose and analysed the lines, in the pursuit of full transparency and in the event anyone might want to do similar analysis)  , my Recommended Learning Order and finally an FAQ of some questions I thought might crop up.  Seeing as this is my own repertoire, I'll update it as frequently as possible - I'll try to commit to updates every 3 months or so, at least for the first year after release.  All that's left for me to do is wish you luck on your journey with 1.d4!  Cheers!  Daniel Barrish  Cape Town, March 2020 }

{ In this relatively short section I want to briefly explain the 'philosophy' or 'theme' behind this repertoire.  This repertoire is based on mainlines. I've tried to pick challenging variations that will put Black under pressure both in theory and in practice. It has been my belief for a long time that this is the best way to play not just to get better results, but to improve as a player. We will be trying to get at least a slight edge against everything Black throws at us - of course, this is not always possible since chess is a draw. However, simply by 'trying' and playing ambitious, principled chess, we ensure that Black's path to equality is a long and difficult one.  My thoughts on this  (mainlines vs sidelines)  have been heavily influenced from a young age by Quality Chess books  (the publishing house)  , which espoused the philosophy of playing mainlines so vehemently that it became their tagline. When I was 9, I was gifted Playing the Queen's Gambit by Lars Schandorff - a fantastic book which shaped much of my White repertoire for years to come. Now, over 10 years later, most of my White repertoire has changed, but the principles behind it remain.   Besides picking ambitious lines, I wanted to have a structural 'theme' underlying the repertoire. In other words, I wanted the pawn structures to be relatively similar so that plans could be transferable and you get a better feel for the entire repertoire. Examples of such themes would be the kingside fianchetto theme which runs through the 1.d4 books by Avrukh and Keep it Simple: 1.d4 by Sielecki, which I'm a big fan of.   I decided to go in a different direction - we will be playing f3 whenever it is decent, in order to prepare to get that 'perfect centre' of e4 and d4. Compared to g3 lines, which are obviously very good but often require subtle play and strategic understanding to play optimally, f3 variations I think are more direct, forcing and maybe even more ambitious.  I haven't tried to shoehorn f3 in whenever it is possible  (chess is concrete and I'm suspicious of 'universal' setups)  , but only when I think it is actually good. You will see this theme appear more prominently in the 2nd Part of the course, where we will deal with the KID/Grunfeld with 3.f3, the Nimzo-Indian with 4.f3 and Modern Benonis will feature a structure with f3 as well. In this 1st part of the course, you'll see f3 feature prominently against the QGD to prepare e4  (and sometimes g4)  and also often in certain Dutch lines to prepare e4 as well.  Hopefully this sheds some light on what you can expect from the rest of chapters -  we will be playing ambitious mainlines which put Black under as much pressure as possible, and do this with f3 lines where applicable. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Repertoire Clashes@@HeaderEnd@@In this section, I'm going to do something which I really wish became more prevalent in chess literature, as I think it's incredibly useful and saves readers a lot of time. I'm going to mention what I consider some of the best chess books, courses and repertoires for Black against 1.d4 and then show where our recommendations clash, as well as give a brief and honest opinion of what I think of the line in general. It should go without saying that none of this is intended as an attack on other courses or books, but simply something that I think helps save readers a significant amount of time.   I hope to keep this file updated in the future as new books and courses are released for Black against 1.d4. If you want something specific covered or added to this file, please let me know in the discussion forums and I'll see what I can do.  Queen's Gambit Accepted  
 Understanding the Queen's Gambit Accepted by Delchev and Semkov. In this book, the authors recommend the line with 3...Nc6. They don't however, mention the rare line I recommend with 6.Nc3 here and the follow-up idea with Be3 which I look at here.  
Queen's Gambit Declined  
 Playing 1.d4 d5: A Classical Repertoire by Ntirlis. Ntirlis features twice in this chapter. His more recent work was on the Queen's Gambit Declined for Black, where he advocates for an approach with ...Nh5. Once again, his analysis is incredibly thorough and accurate, but I think I found a weakness in his proposed repertoire. In his mainline, I believe he underestimates a critical variation and dismisses it as 'fine' for Black, but I think this isn't the case at all. I expanded and analysed this variation a bit further and I think White can claim a healthy advantage here. I think that Black's best equalising attempt objectively-speaking is in the mainline with 11...Ng6 and 12...h6.   Queen's Gambit Declined: A Grandmaster Explains by Colovic. In this Chessable course, Colovic recommends a very solid and positional line based on 3...Be7 and 6...Bd6, exchanging pieces. His analysis is very solid of course, but I found an improvement on move 17 that goes unmentioned by Colovic which puts Black under some pressure in an endgame where White is playing for only 2 results.  
Tarrasch & Semi-Tarrasch  
 Grandmaster Repertoire 10 - The Tarrasch Defence by Ntirlis & Aagaard. I was very impressed by the work of Aagaard and Ntirlis on the Tarrasch Defence. For a book published in 2011, the analysis is remarkably accurate and they are refreshingly honest about Black's chances and what White's best lines are. I chose a line which they admitted was challenging for Black. Their analysis was exceptionally deep and thorough in order to try to prove equality, but I think they were ultimately let down by the fact that the Tarrasch is simply not the greatest opening. I think I found a promising continuation for White which isn't mentioned in the book where Black has to suffer a bit in an endgame with 2 weak, isolated pawns - White's edge is slight and Black should hold with good defence of course, but I'd take the White side of that endgame any day. Practically, White has scored very well in this line with 6.dxc5 and I think White can definitely claim an edge in all variations here.  
Slav  GM Avrukh's recommendations in The Classical Slav clash three times with my own, since we both gave alternatives - I give the Exchange Slav as a backup weapon, while Avrukh recommends both 4...Bf5 and 4...a6 against my main recommendation of 3.Nc3 4.e3.  
 The Exchange Slav analysis basically follows the same line until move 17. Avrukh assesses it as roughly equal, but I'd marginally prefer White there. I think White has easy play with 0-0, Kh1, Rac1, Na4-c5 etc.   Avrukh's first recommendation is 4...a6 followed by 5...g6. I don't like this line too much for Black, as I think Black's winning chances are rather limited if White plays his cards right in this line. I think his second recommendation is more combative.   Avrukh's second recommendation advocates sacrificing a pawn with 4...Bf5 and 6...Nc6. I personally think this is a better practical try than his first recommendation since Black gets some decent activity as compensation for the pawn. I tried to deviate from Avrukh's thorough analysis as early as possible with 15.Ndb5, and in the complex resulting positions I think White has a slight edge, but Black has good practical chances. Credit to Avrukh for helping popularise this line with 4...Bf5 and 6...Nc6, as it was pretty rare prior to his book's release.   The Practical Slav Defense by Bartell. In this Chessable course, IM Bartell recommends a line which is similar to Avrukh's first recommendation except he gives 11...Bxd7 with the idea of ...Ng4-h6. I think this is a better implementation of the 4...a6 5...g6 line since it avoids the doubled f-pawns as in Avrukh's line, which makes it very tough for Black to get active play with the ...e5 break. My recommendation of 13.h3 isn't mentioned though and it throws a spanner in the works here by cutting out the ...Ng4-h6 plan. I think White gets a slight edge here too.  
Semi-Slav  
 A Practical Black Repertoire with d5, c6 by Kornev. GM Kornev recommends what I consider one of Black's absolute best lines against this repertoire with 4...e6, 5...a6 and 6...c5!. This was played by Anand in his 2012 World Championship match against Gelfand, and the game ended in a draw. We followed that game until move 21 here. Black is very close objective equality, but White still retains slightly more active pieces meaning that our position remains marginally preferable. Moreover, there is an interesting unexplored alternative which we can consider, all the way back with 8.g3!? if you aren't satisfied with this line.   The Semi-Slav by Schandorff. GM Schandorff gives the absolute mainline of my Semi-Slav chapter. In this line, I give the move tried by a handful of correspondence players, 24.Bxc4, which results in a drawn but marginally more pleasant rook and opposite coloured bishop endgame for White. White does have a number of good alternatives though, such as 24.Bd1, 24.a4 and 24.Qc1, which aren't analysed by Schandorff. I think all of these moves give White the slightly better side of a very complex position, thanks to his bishop pair and safer king. In an alternative line, I give the very strong 24.a4 instead.  
Dutch  
 The Killer Dutch Rebooted by Williams. In his Chessable course, GM Simon Williams, aka the GingerGM, recommends 2...h6. I'm not the biggest fan of the Black side of the Dutch to be honest, and I feel like White can get an edge in a number of ways. I think that both the rare 7.Be2 that goes unmentioned by the GingerGM which I recommend in the theoretical section and 7.hxg5 which was played by GM Delchev in one of our model games are good for White. }

[Black "Analysis Methodology"]
[Result "*"]

{ In this section, I intend to give you a quick rundown of how I choose my lines, how I analyse them and what resources I use. In my mind, this serves two purposes:  
 It provides full transparency and a better understanding behind my reasoning for choosing some lines and how I choose them.   It might help those who have the intention of doing their own analysis by perhaps giving some new ideas on how to analyse or how to pick your variations.  
If you don't have any interest in either of these things, then feel free to skip this section.  I've used a number of resources in the creation of this course:  
 Statistics  Statistics from over-the-board  (OTB)  games is a vital indicator of how a variation fares in practice. It is one of the first things I look at when comparing variations. I'm careful not to rely on statistics too much though - they can be very misleading, so I often use statistics simply to confirm or reinforce whatever my findings might be. An example of game statistics being misleading is a position where one move might score very well for White - let's say 70% - but the reason for this is that in the vast majority of games before 2015, Black players opted for a bad response where White scored 80%. However, in all the games since then, Black players have found the right move to neutralise White's position and in that situation White only scores 40%. As a result, the statistics would be misleading here since most players would by now know what the right move is and White wouldn't score nearly as well as it might seem.   Elite Players and Correspondence Games  Super-GMs obviously know what they're doing in the opening. If they all go for one specific line, there generally is a very good reason for it. I use correspondence games in a similar way - correspondence games are arguably the most 'perfect' variant of chess as it combines computer analysis with human insight, so using these games as a guide can be invaluable. However, over-reliance on correspondence games can be very dangerous - those games are played with the assumption that the opponent will defend at an incredibly high level, meaning that dangerous lines in OTB games where the defender should equalise with best play are often overlooked. One needs to look at human games as well of course, as correspondence games alone can be misleading.   Popularity  If Move A and Move B are objectively similar, but Move A is rarer, I'll almost always go for Move A. The reason is simple - the rarer a move is, the less it is known/expected, and the higher your chance is of surprising your opponent by playing something that you know but he/she doesn't.    Stockfish 10/11  Of course, every analyst and author uses Stockfish - to varying extents. It has been the undisputed strongest engine in the World for years  (until the emergence of LeelaChess/Lc0)  . It is strong in all positions of course, but it is particularly strong in sharp, complex positions where 'calculation' is of paramount importance. I run development versions of Stockfish in parallel with Leela in order to get a more balanced evaluation of the position.   LeelaChess  The emergence of AlphaZero and Neural Network  (NN)  engines has been nothing short of revolutionary for the chess world and effectively signals the beginning of a new era of chess. Shortly after AlphaZero arrived on the scene, chess enthusiasts desired to replicate its successes but on the home PC, which resulted in the development of LeelaChess, or also known as Lc0. From the start, I was very excited to use it in my own analysis and purpose-built a new desktop PC in order to take full advantage of Lc0's capabilities. The vast majority of my analysis is based on Lc0's findings - it was my primary engine, while Stockfish served more as a secondary engine. Over the last year of chess analysis, in the vast majority of cases when a 'disagreement' existed between the two engines, it was Lc0 that was proven correct after a deeper inspection of the position. The reason for this is simple: Lc0 positional understanding of chess far surpasses that of Stockfish. Even though Stockfish is a great 'calculator', Lc0 'sees' further since it has a deeper "understanding". As a result, it is ideal in situations where sacrifices, long-term positional compensation and where normal, fairly non-forcing lines are involved.   Human Judgement and Personal Preference  This, is ultimately what everything boils down to though - human judgement. I've used all the above resources in order to pick what I think the best variations and moves are in order to give us the best chance of winning the game. Besides just picking the best move objectively, I've considered plenty of other factors - including surprise value, complexity  (how theoretical it is)  , how thematic it is  (whether we get a similar structure/plan to other variations)  and simply whether or not I like it.  
So, in summary, this is generally how the process would go:  I'd look at various possible options that White has at his disposal. I'd compare them, using a combination of Statistics, Popularity, Elite Games and Correspondence Games and use these, together with my own judgement, to pick the line I like. Then I'd analyse that line deeply with Lc0 and Stockfish  (with Lc0 doing the majority of the grunt work and Stockfish acting as a helper)  . After analysing the variation, I'd cut down the lines to a manageable size which I think is worth learning and then go through everything a few more times, adding comments and explanations wherever possible. }

{ In this section, I just want to briefly go over some suggestions I have for learning the material to follow, as well as explaining some conventions which I'll use.  I'd recommend most people learn this course in order, from start to finish, but this largely depends on how much time you have available. If time is limited, I'd recommend reading/watching the Quickstarter Guide and then reading/watching the chapter on Plans, Structures and Pawn Breaks. After that, you should be ready to start playing this repertoire at a decent level. If you simply don't have time for the rest of the theory and analysis, you could skip over the theoretical section and go straight to the Model Games and Puzzles.  Even if you're a strong player who already plays the Queen's Gambit, I'd still recommend taking a look at the Quickstarter as it gives you a good overview of what to come. One thing I like to do after getting a general overview of openings is to play lots of online blitz games with them to test the lines and get a feel for the positions. The important thing though is to then check each game's theory against the analysis here, and as a result see where you or your opponent deviated and how each side could possibly improve. Excessive blitz can be detrimental, but I still think that it's one of the fastest ways to learn a repertoire and get comfortable in the ensuing positions, before playing them in serious over-the-board games.  You might notice that at the start of each chapter there is a "Reference" line. This contains all of the following lines in a single place, which makes it easier to read over a chapter at a glance  (having this in my Chessable courses has been invaluable when cramming some theory before games on my phone :-)  .  The most up-to-date lines will always be the trainable lines - if there is a discrepancy between the trainable lines, the reference line and the video, then the trainable lines are always correct. This is because it is significantly harder to update the video/reference line. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in a number of ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise.   The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be due to the fact that in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for white relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can possibly get. This is a major branching point and black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:     3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging white in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.    3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one.   
I'm going to analyse the latter 2 lines here, in this Quickstarter. These are the two lines you are most likely to face by far. }
3... Nf6
{ Together with 3... e5, I consider this to be one of Black's best objective tries. It is just behind 3... e5 in terms of popularity, but it received Caruana's backing when he used it a few times in rapid games in 2017. Black's idea is to attack White's centre, provoking e5 so that the knight can be planted on d5. }
4. e5 { This must be played - 4. Nc3 e5 ! equalises immediately. } 4... Nd5 5.
Bxc4 { We get our pawn back. } 5... Nb6 { Black's most popular move by far. }
6. Bd3
{ This has begun to overtake 6. Bb3 in popularity in the last while. The bishop will be well-placed on e4 like we already saw in previous lines. }
6... Nc6 7. Be3
{ Defending d4 - it's still taboo of course on account of that same Bb5+ discovered check. }
7... Nb4 { Chasing our bishop - black has a concrete idea behind this. } 8. Be4
f5
{ This idea has to be played now, before White has the chance to retreat his bishop to b1 after we go Nc3. Now this is an absolutely critical position - White has 2 options: 9. exf6 and 9. a3. Prior to writing this course, I was only aware of 9. exf6, since it is much more popular and is recommended in other repertoires. Despite this, the more I analysed these variations, the more I came to like 9. a3. This assessment is supported by both practical results and engine analysis. I think that Black can get a decent position and equality after 9. exf6 if he knows some theory, whereas 9. a3 poses far more problems. It's easy to guess what my recommendation will be ! }
9. a3
{ Prior to my work on this course, I wasn't actually aware of this rather rare move - I had always automatically played 9. exf6. The fact that this move not only exists, but is objectively strong and scores very well in practice came as a shock to me ! At the time of writing, White scores incredibly, with more than 75%! White meets the threat to his bishop with a threat of his own. }
9... N4d5 { Black's main move here. } 10. Bxd5
{ 10. Bf3 is a bit more popular and also good, but I slightly prefer this move. }
10... Nxd5 11. Ne2
{ White's advantage here is largely defined by the overextended pawn on f5. It's doubtful that we would have an advantage, let alone a large advantage, if the pawn was still on f7. }
11... Be6 12. O-O c6 13. Nbc3 g6 14. Qd2
{ White got a big advantage in 1/2-1/2  (74)  Kovalenko,I  (2650)  -Alekseenko,K  (2480)  St Petersburg 2014 but ended up unfortunately botching it. Qd2 introduces the idea of Bh6 at some point of course. Once again, the overextended f5 pawn is in White's favour. }

14. h4
{ Black's knight on g6 is asking to be kicked around with tempo. White has many decent ideas here, like h4-h5 and f4-f5 possibly combined with Bd5 and c4 solidifying the bishop on the d5 outpost. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in a number of ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise.   The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be due to the fact that in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for white relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can possibly get. This is a major branching point and black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:     3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging white in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.    3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one.   
I'm going to analyse the latter 2 lines here, in this Quickstarter. These are the two lines you are most likely to face by far. }
3... e5
{ Black's most popular move here and probably also his best one. He fights for the centre by countering with one of his own pawns while simultaneously preparing to develop his bishop actively to b4. }
4. Nf3
{ 4. d5 doesn't work here - it weakens too many squares. White needs to develop and protect d4 with 4. Nf3. }
4... exd4 { Very natural and the most common move. } 5. Bxc4
{ Here there's another split in the road, with the two moves being 5... Bb4+ and the slightly more popular 5... Nc6. }
5... Bb4+
{ Black inserts a check now that we can't block with Nc3. The idea here is to either force White to block with a bishop, after which the trade supposedly favours black, or block with the knight, after which the knight is a bit misplaced on d2. }
6. Nbd2
{ This is quite a bit more popular than 6. Bd2, but it is actually quite a decent option as well. Keeping pieces on the board like this tries to prove the bishop on b4 to be misplaced as well. }
6... Nc6 { Normal development, protecting d4. } 7. O-O Nf6
{ A normal developing move, but Black's lack of any pawns in the centre means that we are free to kick black's knights around. }
8. e5 { Grabbing space. } 8... Nd5 9. Nb3 { Looking to get the d4 pawn back. }
9... Nb6 10. Bg5
{ The other big move here, 10. Bb5, should transpose, but this cuts out one or two extra options for black. We develop our bishop with tempo, which forces black to retreat and exchange his own already-developed bishop. }
10... Be7 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. Bb5
{ The most active square for the bishop. We want to recapture on d4 and then double Black's c-pawns if allowed. }
12... Bd7 13. Bxc6
{ The immediate recapture with Nxd4 leads to an exchange of queens and at least equality for Black, so it's important to insert this first. We are playing for the initiative now. The idea is to use our knights to give Black a headache on the kingside before he gets his king to safety. }
13... Bxc6 14. Nfxd4 Bd5
{ Black can't realistically allow the doubling of his c-pawns. } 15. Qg4
{ White needs to play quickly and forcefully in order not to lose his advantage and even become worse. Our advantage basically consists of one tempo - we need to try to use that tempo to pose black as many problems on the kingside as possible. }
15... O-O 16. f4
{ Grabbing space and protecting e5. White needs to cover the e5 pawn before continuing the attack with Nf5. }
16... g6 { The best way to deal with the Nf5 threat. } 17. Nf5 Qd7 18. Nh6+ Kg7
19. Qg5 { Black's dark squares are unbelievably weak. } 19... Bxb3 20. axb3 Qd8
21. h4
{ As we saw in the previous line, we secure the queen so that if they are exchanged, White has great play down the h-file. }

{ This is Black's best and most popular try. He needed to find a way to deal with the very uncomfortable threat of Qb3, as we saw after the inaccurate 6... Nf6 and 6... Bc5. }
7. Bxe6
{ The more I looked at this simple move with Lc0, the more I liked it. The main move is 7. Bb5 which leads to a slight, pleasant edge in an endgame for White, but I think that this is even better when played with the right idea, which will be revealed shortly. }
7... fxe6 8. Qb3 { Forking b7 and e6. } 8... Qd7 9. Qxb7 Rb8 10. Qa6

10... Nf6 11. Nbd2 { Covering e4. } 11... Bd6
{ The better square for the bishop, where it fights for control of e5. } 12. b3
{ An important idea to remember - the idea will be discussed on the next move. }
12... O-O 13. Ba3
{ This is the point and the reason why I recommended 7. Bxe6 ! Most players here opted for 13. Bb2, which does look very natural, but this is better. White's idea is rather easy to miss - while it might not seem like it, Black's c7 pawn is in fact backward. The key defender of the c7 pawn is the dark bishop on d6, so that's why we play Ba3 - we want to exchange the defender of c7, and then pile up pressure on it by doubling rooks on the c-file. This simple plan is very difficult to combat and I think it guarantees White a good edge. Note that the d-pawn provides virtually no counterplay in this variation. Even if White's queen doesn't blockade it from d3, the knight will just sit on d2, ensuring that it doesn't go anywhere. }

2... e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his own light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 so as to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for white. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Be7
{ This is the 'refined' version of the Queen's Gambit Declined recommended by GM Colovic in his Chessable course on the QGD. For a long time, the Exchange Variation as played by Kasparov & co., was so challenging that many Black players tried to avoid it with this move order trick. The idea is to prevent White from playing Kasparov's favourite setup with Bg5, e3, Bd3, f3 and Nge2, as in the mainline after 3... Nf6. There is a downside to 3... Be7 though - our bishop can now go to f4 instead, where it is also well-placed. If we played our bishop to f4 after 3... Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4, black can play 5... c5 ! which isn't possible now. By playing 3... Be7 Black wants to develop his bishop out to f5 in the Exchange Variation, but as we'll see, there are ways to take advantage of this. }

{ This is a major branching point in the 3. ..Be7 QGD. In this Quickstarter guide, we will look at 2 options Black has: 1. 6... Bd6 is an ultra-solid option recommended by Colovic in his QGD repertoire on Chessable. Black's idea is vacuum the bishops off the board after ...Ne7 and ...Bf5 later, equalising. 2. 6... Bf5 was the main idea behind 5... c6. With the d5 pawn protected, Black is seemingly free to develop his bishop actively to f5. This is the mainline and most challenging variation in the 3... Be7 QGD. }
6... Bd6
{ Colovic's recommendation has only been played 300 or so times, but it needs to be taken seriously. Black's idea is very positional: he exchanges dark bishops immediately in order to free up the e7 square for his knight. From e7, the knight supports ...Bf5 - if this all goes down without a hitch, black gets to exchange his 'problem bishop' on c8 and should equalise comfortably. The downside to this though is that Black is moving his bishop twice, meaning that he is bound to fall further behind in development. }
7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. Bd3 Ne7
{ As mentioned before, the knight is best here in order to support ...Bf5. If Black can play ...Bf5 without some sort of concession, he should be fine. }
9. Qc2 { Knowing that ...Bf5 is threatened, this must be played of course. }
9... b6
{ Colovic's recommendation and Black's main move has received the backing of some top players including Topalov and Jakovenko. Black scraps the idea of exchanging light bishops with ...Bf5 and instead wants to exchange them with ...Ba6 now. This is also a small concession though, since the c6 pawn is something we can target later. }
10. Nf3
{ There is no way to prevent ...Ba6, so we just focus on finishing our development. Black will succeed in exchanging light bishops, but we hope that our lead in development and the slight vulnerability of c6 gives us an edge. }
10... Ba6 11. O-O Bxd3 12. Qxd3 O-O 13. Rac1
{ Naturally, we are going to double up our rooks on the c-file to put maximum pressure on c6. There is a more popular alternative though in the form of 13. e4 here, but I prefer this. 13. e4 seems a bit too commital to me here - I prefer the slower approach here of piling up on the c6 pawn. }
13... Nd7 14. Rc2 Rfd8
{ This was Colovic's improvement and it does seem to be better than 14... Qg6. }
15. Rfc1 Nf8 16. Qa6 Ne6 17. Ne1
{ Colovic only analyzes 17. Ne5, but this seems to be a clear improvement. 17. Ne1 wants to get the knight to d3, just like 17. Ne5, but 17. Ne5 can be met comfortably with ...c5 after which we can't take on c5 since the knight on e5 would hang. }

{ Getting a bishop to f5 so early in the QGD would normally be a huge success, but it comes at a cost as well !

This kingside expansion is double-edged since there is the risk of overextending, but it is White's best chance of an opening advantage here.

Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his own light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 so as to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for white. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Be7
{ This is the 'refined' version of the Queen's Gambit Declined recommended by GM Colovic in his Chessable course on the QGD. For a long time, the Exchange Variation as played by Kasparov & co., was so challenging that many Black players tried to avoid it with this move order trick. The idea is to prevent White from playing Kasparov's favourite setup with Bg5, e3, Bd3, f3 and Nge2, as in the mainline after 3... Nf6. There is a downside to 3... Be7 though - our bishop can now go to f4 instead, where it is also well-placed. If we played our bishop to f4 after 3... Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4, black can play 5... c5 ! which isn't possible now. By playing 3... Be7 Black wants to develop his bishop out to f5 in the Exchange Variation, but as we'll see, there are ways to take advantage of this. }
4. cxd5 { Keeping in style with the Exchange Variation after 3... Nf6. } 4...
exd5 5. Bf4
{ As mentioned before - since the g5 square isn't available, we put our bishop on f4 instead. Black has 2 moves here, which can easily transpose: 5... c6 and 5... Nf6. }
5... c6 { This flexible move is more popular than 5... Nf6. } 6. e3
{ This is a major branching point in the 3. ..Be7 QGD. In this Quickstarter guide, we will look at 2 options Black has: 1. 6... Bd6 is an ultra-solid option recommended by Colovic in his QGD repertoire on Chessable. Black's idea is vacuum the bishops off the board after ...Ne7 and ...Bf5 later, equalising. 2. 6... Bf5 was the main idea behind 5... c6. With the d5 pawn protected, Black is seemingly free to develop his bishop actively to f5. This is the mainline and most challenging variation in the 3... Be7 QGD. }
6... Bf5
{ Black's main and most critical choice and the point behind 5... c6, delaying ... Nf6. Much like after Colovic's 6... Bd6, if Black gets to exchange light bishops, he equalises. }
7. g4
{ Getting a bishop to f5 so early in the QGD would normally be a huge success, but it comes at a cost as well ! White's extra flexibility allows him to kick the bishop away with g4 and grab space on the kingside. This kingside expansion is double-edged since there is the risk of overextending, but it is White's best chance of an opening advantage here. It has received the backing of most top players here and it scores very well too, with nearly 65%. Black has 2 logical retreats here: g6 and e6. }
7... Be6
{ The better retreat, as the bishop isn't at risk of getting trapped by h4-h5. White seems to have 3 decent options for an edge here: 1. The ambitious 8. h4, offering a pawn sacrifice. 2. The more conservative 8. h3, which seeks to consolidate the space on the kingside. 3. The rare 8. Qb3, hitting b7. }
8. Qb3
{ I have made this my main choice for a couple of reasons. It seems like it leads to a relatively risk-free edge for white, at least after the most common reply ...Qb6, whereas 8. h4 seems quite murky and unclear. 8. Qb3 also has the benefit of being rarer and less explored, so opponents will be less prepared for it. It has been played by some very strong GMs as well, including Kramnik in 2018's Candidates tournament against So. }
8... Qb6
{ This is the more common and natural way to cover the attack on the b7 pawn. Black doesn't create any weaknesses and offers a trade of queens. }
9. f3 { Consolidating g4. } 9... g5
{ Quite necessary so as not to get completely cramped. } 10. Be5
{ A good move, provoking ...f6 - the pawn gets in the way of Black's minor pieces. }
10... f6 11. Bg3 h5 { Black's main active idea. } 12. gxh5 Qxb3
{ Pretty much forced - Black needs to get the queens off, otherwise his kingside comes under heavy fire. }
13. axb3 Rxh5 14. Bd3
{ At the time of writing, this position has been reached in 2 games, including the aforementioned Kramnik-So battle. }
14... f5 15. h4
{ With the same plan as Kramnik used against So. By undermining the g5 pawn, we want to get the incredible f4 square for our knights. }

5... Nc6 { Developing while side-stepping the pin after 5... Nf6. } 6. dxc5
{ I like this simple and direct way of meeting the Tarrasch. It is only white's 5th most common move, but White scores a massive 65% here. White can get a slight pull here almost effortlessly and Black has no real way to avoid this. The mainline here is 6. g3. Aagaard and Ntirlis clearly put a lot of analytical effort into this variation to prove equality, but I think it is a difficult task - White seems to be able to get a slight, but lasting edge in most lines. They view this variation as one of the Tarrasch's biggest challenges. }
6... d4
{ The only real option which is played here. Otherwise, White either wins the d5 pawn or gets to keep his c5 pawn. Black uses some little tactics here to recoup his pawn. }
7. Na4 Bxc5 { Using a little tactic to recoup the pawn. } 8. Nxc5 Qa5+
{ Black uses a simple fork to get his material back. This is a major branching point for White in this variation - we can either block the check with the bishop or the queen. Blocking with the bishop looks more natural, but Qd2 has its advantages too - the queen gets to keep its eye on the vulnerable d4 pawn. Both of these moves look promising for White. I spent a few hours analysing both of these variations and comparing my findings with those of Ntirlis and Aagaard. They did a remarkable job of analysing this variation to incredible depths to prove equality for Black - in many cases, the variations were well over 30 moves deep and concluding in single rook endings. In spite of this, I think White can still get a slight edge into the endgame as I'll show. }
9. Bd2
{ Because of the long mainline given after 9. Qd2 which should equalise for Black with very accurate play, I've opted for 9. Bd2 as my main recommendation. Blocking the check with the bishop is certainly more natural. Our idea here will not be to win the d4 pawn, but rather to play e3 and then enjoy lasting pressure thanks to our bishop pair. }
9... Qxc5 10. Rc1
{ Hitting the queen and activating the rook - very logical. Another interesting try which scores very well for white in practice and is also quite strong is the pawn sacrifice 10. b4 !? - it has the advantage of not being covered by Ntirlis and Aagaard as well. }

{ After a somewhat forced last few moves, the dust has settled and we can now take stock. We have reached a position very similar to a typical Grunfeld structure with a few key differences: both dark bishops have been exchanged and Black has played ...e6 instead of ...g6. Much like the Grunfeld, White has a nice big centre and a space advantage, while Black has the queenside 2 v 1 pawn majority. The usefulness of White's space is limited by the fact that two pairs of minor pieces have already been exchanged. Black hopes for more exchanges so that he can put his queenside pawn majority to good use. On the other hand, we will be trying to keep pieces on the board and use our big centre to put Black under pressure. I think White's most promising plan is based on central play with d5, so that's what we will be preparing over the next few moves. }

4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.    Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for white to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.   
The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching white's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.    Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.    There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel.      Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, ...Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6 { Black's most flexible move order. } 6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's actually not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Bf5
{ This is what 6. Qc2 tries to avoid. Black develops his bishop to its best square, thus 'forcing' White to go into an endgame which is slightly better for White, but which some Black players enjoy trying to hold. Let's see this endgame... }
7. Qf3 { White has no chance of getting an advantage with anything else. } 7...
Bg6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6
{ Of course, taking back with the pawn is far worse - Black's wrecked kingside pawn structure is more of a factor in the middlegame. }
9. Qxf6 gxf6
{ Right, so let's take stock. Black has the bishop pair, but in this position they are rather useless since they have no targets and the position is relatively closed. White, on the other hand, has the far superior pawn structure - the doubled f-pawns and isolated h-pawn could cause black some serious problems later on in the game. Players have realised that the Black side of this endgame isn't in fact so bad - Black is objectively worse, but some players are happy to draw worse endgames. It's important to realise that White can't 'refute' Black's position here, but I think that a long term endgame advantage is already a success out of the opening. In practice, Black has struggled quite badly, with White scoring a very good 65% from this position. }
10. Nf3 Nd7 11. Nh4 Be7 12. Ne2
{ This move was a novelty when Carlsen introduced it in 2016 and used it to beat Kramnik in fantastic style. Since then, it has become White's second most common move in the position after the very natural 12. g3. What's White's idea ? We are rerouting our knight from c3 to the f5 outpost. }
12... f5
{ Since Carlsen's fantastic dismantling of Kramnik in this line, no GM has repeated 12... Nb6. Almost all players have chosen the improvement with 12... f5. This ensures that white doesn't get that strong outpost on f5 by attacking white's knight on h4. }

{ White's main choice and the logical follow-up. 13. Nf3 wouldn't pose black many problems. }
13... Bxh4 14. gxh4
{ A very interesting endgame position. Both sides have damaged pawn structures, but the key difference and the reason White is better is that Black's bad pawns on the kingside are on the same colour as Black's bishop. This means that Black's bishop is very poor on g6 and the f5 pawn is an easy target. The endgame is by no means winning for White, but we certainly have an edge and White has scored well from this position. }
14... Nf6 15. Rg1 { This was Kramnik's choice when he used this line. } 15...
Ke7 16. Bh3 Rae8 17. Nf4
{ Black has no counterplay and is in a bit of a bind. Kramnik went on to win his game and I highly recommend taking a look at it: 1-0  (42)  Kramnik,V  (2779)  -Aleksandrov,A  (2602)  Batumi 2018. The key to Kramnik's success in that endgame was that he played on both sides of the board. It's easy to get fixated on the kingside and struggle to make progress. By playing on the queenside with a2-a4 and Ra1-a3-b3 White created more Black weaknesses and won relatively effortlessly. I'd recommend looking at some other games after 14. gxh4 as well to get a feel for how White's play develops. }

1. d4 d5

2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his own light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 so as to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for white. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }

{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4... exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what: 1. By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage. 2. Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened. 3. Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for white to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure. The two famous plans I'm talking about are: 1. Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching white's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack. 2. Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD. There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play .. .c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, ...Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads actually do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's actually not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural develoment. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... Nh5
{ A typical idea for Black, which we'll see much more of later since it is advocated by Ntirlis in his great 'Playing 1. d4 d5' book but with the insertion of 8... h6 first. Exchanging minor pieces helps Black alleviate the space problems he has. }
9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. g4
{ is a very interesting idea. We exploit the position of Black's knight to grab as much space on the kingside while we have the chance. It is just a little bit less popular than the very natural 10. O-O. I've opted for this as my main recommendation since it's relatively forcing, so tricky move orders are avoided, and also it is objectively strong - Black really needs to know his stuff here to get an equal position. }
10... Nhf6 11. Ng3
{ Defending g4 while simultaneously threatening Nf5. Black has a number of ways to deal with this threat and as a result, this is the major branching point after 8... Nh5. }
11... g6
{ Black's most popular move, preventing Nf5 by force but this comes at the cost of weakening Black's kingside significantly. }
12. h4 { We throw our kingside pawns down the board. } 12... Nb6 13. g5
{ Kicking Black's knight back. } 13... Ng8
{ Black's more popular choice, which can also easily be reached from 11... Nb6. }
14. a4
{ A very strong move, only played once. We want to kick Black's other knight back to d7. }
14... a5
{ The fact that the knight on b6 is unprotected now is useful for White. } 15.
h5 { Continuing our attack at the cost of the g5 pawn. } 15... Qxg5 16. Qb3 Nd7
17. O-O-O
{ White has a very promising attacking setup here. Black's pieces are in disarray and his king is still stuck in the centre. White can consider cracking open the centre with Kb1 and e4 next. }

 14.Ng3 encourages Black to march his h-pawn forward wth ...h5-h4 after he covers the e4 pawn with simply 14...Nf6. This is quite annoying for White to deal with since we can't simply block the h-pawn by playing h4 ourselves.   On e2, the knight is more flexible.

Note that this is why we have been delaying the development of our queen for so long ! We want to be flexible so that we can choose between d2 and c2 when necessary. This position hasn't been reached more than 20 times at the time of writing, but it is bound to pick up in popularity. }
12... Nb6
{ The recommendation of Ntirlis. The knight gets out of the bishop's way and eyes the c4 square. If our bishop ever moves, ... Nc4 can be unpleasant - that is why in many variations we play the prophylactic b3. }
13. f3
{ As we've seen already in this chapter, this is a standard idea. Here, however it has 2 purposes:   1. The obvious idea is to prepare e4.   2. The less obvious, but more interesting idea is to prepare g4. With Black's knight on h5 and pawn on h6, we are ideally-placed to expand on the kingside. }
13... Bd7 { Natural development. } 14. g4
{ This is absolutely the critical way to play. White expands on the kingside, gaining important space for his pieces. Our general idea here is to use our extra space to put our pieces in positions where they can take advantage of the open lines we will create. To create these open lines, we will exploit the h6 'hook' by playing h4 followed by g5. }
14... Nf6 15. Nf4
{ This position is analysed quite a bit deeper in the dedicated QGD chapter, but keep in mind our general idea over the next few moves: we bring our other rook to e1, and then play on the kingside with h4. The idea is to crack open the h-file with g5 and then get good play against Black's king. }

This is known as the minority attack. 2. Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD. There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire. But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play .. .c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, ...Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads actually do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's actually not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural develoment. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... O-O { This is the old mainline. } 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. f3
{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. It's vital that we prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black:   
 11... c5 ?! is poor and allows white to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.   11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.   11... Be6 is a natural developing move and Black's most popular choice, but I think White is doing pretty well here.    11... h6 is played with the idea of preparing ...Ne6, but White is doing well here too.    11... Nh5 trades bishops to relieve some pressure, however it misplaces Black's knight and is a bit too slow to equalise.    11... Ng6, in connection with 12... h6, is in my view the most accurate way for Black to play from this position. Black's idea is to simply pick up the bishop pair. This isn't really too popular at the moment and it has scored well for white in practice anyway. }
11... Be6
{ This normal developing move is Black's most common choice, which is quite nice because I think White can get quite a promising position here. }
12. Rad1 { The standard square for our rook, supporting d4. } 12... Ng6
{ A common move in this position and a standard square for Black's knight. }
13. h3
{ I like this move and we'll be seeing more of it later on too. The obvious idea behind it is to cover the g4 square to prevent ...Ng4 after we play e4 ...dxe5 fxe4, but the more interesting idea is to support g4 in certain situations. }
13... Rc8 14. e4 { We are ready to charge forth. } 14... dxe4 15. fxe4 Qc7 16.
e5
{ The standard way to arrange our central pawns. It does give Black the d5 square and leave our d4 pawn backward, but neither of these can be easily exploited. On the other hand though, we usually use it to give our knight access to e4, open our bishop's diagonal and maybe get d6 as a future outpost. }
16... Nd5 17. Nxd5 Bxd5 18. Bxe7
{ We have exchanged two of Black's best dark square defenders, leaving them very vulnerable. }
18... Rxe7 19. Ng3
{ Our knight is heading to f5 and then d6 with a fantastic position. } *

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his own light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 so as to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for white. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }

We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage. 2. Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened. 3.

12. Rad1
{ This is recommended by both Schandorff in his fantastic repertoire book and by Kamil Plichta on Chessable. White can get an edge here against most Black options, except for 12... h6.

Although the sample space is rather small - 13 games - White has won 7 games, while Black has only won a single 1 - that's 70%! The fact that the practical results don't reflect my objective evaluation could mean two things: 1. I'm a clown and my evaluation is nonsense. 2. The position might be equal, but in practice there is plenty of play for both sides, and in reality it is harder to play for Black. }
15... dxe4 { Accurate. } 16. fxe4 Bg5 { A good, active square for the bishop. }
17. h3 { Covering the g4 square. } 17... Kh7 { Protecting g6. } 18. Nf4
{ White doesn't need to rush e5 necessarily. The knight on f4 is well-placed to put some pressure on g6. If Black is not careful, he could very easily fall victim to a very pretty Nxg6 sac. Practically-speaking, I think White is doing well here, but this might actually be Black's best chance. This line is extended a bit in the full QGD chapter, but this is enough for the purposes of the Quickstarter. }

{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.

2... c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. The first chapter deals with a backup weapon, the Exchange Slav. However, that chapter is short enough so you can learn that directly if you want to. In this Quickstarter Guide, I'll be abbreviating and summarizing the 2nd and 3rd Slav chapters, which cover my main recommendation. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/ technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational. Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see, because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all, since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ... Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... dxc4
{ As I mentioned already, this is meant to be one of the downsides of the 3. Nc3 move order, as 3... dxc4 is supposed to be more effective here since the knight becomes a target of the b-pawn after ...b5-b4. However, I think this ultimately isn't too important - White still gets a healthy advantage after 3... dxc4. }

{ Keeping up the pressure on the pawn on c4. Black has two ways to deal with this: he can either try to protect the pawn, or he can advance. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety. We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. The first chapter deals with a backup weapon, the Exchange Slav. However, that chapter is short enough so you can learn that directly if you want to. In this Quickstarter Guide, I'll be abbreviating and summarizing the 2nd and 3rd Slav chapters, which cover my main recommendation. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/ technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational. Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see, because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all, since 3... dxc4 is still good for us. The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ... Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... e6
{ This is the Triangle System - aptly named on account of the triangle pawn formation: c6, d5, e6. I find this to be quite an interesting system, as Black is very flexible. By delaying ... Nf6 for the time being, he keeps his options open - he can play the Stonewall with ...f5 next, he can just transpose into the Semi-Slav with ...Nf6 or, after 4. Nf3, he can omit ...Nf6 for now and go into the notoriously sharp Noteboom Variation after 4... dxc4. }
4. e3
{ I think this move makes the most sense in conjunction with my other repertoire choices. Firstly, we invite a transposition into the next chapter with 4... Nf6 5. Nf3. Black only really has one independent option and that is the Stonewall setup with 4... f5. I should point out that I spent a long time analysing the very sharp and interesting Marshall Gambit with 4. e4, but ultimately I thought that Black was doing pretty fine there if he is well-prepared. Instead, 4. e3 is a good way to fight for an opening advantage while cutting down on the lines we need to learn by inviting a transposition to the Semi-Slav. }
4... f5
{ The Stonewall. Black accepts severe positional drawbacks such as the e5 weakness and the bad bishop on c8 in exchange for the outpost on e4 and some plausible kingside play. }
5. Bd3
{ I looked at a few alternatives here, most notably the very interesting 5. g4 !? but I couldn't find what to suggest there against the simple 5... Nf6. Instead, I really like the look of 5. Bd3 - note that 5. Nf3 isn't a valid alternative which would transpose, because our knight is going to be heading to e2 instead of f3. The point of this is so that we can play f3, taking the e4 outpost away from Black's knight. }
5... Nf6 6. Nge2 { Keeping the f3 square clear for the pawn. } 6... Bd6 7. f3
{ I should mention that the pawn's purpose on f3 is not purely prophylactic - in fact, we will most likely want to play the e4 break later to open up the position once we have completed development. }
7... O-O 8. O-O
{ Black has tried a few moves here, and we'll have a look at the 4 most common ones to give you an idea of how play can proceed. Overall though, I'm very happy with how White's chances look in this line. }
8... Nbd7 { Black's most flexible and natural move. } 9. Bd2
{ Continuing to develop. } 9... dxc4 10. Bxc4 Nb6 11. Bb3
{ Keeping the pin on the e6 pawn. } 11... Kh8 12. e4
{ Now is the right time for this thematic break. } 12... fxe4 13. Nxe4
{ Recapturing with the pawn allows Black to play the strong response ...e5. }
13... Nxe4 14. fxe4
{ White's centre and more active pieces give him a comfortable advantage. } *

3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
4... a6
{ The ...a6 Slav. This opening goes by many names, like the Chebanenko Slav, or the Chameleon Slav, but let's stick with the simple '...a6 Slav'. This flexible little move doesn't commit Black to a development scheme yet, while introducing a few ideas for Black into the position. Firstly, it allows Black to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 without having to worry about the loose b7 pawn after Qb3, since now Black can defend it with ... Ra7 or play ...b5. The second, more obvious idea of ...a6 is to prepare ...b5 for Black. However, this all can come at the detriment of the bishop on c8 - if Black isn't careful in this line, that bishop can truly end up with zero prospects. }
5. Qc2
{ Delaying Nf3 is one virtue of using the 3. Nc3 4. e3 move order. 5. Qc2 is a prophylactic move, directed against the development of Black's light bishop to f5. The most popular move here is the very natural 5. Nf3, but this scores a bit better and I think it's a good way to make use of our move order. }
5... g6
{ This combination of the ...a6 Slav and Schlechter Slav was one of the recommendations of GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav. }
6. Bd3 Bg7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O Bg4
{ Passive play with 8... Nbd7 or the like doesn't challenge White at all. Black needs to develop the bishop actively to have a shot at equalising. }
9. Ne5 { We can't allow ...Bxf3 of course. } 9... Be6 10. c5
{ Closing the centre. Usually, this move carries some risk since it makes Black's ...e5 break more powerful, but as we can see here, Black is very far from carrying out that break. We will generally be looking to play on the queenside now, with the intention of carrying out the b4-b5 break in the future. }
10... Nbd7 11. Nxd7
{ 11. f4 looks very tempting but Black's dark bishop will become very strong on the h6-c1 diagonal after ...Nxe5 fxe5. }
11... Qxd7
{ Recapturing with the queen contains the idea of trading off Black's bad bishop with ...Bf5 next. }
12. Bd2 Bf5 13. Bxf5 gxf5
{ The doubled f-pawns might seem inconsequential - maybe even beneficial due to the newly-opened g-file. However, I'm not convinced that this is the case - one of Black's issues now is that the typical ...e5 break is far less effective since it leaves f5 extremely weak. }
14. Ne2 Nh5 15. a4
{ Getting queenside play underway. The rook lift, Ra1-a3-b3 is now a possibility. }
15... Kh8 16. b4
{ Another decent plan is 16. Ra3-b3. Instead, we are going for the b5 break directly here. }
16... Rg8 17. b5
{ This looks like a pawn sacrifice for the moment, but it's not a pawn that Black can hold on to. }
17... axb5 18. axb5 cxb5 19. Rxa8 Rxa8 20. Rb1
{ We've opened up the queenside with a better position thanks to our far superior pawn structure. We intend to recoup the b5 pawn next with Qd3xb5. }

Black argues that he isn't really losing a tempo with ...c6-c5, since White's move 5. Qc2 isn't nearly as useful in this Tarrasch structure - in fact, it's debatable whether it is better on d1 or c2. In spite of this, I still think White gets good prospects in this variation - we often end up in an IQP structure, or a symmetrical position, where White is the only one with winning chances }

{ In this position, there is a fork in the road: Black can play 10...Nb4 or 10...cxd4.

{ The slightly more popular move here is 11. Qd2 but it comes at the downside of allowing 11... Ne4, after which I think Black is doing completely fine. That's why I prefer 11. Qb1, which is directed against ...Ne4 since it keeps a grip on that vital e4 square. There is a downside to this though - the queen is a bit awkwardly placed on b1, meaning that Black can try to exploit its position by trapping it with ...Qc8 and ...Bf5. }

{ The main thing to remember in this line - we can't allow Black to keep our dark bishop trapped on d2. The e4 pawn sacrifice is temporary, with the point of freeing our pieces, especially our dark bishop. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety. We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. The first chapter deals with a backup weapon, the Exchange Slav. However, that chapter is short enough so you can learn that directly if you want to. In this Quickstarter Guide, I'll be abbreviating and summarizing the 2nd and 3rd Slav chapters, which cover my main recommendation. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/ technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational. Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see, because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all, since 3... dxc4 is still good for us. The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ... Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
4... g6
{ The Schlechter Slav. I've never been a huge fan of combining the Slav and ...g6, as it seems like a pretty passive setup to me. Despite this, it is quite solid and a perfectly viable way to play. The next few moves are the most common by far, until we reach an important branching point on move 7: }
5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be2
{ We do actually have one other move here, which is the seemingly more active 6. Bd3. The primary advantage 6. Be2 has is that it covers the knight on f3. This is particularly useful since Black often develops his light bishop to g4, where it 'threatens' to take on f3. The benefit of having a bishop on e2 is that in this case we are still free to move our queen to b3 without having to worry about ...Bxf3 leaving us with doubled f-pawns. }
6... O-O 7. O-O
{ This is a major branching point, where Black has tried pretty much every legal move under the sun. In the full chapter, we'll take a look at the 8 most logical and popular ideas which he has tried from here. Black can try many things, and he can try those many things in many different move orders - it's not practical to cover everything here since White can typically respond in a similar way to most of Black's tries. That's why I recommend paying special attention to the ideas and maneuvers we use in the following few variations, and not just the actual moves. I could summarise our plans in two broad scenarios here: 1. Black develops his bishop either to e6, f5, or g4. We respond by playing cxd5 and follow up with Qb3, attacking the b7 pawn which was left unprotected. 2. Black doesn't develop his bishop, and instead does something else like ...e6 or ... b6. In this case, we develop our own dark bishop with b3 and Ba3. In both situations, we should look to play Ne5 when the time is right. }
7... Bg4
{ The most natural move, developing the bishop to its most active square. However, this is where the point of 7. Be2 becomes particularly clear - the bishop is ideally placed to meet ...Bxf3 so that we are still free to move our queen to b3. }
8. cxd5 { Just like after 7... Be6 and 7... Bf5. } 8... cxd5 9. Qb3
{ Hitting b7, once again. } 9... b6 10. h3 Bxf3 11. Bxf3 e6 12. Bd2 Nc6 13.
Rfc1
{ It's best to put this rook on the c-file, since it was doing nothing on f1 - the other rook could conceivably be useful on a1 or b1 in the future. }
13... Na5 14. Qc2 Nc4 15. Be1
{ Once again, keeping the bishop pair for when the position opens up in the future. Next we can boot the knight away from c4 with Be2 and b3, and follow up by conquering the c-file by controlling c8 with Ba6. }

I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
4... Bf5
{ Of all the moves Black has available, this is most in-line with the Classical Slav - Black wants to solve the problem of his light bishop, so he does - he simply develops it to f5 and asks White what he will do about it. Fortunately, we can do plenty about it... In fact, the whole point of our 3. Nc3 4. e3 setup was directed against this move, 4... Bf5 ! This is because, with our knight on c3, we are ideally placed to exploit the unguarded b7 pawn by attacking both b7 and d5 with Qb3. Although this was thought to be bad for Black for a long time, Black has recently begun to play in a way where he sacrifices the b7 pawn and tries to get compensation in the form of piece activity. This was recommended by GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav and it's definitely one of the critical tests of this whole repertoire, however I think White is actually doing pretty well here. }
5. cxd5
{ The usual move to prepare Qb3 - the immediate Qb3 isn't quite as good because ...Qb6 is a decent way to play for Black there. }
5... cxd5 6. Qb3
{ The whole point - Black doesn't have a comfortable way to deal with the threat to the b7 pawn. }
6... Nc6

7. Qxb7 { Grabbing the pawn is critical, of course. } 7... Bd7 8. Qb3
{ We should immediately extract the queen before it starts getting kicked around. }
8... Rb8 9. Qd1 e5
{ Black seeks to open up the position quickly while we are temporarily behind in development. In this position, White has two possible moves: 10. dxe5 and 10. Nf3. Although these moves will transpose in many cases, my preference is for 10. Nf3, because it doesn't allow 12... Nxf3+ ! in the variation I'll show in the Slav chapter after 10. dxe5. }
10. Nf3 Bd6 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nd4
{ Within a couple of moves, this should transpose to the mainline after 12. Be2, but it cuts out the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea which we just saw. }
12... O-O 13. Be2
{ An important branching point in this line. 12. Nd4 is very rare, so there aren't too many practical games to go of off unfortunately. I examined two ideas here: 13... Qe7, which transposes to the mainline which was covered by GM Avrukh, and 13... Ne4 which tries to keep the game independent waters. For the purposes of the Quickstarter, we'll look at 13... Qe7. }
13... Qe7 { This leads to a position covered by Avrukh after we castle. } 14.
O-O Rfc8
{ An important position for the assessment of this variation. Black definitely has some compensation for the pawn in the form of his activity and pressure on our queenside, but I still think our pawn should give us a slight edge as I don't think Black has full compensation. I looked at a few ideas here such as 15. h3, 15. a4 and 15. Ncb5, but ultimately I settled for something which goes unmentioned in GM Avrukh's book: 15. Ndb5. }
15. Ndb5
{ We try to chase the bishop off the h2-b8 diagonal, with the point of following up with a3 and b4 with tempo. }
15... Bc5 { The only move which has been tried so far. } 16. a3
{ Intending b4 next, kicking the bishop back and preparing Bb2. } 16... Bb6
{ Retreating prophylactically in preparation for b4, but this does leave d5 free for the taking. }
17. Nxd5 { Greedily grabbing a second pawn, but I don't see why not. } 17...
Nxd5 18. Qxd5 Bc6 19. Qd6 Qe8 20. Nc3
{ Black certainly has plenty of compensation here and his bishops do look menacing, but I'm not convinced it's two pawns' worth of compensation. Black can recoup one of the pawns fairly easily, by targeting b2, but this will lead to exchanges meaning that some of Black's pressure will be neutralised and that White should still retain an edge thanks to his remaining extra pawn. }

4... e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. All the way back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked in to playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside, since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's own bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ...dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black actually has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7.   The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who are able to put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one really has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines, can become very sharp - obviously this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who are able to reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing, and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ...O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before, since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation, when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... b6
{ Black intends to fianchetto his position and just play solidly, but these plans never appear too challenging to me. If Black plays slowly and passively like this, White can usually prepare the e4 break and get a good position with minimal effort. }
7. Bd3 Bb7 8. O-O
{ Black has played all the obvious moves and now has an important decision to make. In this structure, it is actually pretty important whether Black puts his bishop on d6 or on e7. There are a number of pros and cons to each square, which we'll look at in the relevant variation. }
8... Bd6
{ This looks like the better and more active square, but it does have a major downside: the bishop is much more exposed on d6. This is something we can exploit with our next move. }
9. e4
{ This break is much stronger with Black's bishop on d6, since after ...dxe4 Nxe4 Black's bishop is attacked. Black has no choice but to take on e4 since the e5 advance would be absolutely crushing. }
9... dxe4 10. Nxe4
{ The bishop on d6 is attacked - this is important since Black would otherwise have the chance to play the thematic freeing break ...c5. }
10... Nxe4
{ Black doesn't want to admit defeat so early by retreating the bishop. } 11.
Bxe4
{ Black is just a bit too slow here. He can't play the freeing ...c5 break, because we have the c6 pawn pinned, and he ... Nf6 doesn't manage to boot our bishop away from e4 since we have the annoying Bg5 pin. }
11... h6
{ As a result, this move makes the most sense - Black prepares ... Nf6 by stopping Bg5, which prepares ...c5 since it would get rid of the pin on the c6 pawn. Moreover, Black couldn't even castle here because the h7 pawn was hanging. }
12. Re1 { A good square for the rook in general in this structures. } 12... O-O
{ 12... Nf6 still isn't ideal because we have the very thematic 13. c5 ! available. }
13. Bd2
{ A good square for the bishop where it can help prepare the b4 advance in the future. }
13... Nf6 14. c5
{ This is an important idea to be aware of in this structure. If Black gets to play ...c5 under good conditions in this structure, he can often equalises without many problems. By playing c5 ourselves, Black's freeing break is obviously out of the question now. It does look like an anti-positional move though, since we cede the d5 outpost for Black's knight and give ourselves a backward d4 pawn, but neither of these things are that important. The knight on d5 would look pretty, but not threaten much, while the pawn on d4 only looks weak on the surface since Black can't really attack it while it can be easily defended. On the other hand, the positional benefits of c5 are numerous - the bishop on b7 is buried alive on b7, we can possibly make use of the d6 outpost in the future, Ne5 becomes even strong etc. }
14... Bc7 15. Bd3
{ Dropping the bishop back, keeping the bishop pair and ensuring Black's light bishop remains stuck on b7. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety. We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. The first chapter deals with a backup weapon, the Exchange Slav. However, that chapter is short enough so you can learn that directly if you want to. In this Quickstarter Guide, I'll be abbreviating and summarizing the 2nd and 3rd Slav chapters, which cover my main recommendation. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/ technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational. Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see, because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all, since 3... dxc4 is still good for us. The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ... Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
4... e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. All the way back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked in to playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside, since I still think these lines are pretty good for White. What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's own bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ...dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black actually has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who are able to put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one really has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines, can become very sharp - obviously this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav. As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who are able to reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing, and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ...O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders.

That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before, since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3.6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation, when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7.6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, .. .b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Be7
{ This is also a natural move, but unlike 6... Bd6 it does nothing to further Black's goal of playing the ...e5 break later on. As a result, it's a bit passive and I think White should get an edge here. The main advantage of having the bishop on e7 instead of d6 is that it is less exposed to our e4 break, meaning that ...Be7 is often combined with the development scheme of ... b6 and ...Bb7. }
7. b3
{ We want to fianchetto our own bishop on b2. The pawn on b3 also does a good job of ruling out Black's plan of ...dxc4 followed by ... b5 since we can now just recapture with our pawn. I should point out that this b3 plan isn't effective against 6... Bd6 because Black can then just play the ...e5 break and equalise relatively effortlessly. The passivity of the bishop on e7 gives us time to play b3 and Bb2. }
7... O-O 8. Bb2 b6 9. Bd3 Bb7 10. O-O
{ After all the 'automatic' moves have been made, we have transposed to a position which we also reached a short while ago after 6... b6. Here our plan of e4, which worked well against the bishop on d6, is much less effective since Black has time to take on e4 and then play the thematic freeing break, ...c5. Play can proceed in a number of ways here, but I'll show you two sample lines where we carry out our plan: we will generally be looking to play Ne5 and then support the knight by playing f4. One line will look at when Black plays the prophylactic ...h6, while the other will deal with the situation where Black tries to save a tempo by omitting this move. transposes to a position we cover after 6... Be7. }
10... h6
{ Black gets the pawn away from the dangerous b1-h7 diagonal. This is a useful move since often when we play Ne5, taking on e5 wouldn't be possible because the defender of h7 would be booted away after dxe5. }
11. Rfd1
{ Putting the other rook on d1 is also perfectly playable. It's a difficult choice, deciding which rook setup to recommend, or play in an actual game, as they are objectively similar and they each have their pros and cons. This time around I'm showing 11. Rfd1 based on a nice game played by Jakovenko: }
11... Rc8 12. Qe2
{ This is a good square for our queen where it is less exposed than on the c-file. It's always a bit unpleasant to have your queen on the same file as the enemy's rook. }
12... Qc7 13. Rac1 Qb8 14. Ne5
{ A thematic lunge - it can often be played even if e5 is seemingly covered because of tactics. If Black takes twice on e5 here, we have the very strong Nxd5 discovered attack. }
14... Rfd8 15. Bb1
{ Dropping the bishop back clears the d-file for the rook and maybe also prepares some Qc2/Qd3 mating ideas in the future. }
15... Nxe5
{ This isn't forced, but Black clearly wanted to get rid of the knight on e5 before we have the chance to support it with f4. }
16. dxe5 Nd7 17. f4
{ White was already clearly better in 1-0  (22)  Jakovenko,D  (2752)  -Van Delft,M  (2381)  Porto Carras 2018. Our space advantage and active pieces give us the opportunity to even switch plans here and launch a kingside attack with Qh5, Rf1-f3-g3 etc. }

6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ...Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ... e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... e5
{ This is a very thematic break, but it was relatively rare to try to play it so early. However, it is a genuinely good try, which is why it has picked up in popularity so much recently, especially among strong GMs like Ding Liren, who has used it repeatedly. The downside of playing in this way is that if White knows what he is doing, the very best that Black can do is land up in a symmetrical position where White is more active and Black has very few winning chances. After our next move, White scores a very healthy 62%. }
9. cxd5 { The typical response to the ...e5 break. } 9... cxd5 10. e4
{ A very strong and somewhat surprising move if you haven't seen it before. Playing in a similar way to 7... e5 with 10. Nb5 is also a viable line, but there are some minor differences in this case which I think allow Black to have a great chance to equalise. Instead 10. e4 is a good way to fight for an advantage. The tension in the centre favours White because we are more active. Black has two ways to play here: 10... dxe4, and the more popular 10... exd4. Both options are decent, but I feel like Black is fighting for a draw in both cases with minimal winning chances. }
10... exd4 { The more popular of the two captures. } 11. Nxd5
{ Taking on d4 allows Black to liquidate the centre completely and equalise quite comfortably. }
11... Nxd5 12. exd5 h6 { Preventing Bxh7+. } 13. Nxd4
{ We are up a pawn for the moment, but the d5 pawn is a goner. However, we do have one other trump card here: our active pieces. }
13... Qh4 { Threatening our knight and mate simultaneously. } 14. Nf3 Qh5 15.
Bh7+ { We want to offer the trade of queens with Qf5 next. } 15... Kh8 16. Qf5
Qxf5
{ The safest and best way to play. Black will now look to regain the pawn and hold the endgame. }
17. Bxf5 Nf6 18. Bxc8 Rfxc8 19. Rd1
{ Making it as difficult as possible for Black to recoup the pawn. } 19... Rd8
20. Be3 { A good, active square for the bishop. } 20... Be7 21. d6 Rxd6 22.
Rxd6 Bxd6 23. Rd1 Bc7 24. Kf1
{ White still has a slight edge here due to our more active pieces, even in this seemingly very dry and equal endgame. I highly recommend taking a look at 1-0  (48)  Gledura,B  (2515)  -Anand,V  (2784)  Caleta 2016, to see how even one of the world's greatest players ever was unable to hold this endgame. White prevailed by eventually exchanging down into a knight vs bishop endgame where his activity ended up being the deciding factor. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety. We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. The first chapter deals with a backup weapon, the Exchange Slav. However, that chapter is short enough so you can learn that directly if you want to. In this Quickstarter Guide, I'll be abbreviating and summarizing the 2nd and 3rd Slav chapters, which cover my main recommendation. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/ technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational. Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see, because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all, since 3... dxc4 is still good for us. The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ... Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
4... e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. All the way back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked in to playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside, since I still think these lines are pretty good for White. What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's own bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ...dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black actually has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who are able to put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one really has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines, can become very sharp - obviously this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav. As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who are able to reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing, and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ...O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before, since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3.6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation, when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7.6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, .. .b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ...Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ... e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point, since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows:   
 9... e5 foregoes queenside play in order to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible.    9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5.  9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break.   
Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... e5
{ Black decides that he is going to focus on getting counterplay in the centre instead of playing for any queenside plan with ...b5. }
10. h3
{ This is a very useful prophylactic move and White's most popular choice. It serves two purposes: 1. It takes g4 away from Black's minor pieces. 2. It ensures that Black never has some dangerous ...Bxh2+ tactical idea after he plays ...e4. }
10... Qe7
{ A useful, multi-purpose move. e7 is the best square for the queen, where it protects e5 and supports a potential ...e4 advance later on. }
11. a3
{ A regrouping intending Ba2 which was played many times by Karpov when he popularised whole Anti-Meran starting with 6. Qc2. 11. Bb3 is another good move, which actually even more popular now. }
11... Bb8
{ This has become Black's most popular choice here. It has the major advantage over ...Bc7 of not allowing any Nb5 ideas. }
12. Ba2 h6
{ The usual idea - preventing Ng5 so that Black can develop his rook. } 13. Nh4
{ Once again, exploiting the downside of ...h6 and preparing to invade on the f5 square. }
13... Rd8
{ This has been the near-exclusive choice of Black players - this option wasn't really available after ...Bc7 because Nb5 was very strong in that case. Black's idea here is to regroup with ...Qe8 and ...Nf8, after which the rook is well-placed on d8 to put pressure on our d4 pawn. }
14. Nf5 Qe8 15. Bd2 Nf8 16. Ne2
{ This is a relatively rare but strong idea with the intention of activating our dark bishop on c3, b4, or even a5 while also maybe playing Neg3. }
16... exd4 17. Nfxd4 Qe4 { Black's best bet is to head into an endgame here. }
18. Qxe4 Nxe4 19. Ba5 Re8 20. Rfd1
{ Material is equal, but White has the more pleasant endgame here. All our pieces are pretty active and as usual, our e and f-pawns can start rolling forwards very quickly starting with f3 and e4. }

However, it isn't as effective against 9... a6 because Black can just go 10... e5 after 10. e4. Instead, we played a small improving move while Black played an improving move of his own. }
11. Bd3
{ e2 is another possible square for the bishop, but d3 scores better and is my preferred choice. Black has two equally popular moves here: 1.11... Bb7, developing naturally and intending ... c5 next. 2.11... Qc7, preparing ...c5 and preventing our thematic Ng5 hop. Note that the tempting immediate 11... c5 runs into the strong, typical counter 12. Ne4 !. We'll look at 11... Qc7 in the Quickstarter guide. }
11... Qc7
{ Black ties our knight down to the defence of the h2 pawn and prepares to play ...c5 since Ne4 can now be met by ...c4 since the bishop on d6 wouldn't be hanging. }
12. Bd2
{ Simply continuing development. There isn't a way to prevent ...c5 anymore. }
12... c5 { Black should get this break in while he still has the chance. } 13.
Ne4
{ Once again, we see this thematic counter to ...c5. Black doesn't want to take on e4 since after Bxe4 we attack both Black's rook on a8 and the pawn on h7. }
13... c4 { Closing the queenside like this is Black's only decent option. } 14.
Nxd6 Qxd6 15. Be2 Bb7
{ After a few semi-forced moves, I think it's a good time to take stock. Black has given up the bishop pair but has a lot of compensation for it. What was once a bad bishop, stuck on c8, has become an absolute monster on the long diagonal - on top of that, Black has more space and we are very cramped on the queenside. Black would be comfortably equal if he could have one more move to consolidate his queenside, with ...Bd5 for example. However, he doesn't - we need to take advantage of this by immediately laying siege to Black's a6-b5-c4 pawn chain in order to free our pieces a bit. }
16. b3
{ Attacking c4. Black doesn't want to take on b3 since after axb3 our pieces get plenty of breathing room and a6 becomes weak. Instead, he wants to find a way to maintain the pawn on c4. }
16... Bd5
{ This is Black's best way to defend the c4 pawn. The point is so that Black can recapture on c4 if we play bxc4 with ...Bxc4 !, ensuring that he doesn't end up with an isolated c-pawn as he did after 16... Rfc8. }
17. Qb2
{ We don't want to allow bxc4 ...Bxc4, so we get our queen off the c-file. }
17... Rfc8 18. Be1
{ 18. Ba5 is a more popular square for the bishop, but we need to be a bit careful there sometimes to not allow ...b4, trapping our bishop offside. }
18... Ne4 { Black threatens ...c3. } 19. Rac1
{ Dealing with the threat of ...c3 and now we are threatening Ne5, so Black needs to deal with that. }
19... f6 { Preventing Ne5. } 20. Ba5
{ This might seem truly bizarre - we just played 18. Be1 two moves ago ! It really is quite difficult to understand, but the reason for this lies in a specific variation: if Black plays 20... cxb3 21. axb3 b4 in this line, then in the future the e6 pawn could become a serious weakness since we'll eventually get the c4 square for our bishop. After the immediate 18. Ba5, Black doesn't have this problem because he wouldn't be forced to play ...f6. In effect, we have lost a tempo to provoke .. .f6 which is to our advantage. }
20... Rab8 21. Ne1
{ A typical idea in this line, intending to kick Black's knight out of e4 with f3 next and then maneuver our own knight to the queenside with Nc2. }
21... f5 { Securing a retreat square for the knight. } 22. f3
{ Booting the knight away. } 22... Nef6 23. Nc2
{ White went on to win a very good game from here in 1-0  (79)  Bukavshin,I  (2629)  -Artemiev,V  (2660)  Khanty-Mansiysk 2014, where White's bishop pair eventually prevailed. }

1. d4 d5
{ Black decides to fight for centre by occupying it with his own pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety. We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. The first chapter deals with a backup weapon, the Exchange Slav. However, that chapter is short enough so you can learn that directly if you want to. In this Quickstarter Guide, I'll be abbreviating and summarizing the 2nd and 3rd Slav chapters, which cover my main recommendation. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/ technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational. Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see, because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all, since 3... dxc4 is still good for us. The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ... Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
4... e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. All the way back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked in to playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside, since I still think these lines are pretty good for White. What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's own bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ...dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black actually has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who are able to put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one really has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines, can become very sharp - obviously this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav. As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who are able to reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing, and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ...O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before, since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3.6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation, when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7.6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, .. .b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ...Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ... e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point, since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1.9... e5 foregoes queenside play in order to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2.9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5.3.9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back with the intention of developing his own light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7 { Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far. } 11.
e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows in the Semi-Slav chapter is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }
11... e5
{ The only decent move at Black's disposal - he needs to deal with the threat of e5. }
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ The knight is heading for the outpost on f5. We do have a very valid alternative in the form of the slightly rarer 13. Nh4, but 13. Nd4 is in my opinion a bit stronger and it scores better - a whopping 69% in my database of OTB games ! }
13... Neg4
{ Black's most popular and best move by far - he doesn't give us a chance to play Nf5 by first threatening the h2 pawn. }
14. g3
{ The only decent move - please don't play 14. h3, even though it looks very tempting - Black has 14... Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ ! followed by ...Qxd4. 14. g3 does a good job of blunting Black's dark bishop and reducing these tactical tricks that Black has at his disposal. }
14... Bxg3
{ This is a very tempting move, seemingly winning a pawn, which I was lucky enough to face in practice and score a win against. For the time being, it's actually Black's most common move in OTB games, but White scores a whopping 72% from here. A better choice is 14... Bc5, which we'll be looking at next - however, I imagine most of our opponent's opening knowledge/preparation will end around here, and it will be difficult for those players to resist the temptation to grab what looks like a free pawn. Black seems to have spotted a little tactic that wins a pawn, but White has more than enough compensation in the endgame which we'll force in a couple moves time... }
15. hxg3 Qxd4 16. Qd1
{ An important follow-up to remember, taking the game into an endgame by force. }
16... Qxd1 17. Rxd1
{ Let's take stock briefly. We are down a pawn in this endgame and our compensation isn't immediately apparent. However, the more you look at this and analyse it, the more you realise how difficult matters are for Black. Our compensation mainly consists of: 1. The bishop pair. 2. The possibility of rolling our central pawns forward with f3-f4 and e5.3. The bad bishop on b7, and our more active pieces by contrast. 4. The weak c6 pawn and exposed Black queenside pawns in general. These things in combination provide us with more than enough for the pawn. Black has struggled from this point in practice, and even objectively he is a long way from being able to equalise. I'm going to show a couple of sample lines here, but I'd recommend taking a look at a few games from this endgame as well to see how play might proceed. }

Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who are able to reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing, and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ...O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before, since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3.6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation, when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7.6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, .. .b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ...Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ... e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point, since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1.9... e5 foregoes queenside play in order to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2.9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5.3.9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back with the intention of developing his own light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7 { Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far. } 11.
e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows in the Semi-Slav chapter is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }
11... e5
{ The only decent move at Black's disposal - he needs to deal with the threat of e5. }
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ The knight is heading for the outpost on f5. We do have a very valid alternative in the form of the slightly rarer 13. Nh4, but 13. Nd4 is in my opinion a bit stronger and it scores better - a whopping 69% in my database of OTB games ! }
13... Neg4
{ Black's most popular and best move by far - he doesn't give us a chance to play Nf5 by first threatening the h2 pawn. }
14. g3
{ The only decent game once again - please don't play 14. h3, even though it looks very tempting - Black has 14... Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ ! followed by ...Qxd4. 14. g3 does a good job of blunting Black's dark bishop and reducing these tactical tricks that Black has at his disposal. }
14... Bc5
{ This is catching up in popularity to the natural 14... Bxg3 in OTB games, as I think it is Black's best way to equalise. Black starts putting some pressure on the f2 pawn. }
15. Nf5 Re8 { Putting some pressure on the e4 pawn. } 16. Bf4
{ Simply developing and making it possible for the other rook to enter the game now. My analysis in the Semi-Slav chapter goes quite a bit deeper, but that's beyond the scope of this Quickstarter guide. If you, and your opponent, manage to reach this position, then you've already done well ! }

{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value.   All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... Bf5
{ The Baltic Defence. Black's idea, if allowed, is to play an 'improved QGD' after 3... e6 if allowed, where his bishop will be active on f5 instead of passive on c8, stuck inside the pawn chain. The downside to this is of course that the support for the d5 pawn is lacking, and nothing prevents us from playing 3. cxd5 right now. }
3. cxd5
{ This must be critical of course. Black's queen will be forced to recapture on d5 where it is exposed to Nc3. }
3... Bxb1
{ One of the chief ideas behind the Baltic Defence is to remove the knight on b1 so that Black can leave his queen on d5 without worrying about Nc3. However, the bishop pair is the bishop pair... }
4. Rxb1
{ 4. Qa4+ is more popular, but I prefer this on account of our next move. }
4... Qxd5 5. Nf3

5... Qxa2 { Grabbing the pawn must be critical of course. } 6. Bd2
{ Defending the rook and threatening to grab the whole centre now with e4. }
6... Qd5 7. Rc1 { Keeping up the pressure on Black by attacking c7. } 7... c6
8. e4
{ Another very strong move, sacrificing yet another pawn ! We drag Black's queen further into the centre and clear the diagonal so that we can develop our light bishop. }
8... Qxe4+ 9. Be2 Nd7 10. O-O
{ White's initiative is already decisive here. He has managed to fully develop and castle, while Black has only managed to get one minor piece out - and moreover, his queen is still horribly exposed on e4. Next, we can develop our initiative with Re1, Qb3, Ne5 etc. White won easily in the correspondence game 1-0  (19)  Voveris,G  (2240)  -Kokorin,V  (2161)  ICCF email 2015 }

2... e5
{ The Albin Countergambit. Black sacrifices the e5 pawn in order to get a thorn on d4 which is a little bit annoying since it cramps our centre and kingside - however, we are still a pawn up. Often, Black will either try to regain the e5 pawn later with ...Nc6 and ...Nge7-g6, or start some kind of kingside attack. We will look to return the pawn at the right time with a pleasant positional advantage. }
3. dxe5 d4
{ The d4 pawn does a good job of restricting our knight from coming to c3 and making e3 difficult. }
4. Nf3 Nc6
{ The real start of the Albin Countergambit. There are a few typical ideas you should try to remember here:   
 a3, to prepare b4 and Bb2.   Nbd2, just developing and possibly intending Nb3 to attack d4.   g3 intending to fianchetto our light bishop and castle.   
These ideas can be played in virtually any order. If you remember them, the Albin shouldn't pose you any problems - often Black can mix up his move order here or try different, wacky ideas, but if you remember White's setup everything should turn out just fine. }

2... Nc6
{ The Chigorin Defence. White has a few ways to get an edge, but Black isn't doing too badly. Black violates two opening guidelines in exchange for trying to get quick development/piece play and pressure against our centre: he doesn't support the d5 pawn and he blocks his c-pawn. This second fact is quite important since the c-pawn is often instrumental in Black's counterplay in many Queen's Gambit openings. I spent a while analysing different options against the Chigorin before settling on my choice. 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 are the two most popular moves, but both of these lead to unusual positions which are surprisingly complex. I was looking for a simple line which could get us a pleasant edge without allowing anything to bizarre, and I think I found the ideal solution in the form of 3. cxd5. }
3. cxd5
{ This is rarer than the two main moves, 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3, but I think it is a very simple and strong way to defuse the Chigorin Defence - especially when played in conjunction with my recommendation of 6. a3 !. }
3... Qxd5 4. e3
{ Supporting d4 and threatening to boot Black's queen away from centre with 3. Nc3 next. }
4... e5 { Black attacks our centre and gets ready to develop his dark bishop. }
5. Nc3 Bb4 6. a3
{ The most popular move is 6. Bd2, but this is simpler I think and at least as strong - probably stronger. We force ...Bxc3+, gaining the bishop pair, and use our b-pawn to support the d4 pawn. This can lead to similar positions to 6. Bd2, but leaving the bishop on c1 has some perks - most notably, after 8... Qd6 in the mainline, we have the idea of harassing Black's queen with a4 and Ba3, which isn't possible if the bishop is on d2 instead. }
6... Bxc3+ 7. bxc3
{ Now our idea is to expand in the centre with tempo by playing c4 followed by d5, kicking away Black's queen and knight respectively. We should be better here due to our extra space and bishop pair after that. }
7... Nf6 8. c4 Qd6
{ This is the more natural square for the queen, but I think d8 might be marginally better since the queen isn't exposed to a4 Ba3 there. }
9. d5 { Gaining space and evicting Black's knight. } 9... Ne7 10. a4
{ An important idea to remember - we want to activate our dark bishop with Ba3 next. }
10... Qb4+
{ Black provokes our bishop to d2, so that it can't go Ba3 on the next move. }
11. Bd2 Qd6
{ Black is effectively offering a draw here, but it's his best objective try. Of course we don't have to repeat here with 12. Bc1, but instead we can just play }
12. Nf3
{ Now our plan is to play Bc1-a3 once again, except this time we can meet the annoying ...Qb4+ with Nd2. }
12... O-O 13. Bc1 Nd7 14. Ba3

1. d4 f5
{ We'll be examining the 'pure Dutch' here, starting with 1... f5. The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }
2. Bg5
{ This is an incredibly popular recommendation for White in repertoire books, including in those of Kaufman and Schandorff. Its appeal is easy to understand - 2. Bg5 is forcing and quite disruptive. In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6. 2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ... e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works there too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendations. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }

exf6
{ Note that this is the same position we could have reached after 2... Nf6 3... d5. }
5. c4
{ One of the major problems Black has in this line is the exposed a2-g8 diagonal. To that end, we want to open that diagonal up by forcing Black to take on c4. With that in mind, our plan is to put as much pressure on d5 as quickly as possible with moves like c4, Nc3, and Qb3. }
5... c6 { Supporting d5. } 6. Nc3 Be6 7. Qb3
{ Hitting b7 and putting some pressure on d5. } 7... Qd7 8. Rc1

8... dxc4 9. Bxc4 Bxc4 10. Qxc4 Na6 11. Nge2
{ Once again, with a good centre, control over a2-g8 which makes it difficult for Black to castle, and a better pawn structure, White has a healthy advantage. }

2... h6
{ This is one of Black's two main choices after 2. Bg5, with the other being 2... g6. 2... h6 seeks to exploit our bishop placement by kicking it around and expanding on the kingside quickly. This is a double-edged sword though, as the more pawns that Black pushes on the kingside, the more potential weaknesses that he creates. }
3. Bh4
{ Don't worry about getting the bishop trapped with ...g5 and ...f4 - Black can't do this due to problems on the h5-e8 diagonal, as we shall see. h4 is the most active square for the bishop and the only one which is really worth considering as it continues disrupting Black's development by preventing ...e6 and discouraging . ..Nf6. }
3... g5
{ Gaining space on the kingside and preparing to fianchetto the bishop on g7. }
4. e3
{ The point - Black can't take on h4 due to Qh5 mate. We could play e3 on the next move too, after Bg3. Another option for White here is 4. e4, but after I analysing both I ended up prefering 4. e3. }
4... Nf6
{ Dealing with the mate threat, and now the bishop on h4 is genuinely attacked so we must retreat of course. }
5. Bg3 d6
{ Covering f5 with the bishop, blunting our bishop on g3 and maybe preparing ...e5 in the distant future. }
6. h4
{ A very thematic idea - I already mentioned that the downside of Black rushing his kingside pawns forward is that it can leave weaknesses, and h4 is our way of trying to create one of those weaknesses. We want to get the f4 outpost for our knight, so we trying to force Black to play ...g4 by challenging g5 with h4. }
6... g4 { Black obliges and gives us the f4 outpost. } 7. Nc3
{ Just developing - other moves are fine too. } 7... Bg7
{ Developing normally. } 8. Bc4
{ Another decent move here, and a thematic idea to keep in mind, is h5. This has the benefit of taking h5 away from the knight and cutting off support to the pawn on g4, while ensuring that if we get the knight to f4, we'll also have another outpost available on g6. Despite this, I slightly prefer 8. Bc4 here - we prioritise development and prevent Black from castling. }
8... Nh5 9. Nge2 { I think it's important not to fear the ...Nxg3 exchange. }
9... e6 10. Qd2
{ As is typical in this line, we want to long castle and then prepare the e4 break. Qd2 does a good job of preparing both of these things. }
10... a6 11. a3
{ Castling long immediately is fine too, but this is a useful prophylactic move to insert first - we rule out ...b5-b4, and also free up the a2 square as a retreat square for the bishop. }
11... Qf6 12. e4
{ With Black's queen on f6, the immediate e4 break is particularly strong since Nxe4 comes with tempo now. We will look to long castle over the next couple moves. White went on to win in the correspondence game 1-0  (63)  Crabb,N  (2314)  -Hugo,T  (2123)  ICCF email 2014 }

In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6. 2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ... e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works there too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendations. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }
2... g6
{ The most popular move in this position and a very logical one. Of the three plans I mentioned that Black has in the Dutch - the Classical with ...e6, ... Nf6 and ...Be7, the Stonewall with ...d5, ...e6 and ...c6, and the Leningrad with ...g6 - it is the Leningrad with ...g6 which seems to be the least affected by our disruptive 2. Bg5. Black intends to complete development with ...Bg7, ...Nf6, ...O-O etc. but as we shall see, we are going to throw a spanner in the works very soon with a timely h4-h5 pawn storm. }
3. Nc3
{ For now, we just develop. Don't worry too much about blocking the c-pawn in these lines - we often castle long, meaning our pawn is better on c2 where it provides cover for our king, and moreover we are typically playing for the e4 and g4 pawn breaks. }
3... Bg7
{ The most common move and the most flexible way to get the pieces out. } 4. e3
{ Not the most common move - both 4. e4 and 4. h4 are more common - but I think it's a very strong one with a rather subtle point to it. We delay 4. h4 for the moment so that we can meet ... h6 with Bh4. We are in effect waiting for 4... Nf6 so that ...h6 later can be met by Bxf6. }
4... Nf6 5. h4
{ Now, with Black having committed to ...Nf6, it is the right time to launch our h-pawn down the board since ...h6 can be met by Bxf6. }
5... h6 { Forcing us to make a decision with the bishop. } 6. Bxf6
{ As I said already, this is the way we want to deal with ...h6 if there is a knight on f6. We don't want to retreat and give Black a chance to catch a breath - instead, we are playing quickly, forcefully and trying to develop an initiative. }
6... Bxf6 7. Qf3
{ Intending to play g4 later on. The queen is well-placed on f3 where it can support a kingside attack. We prevent Black from castling now due to the very strong h5 !. }
7... d6 8. Bc4
{ A good, active square for the bishop which also prevents Black from castling, }
8... e6 9. g4
{ This position was reached in the game 1/2-1/2  (33)  Teplyi,I  (2389)  -Kristiansen,J  (2411)  Aarhus 2015. White is doing clearly better here, but Black managed to hold. We intend to develop our initiative further with O-O-O and then Nge2-f4 next, targeting the weak g6 pawn. }

1. d4 e6
{ In the previous lines, we examined the Dutch Defence, starting with 1... f5. We met the Dutch with 2. Bg5 ! - I hope you agree with me when I think that it's a very strong and irritating move for Black to face since it is so disruptive. Many Black players think the same things, which brings us to this move: 1... e6. By playing 1... e6, Black hopes to reach the Dutch without allowing the 2. Bg5 idea from the previous chapter. Black is able to reach a kind of Dutch in this chapter, but the most dangerous option that he has available, the Leningrad Dutch, is no longer possible since Black committed to ...e6 already instead of ...g6. As a result, 1... e6 is often played by players who are happy to go into either a Stonewall Dutch or a Classical Dutch setup. 1... e6 is a typical choice of Black players who are equally willing to play the French. If you are happy to play the French, be my guest and transpose with 2. e4 - however, I'm not much of an 1. e4 player, so I think it's better that we keep the game in 1. d4 waters. As a result, we will be opting for 2. c4. }
2. c4
{ Ensuring that the game won't transpose into the French Defence, as it would after 2. e4. While the bulk of this chapter will be covering the transposition into the Dutch Defence with 2... f5, we will also be looking at the other options Black has tried here on move 2. Among those, the only two independent tries are 2... b6, transposing to some version of the Owen's Defence I believe, and 2... Bb4+ which is unnamed to my knowledge - it's in essence an accelerated version of the Bogo-Indian. Other moves like 2... d5, 2... Nf6 and 2... c5 are covered elsewhere - 2...d5 leads to the Queen's Gambit Declined chapters, while both 2...Nf6 and 2...c5 are covered in the 2nd part of the course. }
2... b6
{ This transposes to some kind of Owen's Defence. Black is looking to fianchetto his bishop on b7 and then fight for the vital e4 square with ...f5 and ...Nf6. Unfortunately for Black, he doesn't have any control over the e4 square for the time being, which is something we can take advantage of with our very simple next move. }
3. e4
{ Since we have the chance to, there's no reason not to grab the whole centre. With our 3 pawns in the centre, we fully control the middle of the board and have a lot more space - Black is on the backfoot already. }
3... Bb7 { Developing and hitting e4. } 4. Bd3
{ It's important to defend the e4 pawn in this way because we don't want to allow the annoying pin after 4. Nc3 Bb4 !. Black can try to exploit the downside of 4. Bd3, which is that g2 is left unguarded, by playing 4... f5, but this backfires spectacularly as we shall see. }
4... f5
{ This is very tempting, and it is actually Black's most popular move in this position, however it is definitely a mistake. I imagine many Black players were freestyling at this point already and noticed that g2 was hanging so they decide to exploit this pin by ramping up the pressure on e4. However, the pin isn't as ironclad as it seems. }
5. exf5
{ Concretely, things just don't work out for Black here - the weakness of the h5-e8 diagonal is much more important than whatever material Black might gain after ...Bxg2. Many Black players realise this at this point and try to bail with 5... Bb4+, which is a better try than the obvious 5... Bxg2, greedily grabbing the material. }
5... Bxg2
{ I'm not going to analyse this line to death because I don't think it's worthwhile - I'll show you the mainline and then a sample game of how play might proceed. White scores well over 65% in my database and should already be objectively winning, assuming he plays decently. }
6. Qh5+

2... Bb4+

3. Bd2
{ All three ways to block the check are viable, but this is my preference. 3. Nc3 was what I initially wanted to suggest, but Black isn't forced to transpose into the Nimzo-Indian with 3... Nf6 and can instead play 3... f5, 3... c5 or even 3... b6 - all of which score pretty well for Black. }
3... a5

4... d5 { Heading for a Stonewall, but quite a bad version of it for Black. }
5. Bf4
{ The difference is that our bishop is now outside the pawn chain. This means that we have one more piece fighting for control over the e5 square. The simple plan that I've followed in this positions is to land a minor piece on e5 - ideally one knight, supported by the other knight - and then cement it on e5 by playing f4. Inevitably, Black will probably take on e5 after which we can recapture on e5 with either the d-pawn - which would give us the d4-outpost - or the f-pawn in certain situations. When the time is right, we'll also capture Black's knight which lands on e4. The long-term strategic goal of White's here is to end up in a position where Black is left with his bad bishop on c8 against our good knight. As long as you follow this plan, or general positional principles, you should fare very well here. Black often relies on some sort of kingside counterattack to get play, but this comes across as speculative at best to me. Let's have a look at a possible line here: }
5... c6 6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. h3

Rc1 g5 11. Bh2 Qe8 12. Ne2

12... Qg6 13. Ne5 Nxe5 14. Bxe5
{ Possibly followed by f4 to secure the bishop on e5 and make sure that our king is safe. As you can see, as long as White plays decently, Black's kingside attack never really gets going and Black struggles in the long term positionally. }

{ This is Black's most popular move here and also the favoured choice of top players. It even got an outing from Carlsen who used it to win a rapid game against Aronian in 2016. Black's play is very logical - he is devoting all of his efforts to win the battle for the vital e4 square, with the knight on f6, pawn on f5 and bishop on b4 all doing their part. The downside to playing 4... Bb4 is that the bishop is effectively a goner - Black will at some point in the future be forced to take on c3 most likely, which could leave White with the bishop pair. }

13... Qxc3 14. Rxc3 Ne7 15. dxe6 dxe6 16. c5
{ Continuing with the plan of opening up the c-file. White has a pleasant edge here thanks to his well-placed pieces and Black's weaknesses - most notably, the e6 pawn and the c7 pawn are targets. White went on to convert in: 1-0  (45)  Bartel,M  (2569)  -Rendle,T  (2382)  Calvia 2006 }

{[%e@p 0,1,26,-14] îîHeaderStartîîIntroductionîîHeaderEndîî The idea behind
this chapter is to give you a very general, 'birds-eye' view of what both
sides are trying to achieve in the opening and middlegame for each of the
major openings and structures in this course. I think understanding this is
vital to being able to play the opening and middlegame successfully. Having
this knowledge means that even if you are taken out of theory or don't know
White's exact line, you will still have a general idea of what your goal is
and what you should be trying to achieve. Probably the most important aspect
to understand is the concept of the pawn break, also referred to as a 'pawn
lever' in Axel Smith's great book 'Pump Up Your Rating'. In this chapter I'll
be giving a quick rundown of what pawn breaks both White and Black are looking
to achieve in each opening, as well as any other general plans both sides have.
îîHeaderStartîîQueen's Gambit AcceptedîîHeaderEndîîWhite's Plans Maintain the
'perfect' d4-e4 pawn centre for as long as possible. Develop quickly, castle
etc. React accordingly to how Black decides to attack the centre. Against ...
c5 and ...Nc6, we'll play d5 sooner or later. Against ...Nf6, we go e5. And
against the main move, ...e5, we play Nf3 and let Black take on d4. In the ...
e5 line, f7 is a weakness. Piece play is the most important thing there. In
the ...e5 line though, after ...exd4, we can often march our e-pawn forwards
with e4-e5. Black's Plans Fight back in the centre in one of a number of
different ways: ...e5, ...Nf6, ...Nc6 and ...c5. îîHeaderStartîîQueen's Gambit
DeclinedîîHeaderEndîîWhite's Plans Minority attack with b4-b5. This is usually
supported by a rook on b1. Once the pawn ends up on b5, Black will most likely
be left with some kind of weakness. After bxc6, if Black recaptures with the
pawn, the c6 pawn will be left weak and backward, while the c5 outpost can be
exploited by our knight with Na4-c5. If Black takes on b5 or recaptures on c6
with a piece, then b7 and d5 are left weak. The central e4 break. This is
prepared with Bd3, Nge2, 0-0, Qc2, f3. Once we have all those moves played,
it's important to still not rush the e4 breaks. Two important preparatory
moves to throw in first are usually Rad1 (defending the d4 pawn which is
important once we play e4) and h3 (to cover the g4 square) . Black's Plans
Play solidly, without creating any weaknesses. Develop and trade off pieces. ..
.Ne4 to trade off pieces. ...Nh5 to trade off pieces. îîHeaderStartîîExchange
SlavîîHeaderEndîîWhite's Plans The pawn structure here is symmetrical, but
White is obviously slightly better due to his more active pieces and extra
tempo. To exploit this, we should be looking at unbalancing the position in
one of a number of ways: Nf3-e5. A standard knight hop. If Black takes it, we
will often recapture with the d-pawn since this gives us a space advantage,
kicks the knight on f6 away and gives us the d4 outpost for our knight. The
goal is to support the knight on e5 with a pawn on f4 and then launch a very
easy and crushing kingside attack. The Na4-c5 maneuver. If Black takes on c5,
we recapture with the d-pawn and get a queenside pawn majority and space
advantage. The e4 break. This is a little more risky and situational. It only
works well when Black is completely unprepared for it and White is much more
active - otherwise it can backfire and leave the IQP on d4 weak. Black's Plans
Trade off pieces, in particular the passive bishops. Queenside play with ...a6
and ..b5, followed by maybe ...Na5-c4. îîHeaderStartîîSlav
DefenceîîHeaderEndîîThe Slav defence encompasses a wide variety of different
structures and lines, so the plans for both sides are highly situational.
White's Plans The e4 break. If Black plays slowly, with ...a6, ...e6, ...Nbd7,
etc. then we should look to carry out the e4 break - preparing it with Bd3, b3,
Bb2, 0-0 etc. Against 4...a6 with 5...g6: at some point, if ...e5 isn't a real
possibility, we can play c5 to close the queenside and give us a space
advantage there, and then look to play the b4-b5 pawn break. Ne5 is the
standard plan we should be aiming for in lines with 4...g6 and 4...a6 whenever
e4 isn't a great possibility, which is typically when Black can play ...dxe4
followed by ...c5. It's not a pawn break, but one of the key ideas is to meet
the majority of Black's light bishop moves, like ...Bf5, with cxd5 followed by
Qb3. Black's Plans Meet a premature e4 break with ...dxe4 followed by ...c5.
Black plays for the ...e5 break. Sometimes, Black plays for the ...c5 break as
well. îîHeaderStartîîSemi-Slav DefenceîîHeaderEndîîWhite's Plans If Black
doesn't take on c4, the plan is similar to the Slav Defence: we prepare e4.
This is particularly effective if the Black dark bishop is on d6, since after .
..dxe4 Nxe4 the dark bishop is attacked. If Black doesn't take on c4 but puts
his bishop on e7, the e4 is less effective since Black can usually just play ..
.dxe4 followed by ...c5. In this case, we play Ne5 followed by f4 typically.
If Black does play ...dxc4, play becomes more concrete and I recommend
learning those lines and the nuances contained within well. Our play depends
on what plan Black goes for - 9...e5, 9...a6 or 9...b5. There are fewer
obvious pawn breaks for White to make, since they depend on what Black does.
Against 9...e5, we will usually play prophylactically with h3, a3, Ba2 etc.
Once Black goes ...h6, then we play Nf3-h4-f5. Against 9...a6, there are two
very important things to remember. Firstly, the standard counter to ...c5,
once Black plays it is Ne4. Secondly, if Black goes ...c5-c4, we want to break
down the pawn chain by playing the b3 break. Against 9...b5, play becomes
particularly concrete. The plan I advocate goes for 11.e4 and after ...e5, we
play dxe5 followed by Nd4 aiming to get the knight to f5. Black's Plans The ...
e5 pawn break is one of Black's key ideas. That's one of the reasons he put
his bishop on d6 - to prepare it. The ...dxc4, ...a6, ...b5, ...c5 plan is
very dangerous. If Black can get the ...c5 break in under good circumstances
where White doesn't know what he's doing, he can equalise or even get an edge
very easily. îîHeaderStartîîDutch DefenceîîHeaderEndîîWhite's Plans Our
general plan is dependent on what Black chooses on move 2. White will often
long castle and prepare the e4 break, with Qd2, Bd3, 0-0-0, f3 and eventually,
e4. Fighting for the f4 outpost in the ...h6 ...g5 line is important with the
h4 break. Against 2...g6, we are invited to rush our h-pawn down the board
with h4-h5. Sometimes, in addition to the e4 break, we have the g4 break. This
can be another very strong idea for White - take a look at some of the 2...g6
lines for example. Black's Plans Try not to get mated. If Black succeeds with
the first point, he might want to launch a queenside counterattack if we
castle long or prepare the ...e5 break with ...d6.} 1. Z0 *

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... e5
{ Black's most popular move here and probably also his best one. He fights for the centre by countering with one of his pawns while simultaneously preparing to develop his bishop actively to b4.   3...b5  The greedy option - Black refuses to believe that we can recoup the pawn and holds on for dear life.  4.a4 !  The standard motif of undermining the c4 pawn's support.  c6  Supporting b5.   4...Bb7 ?!  Black wants to win the e4 pawn, but we simply recoup our material and end up with a big lead in development after  5.axb5  Bxe4  6.Nf3  e6  7.Nc3  Bb7  8.Bxc4  ±  White's clearly better, thanks to his massive lead in development and space advantage. Next, White needs to get the rest of his pieces into the game - he can try targeting the c5 outpost with a knight with Na4-c5 later too.  5.axb5  cxb5  6.Nc3  Developing and attacking b5 again.  a6 !?  This move, with the interesting idea of an exchange sacrifice, is the reason 3... b5 is sometimes played by super-GMs. Objectively, I don't think it is anything too great, but it's certainly interesting.   6...Bd7  The natural and obvious way to defend b5.  7.d5 !  A great positional move, which scores exceptionally well for with around 80%! Black's complete lack of presence in the centre begins to tell as we simply expand. The idea behind 7. d5 is largely prophylactic - if ...e6 dxe6 is played, Black will either recapture with his bishop, leaving b5 unguarded or recapture with the pawn, which is very weakening.  e6  Immediately counterattacking in the centre and trying to get Black's pieces out.   7...a6  Overprotecting b5 to prepare ...e6.  8.b3 !  Exploiting the pin on the a6-pawn. After ...cxb3, we have Qxb3 followed by ideas like Nxb5.  e6  9.bxc4  Bb4  10.Bd2  ±  White has regained his pawn and his big centre gives him a clear advantage.  8.dxe6  Bxe6  ...fxe6 is met by Nxb5 ! with the point of Qh5+ winning back the piece.  9.Qxd8+  Kxd8  10.Nxb5  ±  We've regained the pawn and have a clear advantage due to Black's weak pawns and exposed king.  7.Nxb5  The only way to exploit 6... a6.  axb5  8.Rxa8  Bb7  Black's idea - he sacrifices the exchange for a pawn and some activity. I'm not convinced that it is nearly enough though.  9.Ra1  e6  10.Ne2 !  Only White's third most common choice, but a good one. We ignore the threat to e4 and simply develop. The knight is heading to c3 with tempo, where it can put pressure on b5.  Bxe4  11.Nc3  Bb4  Perhaps slightly better than 11.. .Bc6, but this active move does little to change the evaluation of the position.   11...Bc6  12.Be2 !  Developing - White exploits the fact that if Black grabs a second pawn on g2, we get a huge initiative.  b4  Kicking our knight back before winning the g2 pawn.  13.Nb1  Bxg2  14.Rg1  The rook is loving the newly-opened g-file.  Bd5  15.Nd2  ±  We will win the c-pawn soon, meaning that Black won't have nearly enough compensation.  12.Be2  With the same idea as after 12. Be2 - taking on g2 is quite poor for Black.  Qd5 ?!  was tried in 1-0  (47)  Wagner, D  (2564)  -Smeets, J  (2605)  Germany 2018 but it is fundamentally quite unsound. Better is 12... Nf6, but White is already quite a bit better here if he simply castles.  13.f3  Simply kicking Black's bishop back.  Bg6  14.O-O  and White went on to win quite comfortably in 1-0  (47)  Wagner, D  (2564)  -Smeets, J  (2605)  Germany 2018.   3...c5  Challenging White's centre is a logical thing to do. I think that 3... e5 is a better way to do it though since 3... e5 helps Black develop, whereas 3... c5 doesn't.  4.d5 !  Claiming more space.  Nf6  5.Nc3  e6  I think this is a safer and sounder way to play than 5... b5, but it also isn't challenging enough to equalise.   5...b5  As far as I know, this is called the Linares variation and it was recommended by Mineriva in her Chessable QGA course. This line enjoyed a brief period of popularity during the 2000s, but since then it has pretty much become extinct at the top level. The ways to counter 5... b5 have been worked out now and the chess elite have moved on to sounder tries.  6.Bf4 !  Black's idea is based on White taking on b5, but if White simply ignores that pawn and keeps developing Black has pretty much nothing here. The point was 6. Nxb5 Qa5+ 7. Nc3 Nxe4 and Black is a bit better. White's idea here is just to run Black over in the centre soon with e5 next. Note that the idea behind 6. Bf4 is to control c7, so that ...b4 can be met strongly by Nb5 ! threatening the Nc7 fork.  Qa5  The most popular move by far. 6... Qa5 is directed against our usual idea of 7. e5 since Black can now play ...Ne5. On the other hand, the queen on a5 is a bit vulnerable, which is something we will exploit.   6...a6  Covering b5.  7.e5 !  Our centre starts rolling.  b4  Black's whole idea is based on this counterattack, but it simply doesn't work well for Black concretely.  8.exf6  bxc3  9.bxc3  Nd7  Black wants to recapture on f6 with the knight.  10.Bxc4  Nb6  11.Bb3  gxf6  12.Qe2  ±  White is clearly better - Black is completely undeveloped and his kingside is in a shambles.   6...Ba6  Very similar to 6... a6, and we meet it similarly. The only difference is that after ...b4, the bishop on a6 protects the c4 pawn.  7.e5 !  Just like after 6... a6.  b4  8.exf6  bxc3  9.bxc3  gxf6  10.Nf3  ±  Black is a pawn up here over the previous variation, but this doesn't mean that he stands any better than in that line. Both of Black's c-pawns are hopelessly weak and will probably be picked off quite soon, while all the usual problems Black has here persist.  7.a4 !  As mentioned by Mineriva, this is pretty much the reason why GMs have given up on this line. We take advantage of the queen on a5 to break down Black's queenside pawn mass.  Nxe4  Black is two pawns up now, but this is very temporary.  8.Nge2  Supporting the other knight.  Nd6  9.axb5  Regaining one of the pawns with tempo.  Qb6  10.Ng3  Our idea is to put this knight on e4 after we take on d6.  Nd7  11.Bxd6  exd6  12.Qe2+  Recouping the second pawn.  Kd8  13.Qxc4  ±  This position was reached in the blitz game 1-0  (34)  Morozevich, A  (2750)  -Carlsen, M  (2801)  Moscow 2009. White's space and Black's exposed king give White a clear advantage.  6.Bxc4  exd5  We have two decent ways to recapture here: the pawn or the knight. Both are strong, so your choice here is up to you - 7. Nxd5 keeps some more pieces on the board while 7. exd5 gets a healthy edge in an endgame.  7.Nxd5  Instead of turning the e-pawn into a passed pawn, we decide that we will use the d5 square as an outpost.   7.exd5  is also a very good option. White wants to head into an endgame where he can take full advantage of his passed pawn.  a6  8.Nf3  Bd6  9.Qe2+  There are other ideas, but going into an endgame is best here.  Qe7  10.O-O  Qxe2  11.Bxe2  O-O  12.Nd2 !  White's position looks promising, but he needs to find a way to make progress, and this is his best option. The knight is heading to the standard outpost on c4 where it can attack Black's bishop and perhaps threaten Nb6 at point. Note that Black can't prevent this idea since the obvious ...b5 runs into a4, which becomes very weakening for Black very quickly.  Be5  Aiming to take on c3.  13.Nc4  Bxc3  14.bxc3  Nbd7  Note that the pawn on d5 is taboo. 14... Nxd5 15. Bf3 Nxc3 16. Nb6 Ra7 17. Be3 is dead lost for Black since even though he is temporarily two pawns up, his queenside is in a shambles.  15.Ne3  Covering d5 and preparing c4.  Ne4  16.c4  +=  White's bishop pair and protected passed d-pawn give him a comfortable long-term edge in this endgame.  7...Nxd5  8.Bxd5  The bishop is a thorn on d5. Taking with the pawn wouldn't be great here as it could be easily blockaded, stifling all of our play.  Be7  9.Ne2  The point of White's play - the knight heads to c3 where it can support d5.  O-O  10.O-O  Na6  Black wants to fight for d5 with ...Na6-c7.  11.Bf4  Nc7  12.Nc3  Nxd5  13.Nxd5  ±  White has a very comfortable advantage here thanks to his monstrous knight on d5. If Black ever exchanges on d5, then we get a dangerous pawn instead.   3...Nc6  I don't view this move, attacking d4, as a critical test of 3. e4, but it was recommended in the 2015 book 'Understanding the Queen's Gambit Accepted'. It is Black's third most common choice here, so we need to be prepared. Black's idea is to put rapid pressure on d4 with ...Nc6 and ...Bg4, forcing our centre to advance and overextend. I'm sceptical of how well this works concretely though.  4.Nf3  Defending d4. There's no need for the immediate d5.  Bg4  The most popular move by far, but it should transpose to the 4... Nf6 5... Bg4 line we already looked at in most cases.   4...Nf6  This is quite a bit rarer than 4... Bg4, but it should transpose in most cases.  5.Nc3  Bg4  Black has no real alternatives. 5... e6 is simply too passive and White automatically gets an advantage there.  6.d5  Now is the right time to advance our centre. 6. Be3 is fine too, but this is better.  Ne5  7.Be3 !  A relatively new idea of mine - or should I rather say, Lc0... This is exceptionally rare, and at the time of writing has only been played 6 times. 3 of those games were in 2018 and 2019 with strong players on the White side, showing that other users of Lc0 picked up on it too. The main move, 7. Bf4 has been played over 100 times, but I reckon 7. Be3 is better. The idea is rather interesting - if Black plays similarly to the 7. Bf4 main line and goes 7... e6, then we have 8. Qa4+ when Black can't block with his queen, as he would after 7. Bf4 Ng6 8. Be3 e6 9. Qa4+ Qd7, since the knight on e5 would hang. Also, Black does nothing, by playing ...a6 for example, White wants to play h3 next to forcing a capture on f3, after which we will have a massive pawn chain in the centre spanning f3-e4-d5.  c6  I think this is Black's best choice objectively, but White is better regardless. He chips away at our centre, just like after... .e6, but doesn't expose himself to that annoying Qa4+ idea.   7...a6  allows White to get the massive centre he dreamed of after  8.h3 !  Forcing a capture on f3, since after ...Bh5, g4 is a killer.  Nxf3+  9.gxf3  Bh5  10.Bxc4  White recoups his pawn with a massive centre and a lead in development. We can extend the line a bit to see how the play would continue:  e5  Black's best shot - he needs to get a foothold in the centre before it is too late.  11.dxe6  Taking play into a better endgame for White.  Qxd1+  12.Rxd1  fxe6  Taking on f3 leads to mate after 13. exf7+ followed by 14. Bc5#.  13.Ke2  Bb4  14.Bd4  +=  White has a pleasant edge here. This can be attributed to White's big centre, well-placed pieces and the weak e6 pawn. Our bishops put a lot of pressure on Black's queenside.   7...e6  Black plays similarly to the normal line after 7. Bf4. He logically begins chipping away at White's pawn centre. This is where the idea behind 7. Be3 becomes clear.  8.Qa4+ !  Fully exploiting the fact that ...Qd7, which would normally be Black's best option, is now not possible.  Ned7  9.h3  The standard idea, forcing ...Bxf3, which gives us the bishop pair and reinforces our pawn centre.  Bxf3  10.dxe6 !  An important finesse to throw in before we recapture the bishop. We don't want to be left with an isolated d-pawn after gxf3 ...exd5.  fxe6  11.gxf3  ±  White has a massive advantage here, thanks to his bishop pair, centre and Black's weaknesses and lack of development. Next, we'll regain the c4 pawn and possibly castle long.  8.dxc6  Again, we don't want to be left with an isolated d-pawn.  Qxd1+  9.Rxd1  Nxc6  10.Bxc4  We have regained our pawn and the material balance is restored. White is better here, but why ? Our advantage lies in our better development and more active pieces. Depending on how you look at it, we are 2-3 tempi up on Black here. This allows us to put Black under some pressure and turn our advantage into something more permanent, for example:  e6  Because of our superior activity, the more desirable ...e5 just ends up creating weaknesses we can exploit later - like on d5, for example.  11.Rc1 !  An important idea to remember. We step out of the pin so that we can pick up the bishop pair. Nd2 is the threat now.  Bxf3  Black needs to exchange now before his bishop gets locked out of the game forever with Nd2 and f3.  12.gxf3  We have gained the bishop pair which is already quite a big boon in this position.  Nd7  13.Na4 !  Next White begins targeting the c5 square.  Nde5  14.Be2  ±  White's bishop pair and queenside pressure give him a clear advantage. White will castle kingside next most likely and then can continue probing for queenside weaknesses with moves like Nc5.  5.d5  Once again, now is the time to play d5.  Ne5  6.Nc3 !  This move is relatively rare, just like my recommendation of 6. Be3 after 4... Nf6 5... Bg4. It is strong though - we are trying to transpose to that same line with Nc3 and Be3 that we play after 4... Nf6. In most cases, it should transpose but Black does have 2 independent options.  Nf6  A natural move and Black's most common choice.   6...Bxf3  I don't think voluntarily taking on f3 can challenge White at all. As we've already seen, that f3-e4-d5 pawn chain is quite potent.  7.gxf3  Black can't hold onto his pawn here due to f4 being on its way.  e6  8.f4 !  The knight gets caught in the centre with no attractive retreats.  Nd3+  9.Bxd3  cxd3  10.Qxd3  Qd7  11.Be3  ±  White regained his pawn with a big space advantage and went on to win in 1-0  (53)  Timman, J  (2575)  -Sprenger, J  (2498)  Helmond 2012   6...a6  Black wants to play ...b5, but this is too slow - we won't give him the chance.  7.Bf4 !  I apologise for the seeming inconsistency here ! Why have we been going Be3 in all lines, but now all of a sudden Bf4 appears ? The reason is concrete - Black has ideas of...e6 and ...b5 possibly, so we need to play a bit more forcefully now.  Ng6  8.h3 !  The point of our previous move - this works for concrete reasons.  e5  Black fights tactics with tactics.   8...Bxh3  Doesn't Black just win a pawn here ?  9.Rxh3  Even something like 9. Bg3 is better for White.  Nxf4  10.Bxc4 !  ±  The key move to remember here: ...Nxh3 is just losing because of Qa4+ !. White is just clearly better here and possibly winning - for example:  e5  11.Qa4+  b5  12.Nxb5  axb5  13.Qxb5+  Qd7  14.Nxe5  Qxb5  15.Bxb5+  Ke7  16.Rf3  +-  And Black can resign soon.  9.hxg4  exf4  10.e5 !  White's centre marches on !  b5  11.Qc2  Bb4  12.O-O-O  Getting the king safe and protecting d5.  Bxc3  White was threatening Ne4.  13.bxc3  ±  For the small cost of a pawn, White is positionally dominating with a massive centre. Just as a taster of the problems Black has, how does he develop his knight on g8 ? If it goes to e7, d6 is killer, while after ...Nh6 g3 ...fxg3 Qe4 ! with g5 next is also terrible for Black.  7.Be3  transpose directly into the line that was covered after 4. ..Nf6 5... Bg4.   3...Nf6  Together with 3... e5, I consider this to be one of Black's best objective tries. It is just behind 3... e5 in terms of popularity, but it received Caruana's backing when he used it a few times in rapid games in 2017. Black's idea is to attack White's centre, provoking e5 so that the knight can be planted on d5.  4.e5 !  This must be played - 4. Nc3 e5 ! equalises immediately.  Nd5  5.Bxc4  We get our pawn back.  Nb6  Black's most popular move by far.   5...Bf5  This move isn't nearly as bad as its rarity suggests. It is quite logical and has been tried by some strong players recently. Black pretty much asks the question - why can't he develop the bishop outside the pawn chain before playing ...e6 ? He justifies this by offering a pawn sacrifice on b7, as we shall see.  6.Qb3  Hitting d5 and b7.  c6  7.Ne2 !  The better, more practical decision I reckon. As we saw after 7. Bxd5, Black trades queens with that ...Qc8 idea which leaves him with good compensation in the endgame. The idea behind 7. Ne2 is to prevent the trade of queens with ...Qc8 since it protects the bishop on c1. Now Bxd5 followed by Qxb7 is a legitimate threat.   7.Bxd5 !?  Grabbing the material like this is the engine's choice, but I am sceptical of how good it is as a practical decision. As a result, I've included it, but it isn't my main recommendation.  cxd5  8.Qxb7  Qc8  Heading for an endgame.  9.Qxc8+  Bxc8  10.Nc3  e6  11.f4  +=  White's position is certainly a bit better here - he is up a pawn after all. However, practice has shown that it is not easy at all for White, as he has scored relatively poorly from here. Black has some interesting long-term compensation in the form of the bishop pair and Benko-style pressure on the queenside down the b- and c-files.  7...Qb6  Protecting b7 and offering the exchange of queens.  8.Qf3  Attacking f5 and d5.8. Qg3 is an option too, but I feel that it isn't as good because it doesn't protect the knight on e2. This becomes relevant in the line after 8... Bxb1 9. Bxd5 cxd5 10. Rxb1 Qa6 !.  Bxb1  9.Bxd5  cxd5  10.Rxb1  e6  11.O-O  We reach a standard French-like structure where White's extra space and lead in development gives him an edge.  Nc6  12.Rd1  Be7  was reached in 1-0  (34)  Pelletier, Y  (2555)  -Laznicka, V  (2667)  Batumi 2019 where White went on to win a nice game. I'd like to offer a small improvement with  13.Qg3  Black must take care here not to castle into the storm - i.e. ...O-O Bh6.  Qa6  14.Nc3  Kf8  15.a3  +=  Black's lack of co-ordination, awkward king position and White's space gives us the edge.   5...e6  Blocking in the bishop like this can hardly challenge White at all.  6.Nc3  Nb6  7.Bd3  d4 is indirectly defended by the Bb5+ discovered check of course.  Nc6  8.Nge2 !  This move is rarer than 8. Nf3 but I prefer it. It has the advantage of being able to assist in the fight for the d5 square later with Nf4, or possibly facilitate and f-pawn rush with f4-f5.  Bd7  9.Be4  ±  The bishop stands brilliantly on e4. White's extra space and strong centre allows him to manoeuvre around for a while now and prepare for play on the queenside with b4-b5 or even in the centre with d5.   5...Nc6  The normal square for the knight, putting pressure on d4.  6.Nc3  Nb6  7.Bb5  If White gets the chance, b5 is typically a better square for the bishop than d3.  Bd7  8.Nge2 !  Once again, I prefer this square over f3 on account of Ne2-f4 ideas.  e6  9.a3  Covering b4 and thus preventing any annoying ...Nb4 ideas.  Ne7  10.Bd3  Avoiding exchanges - exchanges favour the player with less space.  Bc6  11.O-O  Qd7  12.Qc2  Clearing the d1 square for our rook.  a6  13.Rd1  +=  As usual, White is a bit better here thanks to his space and centre. The usual b4-b5 idea applies here.  6.Bd3  This has begun to overtake 6. Bb3 in popularity in the last while. The bishop will be well-placed on e4 like we already saw in previous lines.  Nc6  7.Be3  Defending d4 - it's still taboo of course on account of that same Bb5+ discovered check.  Nb4  Chasing our bishop - Black has a concrete idea behind this.   7...Be6  is too slow and harmless. White gets a comfortable edge here.  8.Nc3  Qd7  Black intends to long castle.  9.Nf3  O-O-O  Long castling ramps up the pressure on d4, but the defence holds firm. On the other hand, Black's king on c8 could become quite shaky later on with a4-a5 ideas in the air.  10.O-O  Bg4  11.h3  Bh5  12.a4 !  ±  I like this idea here. White's usual queenside play is even more potent now the king as a target.  8.Be4  f5 !  This idea has to be played now before White has the chance to retreat his bishop to b1 after we go Nc3. Now, this is a critical position - White has 2 options: 9. exf6 and 9. a3. Before writing this course, I was only aware of 9. exf6, since it is much more popular and is recommended in other repertoires. Despite this, the more I analysed these variations, the more I came to like 9. a3. This assessment is supported by both practical results and engine analysis. I think that Black can get a decent position and equality after 9. exf6 if he knows some theory, whereas 9. a3 poses far more problems. It's easy to guess what my recommendation will be !   8...N4d5  This is quite rare and Black should be able to get an edge. Black is trying to erect a blockade on d5, but White can break this by quickly attacking that square.  9.Nc3  c6  10.Qf3 !  Hitting d5.  Be6  11.Nh3 !  Our knight wants to harass Black from either g5 or f4.  h6  Preventing Ng5.  12.Nf4 !  Breaking the blockade on d5.  Nxf4  Black has little choice - other moves lose here.  13.Qxf4  +=  White's space advantage and lead in development gives him a comfortable edge.  9.a3 !  Prior to my work on this course, I wasn't aware of this rather rare move - I had always automatically played 9. exf6. The fact that this move not only exists but is objectively strong and scores very well in practice came as a shock to me ! At the time of writing, White scores incredibly, with more than 75%! White meets the threat to his bishop with a threat of his own.   9.exf6 !?  I include this line to show what the positions look like here, although my main recommendation is 9. a3 of course.  exf6  10.Nc3  f5  11.Bb1  The pawn on f5 is a double-edged sword - it causes some weaknesses around Black's king and especially along the a2-g8 diagonal, but on the other hand it does an incredible job of restricting White's light bishop and ...f4 is a constant worry for White. The irritating thing for White here is that it isn't so easy to activate his light bishop - the natural idea of a3 and Ba2 doesn't achieve that much since Black will plant his knight on d5 and then fortify it with ... c6 and ...Be6.  N4d5  12.Nf3  Nxe3 !  In the last few years, the practice has shown that this works well for Black.  13.fxe3  Bd6  14.O-O  O-O  15.e4  Kh8 !?  ∞  This quiet move would be my suggestion for Black here, but the more popular 15... c6 works well too. I'd still choose White over Black, but I don't think we have any significant kind of edge here.  9...N4d5  Black's main move here.   9...fxe4  This was played by Karjakin against Kramnik in the 2014 Candidates tournament in one of the first major games in this variation. This has since been superseded by 9... N4d5 as the main move once people analysed and worked out that White is simply better here.  10.axb4  White is better here simply because it is easier to exploit the weak pawn on e4 than it is for Black to exploit the weak pawn on b4. The b4 pawn is useful, as we will see since it can cramp Black's queenside with b5.  Bf5  1-0  (39)  Kramnik, V  (2787)  -Karjakin, S  (2766)  Khanty-Mansiysk 2014 continued with 10... e6 from the previous position, but 10. ..Bf5 has been played a bit more since.  11.Nc3  e6  12.b5  Saving the pawn.  Bb4  13.Nge2  ±  The long-term weakness of e4 guarantees White a clear advantage.  10.Bxd5  10. Bxf3 is a bit more popular and also good, but I slightly prefer this move.  Nxd5  11.Ne2  White's advantage here is largely defined by the overextended pawn on f5. It's doubtful that we would have an advantage, let alone a large advantage, if the pawn was still on f7.  Be6   11...Nxe3  is not too dangerous - here we have a prime example where 2 knights best 2 bishops.  12.fxe3  White's knights dominate here, as they both have good squares available and the centre is closed.  g6  13.Nf4  Bh6  14.O-O  +=  Black's problem is that whenever he takes on f4, he is left with an unpleasant bad bishop vs good knight situation.  12.O-O  c6  13.Nbc3  g6  14.Qd2  +=  White got a big advantage in -  (74)  Kovalenko, I  (2650)  -Alekseenko, K  (2480)  St Petersburg 2014 but ended up, unfortunately, botching it. Qd2 introduces the idea of Bh6 at some point of course. Once again, the overextended f5 pawn is in White's favour. }
4. Nf3
{ 4. d5 doesn't work here - it weakens too many squares. White needs to develop and protect d4 with 4. Nf3. }
4... exd4
{ Very natural and the most common move.   4...Bb4+  This is quite a bit less common than 4... exd4, the main move, but it isn't bad at all.  5.Nc3 !  Please remember not to copy/aim for the mainline with 5. Nbd2 since Black can punish this with 5... c3 !.  exd4  6.Nxd4  If you love endgames, be my guest and play 6. Qxd4, but I think there is more of an advantage to be had after 6. Nxd4. We will look at 3 moves from here: 6... Ne7, 6... Nd7 and 6... Qe7. Note that all of these moves are designed to deal with White's threat of Qa4+.  Ne7  Preparing to meet Qa4+ with ...Nbc6.   6...Nd7  Blocking the Qa4 check idea.  7.Bxc4  Ngf6  8.f3  Simply covering e4.  O-O  9.O-O  Ne5  10.Be2  Qe7  11.Bg5  +=  White's control of the centre, space and active pieces give him a slight edge here.   6...Qe7  This deals with the threat of Qa4+ and also introduces a threat on e4.  7.Bxc4 !  It's important to remember here that the threat on the e4 pawn is not a real one. White gets too far too much play if Black decides to go pawn hunting.  Nf6  A normal, developing move.   7...Qxe4+ ?  Materialistic play does not go unpunished here.  8.Kf1  Bxc3  9.bxc3  Black's king in the centre, complete lack of development and vulnerable queen cause him a huge amount of problems. Here's an example of how difficult Black's position is between two famous players:  Be6  10.Qa4+  Nc6  10... Nd7 would be better, but Black is still struggling there.  11.Bg5  Preventing long castling.  Bxc4+  12.Qxc4  +-  Black resigned after just 4 more moves in 1-0  (16)  Shirov, A  (2655)  -Huebner, R  (2615)  Dortmund 1992  8.O-O  O-O  9.Re1  Covering e4.  Nbd7  10.Bb3  Prophylaxis against ...Ne5.  Ne5  11.Bg5  +=  Again, White is active and has good control of the centre. The future he might want to make use of the available outposts in the centre with Nd5 or Nf5.  7.Bxc4  Nbc6  8.Be3  O-O  9.a3  Picking up the bishop pair.  Bxc3+  10.bxc3  Na5  11.Ba2 !  This is rarer than 11. Be2, but I like this square for the bishop. Later on, in many lines, we will want to play on the kingside, and the bishop on a2 bares down on the a2-g8 diagonal.  b6  Threatening ...Ba6.  12.Qe2 !  Good prophylactic play against ...Ba6.  c5  13.Nb5  Ng6  White's a bit better here but went on to draw in -  (20)  Gelfand, B  (2685)  -Huebner, R  (2610)  Munich 1994. Here I'd like to propose a more ambitious plan than in that game, based on a kingside expansion involving h4-h5 and f4.  14.h4 !  +=  Black's knight on g6 is asking to be kicked around with tempo. White has many decent ideas here, like h4-h5 and f4-f5 possibly combined with Bd5 and c4 solidifying the bishop on the d5 outpost. }
5. Bxc4
{ Here there's another split in the road, with the two moves being 5... Bb4+ and the slightly more popular 5... Nc6. }
5... Nc6
{ Simple chess - protecting d4.   5...Bb4+  Black inserts a check now that we can't block with Nc3. The idea here is to either force White to block with a bishop, after which the trade supposedly favours Black, or block with the knight, after which the knight is a bit misplaced on d2.  6.Nbd2  This is quite a bit more popular than 6. Bd2, but it is quite a decent option as well. Keeping pieces on the board like this tries to prove the bishop on b4 to be misplaced as well.  Nc6  Normal development, protecting d4.  7.O-O  Nf6  A normal developing move, but Black's lack of any pawns in the centre means that we are free to kick Black's knights around.   7...Be6  We will see more of this idea later in the chapter, after 5... Nc6.  8.Bxe6  fxe6  9.Nb3  Attacking d4.  Qd7  Note that 9... e5 is not working due to 10. Nxe5 followed by the Qh5+ fork.  10.a3  Be7  11.Nbxd4  ±  White has a definite edge here thanks to the Black's lack of development, uncastled king and the weakness of the e6 pawn.   7...Qf6  An interesting multipurpose move, preparing ...Be6 or ...Bg4 if White goes Nb3 next. Unfortunately for Black, the queen is very exposed on f6 and White can exploit this.  8.e5 !  Wasting no time and kicking Black's queen back.  Qg6  9.Nb3  Bg4  Note that the crude attacking idea 9... Bh3 fails due to 10. Ng5, winning on the spot.  10.h3  Bxf3  11.Qxf3  ±  White has a massive advantage here thanks to his bishop pair, Black's uncastled king and lack of development.  8.e5 !  Grabbing space.  Nd5  9.Nb3  Looking to get the d4 pawn back.  Nb6  10.Bg5 !  The other big move here, 10. Bb5 should transpose, but this cuts out one or two extra options for Black. We develop our bishop with tempo, which forces Black to retreat and exchange his already-developed bishop.  Be7  11.Bxe7  Qxe7  12.Bb5  The most active square for the bishop. We want to recapture on d4 and then double Black's c-pawns if allowed.  Bd7  13.Bxc6  The immediate recapture with Nxd4 leads to an exchange of queens and at least equality for Black, so it's important to insert this first. We are playing for the initiative now. The idea is to use our knights to give Black a headache on the kingside before he gets his king to safety.  Bxc6  14.Nfxd4  Bd5  Black can't realistically allow the doubling of his c-pawns.  15.Qg4 !  White needs to play quickly and forcefully in order not to lose his advantage and even become worse. Our advantage consists of one tempo - we need to try to use that tempo to pose Black as many problems on the kingside as possible.  O-O   15...g6  is the other main move, but in most cases, it transposes to 15...O-O.  16.Rfe1  Covering e5.  O-O   16...Rd8 ?  Black should castle here, but I just want to show how easily Black can go wrong here:  17.e6 !  A powerful pawn break, blasting open the centre.  Qf6  18.Nb5  +-  With Nxc7+ next. White was winning in -  (87)  Dreev, A  (2683)  -Grischuk, A  (2671)  Wijk aan Zee 2002 but Black somehow survived.  17.Nf5 !  Laying siege to Black's kingside.  Qd7  18.Nh6+  Kg7  19.Qg5  Be6  20.Nc5  Continuing to play forcefully.  Qd8  21.h4 !  +=  An idea we'll see more of after 15...O-O - we pretty much have Black in a bind here. His dark squares around his king are chronically weak and the only way to get out of it in the long term is to exchange queens, but now by protecting the queen with h4 we ensure that the h7 pawn will become a serious weakness after the exchange.  16.f4  Grabbing space and protecting e5. White needs to cover the e5 pawn before continuing the attack with Nf5.  g6  The best way to deal with the Nf5 threat.  17.Nf5  Qd7  18.Nh6+  Kg7  19.Qg5  Black's dark squares are unbelievably weak.  Bxb3  20.axb3  Qd8  21.h4 !  +=  As we saw in the previous line, we secure the queen so that if they are exchanged, White has great play down the h-file. }
6. O-O Be6
{ This is Black's best and most popular try. He needed to find a way to deal with the very uncomfortable threat of Qb3, as we saw after the inaccurate 6... Nf6 and 6... Bc5.   6...Nf6  This looks natural but leads straight into problems.  7.Qb3 !  An important idea to remember - Black can't comfortably defend f7.  Qd7  Blocking the bishop like this is exceptionally awkward.  8.Bd2 !  Another important idea to remember, but this time it is prophylactic. Black was threatening ...Na5, because if Black manages to exchange White's light bishop there isn't much of an advantage left.  Ng4  9.e5 !  Continuing to play good, active chess. We can't allow a knight to plant itself on e5, so we put a pawn there - the point is that the pawn is untouchable due to Re1.  Qf5  Black tries to unravel.  10.Re1  Be7  11.Bd3  Kicking Black's queen back.  Qe6  12.Na3  The knight is heading to b5.  Qxb3  13.axb3  ±  Black is seriously struggling here and possibly losing. His pieces are in complete disarray, and h3 is coming next in conjunction with Nb5.   6...Bc5  This has the same downside as 6... Nf6 - it does nothing to combat Qb3.  7.Qb3 !  Once again, f7 is very difficult to protect.  Qf6  The queen is vulnerable on f6.  8.Bg5 !  Developing with tempo.  Qg6  9.Nbd2  Nge7  10.Rac1  Threatening discovered attacks on Black's bishop.  Bb4  11.a3  Bxd2  12.Bxd2  +=  White's activity and bishop pair is enough for a slight advantage here. }
7. Bxe6
{ The more I looked at this simple move with Lc0, the more I liked it. The main move is 7. Bb5 which leads to a slight, pleasant edge in an endgame for White, but I think that this is even better when played with the right idea, which will be revealed shortly.   7.Bb5 !?  There is nothing at all wrong with this move and it does lead to a slight edge in an endgame. It is the more popular choice and has been recommended in most White repertoires from this position, but I think my main recommendation of 7. Bxe6 can pose Black some fresh, interesting problems to solve. Here follows the mainline of my analysis:  Bc5  8.b4 !  The pawn is untouchable due to Qa4.  Bb6  9.a4  Threatening to trap Black's bishop on b6.  a6 !  Almost forced - ...a5 is playable, but not as good.  10.Bxc6+  bxc6  11.a5  Fixing Black's weaknesses on the queenside.  Ba7  12.Bb2  Simply regaining the d4 pawn.  Nf6  13.Bxd4  Nxe4  14.Bxa7  Qxd1  15.Rxd1  Rxa7  This position has been reached nearly 150 times. White is the one pushing, with Black's tragically weak structure on the queenside. White can try 16. Ne5 or 16. Nd4 here.  16.Ne5  is my preference.  Bd5  17.Re1  O-O  18.f3  Re8  19.Nd3  Nf6  20.Rxe8+  Nxe8  21.Nc3  Nf6  22.Kf2  +=  White's a bit better here and definitely can, and should, try to grind out the win - with accurate defence, Black should hold though, of course. }
7... fxe6 8. Qb3 { Forking b7 and e6. } 8... Qd7 9. Qxb7 Rb8 10. Qa6
{ We have regained our pawn now, but our queen is offside and Black has a chance to catch up in development. Despite this, our queen on a6 can prove itself useful, as we shall see... }
10... Nf6 11. Nbd2 { Covering e4. } 11... Bd6
{ The better square for the bishop, where it fights for control of e5.   11...Bb4  This doesn't seem great - I don't understand why Black would want to spend the time to exchange his bishop for the knight on d2.  12.Qd3  Protecting e4.  Bxd2  13.Bxd2 !  This is important to remember. We let Black pick up the b2 pawn since our activity will more than compensate for it.  Rxb2  14.Rac1  Of course, a2 is untouchable due to Qc4.  O-O  15.Rc5  ±  Followed by Rfc1 or maybe e5, with a clear advantage. White has a huge amount of compensation for the pawn. }
12. b3
{ An important idea to remember - the idea will be discussed on the next move. }
12... O-O 13. Ba3
{ This is the point and the reason why I recommended 7. Bxe6 ! Most players here opted for 13. Bb2, which does look very natural, but this is better. White's idea is rather easy to miss - while it might not seem like it, Black's c7 pawn is backward. The key defender of the c7 pawn is the dark bishop on d6, so that's why we play Ba3 - we want to exchange the defender of c7, and then pile up pressure on it by doubling rooks on the c-file. This simple plan is very difficult to combat and I think it guarantees White a good edge. Note that the d-pawn provides virtually no counterplay in this variation. Even if White's queen doesn't blockade it from d3, the knight will just sit on d2, ensuring that it doesn't go anywhere. }
13... Rb6
{ The more accurate way to play is to allow White to be the one to exchange bishops so that Black can recapture with his pawn on c7.   13...Bxa3  Black's most common move, but it seems to make it easier for White to carry out his plan of ganging up on c7.  14.Qxa3  Qd6  15.Qa6  Of course, we decline the exchange of queens.  Rb6  16.Qc4  Rb4  17.Qd3  Ng4  18.Rac1  The first rook has c7 in its crosshairs.  Nce5  19.Nxe5  Nxe5  20.Qc2  Attacking c7.  Rf7  21.f4 !  Booting the knight off its perch.  Ng4  22.Qc5  ±  Threatening Qxa7. After the exchange of queens, our rooks are free to target Black's pawn weaknesses on a7, c7 and d4 - White is clearly better here as a result. }
14. Qa4 e5 { Supporting d4. } 15. Rac1 { Nc4 is now threatened. } 15... Nb4 16.
Qxd7 Nxd7 17. Nc4 Rb5 18. Nxd6
{ We solve Black's problem of the weak c7-pawn, but our advantage is merely transformed. Our rook will reach the 7th rank and the pawn on d6 will stay weak. }
18... cxd6 19. Rc7
{ White's better here. Black will have to defend accurately to hold. White will kill Black's counterplay by taking on b4 and playing Nd2 to block the d4-pawn and protect e4, and afterwards set about exploiting Black's weaknesses. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... b5
{ The greedy option - Black refuses to believe that we can recoup the pawn and holds on for dear life. }
4. a4 { The standard motif of undermining the c4 pawn's support. } 4... Bb7
{ Black wants to win the e4 pawn, but we simply recoup our material and end up with a big lead in development after }
5. axb5 Bxe4 6. Nf3 e6 7. Nc3 Bb7 8. Bxc4
{ White's clearly better, thanks to his massive lead in development and space advantage. Next, White needs to get the rest of his pieces into the game - he can try targeting the c5 outpost with a knight with Na4-c5 later too. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... b5

4. a4 { The standard motif of undermining the c4 pawn's support. } 4... c6
{ Supporting b5. } 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Nc3 { Developing and attacking b5 again. }
6... Bd7 { The natural and obvious way to defend b5. } 7. d5
{ A great positional move, which scores exceptionally well for White with around 80%! Black's complete lack of presence in the centre begins to tell as we simply expand. The idea behind 7. d5 is largely prophylactic - if ...e6 dxe6 is played, Black will either recapture with his bishop, leaving b5 unguarded or recapture with the pawn, which is very weakening. }
7... a6 { Overprotecting b5 to prepare ...e6. } 8. b3
{ Exploiting the pin on the a6-pawn. After ...cxb3, we have Qxb3 followed by ideas like Nxb5. }
8... e6 9. bxc4 Bb4 10. Bd2
{ White has regained his pawn and his big centre gives him a clear advantage. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... c5
{ Challenging White's centre is a logical thing to do. I think that 3... e5 is a better way to do it though since 3... e5 helps Black develop, whereas 3... c5 doesn't. }
4. d5 { Claiming more space. } 4... Nf6 5. Nc3 b5
{ As far as I know, this is called the Linares variation and it was recommended by Mineriva in her Chessable QGA course. This line enjoyed a brief period of popularity during the 2000s, but since then it has pretty much become extinct at the top level. The ways to counter 5... b5 have been worked out now and the chess elite have moved on to sounder tries. }
6. Bf4
{ Black's idea is based on White taking on b5, but if White simply ignores that pawn and keeps developing Black has pretty much nothing here. The point was 6. Nxb5 Qa5+ 7. Nc3 Nxe4 and Black is a bit better. White's idea here is just to run Black over in the centre soon with e5 next. Note that the idea behind 6. Bf4 is to control c7, so that ...b4 can be met strongly by Nb5 ! threatening the Nc7 fork. }
6... Ba6
{ Very similar to 6... a6, and we meet it similarly. The only difference is that after ...b4, the bishop on a6 protects the c4 pawn. }
7. e5 { Just like after 6... a6. } 7... b4 8. exf6 bxc3 9. bxc3 gxf6 10. Nf3
{ Black is a pawn up here over the previous variation, but this doesn't mean that he stands any better than in that line. Both of Black's c-pawns are hopelessly weak and will probably be picked off quite soon, while all the usual problems Black has here persist. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }

I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations.

There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }

{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... Nc6
{ I don't view this move, attacking d4, as a critical test of 3. e4, but it was recommended in the 2015 book 'Understanding the Queen's Gambit Accepted'. It is Black's third most common choice here, so we need to be prepared. Black's idea is to put rapid pressure on d4 with ...Nc6 and ...Bg4, forcing our centre to advance and overextend. I'm sceptical of how well this works concretely though. }
4. Nf3 { Defending d4. There's no need for the immediate d5. } 4... Bg4

{ This move is relatively rare, just like my recommendation of 6. Be3 after 4... Nf6 5... Bg4. It is strong though - we are trying to transpose to that same line with Nc3 and Be3 that we play after 4... Nf6. In most cases, it should transpose but Black does have 2 independent options. }
6... a6
{ Black wants to play ...b5, but this is too slow - we won't give him the chance. }
7. Bf4

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.

6. Qb3 { Hitting d5 and b7. } 6... c6 7. Ne2
{ The better, more practical decision I reckon. As we saw after 7. Bxd5, Black trades queens with that ...Qc8 idea which leaves him with good compensation in the endgame. The idea behind 7. Ne2 is to prevent the trade of queens with ...Qc8 since it protects the bishop on c1. Now Bxd5 followed by Qxb7 is a legitimate threat. }
7... Qb6 { Protecting b7 and offering the exchange of queens. } 8. Qf3
{ Attacking f5 and d5.8. Qg3 is an option too, but I feel that it isn't as good because it doesn't protect the knight on e2. This becomes relevant in the line after 8... Bxb1 9. Bxd5 cxd5 10. Rxb1 Qa6 !. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... Nf6
{ Together with 3... e5, I consider this to be one of Black's best objective tries. It is just behind 3... e5 in terms of popularity, but it received Caruana's backing when he used it a few times in rapid games in 2017. Black's idea is to attack White's centre, provoking e5 so that the knight can be planted on d5. }
4. e5 { This must be played - 4. Nc3 e5 ! equalises immediately. } 4... Nd5 5.
Bxc4 { We get our pawn back. } 5... e6
{ Blocking in the bishop like this can hardly challenge White at all. } 6. Nc3
Nb6 7. Bd3
{ d4 is indirectly defended by the Bb5+ discovered check of course. } 7... Nc6
8. Nge2
{ This move is rarer than 8. Nf3 but I prefer it. It has the advantage of being able to assist in the fight for the d5 square later with Nf4, or possibly facilitate and f-pawn rush with f4-f5. }
8... Bd7 9. Be4
{ The bishop stands brilliantly on e4. White's extra space and strong centre allows him to manoeuvre around for a while now and prepare for play on the queenside with b4-b5 or even in the centre with d5. }

The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level.

3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... Nf6
{ Together with 3... e5, I consider this to be one of Black's best objective tries. It is just behind 3... e5 in terms of popularity, but it received Caruana's backing when he used it a few times in rapid games in 2017. Black's idea is to attack White's centre, provoking e5 so that the knight can be planted on d5. }
4. e5 { This must be played - 4. Nc3 e5 ! equalises immediately. } 4... Nd5 5.
Bxc4 { We get our pawn back. } 5... Nb6 { Black's most popular move by far. }
6. Bd3

7... Nb4 { Chasing our bishop - Black has a concrete idea behind this. } 8. Be4
f5
{ This idea has to be played now before White has the chance to retreat his bishop to b1 after we go Nc3. Now, this is a critical position - White has 2 options: 9. exf6 and 9. a3. Before writing this course, I was only aware of 9. exf6, since it is much more popular and is recommended in other repertoires. Despite this, the more I analysed these variations, the more I came to like 9. a3. This assessment is supported by both practical results and engine analysis. I think that Black can get a decent position and equality after 9. exf6 if he knows some theory, whereas 9. a3 poses far more problems. It's easy to guess what my recommendation will be ! }
9. exf6
{ I include this line to show what the positions look like here, although my main recommendation is 9. a3 of course. }
9... exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1
{ The pawn on f5 is a double-edged sword - it causes some weaknesses around Black's king and especially along the a2-g8 diagonal, but on the other hand it does an incredible job of restricting White's light bishop and ...f4 is a constant worry for White. The irritating thing for White here is that it isn't so easy to activate his light bishop - the natural idea of a3 and Ba2 doesn't achieve that much since Black will plant his knight on d5 and then fortify it with ... c6 and ...Be6. }
11... N4d5 12. Nf3 Nxe3
{ In the last few years, the practice has shown that this works well for Black. }
13. fxe3 Bd6 14. O-O O-O 15. e4 Kh8
{ This quiet move would be my suggestion for Black here, but the more popular 15... c6 works well too. I'd still choose White over Black, but I don't think we have any significant kind of edge here. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }

By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }

Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get.

 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4.

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop.

{ An interesting multipurpose move, preparing ...Be6 or ...Bg4 if White goes Nb3 next. Unfortunately for Black, the queen is very exposed on f6 and White can exploit this. }
8. e5 { Wasting no time and kicking Black's queen back. } 8... Qg6 9. Nb3 Bg4
{ Note that the crude attacking idea 9... Bh3 fails due to 10. Ng5, winning on the spot. }
10. h3 Bxf3 11. Qxf3

{ The immediate recapture with Nxd4 leads to an exchange of queens and at least equality for Black, so it's important to insert this first. We are playing for the initiative now. The idea is to use our knights to give Black a headache on the kingside before he gets his king to safety. }

{ Black can't realistically allow the doubling of his c-pawns. } 15. Qg4

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }
1... d5
{ Black decides to fight for the centre by occupying it with his pawn - the classical way of playing. }
2. c4
{ The famous Queen's Gambit. We put a second pawn near the centre immediately, attacking d5 and trying to lure Black's d5 pawn away so that we can get the perfect e4-d4 centre. White has many other possible ways to play instead of 2. c4, such as the Trompowsky, London, Colle, Colle-Zukertort, etc. However, it is generally agreed that these openings aren't nearly as critical or challenging as the principled Queen's Gambit, fighting for the centre.   I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }

4... exd4 { Very natural and the most common move. } 5. Bxc4

5... Nc6 { Simple chess - protecting d4. } 6. O-O Nf6
{ This looks natural but leads straight into problems. } 7. Qb3
{ An important idea to remember - Black can't comfortably defend f7. } 7... Qd7
{ Blocking the bishop like this is exceptionally awkward. } 8. Bd2
{ Another important idea to remember, but this time it is prophylactic. Black was threatening ...Na5, because if Black manages to exchange White's light bishop there isn't much of an advantage left. }
8... Ng4 9. e5
{ Continuing to play good, active chess. We can't allow a knight to plant itself on e5, so we put a pawn there - the point is that the pawn is untouchable due to Re1. }
9... Qf5 { Black tries to unravel. } 10. Re1 Be7 11. Bd3
{ Kicking Black's queen back. } 11... Qe6 12. Na3
{ The knight is heading to b5. } 12... Qxb3 13. axb3

I always believed that learning the critical mainlines like the Queen's Gambit is a better choice for long-term improvement than employing the d4 deviations. By playing critical lines, you put your opponent under pressure and often can get an edge straight out of the opening, especially if your opponent is not as familiar with the theory as you are. There's another benefit too - classical, principled openings like the Queen's Gambit can lead to many different types of pawn structures and positions, meaning it has higher chess educational value. All this doesn't mean that d4 deviations don't have their place - there are many situations where learning and playing these is a good idea, such as when you want to take your opponent out of theory and 'just play chess', or you are simply busy and don't have enough time to learn much theory yourself. In a nutshell, I highly recommend all ambitious players go for the critical variations, like 2. c4 - the Queen's Gambit. }
2... dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit Accepted, or QGA, is reached. This is the starting position for this chapter. I thought it would make sense to start this course by answering the simple question: what do we do if Black takes the pawn we just offered ? The Queen's Gambit is often said to not be a real gambit - White can pretty much regain the pawn at will in several ways. The idea behind the QGA is therefore not to win the pawn and keep it - instead, Black's idea is that while White spends time recouping the c4-pawn, Black will finish developing and equalise. The downside to 2... dxc4 though is obvious - Black has given up the centre, giving us exactly what we wanted. The QGA has been relatively out of fashion for quite a long time, both at the elite level and at the amateur level. This could be because in many lines White can head for a slightly better endgame relatively quickly and by force. However, it's popularity shouldn't necessarily be seen as an indicator of its objective merit - it's still a very serious opening and we need to be prepared for it, albeit I do think Black has an easier time equalising in openings like the Nimzo-Indian and the Slav. }
3. e4
{ This must be the critical test of the QGA. We take full advantage of Black's last move and claim the whole centre for ourselves. The other moves, 3. e3 and 3. Nf3, might be just as strong objectively, but they are more conservative and tend to lead to slightly better endgames for White relatively quickly. 3. e4 is the maximalist approach, going for the biggest advantage we can get. This is a major branching point and Black has 5 decent moves which are worth examining:   
 3... b5, trying to hold on to the pawn.    3... c5, challenging White in the centre.    3... Nc6, attacking d4.   3... Nf6, attacking e4. This, together with Black's next option, is Black's best reply as far as I can see.  3... e5, fighting for the centre and preparing to develop the bishop. This is Black's most popular move and probably also his best one. }
3... e5
{ Black's most popular move here and probably also his best one. He fights for the centre by countering with one of his pawns while simultaneously preparing to develop his bishop actively to b4. }
4. Nf3
{ 4. d5 doesn't work here - it weakens too many squares. White needs to develop and protect d4 with 4. Nf3. }
4... exd4 { Very natural and the most common move. } 5. Bxc4
{ Here there's another split in the road, with the two moves being 5... Bb4+ and the slightly more popular 5... Nc6. }
5... Nc6 { Simple chess - protecting d4. } 6. O-O Be6
{ This is Black's best and most popular try. He needed to find a way to deal with the very uncomfortable threat of Qb3, as we saw after the inaccurate 6... Nf6 and 6... Bc5. }
7. Bxe6
{ The more I looked at this simple move with Lc0, the more I liked it. The main move is 7. Bb5 which leads to a slight, pleasant edge in an endgame for White, but I think that this is even better when played with the right idea, which will be revealed shortly. }

{ The better square for the bishop, where it fights for control of e5. } 12. b3
{ An important idea to remember - the idea will be discussed on the next move. }
12... O-O 13. Ba3
{ This is the point and the reason why I recommended 7. Bxe6 ! Most players here opted for 13. Bb2, which does look very natural, but this is better. White's idea is rather easy to miss - while it might not seem like it, Black's c7 pawn is backward. The key defender of the c7 pawn is the dark bishop on d6, so that's why we play Ba3 - we want to exchange the defender of c7, and then pile up pressure on it by doubling rooks on the c-file. This simple plan is very difficult to combat and I think it guarantees White a good edge. Note that the d-pawn provides virtually no counterplay in this variation. Even if White's queen doesn't blockade it from d3, the knight will just sit on d2, ensuring that it doesn't go anywhere. }
13... Bxa3
{ Black's most common move, but it seems to make it easier for White to carry out his plan of ganging up on c7. }
14. Qxa3 Qd6 15. Qa6 { Of course, we decline the exchange of queens. } 15...

20... Rf7 21. f4 { Booting the knight off its perch. } 21... Ng4 22. Qc5
{ Threatening Qxa7. After the exchange of queens, our rooks are free to target Black's pawn weaknesses on a7, c7 and d4 - White is clearly better here as a result. }

1. d4
{ 1. d4 - known to some, perhaps, as the Anti-Berlin. I've played 1. d4 almost exclusively throughout my life and certainly don't regret it. Let's take a quick look at why 1. d4 and 1. e4 are so different:   
 1. e4 allows for quicker development of White's kingside since the bishop on f1 can move out immediately, which also means that White can castle faster after 1. e4.   The pawn adjacent to the d-pawn, on c2, can move to c4 without exposing White's king, unlike the f2 pawn after 1. e4.   
These two simple and obvious facts have wide-ranging implications for how the opening unfolds. Both 1. d4 and 1. e4 are played to achieve the 'perfect' pawn centre with d4 + e4, but they go about it in different ways. After 1. e4, White typically develops and castles quickly and then plays d4 after preparing it with c3. After 1. d4, the same idea wouldn't work - supporting e4 with f3 would expose our king. That's why we fight for the centre with 2. c4 ! The mirror opening after 1. e4, the King's Gambit, doesn't work nearly as well since it leaves the White king vulnerable on the e1-h4 diagonal. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development with ...Nf6, ...Be7 and then castle.   There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his own light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'.   In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 so as to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Be7
{ This is the 'refined' version of the Queen's Gambit Declined recommended by GM Colovic in his Chessable course on the QGD. For a long time, the Exchange Variation as played by Kasparov & co. was so challenging that many Black players tried to avoid it with this move order trick. The idea is to prevent White from playing Kasparov's favourite setup with Bg5, e3, Bd3, f3 and Nge2, as in the mainline after 3... Nf6. There is a downside to 3... Be7 though - our bishop can now go to f4 instead, where it is also well-placed. If we played our bishop to f4 after 3... Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4, Black can play 5... c5 ! which isn't possible now. By playing 3... Be7 Black wants to develop his bishop out to f5 in the Exchange Variation, but as we'll see, there are ways to take advantage of this.   3...a6  This is a funny little 'waiting' idea. The point behind it is quite similar to 3... Be7 - Black delays develop his knight to f6 so that we can't play Bg5 yet. This rare move has been picking up in popularity recently, and the reason is pretty simple - it's not nearly as bad as it looks !  4.cxd5  exd5  5.Bf4  Our play is very similar to the 3... Be7 line. We can't develop our bishop to g5, so we settle on the next best square - f4. Black has made a concession here to prevent Bg5 - the move ...a6 is in many cases not the best use of a tempo. Black's main idea here is to play ...Bd6 to trade our dark bishop and alleviate his space problems. Play develops very similarly to GM Colovic's recommendation of 3... Be7 followed by 5... c6 and 6... Bd6. The only real difference is the inclusion of the move ...a6.  c6  The more flexible way to play. Black ensures that we will have no choice but to exchange on d6 once Black plays ...Bd6, by delaying ...Nf6 even more and thus preventing Bg5.   5...Nf6  6.e3  Bd6  Black uses the standard idea in this position and offers a trade of dark bishops. However, with the knight on f6 now, we don't necessarily have to oblige.  7.Bg5 !  Taking on d6 is also fine, but I think keeping more pieces on gives us a better chance for an advantage here.  Be6  8.Bd3  O-O !  This is surprisingly rare and it has only been played around 4 times out of 30 or so games, however, I think it's the most natural as well as the best option that Black has.   8...Nbd7  Black's most common move by far, which is quite surprising to me. I think it's a bit inaccurate though on account of our next move...  9.f4 !  Threatening f5, trapping Black's bishop on e6. With the knight in the way on d7, the bishop on e6 is critically short of retreat squares. The possibility of this move is the reason why I think that 8...O-O is more accurate.  h6  10.Bh4  g5  Black's only way to justify his play - he temporarily sacrifices a pawn to open up the h-file and thus regain his pawn, while dealing with the threat of f5.  11.fxg5  hxg5  12.Bxg5  Rxh2  With the h-file opened, Black recoups his pawn.  13.Rxh2  Bxh2  14.Nge2  ±  This position was reached relatively recently in a top-level game which White went on to win: 1-0  (69)  Yu, Y  (2762)  -Fedoseev, V  (2707)  Danzhou 2018. Both sides have pretty damaged pawn structures, however, White is better placed to take advantage after castling long.  9.Nge2  h6  10.Bh4  Not surrendering the bishop pair unnecessarily, of course.  Re8  11.h3  A standard prophylactic move which we'll come to see again, and again, in the next couple of chapters. In this case, if we castled immediately, we'd fall victim to Black's tactic of ...Bxh2+ followed by ...Ng4+.  Nbd7  12.O-O  c6  13.Qc2  +=  With the plan of Nf4xe6 in the future. The usual downside to having a bishop on e6 is this plan of Nf4.  6.e3  Bd6  Forcing the exchange of dark bishops. Even though Black is exchanging his 'good' bishop, he reckons this doesn't matter - exchanges tend to favour Black here since he has a bit less space. Moreover, he intends to follow up by exchanging his other bishop by getting ...Bf5 in somehow.  7.Bxd6  Qxd6  8.Bd3  Ne7  The point - Black wants to exchange his 'problem piece' on c8 with ...Bf5.  9.Qc2 !  Naturally, we can't allow this - if Black gets to exchange light bishops without making any concession, he should be fine.  g6  Black insists on forcing ...Bf5 - this is a concession though. It might not be apparent now, but the f6 square is weakened - later on, once we get our e4 break-in and maybe land with a knight on e4, this weakened square could become an issue.  10.Nge2  Bf5  11.O-O-O !  One of the downsides to this whole exchanging strategy of Black's with ...Bf5 and ...Bd6 is that it takes time. White gets a lead in development, and if he can use this to develop an initiative he should, of course, be better. By long castling, we signal our intention of opening up the position later with e4.  Bxd3  12.Rxd3  +=  with e4 next, opening up the position to our advantage. Our lead in development gives us an edge.   3...Bb4  This is relatively rare - Black is aiming to transpose into a Ragozin after 4. Nf3 Nf6. The problem for Black is that we aren't forced to play like this.  4.a3  There are other ways to play, but I think this makes the most sense in conjunction with my main recommendation against the Nimzo-Indian in the second part of this course.  Bxc3+  5.bxc3  Ne7  This is an independent option, but I don't really see any advantage in having the knight on e7 as opposed to f6.   5...Nf6  is the main move, but it isn't really an independent option. After  6.f3  we transpose to the chapters covering the Nimzo-Indian, which are included in the second part of this course. There are other moves in this position, like 6. e3, but I think practically speaking it makes most sense just to transpose. 3... Bb4 is relatively rare, and the positions we get after 6. f3 are more than good enough.  6.e3  O-O  7.Bd3  c5  8.cxd5  exd5  9.Ne2  +=  This structure is known to be good for White. The tension in the centre favours White. Long-term, we are looking to play the e4 break in the centre, after preparing it with f3. This has the benefit of freeing our poor dark bishop on c1 and setting the foundation for a kingside attack after e4-e5. Black lacks easy counterplay - .. .cxd4 does nothing, while ...c4 just strengthens the e4 break. }
4. cxd5 { Keeping in style with the Exchange Variation after 3... Nf6. } 4...
exd5 5. Bf4
{ As mentioned before - since the g5 square isn't available, we put our bishop on f4 instead. Black has 2 moves here, which can easily transpose: 5... c6 and 5... Nf6. }
5... c6
{ This flexible move is more popular than 5... Nf6.   5...Nf6  Since these moves can transpose very easily, we will cover all the lines here where Black doesn't opt for ...c6 at some point.  6.e3  Natural, preparing to get the bishop out. Note that 6... c6 here would transpose to 5... c6.  O-O   6...Bf5  Quite natural, but as is typical of developing the bishop to f5 in the Queen's Gambit and Slav, it leaves the b7 pawn vulnerable.  7.Qb3 !  Taking advantage of the unprotected b7 pawn and putting pressure on both d5 and b7.  Nc6 !  Black has no natural way to cover b7, so he decides to sacrifice a pawn.  8.g4 !  Deflecting the knight or the bishop from their positions.  Nxg4  The knight has been deflected, leaving d5 exposed.   8...Bxg4 ?!  has only been played a couple of times, but it is unclear at first why it is bad.  9.Qxb7 !  Nb4  10.Rc1 !  Now the reason behind the mysterious 8. g4 becomes clear ! Black can't castle here since after 11. a3 his knight is trapped ! This wouldn't be the case with the bishop still on f5, which is why we played g4.  Rb8  11.Qxc7  Qxc7  12.Bxc7  Rb7  13.Be5  ±  Black lacks compensation for the pawn here.  9.Qxd5  Qxd5  Black doesn't want to risk an attack and heads for the endgame.   9...Qc8  Protecting f5.  10.Qg2  O-O  11.O-O-O  +=  White is definitely for choice here thanks to his good control of the centre and easy play on the kingside and down the g-file.  10.Nxd5  Bb4+  11.Nxb4  Nxb4  Watch out for ...Nc2+.  12.Rc1  c6  13.a3  Kicking the one knight back.  Nd5  14.h3  Ngf6  15.Be5  +=  White has a slight edge thanks to his bishop pair and control of the centre. Next, White should bring his kingside into the game, e.g. Ng1-e2-c3 and Rg1.  7.Bd3  c5  Black's only real independent choice here. 7... c6 would transpose to 5... c6 of course. I am sceptical of ...c5 here, at least this early. Black can't afford to be saddled with an IQP, so he will have to play ...c4 at some point which comes with its own issues.  8.Nge2  Taking on c5 immediately is possible, but then Black might have a chance to quickly exchange his IQP with ...d4.  Nc6  9.O-O  c4  Black decides that he would rather not risk an IQP position, however, ...c4 is a very double-edged move in situations like this. On the one hand, Black gets some space and play on the queenside, but on other, c4 often becomes a target to White's b3 and also the central break e4 gains in strength significantly.   9...cxd4  This looks like a simple equaliser, but that's far from the case.  10.Nxd4  Nxd4  11.exd4  It seems like Black has fully equalised here with the symmetrical pawn structure, but there is a key difference in each side's pieces here: White is far far more active and has enough time to put Black's d5 pawn under some serious pressure, for example:  Be6  12.Nb5  Threatening an invasion on c7, but other, slower approaches are possible too, like h3.  Ne8  13.Rc1  Reinforcing the idea of Nc7.  a6  14.Nc7  Nxc7  15.Rxc7  +=  White's activity and initiative give him an edge.  10.Bc2  a6  Black prepares to expand on the queenside with ...b5.  11.b3 !  Chipping away at the c4 pawn. The point is to force ...b5, so after we exchange on c4 the e4 break becomes very strong.  b5  12.bxc4  bxc4  13.h3  +=  White has a comfortable edge here. Black's protected passed c-pawn is clearly blockaded and going nowhere. White will be playing for the e4 break here with moves like Be5, f3 etc., after which the c4 pawn will become very vulnerable. }
6. e3
{ This is a major branching point in the 3... Be7 QGD. We will look at 3 options Black has:   
 The very natural developing move 6... Nf6 is not too challenging. I think White can get a comfortable edge here - the placement of our bishop has some advantages which will be explained later.    6... Bd6 is an ultra-solid option recommended by Colovic in his QGD repertoire on Chessable. Black's idea is vacuum the bishops off the board after ...Ne7 and ...Bf5 later, equalising.    6... Bf5 was the main idea behind 5... c6. With the d5 pawn protected, Black is seemingly free to develop his bishop actively to f5. This is the mainline and most challenging variation in the 3... Be7 QGD. }
6... Bf5
{ Black's main and most critical choice and the point behind 5... c6, delaying ... Nf6. Much like after Colovic's 6... Bd6, if Black gets to exchange light bishops, he equalises.   6...Nf6  As mentioned, this is natural but not too challenging and of Black's 3 options, this is the rarest. Our play here is quite similar to the 3... Nf6 mainline, with the exception that we put our knight on f3 instead of e2 and play for the minority attack. The advantage of having the bishop on g5 instead of f4 is that it is a bit less vulnerable and harder to exchange with ...Nh5 for example. Now, after h3, ...Nh5 can be met by just dropping the bishop back to h2.  7.Bd3  O-O   7...Nbd7  is another move order instead of 7...O-O, but it should just transpose.  8.h3  The only thing to keep in mind here is that 8. Qc2 and 8. Nf3 are premature since Black can exchange our dark bishop with ... Nh5.  Nf8  9.Nf3  Ng6  10.Bh2  with a transposition to 7...O-O.  8.Qc2  The usual square for the queen.  Nbd7  9.Nf3  Our usual plan of Nge2 and f3 is not as effective here, so we switch gears and go into Minority Attack mode. Our plan is simply to castle short and then later launch the b-pawn down the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on Black's queenside.  Re8  10.h3  Securing a retreat square for our bishop.  Nf8  11.O-O  Ng6  12.Bh2  Of course, we can't let Black's knight take our bishop.  Bd6  This has been Black's plan almost exclusively.  13.Bxd6  Qxd6  14.Rab1 !  The beginning of the minority attack - the rook supports the b4-b5 lever.  Bd7  Black's most common move.   14...a5  Black tries to stop our minority attack before it gets going, but this comes at a cost of creating weaknesses for us without provocation - b6 and c5 are now more appealing than ever for our knight.  15.a3  Qe7  Black is preparing ...Ne4.  16.Na4  The immediate b4 looks good too. Our knight is heading for b6.  Ne4  17.Nb6  Rb8  18.b4  axb4  19.Nxc8  The immediate recapture on b4 is fine as well.  Rbxc8  20.axb4  Nd6  21.b5  +=  White's minority attack is well underway. Black is going to get a weakness on the queenside one way or another.  15.b4  b4-b5 is coming.  Rac8  Black prepares for the b5 eventuality.   15...a6  A common move to prevent the impending b5 break, but sometimes the cure is worse than the disease - c5 and b6 are badly weakened by ...a6.  16.Na4  Heading for c5.  Ne4  17.Nc5  +=  White has a dominant grip on the queenside here. Generally, in situations like this with ...a6, kicking White's knight away with ...b6 is clearly not possible since a6 would hang. Also, taking the knight on c5 is also terrible since White recaptures with the b-pawn, leaving the b7-weakness as good as dead.  16.Rfc1  Getting White's pieces into position before executing the b5 break.  Qe7  17.Qb2  +=  Stepping out of Black's rook's way. White is now ready to play b5. Black can meet b5 in a number of ways, but none of them are too promising: 1. Taking on b5. This leaves d5 and b7 weak. 2. Letting White take on c6 and then recapturing with the pawn. This leaves c6 weak and gives White a huge outpost on c5.3. Black pushes past and plays ...c5, but after dxc5 Black is left with a bad IQP.   6...Bd6  Colovic's recommendation has only been played 300 or so times, but it needs to be taken seriously. Black's idea is very positional: he exchanges dark bishops immediately in order to free up the e7 square for his knight. From e7, the knight supports ...Bf5 - if this all goes down without a hitch, Black gets to exchange his 'problem bishop' on c8 and should equalise comfortably. The downside to this though is that Black is moving his bishop twice, meaning that he is bound to fall further behind in development.  7.Bxd6  Qxd6  8.Bd3  Ne7  As mentioned before, the knight is best here in order to support ...Bf5. If Black can play ...Bf5 without some sort of concession, he should be fine.   8...Nf6  is just inconsistent with 6... Bd6. White just gets a good version of the normal QGD Exchange Variation here and this shows, since in practical play he scores around 75%!  9.Nge2  We have time here to play our usual plan from 3... Nf6 of Nge2, f3, O-O, Qd2 with the idea of e4 later.  O-O  10.Qd2  The queen is better here than on c2 now since it is important that e3 is protected in preparation for f3.  Re8  11.f3  +=  White can castle or play Kf2 next, protecting e3, depending on how Black responds and follow up by expanding on the kingside and in the centre.  9.Qc2 !  Knowing that ... Bf5 is threatened, this must be played of course.  b6  Colovic's recommendation and Black's main move has received the backing of some top players including Topalov and Jakovenko. Black scraps the idea of exchanging light bishops with ...Bf5 and instead wants to exchange them with ...Ba6 now. This is also a small concession though since the c6 pawn is something we can target later.   9...Qf6  is one way to try and force ...Bf5 in, but this is simply too slow - Black has already spent an extra tempo moving his dark bishop. This move is the rarest option we'll look at.  10.Nf3  10. f3 is another possibility, which is just as good or maybe even better.  Bf5  11.e4 !  Opening up the position and preventing the exchange of light bishops.  dxe4  12.Nxe4  Bxe4  13.Bxe4  Nd7  14.O-O  +=   9...g6  is another way to prepare ... Bf5 but it falls flat for a similar reason to 9... Qf6 - it is too slow.  10.f3  Preparing to meet ... Bf5 with e4.  O-O  11.Nge2  Nf5  12.Qd2  ±  White will play e4 soonish with a clearly better position.  10.Nf3  There is no way to prevent ...Ba6, so we just focus on finishing our development. Black will succeed in exchanging light bishops, but we hope that our lead in development and the slight vulnerability of c6 gives us an edge.  Ba6  11.O-O  Bxd3  12.Qxd3  O-O  13.Rac1  Naturally, we are going to double up our rooks on the c-file to put maximum pressure on c6. There is a more popular alternative though in the form of 13. e4 here, but I prefer this. 13. e4 seems a bit too committal to me here - I prefer the slower approach here of piling up on the c6 pawn.  Nd7  14.Rc2  Rfd8  This was Colovic's improvement and it does seem to be better than 14. ..Qg6.   14...Qg6  was played a couple of times, including once by Kasimdzhanov. I'm doubtful that the exchange of queens alleviates Black's problems here.  15.Qxg6  hxg6  16.h4 !  +=  A nice move, putting a clamp on Black's queenside. White can definitely push for the win here safely. We have a relatively straightforward plan: Rfc1, Ne1-d3, Ne2-f4 and if allowed, Nb4. Black has no counterplay so White can take as much time as he likes improving his position and expanding on the kingside as well.  15.Rfc1  Nf8  16.Qa6  Ne6  17.Ne1 !  Colovic only analyzes 17. Ne5, but this seems to be a clear improvement. 17. Ne1 wants to get the knight to d3, just like 17. Ne5, but 17. Ne5 can be met comfortably with ...c5 after which we can't take on c5 since the knight on e5 would hang.  c5  This isn't forced, but if Black doesn't go for it he is looking to fight for the draw with no end in sight.  18.dxc5 !  Of course, this is impossible with a knight on e5.  bxc5  19.Qxd6  Rxd6  20.b3  +=  White's got a very nice endgame where he can safely grind for the win. Black's hanging pawns are very vulnerable, in particular c5. }
7. g4
{ Getting a bishop to f5 so early in the QGD would normally be a huge success, but it comes at a cost as well ! White's extra flexibility allows him to kick the bishop away with g4 and grab space on the kingside. This kingside expansion is double-edged since there is the risk of overextending, but it is White's best chance of an opening advantage here. It has received the backing of most top players here and it scores very well too, with nearly 65%. Black has 2 logical retreats here: g6 and e6. }
7... Be6
{ The better retreat, as the bishop isn't at risk of getting trapped by h4-h5. White seems to have 3 decent options for an edge here: 1. The ambitious 8. h4, offering a pawn sacrifice. 2. The more conservative 8. h3, which seeks to consolidate the space on the kingside. 3. The rare 8. Qb3, hitting b7.   7...Bg6  This seems to be less accurate than 7.. .Be6 as well as less popular. The problem for Black here is that the bishop is actually in the way - it becomes a target of White's rolling kingside pawns.  8.h4  Threatening h5. As we will see, the pawn on h4 is untouchable.  h6  Securing the bishop's escape square on h7.   8...Bxh4 ??  This has been played a few times, but Black is dead lost here:  9.Qb3 !  Black can't protect b7, so he has to advance.  b6  10.Rxh4 !  The killer blow. Everything falls apart for Black.  Qxh4  11.Nxd5  cxd5  12.Bb5+  Nd7  13.Bxd7+  Kf8  14.Qxd5  +-  Black can resign soon.   8...h5  Black stops our kingside advance in its tracks.  9.g5  Bd6  10.Nge2  Intending to recapture on f4 with the knight.  Ne7  11.Bh3 !  This is quite an aesthetic novelty by the engine. White is fighting for control over f5, with the idea of playing Ng3, attacking h5.  Bf5  This makes sense - exchanging Black's bad bishop, but White's second idea behind 11. Bh3 becomes clear now.  12.Bxf5  Nxf5  13.Ng3 !  White invites exchanges to open the f-file.  Nxg3  14.fxg3  ±  This is quite a strange position, but White is clearly better thanks to the weakness of the h5-pawn and easy play down the f-file and in the centre.  9.Bd3 !  N  A novelty and I believe a strong one. White forces the exchange of bishops while the bishop is on g6. The most common move is 9. h5 and then 10. Bd3.  Bxd3  10.Qxd3  Qd7   10...Bxh4 ?  is bad once again:  11.Nf3  Be7  12.O-O-O  ±  followed by g5 with a huge attack.  11.Nge2 !  White ignores the threat to g4.  Qxg4   11...Nf6  just allows White to solidify his space advantage with  12.f3  ±  White's space gives him a comfortable edge - next, he can bring his knight to f5 maybe via g3.  12.Rg1  White picks up the g7 pawn.  Qxh4  13.Rxg7  Nd7  14.Rg1  +=  White has more than enough compensation for the pawn and a comfortable edge. An interesting little tactic which shows how difficult it is for Black to unravel is as follows:  O-O-O ??  15.Nb5 !  +-  And Black can resign. }
8. Qb3
{ I have made this my main choice for a couple of reasons. It seems like it leads to a relatively risk-free edge for White, at least after the most common reply ...Qb6, whereas 8. h4 seems quite murky and unclear. 8. Qb3 also has the benefit of being rarer and less explored, so opponents will be less prepared for it. It has been played by some very strong GMs as well, including Kramnik in 2018's Candidates tournament against So.   8.h4 !?  This is White's most popular move and a decent choice but not my main recommendation. Regardless, let's have a quick look at why I think Black should be fine here.  Nd7  Ignoring the pawn on h4.  9.g5  h6  10.g6  fxg6  11.Bd3  Bf7  12.Qc2  Ngf6  13.O-O-O  Stockfish somewhat likes White's position a bit, but Leela doesn't approve, and Stockfish comes around a bit later too. Black should be fine here with decent play, for example  O-O  14.Nge2  Ng4  Hitting f2 and h4.  15.Bg3  Ndf6  ∞  It's difficult for White to breakthrough on the kingside with Black's fantastic knights, while Black will start getting his kingside play underway with ...c5 next. As a result, I prefer 8. Qb3. }
8... Qb6
{ 8...b5  is a bizarre-looking move, but the engine's top choice. It seems to create quite a few weaknesses on the queenside like the c6 pawn, but when you look a bit deeper it isn't so clear how these can be exploited immediately. Regardless, exploit it we will try: our general plan here will be to complete development and then put some pressure on the backward c6 pawn - and if Black advances ...c5, we get to play against the isolated d5 pawn. This move has been played twice at the time of writing - both times in 2018 by strong GMs. I think this could be a critical test of 8. Qb3 and maybe even 'best play' all the way from 3... Be7. The first thing to realise now is that White's g4 pawn is hanging - we need to find a way to deal with that.  9.h3  This seems to be the more natural way to cover g4. In the other game, White opted for 9. Qd1 instead.  Nd7  10.Nf3  In addition to our stem game of Sargissian - Meier, we have transposed into a top-flight battle between Svidler and Mamedyarov in 2014, which White won. This is a critical position for Black where he needs to find a way to unravel and develop his kingside - if I were championing the Black side here, I'd start by looking for improvements from this position.  Ngf6  is natural but allows the Ng5 hop.   10...h6  was played by Mamedyarov to prevent Ng5 after ...Nf6, but this might just be a bit too slow.  11.Bd3  Ngf6  12.Qc2  Rc8  13.O-O  b4  1-0  (36)  Svidler,P  (2732)  -Mamedyarov,S  (2764)  Baku 2014 CBM 163  14.Na4 !  ±  Since Black's only active plan here is ... c5, Na4 ensures that when that break comes we exchange some pieces, which leaves the future IQP on d5 even weaker.   10...a6  was played by Meier, supporting b5, but I think White should be better here too.  11.Bg2  Ngf6  12.Ng5 !  Since Black didn't play h6 like in the Svidler game, we now have this option, attacking e6.  Nf8  A rather sad move to be forced to make.  13.O-O  +=  White has a definite edge here with easy play down the c-file and the opportunity to pick up the bishop pair when he feels like it with Nxe6.  11.Ng5  Nf8  12.Bd3  Rc8  13.Rc1  N6d7  Forcing ...Nxe6 now. Note that if Black drops his bishop back to d7 instead, White has the strong manoeuvre Ng5-f3-e5.  14.Nxe6  Nxe6  15.Bg3  +=  White has a slight edge here thanks to his bishop pair and easy play down the c-file. }
9. f3 { Consolidating g4. } 9... g5
{ Quite necessary so as not to get completely cramped.   9...Nd7 ?!  Inaccurate. White is free now to continue his kingside expansion.  10.h4 !  Grabbing space and preventing Black's ...g5.  Qxb3  11.axb3  h5  Quite typical - stopping White's rolling pawns and fixing them on dark squares.  12.g5  Bb4  13.Kf2  Stepping out of the pin.  Ne7  14.Na2  Ba5  15.b4  Bd8  was reached in -  (31)  Erenberg,A  (2407)  -Zumsande,M  (2492)  Douglas 2018  16.Nc3  ±  Seems to be an improvement over the game continuation. White is planning b5 with a comfortable edge thanks to his extra space and more active pieces. }
10. Be5
{ A good move, provoking ...f6 - the pawn gets in the way of Black's minor pieces. }
10... f6 11. Bg3 h5 { Black's main active idea. } 12. gxh5 Qxb3
{ Pretty much forced - Black needs to get the queens off, otherwise, his kingside comes under heavy fire.   12...Nd7 ?!  Black can't hold the tension between the queens any longer - he needs to exchange here instead.  13.Qc2 !  White breaks the tension and threatens an invasion on g6.  f5  14.O-O-O  ±  Holding f5 is a very difficult task after White's next move, Bd3. }
13. axb3 Rxh5 14. Bd3
{ At the time of writing, this position has been reached in 2 games, including the aforementioned Kramnik-So battle. }
14... Kf7
{ was So's choice.   14...f5  15.h4  With the same plan as Kramnik used against So. By undermining the g5 pawn, we want to get the incredible f4 square for our knights.  Nd7  might be Black's best try here. What follows is far from forced, but just an indication what best play might be and a demonstration of White's plans.  16.Kd2  Activating the king.  gxh4  Black will probably need to play this at some point. White has incredible long-term compensation for the pawn here, in the form of activity, the amazing f4 outpost and the weak Black f5 and h4 pawns.  17.Nce2  This seems like the right knight to bring to f4 - it was doing nothing on the queenside.  Nf8  Black's bringing his knight to g6.  18.Be5  Preparing the Nf4 hop - e5 is a better square for our bishop than f2.  Ng6  19.Nh3  The other knight joins the battle - there is no need to worry about ...Nxe5, since the closed nature of the position and multiple outposts favour our knights.  Rh6  20.Rag1  Activating the other rook.  Nxe5  21.dxe5  Bb4+  22.Kc2  Bc5  23.Ng5 !  Good, active play - White threatens Nxe6 so Black can't take on e3.  Bc8  A sad retreat, but Black has nothing better.  24.Nd4  +=  White is dominating positionally and is in an ideal situation to grind for the win. Either the weak f5 or h4 pawn will drop off in the future. }
15. h4 { As mentioned, the idea here is to get the f4 square for our knight. }
15... f5 16. Nh3 f4
{ was played by So but is inaccurate. 16... Nd7 was better, leading to similar play in our previous line after 14... f5. }
17. exf4 Bxh3 18. fxg5
{ White's three connected pawns on the kingside give White a clear advantage. White was unlucky not to convert in -  (42)  Kramnik, V  (2800)  -So, W  (2799)  Berlin 2018 CBM 184 }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development with ...Nf6, ...Be7 and then castle.   There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his own light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'.   In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 so as to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Be7
{ This is the 'refined' version of the Queen's Gambit Declined recommended by GM Colovic in his Chessable course on the QGD. For a long time, the Exchange Variation as played by Kasparov & co. was so challenging that many Black players tried to avoid it with this move order trick. The idea is to prevent White from playing Kasparov's favourite setup with Bg5, e3, Bd3, f3 and Nge2, as in the mainline after 3... Nf6. There is a downside to 3... Be7 though - our bishop can now go to f4 instead, where it is also well-placed. If we played our bishop to f4 after 3... Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4, Black can play 5... c5 ! which isn't possible now. By playing 3... Be7 Black wants to develop his bishop out to f5 in the Exchange Variation, but as we'll see, there are ways to take advantage of this. }
4. cxd5 { Keeping in style with the Exchange Variation after 3... Nf6. } 4...
exd5 5. Bf4
{ As mentioned before - since the g5 square isn't available, we put our bishop on f4 instead. Black has 2 moves here, which can easily transpose: 5... c6 and 5... Nf6. }
5... c6 { This flexible move is more popular than 5... Nf6. } 6. e3
{ This is a major branching point in the 3... Be7 QGD. We will look at 3 options Black has:   
 The very natural developing move 6... Nf6 is not too challenging. I think White can get a comfortable edge here - the placement of our bishop has some advantages which will be explained later.    6... Bd6 is an ultra-solid option recommended by Colovic in his QGD repertoire on Chessable. Black's idea is vacuum the bishops off the board after ...Ne7 and ...Bf5 later, equalising.    6... Bf5 was the main idea behind 5... c6. With the d5 pawn protected, Black is seemingly free to develop his bishop actively to f5. This is the mainline and most challenging variation in the 3... Be7 QGD. }
6... Bd6
{ Colovic's recommendation has only been played 300 or so times, but it needs to be taken seriously. Black's idea is very positional: he exchanges dark bishops immediately in order to free up the e7 square for his knight. From e7, the knight supports ...Bf5 - if this all goes down without a hitch, Black gets to exchange his 'problem bishop' on c8 and should equalise comfortably. The downside to this though is that Black is moving his bishop twice, meaning that he is bound to fall further behind in development. }
7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. Bd3 Ne7
{ As mentioned before, the knight is best here in order to support ...Bf5. If Black can play ...Bf5 without some sort of concession, he should be fine. }
9. Qc2 { Knowing that ... Bf5 is threatened, this must be played of course. }
9... b6
{ Colovic's recommendation and Black's main move has received the backing of some top players including Topalov and Jakovenko. Black scraps the idea of exchanging light bishops with ...Bf5 and instead wants to exchange them with ...Ba6 now. This is also a small concession though since the c6 pawn is something we can target later. }
10. Nf3
{ There is no way to prevent ...Ba6, so we just focus on finishing our development. Black will succeed in exchanging light bishops, but we hope that our lead in development and the slight vulnerability of c6 gives us an edge. }
10... Ba6 11. O-O Bxd3 12. Qxd3 O-O 13. Rac1
{ Naturally, we are going to double up our rooks on the c-file to put maximum pressure on c6. There is a more popular alternative though in the form of 13. e4 here, but I prefer this. 13. e4 seems a bit too committal to me here - I prefer the slower approach here of piling up on the c6 pawn. }
13... Nd7 14. Rc2 Qg6
{ was played a couple of times, including once by Kasimdzhanov. I'm doubtful that the exchange of queens alleviates Black's problems here. }
15. Qxg6 hxg6 16. h4
{ A nice move, putting a clamp on Black's queenside. White can definitely push for the win here safely. We have a relatively straightforward plan: Rfc1, Ne1-d3, Ne2-f4 and if allowed, Nb4. Black has no counterplay so White can take as much time as he likes improving his position and expanding on the kingside as well. }

I think White can get a comfortable edge here - the placement of our bishop has some advantages which will be explained later.    6... Bd6 is an ultra-solid option recommended by Colovic in his QGD repertoire on Chessable. Black's idea is vacuum the bishops off the board after ...Ne7 and ...Bf5 later, equalising.    6... Bf5 was the main idea behind 5... c6. With the d5 pawn protected, Black is seemingly free to develop his bishop actively to f5. This is the mainline and most challenging variation in the 3... Be7 QGD. }
6... Bf5
{ Black's main and most critical choice and the point behind 5... c6, delaying ... Nf6. Much like after Colovic's 6... Bd6, if Black gets to exchange light bishops, he equalises. }
7. g4
{ Getting a bishop to f5 so early in the QGD would normally be a huge success, but it comes at a cost as well ! White's extra flexibility allows him to kick the bishop away with g4 and grab space on the kingside. This kingside expansion is double-edged since there is the risk of overextending, but it is White's best chance of an opening advantage here. It has received the backing of most top players here and it scores very well too, with nearly 65%. Black has 2 logical retreats here: g6 and e6. }
7... Be6
{ The better retreat, as the bishop isn't at risk of getting trapped by h4-h5. White seems to have 3 decent options for an edge here: 1. The ambitious 8. h4, offering a pawn sacrifice. 2. The more conservative 8. h3, which seeks to consolidate the space on the kingside. 3. The rare 8. Qb3, hitting b7. }
8. Qb3
{ I have made this my main choice for a couple of reasons. It seems like it leads to a relatively risk-free edge for White, at least after the most common reply ...Qb6, whereas 8. h4 seems quite murky and unclear. 8. Qb3 also has the benefit of being rarer and less explored, so opponents will be less prepared for it. It has been played by some very strong GMs as well, including Kramnik in 2018's Candidates tournament against So. }
8... b5 9. h3
{ is a bizarre-looking move, but the engine's top choice. It seems to create quite a few weaknesses on the queenside like the c6 pawn, but when you look a bit deeper it isn't so clear how these can be exploited immediately. Regardless, exploit it we will try: our general plan here will be to complete development and then put some pressure on the backward c6 pawn - and if Black advances ...c5, we get to play against the isolated d5 pawn. This move has been played twice at the time of writing - both times in 2018 by strong GMs. I think this could be a critical test of 8. Qb3 and maybe even 'best play' all the way from 3... Be7. The first thing to realise now is that White's g4 pawn is hanging - we need to find a way to deal with that. }
9... Nd7
{ This seems to be the more natural way to cover g4. In the other game, White opted for 9. Qd1 instead. }
10. Nf3 Ngf6 { is natural but allows the Ng5 hop. } 11. Ng5 Nf8 12. Bd3 Rc8 13.
Rc1 N6d7
{ Forcing ...Nxe6 now. Note that if Black drops his bishop back to d7 instead, White has the strong manoeuvre Ng5-f3-e5. }
14. Nxe6 Nxe6 15. Bg3
{ White has a slight edge here thanks to his bishop pair and easy play down the c-file. }

{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7.

Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'.

Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6.   5...Be6  is plain bad - the bishop is misplaced on e6 and this is a waste of a tempo.  6.e3  Be7  7.Bd3  Nbd7  8.Nge2  e2 will be the knight's home for the majority of the rest of this chapter, for reasons explained later, but in this case, it is because our knight wants to go to f4.  O-O  9.Nf4  One major disadvantage of having the bishop on e6 is that it is vulnerable to Nf4xe6 ideas.  c5   9...c6  10.Qc2  There's no need to rush Nxe6 since Black can't do anything to avoid it.  h6  11.Bh4  Bd6  12.Nxe6  fxe6  13.O-O  +=  White's bishop pair and Black's pawn structure defects give White an advantage.  10.O-O  Rc8  11.Rc1  ±  Black lacks a good plan here. Eventually, he'll most likely either end up stuck with a weak IQP, or he'll play ...c4. If he goes for ...c4, then we start preparing the e4 break since ...c4 makes it much stronger. Also, at any time White feels like it, we can grab the bishop pair with Nxe6.   5...Bb4  Black is aiming for a kind of Ragozin here, but without our knight committed to f3 yet, this is inaccurate.  6.e3  h6 !  This is the only way Black can try to justify 5... Bb4. He is going to kick our bishop back and then plant his knight on e4.   6...O-O  Normal play just shows why the bishop on b4 is misplaced.  7.Bd3  h6  8.Bh4  c6  9.Nge2  Re8  10.Qc2  Nbd7  11.O-O  +=  The position is similar to the mainline, but with the bishop on b4 instead of e7. It is clear that the bishop is misplaced here - it has no clear purpose since taking on c3 is not good.  7.Bh4  Taking on f6 would pose Black no real problems.  g5  8.Bg3  Ne4  Black's idea, hitting c3.  9.Nge2 !  White has a few other options here, but I like this move - we develop and support c3. The knight is only temporarily in the way of our light bishop since we want to play a3 next to force the trade on c3.  h5 !  Black's only hope of getting a decent game. ...h4 is the threat.  10.h4  Preventing .. .h4 and preparing to open the h-file.  Nxg3  11.Nxg3  gxh4  12.Nxh5  +=  Black seems to have overextended on the kingside, meaning White is a bit better here.   5...Nbd7  should just transpose to mainline within a couple of moves, but please remember one thing here ! Don't take on d5 ! It loses on the spot.  6.e3   6.Nxd5 ??  is a losing blunder after  Nxd5 !  7.Bxd8  Bb4+  White loses his queen.  8.Qd2  Bxd2+  9.Kxd2  Kxd8  -+  This well-known beginner's trap leaves White down a piece. The scary thing is that in my database alone, more than 500 people have fallen for this trick !  6...c6  7.Bd3  Be7  8.Nge2  transposing to the mainline.   5...Be7  should also just transpose to the mainline within a few moves, for example  6.e3  O-O  7.Bd3  Nbd7  8.Nge2  c6  transposing to the mainline. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7
{ 6...Bd6  This is relatively rare but it is not as bad as its rarity suggests. In most cases, the bishop is better on e7 than d6, but d6 does have an interesting idea behind it which will be revealed a little later.  7.Bd3  O-O  8.Nf3 !  And this is it ! Throughout this chapter, we are going for the Nge2, f3 and e4 setup where possible, so why do we switch all of a sudden ? I realised that one of the points behind ...Bd6 is that it keeps the e-file open for Black's rook. This means that after something like ...h6 Bh4 ...Re8, White can't play f3 because the e3 pawn would hang - of course, with a bishop on e7 this wouldn't be the case. As a result, I think a change of plan is called for here. The rare 8. Nf3 still contains the idea of e4 at some point, but we are more likely to prepare it now with Nd2 instead.  Re8   8...Bg4  This is Black's most popular move by far here, which seems like it equalises easily because the bishop can get to g6 to trade off our good bishop, but things aren't so simple for Black !  9.h3  Bh5  10.Qc2  Bg6  11.Bxg6  hxg6  Surely Black has succeeded here ? With our good bishop gone, what edge can White hope for ?  12.h4 !  ±  White doesn't only have a slight edge here, but a clear advantage. We haven't castled short, so this h4-h5 lever is highly effective. White's attack pretty much plays itself from here.  9.O-O  h6  10.Bh4  Nbd7  11.Qc2  Nf8  12.h3  Fairly standard play all around. We are going to play Rae1 and e4 next if allowed.  g5 !  It looks like Black is winning a pawn here...  13.Bg3  g4  is an improvement.   13...Bxg3  Grabbing the pawn isn't Black's best chance.  14.fxg3  Rxe3  15.g4  ±  White has a huge amount of compensation here. White will double on the f-file, put his knight on e5 and start attacking Black's king.  14.Ne5  Bxe5  15.Bxe5  gxh3  16.f3 !  +=  Planning to recapture on g2 with the queen. Once again, we have huge compensation for the pawn - this time in the form of Black's disastrous kingside and our bishop pair.   6...Bf5 !?  This is what 6. Qc2 tries to avoid. Black develops his bishop to its best square, thus "forcing" White to go into an endgame which is slightly better for White, but which some Black players enjoy trying to hold. Let's see this endgame...  7.Qf3  White has no chance of getting an advantage with anything else.  Bg6  8.Bxf6  Qxf6  Of course, taking back with the pawn is far worse - Black's wrecked kingside pawn structure is more of a factor in the middlegame.  9.Qxf6  gxf6  Right, so let's take stock. Black has the bishop pair, but in this position, they are rather useless since they have no targets and the position is relatively closed. White, on the other hand, has the far superior pawn structure - the doubled f-pawns and isolated h-pawn could cause Black some serious problems later on in the game. Players have realised that the Black side of this endgame isn't so bad - Black is objectively worse, but some players are happy to draw worse endgames. It's important to realise that White can't "refute" Black's position here, but I think that a long term endgame advantage is already a success out of the opening. In practice, Black has struggled quite badly, with White scoring a very good 65% from this position.  10.Nf3  Nd7   10...Bd6 ?!  The bishop is worse placed on d6 than on e7.  11.Nh4  Nd7  12.f4 !  And this is why. With the bishop on e7, this wouldn't work because Black could reply ...f5 with tempo.  f5  13.Bd3  ±  White wins a pawn.  11.Nh4  Be7  12.Ne2 !  This move was a novelty when Carlsen introduced it in 2016 and used it to beat Kramnik in fantastic style. Since then, it has become White's second most common move in the position after the very natural 12. g3. What's White's idea ? We are rerouting our knight from c3 to the f5 outpost. Let's first see how Carlsen used this idea to beat Kramnik.  f5 !  Since Carlsen's fantastic dismantling of Kramnik that we just looked at, no GM has repeated 12... Nb6. Almost all players have chosen the improvement with 12... f5. This ensures that White doesn't get that strong outpost on f5 by attacking White's knight on h4.   12...Nb6  Kramnik's choice, when confronted with Carlsen's idea, has not been repeated by a GM since.  13.Ng3  Heading for f5.  Bb4+  Forcing our king to d1, but this isn't a big deal.  14.Kd1  Na4  15.Ngf5 !  The threat to b2 is an illusion.  Kd7   15...Nxb2+ ?  doesn't work because of  16.Kc2  Nc4  17.Bxc4  dxc4  18.Rhb1  ±  We win the b7 pawn with a great position.  16.Rb1  Covering b2.  Ke6  This is a bit inaccurate since the king is exposed on e6, but White is already a bit better regardless.  17.Bd3  Developing and supporting f5.  Rhc8  18.Ke2  Bf8  19.g4 !  Supporting f5 - Carlsen has an unshakeable grip over that outpost.  c5  20.Ng2 !  +-  A fantastic move and the essence of Carlsen's idea. With the knight secured on the f5 outpost, Carlsen reroutes his other knight to f4. The knight is coming to f4 with tempo and then he'll follow up with h4-h5. White is already winning and Carlsen converted flawlessly in 1-0  (50)  Carlsen, M  (2851)  -Kramnik,V  (2801)  Stavanger 2016 CBM 172. So what was Carlsen's basic plan after 12. Ne2 ? 1. Bring the knight to the f5 outpost with Nc3-e2-g3-f5.2. Secure the knight with Bd3 and g4.3. Improve the other knight's position with Nh4-g2-f4.4. Run Black over with h2-h4-h5.   12...Bb4+  is another move Black has tried but it's likely to transpose to either 12... f5 or 12... Nb6.  13.Kd1  Bd3  Black's only noteworthy independent try. Black wants to exchange off the bad bishop on g6, but this does little to alleviate his problems.  14.Ng3  Bxf1  15.Rxf1  ±  White is clearly better thanks to Black's weak pawns and the outpost on f5.  13.g3  White's main choice and the logical follow-up. 13. Nf3 wouldn't pose Black many problems.  Bxh4  14.gxh4  A very interesting endgame position. Both sides have damaged pawn structures, but the key difference and the reason White is better is that Black's bad pawns on the kingside are on the same colour as Black's bishop. This means that Black's bishop is very poor on g6 and the f5 pawn is an easy target. The endgame is by no means winning for White, but we certainly have an edge and White has scored well from this position.  Nf6  15.Rg1  This was Kramnik's choice when he used this line.  Ke7  16.Bh3  Rae8  17.Nf4  +=  Black has no counterplay and is in a bit of a bind. Kramnik went on to win his game and I highly recommend taking a look at it: 1-0  (42)  Kramnik, V  (2779)  -Aleksandrov, A  (2602)  Batumi 2018. The key to Kramnik's success in that endgame was that he played on both sides of the board. It's easy to get fixated on the kingside and struggle to make progress. By playing on the queenside with a2-a4 and Ra1-a3-b3 White created more Black weaknesses and won relatively effortlessly. I'd recommend looking at some other games after 14. gxh4 as well to get a feel for how White's play develops. }
7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7
{ 7...O-O  should just transpose, for example  8.Qc2  Nbd7  9.Nge2  transposes. }
8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... O-O
{ This is the old mainline. transposing to the mainline.   8...Nf8 !?  A neat idea - Black hurries to trade off light bishops by playing ...Nd7-f8-e6 followed by ...g6, ...Ng7 and . ..Bf5. As we've seen before, if Black succeeds in trading light bishops, he is equal more often than not. The problem with this elaborate plan though is that it is quite slow.  9.O-O  Ne6  10.Bh4  g6  Preparing the aforementioned ...Ng7 . ..Bf5 idea.   10...O-O  11.Qc2  g6  12.Rab1  Ng7  13.b4  transposes to the Ding-Fedoseev game that we look at after 10... g6.  11.b4 !  White gets queenside play underway immediately. Note that the pawn on b4 isn't hanging because of 11... Bxb4 12. Nxd5 !.   11.f3 !?  +=  is more popular and a good alternative.  11...a6 !  Good prophylactic play, slowing down White's queenside advance.  12.Na4 !  White immediately sets about exploiting the consequences of Black's previous move - a knight on c5 is much stronger now.  O-O   12...Bxb4 ?  Once again, grabbing this pawn is ill-advised:  13.Bxf6  Qxf6  14.Nb6  Rb8  15.Nxd5 !  cxd5  16.Qa4+  ±  We regain our pawn with a big advantage.  13.Nc5  The knight does a good job here of tying down Black's light bishop to the defence of b7, thus preventing ...Bf5.  Ng7  14.Rc1  Nfe8  15.Bxe7  Qxe7  16.a4  Preparing b5 again.  Nd6  17.b5  axb5  18.axb5  Bf5  19.bxc6  bxc6  20.Nf4  +=  White is a bit better here but Black went on to draw in -  (43)  Ding, L  (2813)  -Fedoseev, V  (2724)  Wijk aan Zee 2019. Black defended well and White could have improved, but not everyone is Fedoseev and the defence isn't so easy here - White has an easy target on c6 and a strong knight on c5.   8...Nh5  A typical idea for Black, which we'll see much more of later since it is advocated by Ntirlis in his great 'Playing 1. d4 d5' book but with the insertion of 8... h6 first. Exchanging minor pieces helps Black alleviate the space problems he has.  9.Bxe7  Qxe7  10.g4 !  is a very interesting idea. We exploit the position of Black's knight to grab as much space on the kingside while we have the chance. It is just a little bit less popular than the very natural 10. O-O. I've opted for this as my main recommendation since it's relatively forcing, so tricky move orders are avoided, and also it is objectively strong - Black needs to know his stuff here to get an equal position.   10.O-O !?  is the more "normal" option. Play proceeds normally, for example:  O-O  11.Qd2  Re8  12.Rae1  Ndf6  13.Nf4 !  A useful idea to keep in mind. The opening of the e-file and White's grip over e5 give him good play.  Nxf4  14.exf4  Qf8  15.Re5  g6  16.f5 !  +=  With a promising position for White.  10...Nhf6  11.Ng3  Defending g4 while simultaneously threatening Nf5. Black has several ways to deal with this threat and as a result, this is the major branching point after 8... Nh5.  Nf8 !  This is possibly Black's best move objectively, but it has only been played a few times. The idea behind this move becomes apparent a bit later.   11...O-O ?!  has only been played a couple of times and I understand why - it looks very scary for Black.  12.h4 !  No need to immediately hop in with Nf5.  Nb6  13.g5 !  We keep rolling our kingside pawns forward.  Ne8  ...Ng4 would be met by Bf5.  14.Qc2  g6  15.O-O-O  ±  White has a very, very dangerous attack.   11...g6  Black's most popular move, preventing Nf5 by force but this comes at the cost of weakening Black's kingside significantly.  12.h4  Just like before, we throw our kingside pawns down the board.  Nb6  13.g5  Kicking Black's knight back.  Ng8  Black's more popular choice, which can also easily be reached from 11... Nb6.   13...Nfd7  14.Qe2  Nf8  15.O-O-O  +=  White has a very promising play on the kingside with f4-f5. Black should probably castle long to avoid the onslaught, but White is still quite a bit better.  14.a4 !  A very strong move, only played once. We want to kick Black's other knight back to d7.  a5  The fact that the knight on b6 is unprotected now is useful for White.  15.h5 !  Continuing our attack at the cost of the g5 pawn.  Qxg5  16.Qb3  Nd7  17.O-O-O  ±  White has a very promising attacking setup here. Black's pieces are in disarray and his king is still stuck in the centre. White can consider cracking open the centre with Kb1 and e4 next.   11...h6  Prophylaxis against g5 of course, but this does nothing against Nf5.  12.Nf5  Qf8  Putting the queen on f8 is extremely awkward.  13.h4  g6  14.Ng3  White has successfully provoked the weakening of Black's kingside.  Nb6  15.f3  Bd7  16.h5 !  +=  We want to force the g6 pawn to move so that we get the f5 outpost for our knight.   11...Nb6  is Black's second most common choice.  12.g5  Ng8  13.h4  h6 !  Black chips away at White's seemingly overextended kingside. 13... g6 would transpose to 11... g6.  14.g6 !  Nf6  15.gxf7+  Qxf7  16.Qc2  O-O  17.Nce2  +=  We have a good position with promising attacking chances once again.  12.g5  Ng8  13.h4  h6 !  Black's idea. The knights do a good job of helping Black chip away at White's g5 pawn. The point of ...Nf8 becomes clear now - it prevents g6. White needs to react precisely here - otherwise, he might well have been caught overextending on the kingside.  14.Kd2 !  We want to recapture on h1 with our queen after the trades on g5. A good alternative is 14. Qa4.  hxg5  15.hxg5  Rxh1  16.Qxh1  Qxg5  17.Rg1 !  We bring our final piece into the attack.  Qh6  18.Nh5 !  Hitting g7.  Ne6  19.Nxg7+ !  White can also keep the attack going with something like Ne2.  Nxg7  20.Qxh6  Nxh6  21.Rxg7  +=  White's active pieces give him the advantage in this endgame.   8...h6  Kicking our bishop back. The pawn on h6 has pros and cons - it controls the g5 square and White no longer can attack h7 with his queen + bishop battery, but it could also serve as a hook which White can attack.  9.Bh4  Nh5  This is the recommendation of Ntirlis in his great 'Playing 1. d4 d5' book. This is a serious equalising attempt for Black and Ntirlis analysed it in great depth. Since its popularity will inevitably pick up and it is a challenging line, I will cover this line in quite some depth - so I apologise if some of the variations appear rather long. The deeper analysis was necessary to try to counter his book's recommendations, which I think I might have done successfully.   9...O-O  Black commits to castling kingside before we do. This is a useful fact to be aware of if Black goes for the ... Nh5 idea again.  10.Qc2  Re8   10...c5  It's too early for this - the pawn on c5 has no prospects since Black isn't active enough to be OK in the ensuing IQP position.  11.O-O  c4  As usual, this advance just strengthens White's upcoming e4 counter break.  12.Bf5  Nb6  13.f3  Preparing e4.  Re8  14.Bxc8  Rxc8  15.Rad1  ±  White is clearly better on account of the inevitable e4 break.   10...b6  This plan tries to deploy Black's bishop on b7, but it is a bit too weakening on the queenside. White should switch gears now and head for a minority attack.  11.O-O  Bb7  12.Rfd1  Prophylaxis against ...c5.  Re8  13.h3  Nh5  14.Bxe7  Qxe7  15.Rab1  Nf8  16.b4  Rad8  17.a4  +=  White's minority attack is strengthened by the pawn moves Black has already made on the queenside.   10...Ne8  Offering the trade of bishops, but there is no need for White to accept without a knight on h5.  11.Bg3 !  Keeping the bishops on the board for now.  Ndf6   11...Bd6  Black insists on the trade, but he is spending so much time to achieve it that it isn't at all worthwhile.  12.O-O  Bxg3  13.Nxg3  Nd6  14.f3  +=  With the standard e4 break on the way, White's better.  12.O-O  Nd6  13.f3  Nh5  14.Be5  Nc4  15.Bxc4  dxc4  16.Rad1  +=  White's big centre here gives him a comfortable edge.   10...Nh5  An idea which features again and again.  11.Bxe7  Qxe7  12.g4 !  Just like after 8... Nh5, we get the g-pawn going and castle long to get an attack against Black's king. It's even more effective now, seeing as Black's king is already committed to short castling.  Nhf6  13.Rg1  Protecting g4 and possibly preparing g5.  Re8  14.O-O-O  Ne4 !  Black needs to try and disrupt our lines of attack.  15.Bxe4  dxe4  16.Kb1  +=  White has a comfortable edge here connected to the weakness of the e4 pawn and our extra space on the kingside.  11.O-O  11. h3 is another idea to meet ...Nh5 with g4 later.  Ne4  Black's most common move here, heading for mass exchanges.   11...Nf8  12.f3  transposes to our mainline after 8...O-O.   11...Nh5  Yet another manifestation of this idea.  12.Bxe7  Qxe7  13.Rab1  I think this minority attack plan makes the most sense here since it is difficult to get f3 in.  a5  14.a3  Nhf6  15.Na4  +=  With the knight coming to c5, White's got a slight edge.  12.Bxe7  Qxe7  13.Bxe4  dxe4  As is typical in this structure, the e4 pawn is a bit weak, which gives White a slight but lasting pull.  14.Rfd1  Preparing the typical d5 break, which has the idea of freeing the d4 square for the rook so it can attack e4.  Nf6  15.h3  Prophylaxis against any ...Bg4 ideas.  Bf5  16.d5 !  +=  White has the initiative and the e4 pawn is weak.  10.Bxe7  Qxe7  11.O-O  Note that our plan of g4 doesn't work here since Black already has his pawn on h6 to prevent any further g4-g5 advances.  O-O  12.Qd2 !  The best way to implement our idea of f3 on the next move. d2 is more suitable for the f3 plan than the c2 square because it protects the e3 pawn. Note that this is why we have been delaying the development of our queen for so long ! We want to be flexible so that we can choose between d2 and c2 when necessary. This position hasn't been reached more than 20 times at the time of writing, but it is bound to pick up in popularity.  Nb6  The recommendation of Ntirlis. The knight gets out of the bishop's way and eyes the c4 square. If our bishop ever moves, ...Nc4 can be unpleasant - that is why in many variations we play the prophylactic b3.   12...Re8  Very natural and a popular Black alternative.  13.Rae1  The best square for the rook in this line.  Ndf6  Planning ...Ne4.   13...Nb6  14.Nf4  This is an interesting idea we have seen before - we want to open the e-file and then grab space on the kingside.   14.Nc1 !?  is the more normal move with the idea of f3 and e4. This is also fine.  Nf6  15.f3  c5  16.dxc5  Qxc5  17.Nb3  Qc7  18.Rc1  +=  White has a slight edge, but it's not much.  14...Nxf4  15.exf4  Qd8  16.Rxe8+  Qxe8  17.f5 !  Cramping Black's kingside and restricting his bishop.  Qd8  18.g4  Qh4  19.f3  +=  Our pawn chain does a great job of restricting Black's bishop and claiming space on the kingside. I prefer White here.  14.Bb1  Dropping our bishop back prophylactically in preparation for ...Ne4.  Ne4  15.Nxe4  dxe4  16.a3  Preparing b4 possibly or allowing White to activate his bishop via a2.  Nf6  17.Ng3  +=  As usual in this structure, White has a slight edge since we can target and play against e4, but it's nothing major.  13.f3  As we've seen already in this chapter, this is a standard idea. Here, however, it has 2 purposes: 1. The obvious idea is to prepare e4.2. The less obvious, but more interesting idea is to prepare g4. With Black's knight on h5 and pawn on h6, we are ideally placed to expand on the kingside.  Bd7  Natural development.   13...f5  tries to forcefully prevent g4 and e4, but this creates too many weaknesses on the kingside and restricts Black's bishop.  14.Rae1  Bd7  15.b3  Restricting Black's knight.  Rae8  16.Nc1  c5  17.dxc5  Qxc5  18.Bb1  Planning Qd4.  f4  19.Qd4  Qxd4  20.exd4  +=  White is a bit better here due to his more active pieces and Black's slightly exposed pawns on f4 and d5.   13...Qg5  Preventing e4.  14.Rad1  Preparing e4 again.  f5  15.Rde1  Now that Black has committed to ...f5, e1 is the better square for the rook once again.  Be6  16.b3  +=  Play proceeds similarly to 13... f5.  14.g4 !  This is absolutely the critical way to play. White expands on the kingside, gaining important space for his pieces. Our general idea here is to use our extra space to put our pieces in positions where they can take advantage of the open lines we will create. To create these open lines, we will exploit the h6 "hook" by playing h4 followed by g5.  Nf6  15.Nf4  This position has only been reached once, so the analysis that follows is highly theoretical, in the sense it hasn't been tested yet. However, we will be going a bit deeper here as this is the mainline in Ntirlis' QGD book, so it is important to deal with his recommendation. Players shouldn't concern themselves too much with memorising the lines that follow - instead, keep in mind our general idea over the next few moves: we bring our other rook to e1, and then play on the kingside with h4. The idea is to crack open the h-file with g5 and then get good play against Black's king.  c5  Black gets his counterplay underway immediately. This is Ntirlis' recommendation.   15...Rae8  16.Rae1  c5  17.h4  +=  with play very similar to our mainline.   15...g5  Kicks our knight away but weakens Black's kingside significantly.  16.Ng2  Ne8  17.e4  17. h4 is another strong idea.  dxe4  18.Nxe4  +=  White's more active, which means that Black's king is in more danger here than White's.  16.h4  Planning g5 of course.  Rac8  17.Rae1  Rfe8  18.g5 !  This strong move is covered by Ntirlis, but I think he underestimated the problems that Black faces.   18.Qh2 !?  is Ntirlis' mainline, but even here I feel like White should have a very slight pull.  cxd4  19.exd4  Qb4  20.Nce2  Bb5  21.g5  Bxd3  22.Nxd3  Qd2  23.Nef4  Qxh2+  24.Kxh2  hxg5  25.hxg5  Rxe1  26.Rxe1 =  Ntirlis analyses this a bit further and shows that Black is OK but practically White is still for choice thanks to his more active pieces and space on the kingside.  18...hxg5  19.hxg5  Nh5  A cute idea - White can't take the knight because of ...Qxg5+.  20.Qg2  Nxf4  21.exf4  Qf8  Ntirlis ends his analysis here and claims that Black will play ...g6 next with a fine position, but I think this is far from clear.  22.Qh2  Threatening mate on h7.  g6  I think this position is far from clear - and it doesn't seem like Black is completely fine. As we will see, the open h-file is a constant worry for Black as he could easily get mated, while White's king has a nice safe square on g3.  23.dxc5  The next few moves are nearly forced, and alternatives will pretty much just transpose to the position after move 25.  Qxc5+  24.Kg2  Rxe1  25.Rxe1  Qd4  26.Rh1   26.Rd1 !?  is another promising idea leading to a good endgame for White.  Qh8  27.Qxh8+  Kxh8  28.Ne2  +=  White has the ideal endgame for the endgame grinders out there. Black lacks any counterplay and White can play risk-free for a win. The weak d4-pawn and space on the kingside which keeps Black's king out of the game give White an edge here.  26...Kf8   26...Re8  27.Kg3  The king is safer on g3.  Bc6  28.Qh7+  Kf8  29.Rd1  Qg7  30.Qh2  +=  White keeps a pleasant edge. Black needs to constantly guard his king while White's is relatively safe on g3.  27.Rd1  Threatening Bxg6.  Qg7  28.Kg3  +=  Once again, White retains a pleasant, long-term advantage here which is very difficult to neutralise for Black in practice, since he lacks counterplay and all he can do is defend against White's threats. All in all, I'm very happy with how this repertoire stacks up against Ntirlis' work - I think White gets a definite edge here in pretty much all lines and would gladly go down this variation as White. }

11. f3
{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many Black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. We must prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black: 1.11... c5 ?! is poor and allows White to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.2.11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.3.11... Be6 is a natural developing move and Black's most popular choice, but I think White is doing pretty well here. 4.11... h6 is played with the idea of preparing ...Ne6, but White is doing well here too. 5. 11... Nh5 trades bishops to relieve some pressure, however, it misplaces Black's knight and is a bit too slow to equalise. 6.11... Ng6, in connection with 12... h6, is in my view the most accurate way for Black to play from this position. Black's idea is to simply pick up the bishop pair. This isn't too popular at the moment and it has scored well for White in practice anyway. }
11... Ng6
{ I think this Black's only way to equalise from the tabiya on the previous move, but only in connection with a specific follow-up. The knight is good on g6 - it performs the important function of cutting off our bishop's retreat to h4.   11...c5 ?!  is very premature and White gets a big advantage after  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.dxc5 !  Leaving White with a weak IQP.  Rxe3  14.Rad1  The d5 pawn is bound to fall soon.  Be6  15.Be4  d4  16.Nb5  There's no saving d4.  d3  17.Bxd3  ±  White is a clean pawn up.   11...g6  A typical idea that we have already encountered. Black wants to play ...Ne6-g7, but the immediate 11.. .Ne6 would lose a pawn to Bxf6 ... Bxf6 Bxh7+.  12.Rad1  This will be our default square for the rook in the following variations. The reasoning is that the e3 pawn has enough support already and after we play e4, it is the d4 pawn which needs some more support. This is especially evident after the sequence e4 ...dxe4 fxe4 and then e5 - we are left with a backward d4 pawn which the rook supports.  Ne6  Hitting our bishop, but it also puts pressure on d4 which makes it harder to carry out the e4 break.  13.Bh4  b5 !  This is an interesting attempt by Black to get some counterplay on the queenside, although it is still quite rare. The other point is to keep the knight on e6 where it puts pressure on d4, thus preventing our standard plan of e4. Objectively, this is quite strong and I had to resort to Leela to provide some enlightenment.   13...Ng7  is the very natural follow up to White's previous move and Black's most common choice, but I think White can get a good advantage here.  14.e4  dxe4  15.fxe4  Ng4  16.Bxe7  Qxe7  17.Qd2  ±  Covering e3. White has a huge centre while Black's pieces are in disarray.  14.Qc1 !  What a bizarre, mysterious move ! The idea is quite interesting though. We are trying to stay as flexible as possible and decide on a plan based on where Black puts his light bishop. If he goes to b7, we want to play Nf4, threatening Nxe6, and the queen on c1 supports that. If Black's bishop goes to d7 instead, we can break with e4 since the d4 pawn will no longer hang after exchanges on e4.  Bb7  15.Nf4 !  The point of the previous move.  Nxf4  16.exf4  Our extra f-pawn and the open e-file help us get kingside play underway here. Black's g6 pawn gives us a "hook" to attack.  Nh5  The queen on c1 is already well-placed to deal with the pressure on f4.  17.Bxe7  Qxe7  18.g4 !  Kicking Black's knight back and gaining some space on the kingside.  Ng7  19.Ne2  +=  I like White's position here quite a bit, even though our advantage is rather minimal. Our extra space and majority on the kingside gives us easy play there with f5. Long term, Black's weakness on c6 and bad bishop might also be a telling factor.   11...Be6  This normal developing move is Black's most common choice, which is quite nice because I think White can get quite a promising position here.  12.Rad1  The standard square for our rook, supporting d4.  Rc8  This is usually played in connection with one of Black's few active ideas, ...c5.   12...Ng6  A common move in this position and a standard square for Black's knight.  13.h3 !  I like this move and we'll be seeing more of it later on too. The obvious idea behind it is to cover the g4 square to prevent ...Ng4 after we play e4 ...dxe5 fxe4, but the more interesting idea is to support g4 in certain situations.  Rc8  14.e4  We are ready to charge forth.  dxe4  15.fxe4  Qc7  16.e5 !  The standard way to arrange our central pawns. It does give Black the d5 square and leave our d4 pawn backward, but neither of these can be easily exploited. On the other hand, though, we usually use it to give our knight access to e4, open our bishop's diagonal and maybe get d6 as a future outpost.  Nd5  17.Nxd5  Bxd5  18.Bxe7  We have exchanged two of Black's best dark square defenders, leaving them very vulnerable.  Rxe7  19.Ng3 !  ±  Our knight is heading to f5 and then d6 with a fantastic position.   12...N6d7  is one way to trade off some minor pieces.  13.Bxe7  Qxe7  14.Nf4 !  A typical downside of putting the bishop on e6 is that it allows these annoying Nf4xe6 ideas.  Rad8  The rook is well-placed here in preparation for e4.  15.Nxe6  fxe6  16.e4  dxe4  17.Nxe4  +=  White's extra space and activity give him the edge. The e6 pawn is weaker and more easily attackable than our weakness on d4.  13.h3  Just like before, we cover the g4 square.  c5   13...N6d7  14.Bxe7  Qxe7  15.Nf4  Planning to grab on e6.  Ng6  16.Nxe6  Qxe6  17.e4  +=  We've achieved a good version of our usual break and have a definite edge.  14.dxc5  Bxc5  15.Nd4  Blockading Black's IQP. If he takes on d4, we have gained the bishop pair.  Bd7  16.Kh1  +=  Getting the king off the g1-a7 diagonal. We have great play against the d5 weakness.   11...h6  This is typically played in connection with ...Ne6 - the immediate ...Ne6 would lose a pawn to Bxf6 followed by Bxh7+.  12.Bh4  transposes to our mainline after 8...O-O.  Ne6  Sometimes the knight is useful on e6 to put pressure on d4 and prevent e4, but not here because of White's next move.   12...c5 ?!  is bad, just like 11... c5 and is dealt with in the same way:  13.Bxf6 !  Bxf6  14.dxc5  Rxe3  15.Rad1  d4  16.Be4  Be6  17.Nb5  ±  Black is losing his d4 pawn.   12...Be6  13.Rad1  The usual square for our rook.  Rc8  14.Kh1  Prophylaxis against a future ...c5 - we don't want any checks on the g1-a7 diagonal.  a6  15.Bf2  Tucking the bishop away on f2 is a nice idea in preparation for e4.  c5 !  Black needs to act soon because e4 was looming.  16.dxc5  Bxc5  17.Nd4  +=  As is typical, White is a bit better here thanks to the weak d5 pawn.  13.Bf2  Simple chess, covering d4 in preparation for e4.  b6  14.Rad1  Bb7  15.Kh1  +=  Giving White's bishop a fallback square after e4 ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. White is ready to play e4 and is comfortably better.   11...Nh5  Trading pieces tries to releases some of the pressure on Black - with fewer pieces on the board, space becomes less of a factor. On the other hand, the knight is a bit misplaced on h5 and this exchanging manoeuvre takes time, which Black lacks.  12.Bxe7  Qxe7  The more natural and popular recapture - we have no choice to charge forwards with e4, but who's complaining ?   12...Rxe7  looks a bit strange to me, but it has been played. The point is to leave the queen on d8, eyeing the d4 pawn.  13.Qd2  Protecting e3. e4 is premature since ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ne6 leaves d4 in an awkward spot.  Ne6  14.Rad1  g6  15.g4 !  Kicking the knight back and grabbing space. We've seen this plenty of times already.  Nf6  16.h3  +=  White's big space advantage gives him a pleasant edge.  13.e4  dxe4  is much more popular than 13... dxe4.   13...Be6  allows White to secure his big space advantage with  14.e5 !  Our position just plays itself with f4-f5 etc.  g6  15.f4  Ng7  16.Nd1 !  +=  Our knight is heading to e3, to support f5, with a great position.  14.fxe4  Be6  This is pretty much Black's only reasonable move here, although Black has tried a lot of other things as well.   14...Qg5 ?  is quite common, but very poor - Black's kingside play is doomed to fail since we have full control over the centre.  15.e5 !  Black's knight is caught offside on h5.  Bg4  16.Ne4  Qe3+  17.Kh1  +-  Black gave a check, but there's nothing more than that. Next, we kick the queen away with Rae1 with what the engine claims to be a winning advantage.   14...Bg4 ?!  Just like in the previous line, White can exploit the awkward position of Black's knight.  15.e5 !  Cutting off the knight's retreat.  Rad8  16.Ne4  ±  White has too many advantages here to name - we are clearly better.  15.Rad1  The d-pawn needs the rook's support more than the e-pawn.  Rad8  16.e5 !  The usual idea.  g6  17.Ne4  Our knight is on a fantastic square where it eyes both d6 and f6.  Bf5  18.Bc4  +=  White has an incredible position. Next, he can consider the exchange sacrifice with Rxf5. }
12. Rad1
{ This is recommended by both Schandorff in his fantastic repertoire book and by Kamil Plichta on Chessable. White can get an edge here against most Black options, except for 12... h6. I'd probably choose this move in practice over 12. e4 because 12... h6 hasn't really caught on yet as the best move for Black here, and until then I want to enjoy the great position White gets here !   12.e4 !?  If you don't like the position we get after 12. Rad1, you can maybe try this as well, although Black can probably still equalise.  dxe4  13.fxe4  Be6  14.Bxf6  Bxf6  15.e5  Be7  16.Rad1  ∞  I'd still choose White here, but objectively Black is close to equality. His bishop pair compensate for our extra space and activity, while our central pawns are pretty well blockaded. }
12... h6
{ 12...Be6  is Black's most popular move here which transposes to 11... Be6 after  13.h3   12...Nh5  13.Bxe7  Qxe7  14.e4  Qg5  Black is banking on a counterattack on the kingside based on ...Nf4.  15.Qd2 !  Offering the exchange of queens. The endgame is very good for White.  Nhf4  16.Nxf4  Nxf4  17.Kh1  +=  Black's idea isn't really working - we have a big centre and comfortable edge. }
13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Bxg6 { Damaging Black's pawn structure. } 14... fxg6 15. e4
{ Here's the interesting thing about this position: even though I think Black is objectively very close to equality, the practical results in this position don't reflect this at all ! Although the sample space is rather small - 13 games - White has won 7 games, while Black has only won a single 1 - that's 70%! The fact that the practical results don't reflect my objective evaluation could mean two things: 1. I'm a clown and my evaluation is nonsense. 2. The position might be equal, but in practice, there is plenty of play for both sides, and in reality, it is harder to play for Black. }
15... dxe4
{ Accurate.   15...g5 ?!  is not great, and would be my choice as Black if I was trying to un-equalise !  16.e5  Be7  17.f4 !  +=  And Kasparov had a great initiative against Barua which he ended up converting. }
16. fxe4 Bg5 { A good, active square for the bishop. } 17. h3
{ Covering the g4 square. } 17... Kh7 { Protecting g6. } 18. Nf4
{ White doesn't need to rush e5 necessarily. The knight on f4 is well-placed to put some pressure on g6. If Black is not careful, he could very easily fall victim to a very pretty Nxg6 sac. Let me end off this chapter with a rather long engine line to show how the game might continue - what's clear to me is this: 1. There's a lot of play left in this position. 2. Despite it being equal with the best play, I'd rather be White here. }
18... Rf8 { 18... Qf6 is good too - maybe better. } 19. Nxg6
{ The aforementioned sacrifice idea. } 19... Rxf1+ 20. Rxf1 Qxd4+ 21. Kh1 Be6
{ Only decent move - Black doesn't want his king running down the board and getting mated after 21... Kxg6 ! }
22. e5 { Protecting out knight and threatening mate with Nf8+. } 22... Kg8 23.
h4 Be3 24. Ne7+ Kh8 25. Ne4
{ With a very complex position still on the board. I feel like this is one of those 0.00 equal positions where Black has to play a string of accurate moves to hold, which is exactly what White is looking for out of the opening. White's knights are a true menace, and we have a draw already as a minimum with Ng6-e7-g6. And that brings our analysis of the Queen's Gambit Declined to an end ! I think White has little to fear here and can get a slight edge in most lines. I certainly enjoying facing the QGD since White's plans are easy to play and objectively strong. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }

4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, ...Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }

4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }

6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ e2 will be the knight's home for the majority of the rest of this chapter, for reasons explained later, but in this case, it is because our knight wants to go to f4. }
8... O-O 9. Nf4
{ One major disadvantage of having the bishop on e6 is that it is vulnerable to Nf4xe6 ideas. }
9... c5 10. O-O Rc8 11. Rc1
{ Black lacks a good plan here. Eventually, he'll most likely either end up stuck with a weak IQP, or he'll play ...c4. If he goes for ...c4, then we start preparing the e4 break since ...c4 makes it much stronger. Also, at any time White feels like it, we can grab the bishop pair with Nxe6. }

{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White.

Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Bd6

7. Bd3 O-O 8. Nf3
{ And this is it ! Throughout this chapter, we are going for the Nge2, f3 and e4 setup where possible, so why do we switch all of a sudden ? I realised that one of the points behind ...Bd6 is that it keeps the e-file open for Black's rook. This means that after something like ...h6 Bh4 ...Re8, White can't play f3 because the e3 pawn would hang - of course, with a bishop on e7 this wouldn't be the case. As a result, I think a change of plan is called for here. The rare 8. Nf3 still contains the idea of e4 at some point, but we are more likely to prepare it now with Nd2 instead. }
8... Bg4
{ This is Black's most popular move by far here, which seems like it equalises easily because the bishop can get to g6 to trade off our good bishop, but things aren't so simple for Black ! }
9. h3 Bh5 10. Qc2 Bg6 11. Bxg6 hxg6
{ Surely Black has succeeded here ? With our good bishop gone, what edge can White hope for ? }
12. h4
{ White doesn't only have a slight edge here, but a clear advantage. We haven't castled short, so this h4-h5 lever is highly effective. White's attack pretty much plays itself from here. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }

8... Re8 9. O-O h6 10. Bh4 Nbd7 11. Qc2 Nf8 12. h3
{ Fairly standard play all around. We are going to play Rae1 and e4 next if allowed. }
12... g5 { It looks like Black is winning a pawn here... } 13. Bg3 Bxg3
{ Grabbing the pawn isn't Black's best chance. } 14. fxg3 Rxe3 15. g4

This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Bf5
{ This is what 6. Qc2 tries to avoid. Black develops his bishop to its best square, thus 'forcing' White to go into an endgame which is slightly better for White, but which some Black players enjoy trying to hold. Let's see this endgame... }
7. Qf3 { White has no chance of getting an advantage with anything else. } 7...
Bg6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6
{ Of course, taking back with the pawn is far worse - Black's wrecked kingside pawn structure is more of a factor in the middlegame. }
9. Qxf6 gxf6
{ Right, so let's take stock. Black has the bishop pair, but in this position, they are rather useless since they have no targets and the position is relatively closed. White, on the other hand, has the far superior pawn structure - the doubled f-pawns and isolated h-pawn could cause Black some serious problems later on in the game. Players have realised that the Black side of this endgame isn't so bad - Black is objectively worse, but some players are happy to draw worse endgames. It's important to realise that White can't 'refute' Black's position here, but I think that a long term endgame advantage is already a success out of the opening. In practice, Black has struggled quite badly, with White scoring a very good 65% from this position. }
10. Nf3 Nd7 11. Nh4 Be7 12. Ne2
{ This move was a novelty when Carlsen introduced it in 2016 and used it to beat Kramnik in fantastic style. Since then, it has become White's second most common move in the position after the very natural 12. g3. What's White's idea ? We are rerouting our knight from c3 to the f5 outpost. Let's first see how Carlsen used this idea to beat Kramnik. }
12... Nb6
{ Kramnik's choice, when confronted with Carlsen's idea, has not been repeated by a GM since. }
13. Ng3 { Heading for f5. } 13... Bb4+
{ Forcing our king to d1, but this isn't a big deal. } 14. Kd1 Na4 15. Ngf5
{ The threat to b2 is an illusion. } 15... Kd7 16. Rb1 { Covering b2. } 16...
Ke6
{ This is a bit inaccurate since the king is exposed on e6, but White is already a bit better regardless. }
17. Bd3 { Developing and supporting f5. } 17... Rhc8 18. Ke2 Bf8 19. g4
{ Supporting f5 - Carlsen has an unshakeable grip over that outpost. } 19... c5
20. Ng2
{ A fantastic move and the essence of Carlsen's idea. With the knight secured on the f5 outpost, Carlsen reroutes his other knight to f4. The knight is coming to f4 with tempo and then he'll follow up with h4-h5. White is already winning and Carlsen converted flawlessly in 1-0  (50)  Carlsen, M  (2851)  -Kramnik,V  (2801)  Stavanger 2016 CBM 172. So what was Carlsen's basic plan after 12. Ne2 ?   
 Bring the knight to the f5 outpost with Nc3-e2-g3-f5.   Secure the knight with Bd3 and g4.   Improve the other knight's position with Nh4-g2-f4.    Run Black over with h2-h4-h5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White.

 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.

{ A very interesting endgame position. Both sides have damaged pawn structures, but the key difference and the reason White is better is that Black's bad pawns on the kingside are on the same colour as Black's bishop. This means that Black's bishop is very poor on g6 and the f5 pawn is an easy target. The endgame is by no means winning for White, but we certainly have an edge and White has scored well from this position. }

Ke7 16. Bh3 Rae8 17. Nf4

The key to Kramnik's success in that endgame was that he played on both sides of the board. It's easy to get fixated on the kingside and struggle to make progress. By playing on the queenside with a2-a4 and Ra1-a3-b3 White created more Black weaknesses and won relatively effortlessly. I'd recommend looking at some other games after 14. gxh4 as well to get a feel for how White's play develops. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }

4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... Nh5
{ A typical idea for Black, which we'll see much more of later since it is advocated by Ntirlis in his great 'Playing 1. d4 d5' book but with the insertion of 8... h6 first. Exchanging minor pieces helps Black alleviate the space problems he has. }

Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... Nh5
{ A typical idea for Black, which we'll see much more of later since it is advocated by Ntirlis in his great 'Playing 1. d4 d5' book but with the insertion of 8... h6 first. Exchanging minor pieces helps Black alleviate the space problems he has. }
9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. g4
{ is a very interesting idea. We exploit the position of Black's knight to grab as much space on the kingside while we have the chance. It is just a little bit less popular than the very natural 10. O-O. I've opted for this as my main recommendation since it's relatively forcing, so tricky move orders are avoided, and also it is objectively strong - Black needs to know his stuff here to get an equal position. }
10... Nhf6 11. Ng3
{ Defending g4 while simultaneously threatening Nf5. Black has several ways to deal with this threat and as a result, this is the major branching point after 8... Nh5. }
11... Nf8
{ This is possibly Black's best move objectively, but it has only been played a few times. The idea behind this move becomes apparent a bit later. }
12. g5 Ng8 13. h4 h6
{ Black's idea. The knights do a good job of helping Black chip away at White's g5 pawn. The point of ...Nf8 becomes clear now - it prevents g6. White needs to react precisely here - otherwise, he might well have been caught overextending on the kingside. }
14. Kd2
{ We want to recapture on h1 with our queen after the trades on g5. A good alternative is 14. Qa4. }
14... hxg5 15. hxg5 Rxh1 16. Qxh1 Qxg5 17. Rg1
{ We bring our final piece into the attack. } 17... Qh6 18. Nh5 { Hitting g7. }
18... Ne6 19. Nxg7+
{ White can also keep the attack going with something like Ne2. } 19... Nxg7
20. Qxh6 Nxh6 21. Rxg7

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop.

{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one.

 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... h6
{ Kicking our bishop back. The pawn on h6 has pros and cons - it controls the g5 square and White no longer can attack h7 with his queen + bishop battery, but it could also serve as a hook which White can attack. }
9. Bh4 O-O
{ Black commits to castling kingside before we do. This is a useful fact to be aware of if Black goes for the ... Nh5 idea again. }
10. Qc2 Nh5 { An idea which features again and again. } 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. g4

12... Nhf6 13. Rg1 { Protecting g4 and possibly preparing g5. } 13... Re8 14.
O-O-O Ne4 { Black needs to try and disrupt our lines of attack. } 15. Bxe4 dxe4
16. Kb1
{ White has a comfortable edge here connected to the weakness of the e4 pawn and our extra space on the kingside. }

We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }

Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... h6
{ Kicking our bishop back. The pawn on h6 has pros and cons - it controls the g5 square and White no longer can attack h7 with his queen + bishop battery, but it could also serve as a hook which White can attack. }
9. Bh4 Nh5

Since its popularity will inevitably pick up and it is a challenging line, I will cover this line in quite some depth - so I apologise if some of the variations appear rather long. The deeper analysis was necessary to try to counter his book's recommendations, which I think I might have done successfully. }
10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. O-O

{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }

4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... h6
{ Kicking our bishop back. The pawn on h6 has pros and cons - it controls the g5 square and White no longer can attack h7 with his queen + bishop battery, but it could also serve as a hook which White can attack. }
9. Bh4 Nh5
{ This is the recommendation of Ntirlis in his great 'Playing 1. d4 d5' book. This is a serious equalising attempt for Black and Ntirlis analysed it in great depth. Since its popularity will inevitably pick up and it is a challenging line, I will cover this line in quite some depth - so I apologise if some of the variations appear rather long. The deeper analysis was necessary to try to counter his book's recommendations, which I think I might have done successfully. }
10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. O-O
{ Note that our plan of g4 doesn't work here since Black already has his pawn on h6 to prevent any further g4-g5 advances. }
11... O-O 12. Qd2
{ The best way to implement our idea of f3 on the next move. d2 is more suitable for the f3 plan than the c2 square because it protects the e3 pawn. Note that this is why we have been delaying the development of our queen for so long ! We want to be flexible so that we can choose between d2 and c2 when necessary. This position hasn't been reached more than 20 times at the time of writing, but it is bound to pick up in popularity. }
12... Nb6
{ The recommendation of Ntirlis. The knight gets out of the bishop's way and eyes the c4 square. If our bishop ever moves, ...Nc4 can be unpleasant - that is why in many variations we play the prophylactic b3. }
13. f3
{ As we've seen already in this chapter, this is a standard idea. Here, however, it has 2 purposes: 1. The obvious idea is to prepare e4.2. The less obvious, but more interesting idea is to prepare g4. With Black's knight on h5 and pawn on h6, we are ideally placed to expand on the kingside. }
13... Bd7 { Natural development. } 14. g4
{ This is absolutely the critical way to play. White expands on the kingside, gaining important space for his pieces. Our general idea here is to use our extra space to put our pieces in positions where they can take advantage of the open lines we will create. To create these open lines, we will exploit the h6 'hook' by playing h4 followed by g5. }
14... Nf6 15. Nf4
{ This position has only been reached once, so the analysis that follows is highly theoretical, in the sense it hasn't been tested yet. However, we will be going a bit deeper here as this is the mainline in Ntirlis' QGD book, so it is important to deal with his recommendation. Players shouldn't concern themselves too much with memorising the lines that follow - instead, keep in mind our general idea over the next few moves: we bring our other rook to e1, and then play on the kingside with h4. The idea is to crack open the h-file with g5 and then get good play against Black's king. }
15... c5
{ Black gets his counterplay underway immediately. This is Ntirlis' recommendation. }
16. h4 { Planning g5 of course. } 16... Rac8 17. Rae1 Rfe8 18. g5

{ The king is safer on g3. } 28. Qh7+ Kf8 29. Rd1 Qg7 30. Qh2

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }

[Black "Queen's Gambit Declined 5...c6 & 6...Be7 Variation 33"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... O-O { This is the old mainline. transposing to the mainline. } 9. Qc2
{ transposes. } 9... Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. f3
{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many Black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. We must prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black: 1.11... c5 ?! is poor and allows White to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.2.11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.3.11... Be6 is a natural developing move and Black's most popular choice, but I think White is doing pretty well here. 4.11... h6 is played with the idea of preparing ...Ne6, but White is doing well here too. 5. 11... Nh5 trades bishops to relieve some pressure, however, it misplaces Black's knight and is a bit too slow to equalise. 6.11... Ng6, in connection with 12... h6, is in my view the most accurate way for Black to play from this position. Black's idea is to simply pick up the bishop pair. This isn't too popular at the moment and it has scored well for White in practice anyway. }
11... Be6
{ This normal developing move is Black's most common choice, which is quite nice because I think White can get quite a promising position here. }
12. Rad1 { The standard square for our rook, supporting d4. } 12... Ng6
{ A common move in this position and a standard square for Black's knight. }
13. h3
{ I like this move and we'll be seeing more of it later on too. The obvious idea behind it is to cover the g4 square to prevent ...Ng4 after we play e4 ...dxe5 fxe4, but the more interesting idea is to support g4 in certain situations. }
13... Rc8 14. e4
{ We are ready to charge forth. In one of our Model Games, Sasikiran - C.Hansen, White played 14.a3 instead which is a bit less accurate - however, the game is still instructive and I highly recommend taking a lok. }
14... dxe4 15. fxe4 Qc7 16. e5
{ The standard way to arrange our central pawns. It does give Black the d5 square and leave our d4 pawn backward, but neither of these can be easily exploited. On the other hand, though, we usually use it to give our knight access to e4, open our bishop's diagonal and maybe get d6 as a future outpost. }
16... Nd5 17. Nxd5 Bxd5 18. Bxe7
{ We have exchanged two of Black's best dark square defenders, leaving them very vulnerable. }
18... Rxe7 19. Ng3
{ Our knight is heading to f5 and then d6 with a fantastic position. } *

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }

{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2

{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many Black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. We must prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black: 1.11... c5 ?! is poor and allows White to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.2.11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.3.11...

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... O-O { This is the old mainline. transposing to the mainline. } 9. Qc2
{ transposes. } 9... Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. f3
{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many Black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. We must prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black: 1.11... c5 ?! is poor and allows White to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.2.11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.3.11... Be6 is a natural developing move and Black's most popular choice, but I think White is doing pretty well here. 4.11... h6 is played with the idea of preparing ...Ne6, but White is doing well here too. 5. 11... Nh5 trades bishops to relieve some pressure, however, it misplaces Black's knight and is a bit too slow to equalise. 6.11... Ng6, in connection with 12... h6, is in my view the most accurate way for Black to play from this position. Black's idea is to simply pick up the bishop pair. This isn't too popular at the moment and it has scored well for White in practice anyway. }
11... Nh5
{ Trading pieces tries to releases some of the pressure on Black - with fewer pieces on the board, space becomes less of a factor. On the other hand, the knight is a bit misplaced on h5 and this exchanging manoeuvre takes time, which Black lacks. }
12. Bxe7 Qxe7
{ The more natural and popular recapture - we have no choice to charge forwards with e4, but who's complaining ? }
13. e4 Be6 { allows White to secure his big space advantage with } 14. e5
{ Our position just plays itself with f4-f5 etc. } 14... g6 15. f4 Ng7 16. Nd1

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... O-O { This is the old mainline. transposing to the mainline. } 9. Qc2
{ transposes. } 9... Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. f3
{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many Black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. We must prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black: 1.11... c5 ?! is poor and allows White to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.2.11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.3.11... Be6 is a natural developing move and Black's most popular choice, but I think White is doing pretty well here. 4.11... h6 is played with the idea of preparing ...Ne6, but White is doing well here too. 5. 11... Nh5 trades bishops to relieve some pressure, however, it misplaces Black's knight and is a bit too slow to equalise. 6.11... Ng6, in connection with 12... h6, is in my view the most accurate way for Black to play from this position. Black's idea is to simply pick up the bishop pair. This isn't too popular at the moment and it has scored well for White in practice anyway. }
11... Ng6
{ I think this Black's only way to equalise from the tabiya on the previous move, but only in connection with a specific follow-up. The knight is good on g6 - it performs the important function of cutting off our bishop's retreat to h4. }
12. e4
{ If you don't like the position we get after 12. Rad1, you can maybe try this as well, although Black can probably still equalise. }
12... dxe4 13. fxe4 Be6 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. e5 Be7 16. Rad1
{ I'd still choose White here, but objectively Black is close to equality. His bishop pair compensate for our extra space and activity, while our central pawns are pretty well blockaded. }

The fact that the practical results don't reflect my objective evaluation could mean two things: 1. I'm a clown and my evaluation is nonsense. 2. The position might be equal, but in practice, there is plenty of play for both sides, and in reality, it is harder to play for Black. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
{ The Queen's Gambit Declined is just about as classical as openings get. Black supports his pawn on d5 and prepares to develop his dark bishop, most likely to e7. Black intends to simply complete his kingside development and then castle. There is a downside to ...e6, however, and that is the fact that Black blocks in his light bishop. Much like in the French Defence against 1. e4, the success of Black's opening often hinges on whether or not he can successfully deploy his 'problem bishop'. In recent times, many players have preferred to reach the Queen's Gambit Declined via a different move order with 1... Nf6, 2... e6 and 3... d5 to avoid the Exchange Variation, which is often considered to be good for White. Although the situation might not be as cut and dry as many assume, I still think that White can get a very comfortable position against the QGD in the Exchange Variation and this is supported by White's fantastic practical results. }
3. Nc3
{ There are other options, such as 3. Nf3 or 3. g3 with a Catalan, but as mentioned before, we are heading for the Exchange Variation. }
3... Nf6
{ Finally, we get to the main move - 3...Nf6. Black develops classically - knights before bishops. }
4. cxd5
{ The famous Exchange Variation which put many a Black player off the Queen's Gambit with 1... d5 2... e6. The reasons behind this exchange will be discussed after 4...exd5. }
4... exd5
{ Finally, we have dealt with all of Black's deviations on the way the QGD proper. So, why did we play 4. cxd5 ? What exactly did we gain ? Here's what:   
 By fixing the pawn structure, White limits Black's counterplay based on ...c5. We often still see him attempt this typical break anyway, but now he risks being saddled with a weak IQP which will give White a long term advantage.   Black's other methods of counterplay are also less effective, such as ...b6 and ...Ba6 since that would leave Black's pawn on c6 weakened.    Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the rigid pawn structure makes it easier for White to carry out either of the two most famous plans in this Carlsbad pawn structure.     The two famous plans I'm talking about are:   
 Developing normally and putting the knight on f3, combined with castling short and launching White's b-pawn up the board with b4-b5 to create weaknesses on the queenside. This is known as the minority attack.  Putting the knight on e2 instead, combined with central play based on playing the e4 break after preparing it with f3. This was Kasparov's plan of choice which discouraged many Black players from going for this form of the QGD.   
There is a third plan too, involving long castling and a kingside attack, but this is more situational I feel. Of the two plans, my preference is for the second one. Direct play in the centre with f3 and e4 is very strong and more in keeping with the theme of this repertoire.   But what about the drawbacks of 4. cxd5 ? The most obvious one would seem to be that Black is now free to develop his bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal, but as we will see, it's not that simple. Black still struggles to play ...Bf5 for concrete reasons - either White's bishop gets to the diagonal first, or the b7 pawn becomes vulnerable to Qb3. }
5. Bg5
{ The most active square for the bishop, pinning the knight and threatening Bxf6. The tricky thing about learning and writing about this variation is that there are so many different move order variants, for both sides - Black will usually play ...c6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Re8, .. .Nf8, ...h6 at some point, but there are so many different move orders ! Most should transpose to the mainline, but I'll point out the nuances and tricks you must watch out for along the way. }
5... c6
{ Black's most flexible move order. As we saw already, most roads do lead to Rome here, but Black does have one extra option which we'll examine shortly, after 5... c6. }
6. e3
{ White's most common move, but it's not the only move order. 6. Qc2 first is directed against 6... Bf5, which is can be an annoying option for some people - we allow 6... Bf5, because I think the ensuing endgame is quite good for White. Also, the other reason we stay flexible with 6. e3 becomes apparent later - the added flexibility for our queen means that we can also put it on d2, which is very useful in certain variations like those recommended by Ntirlis based on ...Nh5. }
6... Be7 7. Bd3 { Natural development. } 7... Nbd7 8. Nge2
{ I think this is an important finesse to remember for White. We don't want to commit our queen too early - often the queen is better on d2 than c2 since from d2 it can protect the e3 pawn after we play f3. }
8... O-O { This is the old mainline. transposing to the mainline. } 9. Qc2
{ transposes. } 9... Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. f3
{ Finally we reach the biggest tabiya in the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation. This has been reached about 2500 times and White scores a very impressive 67% at the time of writing ! White's success in this position caused many Black players to look elsewhere for good alternatives - this resulted in the growth in popularity of lines like 3... Be7 and lines with an early ...Nh5. White's plan in this position is no secret: we are going to play e4. However, the timing of this is very important - play e4 too early and Black can equalise very easily, with ideas like ...dxe4 fxe4 ...Ng4. We must prepare this, for example by bringing our other rook to e1 and then dropping our bishop back to f2. This is a major branching point for Black: 1.11... c5 ?! is poor and allows White to win a pawn after 12. Bxf6.2.11... g6 is a respectable idea, covering h7 and preparing ...Ne6.3.11... Be6 is a natural developing move and Black's most popular choice, but I think White is doing pretty well here. 4.11... h6 is played with the idea of preparing ...Ne6, but White is doing well here too. 5. 11... Nh5 trades bishops to relieve some pressure, however, it misplaces Black's knight and is a bit too slow to equalise. 6.11... Ng6, in connection with 12... h6, is in my view the most accurate way for Black to play from this position. Black's idea is to simply pick up the bishop pair. This isn't too popular at the moment and it has scored well for White in practice anyway. }
11... Ng6
{ I think this Black's only way to equalise from the tabiya on the previous move, but only in connection with a specific follow-up. The knight is good on g6 - it performs the important function of cutting off our bishop's retreat to h4. }
12. Rad1
{ This is recommended by both Schandorff in his fantastic repertoire book and by Kamil Plichta on Chessable. White can get an edge here against most Black options, except for 12... h6. I'd probably choose this move in practice over 12. e4 because 12... h6 hasn't really caught on yet as the best move for Black here, and until then I want to enjoy the great position White gets here ! }
12... h6
{ Picking up the bishop pair. The odd thing is that this move is relatively rare, being only played around 20 times or so at the time of writing. From that 11. f3 tabiya, this is the only sequence which equalises, at least in my mind. }
13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Bxg6 { Damaging Black's pawn structure. } 14... fxg6 15. e4
{ Here's the interesting thing about this position: even though I think Black is objectively very close to equality, the practical results in this position don't reflect this at all ! Although the sample space is rather small - 13 games - White has won 7 games, while Black has only won a single 1 - that's 70%! The fact that the practical results don't reflect my objective evaluation could mean two things: 1. I'm a clown and my evaluation is nonsense. 2. The position might be equal, but in practice, there is plenty of play for both sides, and in reality, it is harder to play for Black. }
15... dxe4 { Accurate. } 16. fxe4 Bg5 { A good, active square for the bishop. }
17. h3 { Covering the g4 square. } 17... Kh7 { Protecting g6. } 18. Nf4
{ White doesn't need to rush e5 necessarily. The knight on f4 is well-placed to put some pressure on g6. If Black is not careful, he could very easily fall victim to a very pretty Nxg6 sac. Let me end off this chapter with a rather long engine line to show how the game might continue - what's clear to me is this: 1. There's a lot of play left in this position. 2. Despite it being equal with the best play, I'd rather be White here. }
18... Rf8 { 18... Qf6 is good too - maybe better. } 19. Nxg6
{ The aforementioned sacrifice idea. } 19... Rxf1+ 20. Rxf1 Qxd4+ 21. Kh1 Be6
{ Only decent move - Black doesn't want his king running down the board and getting mated after 21... Kxg6 ! }
22. e5 { Protecting out knight and threatening mate with Nf8+. } 22... Kg8 23.
h4 Be3 24. Ne7+ Kh8 25. Ne4
{ With a very complex position still on the board. I feel like this is one of those 0.00 equal positions where Black has to play a string of accurate moves to hold, which is exactly what White is looking for out of the opening. White's knights are a true menace, and we have a draw already as a minimum with Ng6-e7-g6. And that brings our analysis of the Queen's Gambit Declined to an end ! I think White has little to fear here and can get a slight edge in most lines. I certainly enjoying facing the QGD since White's plans are easy to play and objectively strong. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6
{ We covered this move in the previous chapter, but not in its entirety...   3...c5  Now that we have completed our dissection of the QGD Proper, we need to go on a detour to see how to deal with the Tarrasch Defence, as well as the Semi-Tarrasch Defence. The Tarrasch Defence enjoyed a brief spurt of popularity when it was essayed by Kasparov in his World Championship Match against Karpov, but he gave it up shortly afterwards. These days the Tarrasch doesn't enjoy the best theoretical reputation. Typically, Black relies on active piece play to compensate for the Isolated Queen's Pawn, or IQP, that he receives, but this is often not enough.  4.cxd5  The first step in saddling Black with the IQP.  exd5  This natural recapture is not the only move. Black can also play 4... cxd4, known as the Von Hennig-Scharra Gambit. This is quite dubious though and will be covered in the chapter dealing with Black's deviations after 1... d5.  5.Nf3  Natural development. We want to recapture on d4 with our knight.  Nc6  Developing while side-stepping the pin after 5... Nf6.   5...Nf6  has for a long time been thought to be an inaccurate way to develop as White gets the chance to immediately pin Black's knight, thus putting a huge amount of pressure on d5 - however, it has recently been given a few tries by Carlsen in some rapid and blitz games.  6.Bg5  Pinning Black's knight and putting pressure on d5. White scores an incredible 70% from here !  Be6  Supporting d5 is probably Black's best chance of making this work.   6...Nc6 ?!  If Black's previous move was inaccurate, then this is a definite mistake.  7.Bxf6 !  Black must choose between permanently wrecking his kingside pawn structure and giving up a pawn.  Qxf6  Recapturing with the pawn is just as bad.  8.Nxd5  Qd8  9.dxc5  Be6  10.e4  ±  Black has virtually nothing for the extra pawn.  7.e3  c4  Otherwise Black will just get saddled with a very poor IQP.  8.Be2  Be7  9.O-O  O-O  10.Bxf6  Bxf6  11.b3  A typical idea when Black plays ...c4. Black has little choice but to take our pawn, which opens up the b and c files for our major pieces and exposes the weakness on d5.  cxb3  12.Qxb3  +=  The d5 pawn is a long-term weakness and we have very good play down the b and c-files, while Black is yet to fully develop.  6.dxc5 !  I like this simple and direct way of meeting the Tarrasch. It is only White's 5th most common move, but White scores a massive 65% here. White can get a slight pull here almost effortlessly and Black has no real way to avoid this. The mainline here is 6. g3. Aagaard and Ntirlis put a lot of analytical effort into this variation to prove equality, but I think it is a difficult task - White seems to be able to get a slight, but lasting edge in most lines. They view this variation as one of the Tarrasch's biggest challenges.  d4 !  The only real option which is played here. Otherwise, White either wins the d5 pawn or gets to keep his c5 pawn. Black uses some little tactics here to recoup his pawn.  7.Na4  Bxc5  Using a little tactic to recoup the pawn.   7...b5 ?!  is played with the idea of gambiting the pawn, but this is plain bad.  8.cxb6  axb6  9.e3  Bb4+  10.Bd2  dxe3  Note that if Black takes on d2, we can just recapture with our queen since our knight on a4 is indirectly defended by the Bb5 fork.  11.Bxb4  Qxd1+  12.Rxd1  It doesn't matter which piece Black takes - he is losing.  Nxb4  13.Bb5+  Ke7  14.Nxb6  +-  Black is dead lost here.  8.Nxc5  Qa5+  Black uses a simple fork to get his material back. This is a major branching point for White in this variation - we can either block the check with the bishop or the queen. Blocking with the bishop looks more natural, but Qd2 has its advantages too - the queen gets to keep its eye on the vulnerable d4 pawn. Both of these moves look promising for White. I spent a few hours analysing both of these variations and comparing my findings with those of Ntirlis and Aagaard. They did a remarkable job of analysing this variation to incredible depths to prove equality for Black - in many cases, the variations were well over 30 moves deep and concluding in single rook endings. Despite this, I think White can still get a slight edge into the endgame as I'll show.  9.Bd2 !  Because of the long mainline given after 9. Qd2 which should equalise for Black with very accurate play, I've opted for 9. Bd2 as my main recommendation. Blocking the check with the bishop is certainly more natural. Our idea here will not be to win the d4 pawn, but rather to play e3 and then enjoy lasting pressure thanks to our bishop pair.   9.Qd2 !?  Although this isn't my main choice, I think it is good to show some of the main ideas here in case you prefer it or want an alternative. The idea is to ramp up the pressure on d4 as quickly as possible, by developing our dark bishop with a3, b4 and Bb2.  Qxc5  10.a3  Preparing b4 and Bb2.10. e3 is a bit more popular but after 10. a3 White scores an incredible 75%!  Nge7 !  The recommendation of Ntirlis and Aagaard and a good one ! This seems a bit mysterious at first, but it has a rather deep concrete idea: White will win the d4 pawn, but Black then plans to attack our queen on d4 with a knight on c6 and get compensation in the form of pressure on our queenside pawns and a lead in development.  11.b4  Kicking the queen away and preparing Bb2.  Qb6  12.Bb2  O-O  13.Bxd4  Nxd4  14.Qxd4  Seemingly White is just a pawn up... but things are not so easy !  Nc6 !  Attacking our queen. Note that exchanging queens isn't an option since one of the queenside pawns will fall or Black will get a huge amount of play.  15.Qb2   15.Qc3 !?  This is an interesting novelty which I analysed a bit with a rather clever idea.  Bg4 !  is Black's best bet here which should equalise.   15...a5  Black reacts in the same way as after 15. Qb2, but this allows us to execute our idea.  16.b5 !  is the point. We give the pawn back so that we can complete our development and then put pressure on Black's b7 pawn. Note that with the queen on b2 this isn't possible since Black can just play ...a4 and .. .Na5 since the b5 pawn is pinned.  Qxb5  17.e3  Qb6  18.Bd3  Bg4  19.Rb1  Qc7  20.O-O  +=  followed by Rb5 with a definite edge thanks to our pressure on b7.  16.e3  Bxf3  17.gxf3  Rfe8  18.Be2 =  Black has compensation for the pawn and should equalise with accurate play, but I still prefer White.  15...a5  16.b5  a4 !  Black is preparing ...Na5-b3.  17.e3  Na5  18.Qd4  We have some other options here such as 18. Nd4, but this is probably my favourite.  Qc7  19.Qb4  Dodging the ...Nb3 fork.  Rd8  20.Be2  Nb3  21.Rd1  Rxd1+  22.Bxd1  Qa5  23.Qxa5  Rxa5  24.Bxb3  axb3  25.Kd2  Rxa3  26.Kc3  All of this is somewhat forced.  Be6 !  Precise.  27.Nd4  Ra2  28.Nxe6  fxe6  29.Rf1  Ra5  30.Rb1  Rxb5  31.Rxb3  Rc5+  32.Kd3 =  Quite incredibly, this was all covered by Ntirlis and Aagaard in their book - a very impressive piece of analysis, especially considering that the book was published in 2011! They conclude that Black should hold without much difficulty here, but I'd like to add that White should definitely play on from here - Black can certainly still go wrong and in most variations, I analysed Black has to sacrifice the b7 pawn at some point to draw. White can still try a plan like e4 followed by Rc3-c7 here. I think it's also important to keep in mind here that Black had to play 20+ accurate moves to reach a marginally worse rook ending - memorising variations like these is a near-impossible task for many players, so practically White scores very well in this whole variation of the Tarrasch.  9...Qxc5  10.Rc1  Hitting the queen and activating the rook - very logical. Another interesting try which scores very well for White in practice and is also quite strong is the pawn sacrifice 10. b4 !? - it has the advantage of not being covered by Ntirlis and Aagaard as well.  Qb6  11.e3 !  Our idea - getting rid of the d4 thorn and opening the position for our bishops.  Nf6  Black ignores White's previous move and continues developing.   11...dxe3  This is very natural, but it's probably not best as it wastes a tempo compared to the mainline, or forces Black to grab the b2 pawn to justify his play.  12.Bxe3  Qxb2  The only way for Black to justify his previous move.   12...Qb4+  13.Bd2  Qe7+  14.Be2  ±  White has an extra tempo over the mainline of 11... Nf6 since we didn't play Bf1-c4-e2. Our bishop pair gives us a comfortable advantage here.  13.Bc4  As we will see, Black has won a pawn but fallen very dangerously behind in development.  Qb4+  14.Nd2  Nge7  15.Bc5  Hitting the queen and putting pressure on e7.  Qb2  16.O-O  O-O  17.Re1  17. Ne4 is also good here with the idea of hopping into d6.  Rd8  18.Bxe7  Rxd2  19.Bxf7+ !  A bolt from the blue.  Kxf7  20.Qf3+  Bf5 !  Forced, so that Black's rook covers f8.  21.Qxf5+  Kg8  22.Bg5  +=  White's initiative persists here and is definitely for choice.  12.Bc4 !  As do we ! Development is the priority here.  dxe3  The recommendation of Ntirlis and Aagaard.   12...O-O  13.O-O  White scores an incredible 94% from this position at the time of writing !  Bg4  ...Be6 is also possible, but then we get to play against the isolated e6 pawn.  14.exd4  Nxd4  15.Be3  Forcing a trade into a good endgame for White.  Bxf3  16.Qxd4  Qxd4  17.Bxd4  Bc6  18.f3 !  +=  Blunting Black's bishop and knight. I could hardly imagine a better situation for White's bishop pair - the board is wide open for them to wreak havoc. From this ending after 17... Bc6, at the time of writing White won 6 out of 7 games, with one draw, so clearly it is very difficult to defend this in practice.  13.Bxe3  Qb4+  Grabbing the pawn here is even worse than last time. Black is trying to trade off queens.  14.Qd2 !  I think White has a few good options here, including 14. Bd2 and 14. Kf1 !?, both of which should give White an edge - however, I prefer the endgame here since I think we can transform our advantage now into something more permanent.  Qxd2+  15.Kxd2  The other recaptures are OK too.  O-O  16.Rhd1  Ng4  This was the idea given by Ntirlis and Aagaard, trying to eliminate our bishop pair.  17.Ke2  Getting our king out of the way.  Re8  18.Bb5 !  I like this simple idea - we want to take on c6 to damage Black's pawn structure.  Nxe3  19.fxe3  Be6  Threatening a2.  20.b3  Rac8  21.Bxc6 !  White can throw in Ng5 first maybe, but this is good enough.  bxc6  22.Rd4 !  +=  Black is saddled with permanent weaknesses on a7 and c6. In future, we will target this, perhaps with Ra4-a6/a5. Black will probably be able to hold here eventually with accurate play, but I don't envy his situation - the endgame grinders out there would love White's position here. }
4. cxd5 Nxd5
{ Black can also recapture on d5 with his knight ! This knight recapture has picked up in popularity recently since it is seen as a solid option for Black and good for a draw. It typically leads to an opening known as the Semi-Tarrasch, which has been championed by Kramnik among others. }
5. e4 { Grabbing the whole centre must be critical. } 5... Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5
{ The position is quite similar to a Grunfeld, with the difference being that Black played ...e6 instead of ...g6. }
7. Nf3 cxd4 8. cxd4 Bb4+
{ 8...Nc6  should in most cases transpose to 8... Bb4+, but Back has one independent idea.  9.Bc4  b5 ?!  The natural 9... Bb4+ just transposes to the mainline. The b5 pawn is taboo of course due to ...Qa5+. Black reasons that the "free" ...b5 move is to his advantage, but in reality, it is more of a weakness at this early point.  10.Be2  Bb4+  11.Bd2  Qa5  12.a4 !  Exploiting Black's overextended b5 pawn.  Bxd2+  13.Qxd2  Qxd2+  14.Kxd2  bxa4  15.Rxa4  ±  White is clearly better in this endgame. The passed a-pawn is more of a liability than a strength right now since Black is so underdeveloped. }
9. Bd2 Bxd2+
{ 9...Qa5 ?!  is chosen by Black players who really want to get the queens off the board, but it's not very good.  10.Rb1 !  Forcing Black to take on d2.  Bxd2+  11.Qxd2  Qxd2+  12.Kxd2  O-O  13.Bb5 !  ±  This endgame is very good for White - we have serious pressure on the b-file and Black has no comfortable way to develop his queenside, plus a big centre and an active king to boot. }
10. Qxd2
{ After a somewhat forced last few moves, the dust has settled and we can now take stock. We have reached a position very similar to a typical Grunfeld structure with a few key differences: both dark bishops have been exchanged and Black has played ...e6 instead of ...g6. Much like the Grunfeld, White has a nice big centre and a space advantage, while Black has the queenside 2 v 1 pawn majority. The usefulness of White's space is limited by the fact that two pairs of minor pieces have already been exchanged. Black hopes for more exchanges so that he can put his queenside pawn majority to good use. On the other hand, we will be trying to keep pieces on the board and use our big centre to put Black under pressure. I think White's most promising plan is based on central play with d5, so that's what we will be preparing over the next few moves. }
10... O-O 11. Bc4 { The best square for the bishop where it aids our d5 plan. }
11... Nd7
{ 11... b6 should just transpose in a move or two. The knight is better on d7 than c6 since it won't block the bishop on b7 or exposed to d5 with tempo.   11...Nc6  is Black's second most common try, putting pressure on d4, but it comes with the downside of leaving the knight exposed to the d5 break with tempo.  12.O-O  b6  13.Rfe1  Getting ready to break with d5, just like in the mainline.  Bb7  14.Rad1  We want both rooks in the centre before playing d5.  Rc8   14...Na5  15.Bf1  Much rarer than 15. Bd3, but since we are playing for d5 I'd rather get the bishop completely out of the way.  Rc8  16.d5  exd5  17.exd5  Qd6  18.Ng5  +=  I like White's position here. He can combine ideas of attacking the kingside with Qd3-h3 with ideas of pushing the d-pawn further down the board.  15.d5  exd5  15... Na5 would transpose to 14... Na5 after 15. Bf1. Here recapturing with the bishop or with the pawn are both good - for the sake of simplicity and consistency, I've gone with the pawn recapture.  16.exd5  Na5  17.Bf1  transposing to 14... Na5. }
12. O-O b6
{ Preparing to fianchetto Black's bishop.   12...Nf6  13.Rfe1  b6  just transposes to 12... b6 after  14.Rad1 }
13. Rfe1
{ Since we are playing for d5, we want our rooks on the central e- and d-files. }
13... Bb7 14. Rad1
{ There is an alternative plan based on a4-a5, but I found it a bit difficult to find anything for White if Black plays ...a5 ! blocking the advance. Instead, we are preparing d5. }
14... Rc8 15. Bb3
{ Definitely the better square for the bishop - Bd3 does nothing to help with the d5 break. This position has featured quite prominently at the elite level - Black has a few different setups he can try at this point. }
15... Re8
{ Nowadays, this setup with a knight on f6 and a rook on e8 has overtaken the ...Qf6 setup in popularity, at least at the top level. This seems to be Black's best bet at equality in this line. I have given two lines and here and you can decide which you prefer as White.   15...Qf6  Black prevents the activation of White's queen via f4. This was the older of Black's setups.  16.Qe3  White improves his position slowly, getting ready for d5.  Rfd8  17.h3  h6  18.d5 !  This seems like a good time to make the d5 break. White's most popular move is 18. Nh2 with the two-fold idea of kicking back Black's queen with Ng4 and expanding with f4. Despite this, I prefer Leela's suggestion here of the immediate 18. d5 - the move is based on the idea of a positional pawn sacrifice.  Nc5  This seems to be critical response.   18...e5  This has been played in all three games after 18. d5, but it gives White a comfortable edge thanks to White's protected passed d-pawn.  19.Ba4 !  is the right idea, played by Ponomariov. White wants to take on d7 if allowed.  Nc5  Black shouldn't allow this exchange of course.  20.Bb5  b5 is a great square for White's bishop where it restricts both of Black's minor pieces since exchanges generally favour White now that we have a protected passed pawn.  Rc7  21.Rc1  Qd6  22.Nd2 !  Our knight is heading for c4.  Ba6  23.Bxa6  Nxa6  24.Rxc7  Qxc7  25.Nf1 !  +=  We are switching our attention to the kingside now and bringing our knight to f5. White has a very comfortable edge here thanks to his space and protected passed pawn.  19.Nd4 !  The point - White is now threatening e5.  exd5  20.e5 !  This was the idea behind the immediate d5. We sacrifice a pawn for incredible positional compensation: with one move, we get the great d4 outpost for our knight, blunt Black's bishop and get the chance to expand rapidly on the kingside with f4-f5, all at the cost of a pawn.  Qg5  Provoking f4 so that after ...Qg6, Bc2 can be met with ...Ne4.  21.f4  Qg6  White has a couple of promising ways to develop his play on the kingside now.  22.Qf3 !  Introducing the idea of h4-h5. The immediate 22. f5 is also decent. Black seriously lacks counterplay here.  Rc7  23.Kh2 !  +=  Quite a deep idea - White is planning h4-h5 next, after which Black will probably be forced to play ...Qg4 and exchange queens. This will leave a vulnerable pawn on g4 which is now closer to being picked up by our king with Kh2-g3xg4. }
16. d5
{ One of two major options White has and my main choice. Black should equalise here with best play, but not without some suffering first - White is always the one pushing with his passed d-pawn. In practice, White has scored quite well in this variation, from the limited tests available - over 60%.   16.h3 !?  The usual little improving move was the one used in both Candidate's tournaments and is White's most popular choice.  Nf6  17.Qf4  The best, most active square for our queen.  Nh5  Kicking the queen back.  18.Qh2  h6  This important position has been reached twice in the 2018 Candidates tournament alone.  19.Ne5  This could be White's best way to try get an edge here.  Nf6  20.Qf4  b5  21.Re3  21. Nxf7 !? is an interesting alternative which leads to a long forcing line concluding in an equal rook ending.  Rc7  22.Nd3  Rc3  23.Nc5  Rxe3  24.Qxe3 =  was reached in 0-1  (43)  Mamedyarov,S  (2809)  -Ding,L  (2769)  Berlin 2018 CBM 184. The position is roughly equal and Black went on to win, but I still think I'd marginally prefer White here thanks to his nice centre and strong knight. }
16... exd5 17. exd5 Nc5
{ The only move which equalises I think. The knight is best on c5. } 18. d6
Bxf3 19. Rxe8+ Qxe8 20. gxf3
{ An interesting position. White's kingside structure is terrible, but because of the limited material and our passed d-pawn, Black has no way to attack our king. The d-pawn is a big trump card here as it ties down Black's pieces - however, it is difficult to find a way for White to break through with accurate defend from Black. Regardless, White is the one pushing here - Black has limited counterplay and is pretty much subjected to joyless defence for the rest of the game. In this position, 2 moves have been tried at the time of writing: 20... Qd7 and the improvement 20.. .Qc6 !. }
20... Qc6
{ Black's best move, found by Dominguez Perez, and probably his best shot at equalising. f3 is of course threatened.   20...Qd7  This was played twice and is a bit passive. White has time to grab control of the e-file and put Black under some pressure.  21.Re1  Re8 ?!  This was played in both games, but it's not best - however White retains a comfortable edge after something like 21... Ne6 anyway.  22.Rxe8+  Qxe8  23.Qg5  Kf8  24.Qd5  ±  White's d-pawn combined with the active queen give him a clear advantage. White went on to win a fantastic game in 1-0  (79)  Anton Guijarro, D  (2643)  -Bindrich, F  (2610)  Skopje 2019 }
21. Qg5 { Preparing to meet Qxf3 with d7. } 21... Re8 22. Kg2
{ White is still pushing - Black has quite a bit of defence to do here before he can draw. }

White can still try a plan like e4 followed by Rc3-c7 here. I think it's also important to keep in mind here that Black had to play 20+ accurate moves to reach a marginally worse rook ending - memorising variations like these is a near-impossible task for many players, so practically White scores very well in this whole variation of the Tarrasch. }

They did a remarkable job of analysing this variation to incredible depths to prove equality for Black - in many cases, the variations were well over 30 moves deep and concluding in single rook endings. Despite this, I think White can still get a slight edge into the endgame as I'll show. }
9. Bd2
{ Because of the long mainline given after 9. Qd2 which should equalise for Black with very accurate play, I've opted for 9. Bd2 as my main recommendation. Blocking the check with the bishop is certainly more natural. Our idea here will not be to win the d4 pawn, but rather to play e3 and then enjoy lasting pressure thanks to our bishop pair. }
9... Qxc5 10. Rc1
{ Hitting the queen and activating the rook - very logical. Another interesting try which scores very well for White in practice and is also quite strong is the pawn sacrifice 10. b4 !? - it has the advantage of not being covered by Ntirlis and Aagaard as well. }

11... dxe3

12. Bxe3 Qb4+ 13. Bd2 Qe7+ 14. Be2
{ White has an extra tempo over the mainline of 11... Nf6 since we didn't play Bf1-c4-e2. Our bishop pair gives us a comfortable advantage here. }

{ Now that we have completed our dissection of the QGD Proper, we need to go on a detour to see how to deal with the Tarrasch Defence, as well as the Semi-Tarrasch Defence. The Tarrasch Defence enjoyed a brief spurt of popularity when it was essayed by Kasparov in his World Championship Match against Karpov, but he gave it up shortly afterwards. These days the Tarrasch doesn't enjoy the best theoretical reputation. Typically, Black relies on active piece play to compensate for the Isolated Queen's Pawn, or IQP, that he receives, but this is often not enough. }

Aagaard and Ntirlis put a lot of analytical effort into this variation to prove equality, but I think it is a difficult task - White seems to be able to get a slight, but lasting edge in most lines. They view this variation as one of the Tarrasch's biggest challenges. }

[White "The Exchange Slav - Backup Weapon"]
[Black "The Exchange Slav "]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }
3. cxd5
{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Blac wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... a6
{ I already mentioned this, but I think it's worth repeating the point behind this little move. By playing 6... a6, Black prepares ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 in the future without having to worry about the Qb3-Qa4+ idea we just saw, since Black just meet Qa4+ now with ...b5.6... a6 is also just a useful all-round move, since Black after wants to play ...a6 and ...b5 anyway. However, it does have a downside, which is that Black does fall a bit further behind in development, which is something we definitely want to try to exploit.   6...e6  This is very common but simply bad positionally as I already mentioned. Black wants to develop his dark bishop quickly, but completely neglects the well-being of the other one. Limiting his light bishop is a major concession and White is quite a bit better already.  7.Bd3  In this line, we usually want to develop our light bishop before our knight on the kingside. This is for two reasons. The first one is that a premature Nf3 sometimes allows the annoying ...Nh5, swapping off our dark bishop it and with it completely neutralising any edge we might have had. The second reason will be revealed shortly...  Be7  This is significantly better than 7... Bd6, which has the problem of allowing that Bxd6 f4 plan we just saw. However, Black still has to deal with the problem bishop on c8.   7...Bd6  This is inaccurate, and the other reason why we delayed developing our knight to f3 will become apparent in a second.  8.Bxd6  Qxd6  9.f4 !  The point ! With the knight still at home on g1, we have the opportunity to play this fantastic move. We clamp down on e5, and transform the pawn structure into one reminiscent of the Stonewall, except without all the usual defects - like a bad dark bishop or a huge hole on e4. Instead, our light bishop is complementing our pawn structure perfectly. The major advantage we get from having a pawn on f4 is the outpost on e5 for our knight. Over the next few moves, we intend to plant our knight on e5 with Nf3-e5, after which it will be virtually untouchable. If Black does decide to get rid of it, then after ...Nxe5 fxe5 the f-file opens up to our advantage. This position pretty much plays itself from here. After we plant our knight on e5, we will most likely castle short and then follow up by launching a kingside attack starting with g4-g5, Qh5, Rf3-h3 etc. It's difficult for Black to defend against this, and moreover, he seriously lacks counterplay. I think it's very important to be familiar with this Bxd6 f4 Nf3-e5 idea. If the majority of your opponents are under 2000, then you can expect a large chunk of your games to go down this road. The issue that many lower-rated Black players face is that they don't bother really learning theory against the Exchange Slav and expect to be able to just 'wing it' - and even though their position might look OK on the surface, Black is already much worse here positionally. White's plan is simple and his position pretty much plays itself. I've won countless games in the Exchange Slav with this simple idea, especially against lower-rated players - I highly recommend remembering and understanding this simple plan with Bxd6, f4, and Nf3-e5.  O-O  10.Nf3  a6  Black is looking to get counterplay on the queenside, but it is very slow and simply not that effective on account of his bad bishop.  11.O-O  b5  12.Ne5  Bb7  13.g4  ±  White's play is almost formulaic - Nf3-e5, O-O, g4-g5, Qh5, Rf3-h3, etc. The attack plays itself, and it is very difficult to deal with for Black. Moreover, he lacks easy counterplay on the queenside.  8.h3  A useful prophylactic move to include before developing our knight in order to have the h2 retreat square available if Black tries ...Nh5.  O-O  9.Nf3  Bd7  10.O-O  Qb6  Hitting the b2 pawn.  11.a3 !  A cute little trick to cover the pawn on b2. Black can't grab it because his queen would get trapped after Na4.  Rfc8  12.Na4  Our knight is heading for the c5 outpost.  Qd8  13.Nc5  Black doesn't have a comfortable way to cover the b7 pawn, so he is somewhat forced to exchange on c5.  Bxc5  14.dxc5  +=  This Na4-c5 manoeuvre is a typical one and its something which you should definitely be aware of. In a typically symmetrical exchange Slav structure, it's one of the easiest and best ways to unbalance the game. We have no only managed to win the bishop pair, but have also secured a space advantage and queenside pawn majority which we can put into action later on.   6...Bf5  To my eyes at least, this is the most natural move in the position. Black 'copies' White and develops his own bishop to its best square, on f5. What's important to note here is that if Black manages to exchange our good bishop, the light-squared one, then he is completely fine - as a result, Bd3 is obviously out of the question. If we didn't have the little finesse which I'll show you over the next few moves, Black would probably be completely fine and have no problems. Yet, we can keep up the pressure - the usual problem with the bishop vacating c8 is that the pawn on b7 is left unguarded - and we exploit this in the usual way: with Qb3.  7.Qb3 !  Hitting the pawn on b7. This is surprisingly difficult to defend in a comfortable way.  Na5  Alternatives to this are quite bad. The queen on d7 would be exposed to Nf3-e5 in the future, and ...Qb6 results in a poor endgame for Black where the doubled b-pawns and fantastic b5 outpost gives us a comfortable advantage. ...Na5 is Black's only decent try.  8.Qa4+ !  Continuing to annoy Black - we are trying to force his light-squared bishop back inside the pawn chain.  Bd7  Dropping the knight back is also possible, but allowing the pin on that knight is far from ideal and after ...Nc6 Nf3 Black has little choice but to play ...Bd7 sooner or later to deal with the threat of Ne5.  9.Qc2 !  This is the point ! Our little dance with the queen, from d1 to b3 to a4 to c2, has achieved what we set out to do from the get-go in the Exchange Slav: trap the bishop inside the pawn chain. With our queen on c2, Black can't get his bishop out to f5 anymore, and the tempting ...Bg4 is met decisively now by Nb5, threatening Nc7+.  e6  Black has nothing better than to 'admit defeat' and playing ...e6. We have succeeded in 'trapping' the bishop inside the pawn chain, but I should mention that this isn't as good as the version that we already saw after 6... e6, where Black immediately gave us what we wanted. In this case, we have spent some tempi to achieve our goal, and Black has gone the chance to make some semi-useful moves like ...Bd7 and .. .Na5. Often, our queen won't stay on c2 - we might want to shuffle it over to e2 instead in some cases.  10.Bd3  The alternative is the very natural 10. Nf3. Both moves are objectively similar, but I slightly prefer this choice. This is a major branching point in this variation of the Exchange Slav. Black has tried a number of moves here - 10... Nc6, 10... Rc8, 10... Be7, 10... Bb4 and 10... Nh5. I actually think that this line is probably Black's best bet in this chapter. White has a marginal edge due to his more active bishops, but it's nothing more than that since Black is very solid.  Rc8  Another very popular and natural way to play. Black brings the rook to its best post.   10...Nh5  This is the rarest of Black's options that we'll cover. It is objectively fine though and scores pretty well for Black. It is a decent attempt from Black to unbalance the game.  11.Be5  This is better than the immediate retreat to g3 - we don't want to make it easy for Black to get the bishop pair. We'd rather provoke the weakening ...f6 from Black first.  Nc6  Black's most common move by far. He brings his other knight back into the fold with the intention of picking up the bishop pair.  12.Qe2 !  Exploiting Black's somewhat wayward knight on h5.  Nxe5  13.dxe5  g6  14.Nf3  +=  This is a relatively unbalanced position compared to other Exchange Slav lines, which is nice. Black has the bishop pair, but that's not too important in this static pawn structure right now. He is still stuck with a light bishop which has very limited scope. We have a very attractive outpost on d4 for our knights which we'll try to make use of with Nc3-b5-d4. I think White has a slight 'par' advantage here on account of the d4 outpost, the misplaced knight on h5, the slightly weakened dark squares around Black's king and the possibility of playing the e4 break later on.   10...Nc6  Black immediately brings his knight back into the game, threatening ...Nb4 and fighting for the e5 square.  11.Qe2  Of course, we can't allow Black's ...Nb4 which would kill our good bishop. An alternative is 11. a3, but I prefer 11. Qe2 since it gets the queen off the c-file which is usually home to Black's rook. Additionally, the queen on e2 prevents Black's .. .Nh5 idea for now.  Be7  12.Nf3  You can also play 12. h3 here. It is an equally good option, but I like Aronian's choice here, 12. Nf3.  Nh5  13.Be5  Once again, this is the default square where our bishop goes when attacked instead of g3 since we want to provoke ...f6.  f6  14.Bg3  f5  Black couldn't castle because of the very strong Ng5 !.  15.Be5  ∞  This is pretty much as close to equal as Black is going to get in this chapter - I definitely still prefer White, but Black is doing pretty fine. We have managed to provoke Black to weaken the e5 square, which we might be able to take advantage of later on with something like O-O, h3, Bh2 and Ne5.   10...Be7  Black prioritises kingside development and castling.  11.h3  11. Nf3 will most likely transpose.  Rc8  12.Nf3  O-O  13.O-O  b5  Black is threatening ...b4, winning our knight, so we must respond to that.  14.a3  Nipping ...b4 in the bud.  Nc4  15.Ne5  +=  Black has his outpost on c4, but we have ours on e5. White is doing a bit better here, because ultimately when the time is right, we should be able to kick Black's knight away from c4 with a well-timed b3. Possible moves from here are Qe2, Rac1 etc. Once b3 comes, Black will also have to be careful with the b5 pawn, which could be hanging - so even if he wins our pawn on a3, we'd win the b5 pawn with a good position.   10...Bb4  A very natural move too, pinning our knight. This active square does have a drawback though, which is that it relinquishes control over the h4-d8 diagonal - this can be important after ...Nh5, since now we can often play Bg5 after we develop with Nf3.  11.Nf3  Just developing.  Nh5  As tempting as the plan of ...Rc8 ...Bxc3 might be, to give us a backward c-pawn, the bishop pair is more important. We have time to play moves like O-O, Nd2, Rfc1 and eventually maybe c4. Black has no good way to exploit that backward c-pawn, so instead, most Black players have gone for the standard ...Nh5 idea instead.  12.Bg5  As already mentioned, this is the downside of ...Bb4 - Bg5 is now possible, and this is even more irritating for Black than Be5 would be.  f6  The only move that Black has played here.  13.g4 !  This is a very thematic and important idea to keep in mind in this line. We ignore the threat to our bishop and instead counterattack Black's knight on h5, which is short on retreat squares.  fxg5  14.gxh5  This surprising turn of events seems to favour White. Black needs to find a way to deal with the threat to the h7 pawn. The pawn on h5 is exposed, but Black seemingly doesn't have a way to take advantage. Moreover, our knight now has a fantastic outpost on e5 now.  Qf6  15.Ne5  Nc6  Ensuring that our knight doesn't stay on e5 for long.  16.Nxd7  The better minor piece to capture - long-term, the bishop on d7 would be a menace and we want to keep Black's king stuck in the centre.  Kxd7  17.a3  This is not the time to be greedy and go pawn-grabbing with Bxh7, since ...Qf3 is very strong for Black.  Ba5  18.Qe2  +=  Certainly a very unusual position has appeared, but I think White is doing pretty well here. Our king is going to be surprisingly safe after we castle short, and we can then start targeting the c5 outpost with Na4 and Rac1 with a good position.  11.Nf3  b5  Threatening ...b4.  12.a3  We deal with the threat in the same way as before.  Be7  13.h3  Securing our dark bishop's future by providing it with a retreat square on h2.  O-O  14.O-O  a6  15.Ne5  Bc6  Black is manoeuvring the bishop around to b7, where it is less in the way and it can aid the fight for the e4 square.  16.b3  +=  Keeping Black's knight out of c4. Next, we can play natural moves like Qb2 and Rfc1, enjoying a slight edge. Long-term, we will probably fight for the c-file by doubling rooks with Rc2 and Rac1. The pawn structure is symmetrical, but I think White's position is definitely preferable here - when the queenside inevitably opens, our more active pieces will be better placed to take advantage.   6...Bg4  This is also a natural idea, but we meet it in the exact same way as 6... Bf5 and the moves will simply transpose after  7.Qb3  Hitting b7 once again.  Na5  Black still has nothing better.  8.Qa4+  Bd7  9.Qc2  Transposing directly into the lines we just looked at after 6... Bf5. }
7. Be2
{ This is quite a lot less common than the very natural 7. Bd3, but it scores better and I think it's a better try objectively-speaking. The bishop on e2 prevents Black from going ... Bg4. }
7... Bf5
{ This must be critical, of course. Black has prepared ...Bf5 with . .. a6, and now he finally gets the chance to play it.   7...e6  This shouldn't be too critical, as once again, we have managed to 'trap' Black's light bishop inside the pawn chain. It's a slightly inferior version to the one after 6... e6, but this is good for us nonetheless.  8.Nf3  Be7   8...Bd6  This exchanging idea makes a lot more sense now with our prior idea of Bxd6 followed by f4 being impossible now.  9.Ne5 !  This has been played a lot less than the natural 9. Bxd6, but I think it's stronger and this is backed up by most strong GMs opting for 9. Ne5 instead here.  Bxe5  10.Bxe5  Taking with the pawn would be an awkward blunder since we actually can't defend e5 after dxe5 ...Nd7.  Nxe5  11.dxe5  Nd7  12.f4  +=  I really like White's position here. We have the good vs bad bishop advantage that we've been trying so long and hard to establish, as well as a fantastic outpost on d4 for our knight and prospects for a kingside attack later to boot.  9.h3  The usual prophylactic move.  O-O  10.O-O  Bd7  11.Rc1  Rc8  12.Bd3  We have technically 'lost' a tempo - Black got ...a6 in for free - but time isn't too vital in this type of position. The main thing is that Black's light bishop is passive on d7.  b5  13.Qe2  +=  Once again, I think White is doing pretty well here. Some possible ideas to consider are Bb1, dropping the bishop out of harm's way, and then Ne5. Long-term we might be looking to carry out the e4 break when the time is right, so consider preparing this with Rfd1 as well. }
8. Nf3
{ The natural and obvious developing move, but I'd look to draw your attention to one very interesting alternative here, which is 8. g4 !?. I actually played this once and won a pretty nice game with it - it's objectively 100% sound, and Black needs to know what he's doing to equalise here. In spite of this, I think 'normal' play with 8. Nf3 is a bit better objectively, once the surprise value of 8. g4 has worn off. }
8... e6
{ 8...Nh5  This idea is possible once again, trying to pick up the bishop pair.  9.Be5  Again, provoking ...f6 if Black is deadset on taking our dark bishop on g3.  e6  10.O-O  Be7  11.Rc1  O-O  12.Na4  I'd like to suggest playing with a move, with the obvious idea of Nc5 next, immediately. Slow play with 12. h3 doesn't seem to pose Black many problems, so I think foregoing this is better.  f6  Black doesn't want to take on e5 since after dxe5 his knight on h5 would be stranded. Instead, he kicks our bishop back so that he can take on g3.  13.Bg3  Nxg3  14.hxg3  Black has the bishop pair, but this won't last too long since Nc5 is on its way and Black will have nothing better than ...Bxc5.  e5  15.dxe5  fxe5  16.Nc5  Bxc5  17.Rxc5  Be6  18.Qd2  +=  Black has a nice looking centre here, but I'd claim it's more of a target than a threat right now. Moreover, we have very active pieces and control over the c-file. Next, we can play Rfc1 and then maybe something like a4 or b4, getting our pawns on the queenside rolling. }
9. Qb3
{ Yet again, we have this annoying move, taking advantage of the undefended b7 pawn. The reason it works well now is because of Black's last move - his bishop no longer has access to d7. This means that ...Na5 is a blunder because of Qa4+ ...b5 Bxb5+ etc. Black needs to find a way to deal with the threat to the b7 pawn. }
9... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move - Black ignores the threat to the b7 pawn and tries to catch up on development. He hopes that our pawn-grabbing won't go unpunished...   9...Ra7  This is another benefit of ...a6, and an idea which is borrowed from the Chebanenko/...a6 Slav, where it features prominently in many variations. Black covers b7, but on the flip side the rook on a7 does look pretty awful.  10.Ne5  I think it's best to play relatively forcefully like this, while Black is still behind in development.  Nxe5  11.Bxe5  Nd7  Black's looking to pick up the bishop pair now, but this shouldn't bother us. As a rule of thumb, the structure in the Exchange Slav after dxe5 is usually quite pleasant for White on account of the d4 outpost for our knight.  12.O-O  Nxe5  13.dxe5  Be7  14.g4 !  Booting Black's bishop away.  Bg6  15.f4  ±  White's advantage has grown and become a serious headache for Black here. He lacks counterplay while White has a very simple plan of rolling his kingside pawns forward, starting with f5. }
10. Bxd6 Qxd6 11. Qxb7
{ Black is a little bit too far behind in development to fully exploit our pawn-grabbing, since he still needs to castle. }
11... O-O 12. Qb3
{ We have enough time to extract our queen from b7 before it gets trapped. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qa3
{ The only way to hold on to our extra pawn is to head into an endgame. } 13...
Qxa3 14. bxa3
{ Black has some activity here in exchange for the pawn, and with accurate defence, he should be able to hold, but I don't think he has nearly enough compensation here to claim full equality. Even though our doubled a-pawns seem pretty useless as far as an extra pawn goes, they actually do a good job of taking away squares from Black's knights. The following line is far from forced, but it's just an indication of how the play might proceed from here: }
14... Na7 { ...Nb5 is the threat. } 15. a4
{ Good prophylactic play, ruling out Black's ...Nb5 idea. } 15... Rb2
{ Black sacrifices the pawn on a6 to activate his pieces as much as possible. }
16. Bxa6
{ We continue grabbing material - eventually, we can give a pawn back to unravel. }
16... Rc2 17. Nd1 Nc8 18. Bb5 { Defending a4. } 18... Nb6 19. Ne5
{ With the idea of f3 next to take vital squares away from Black's knight and bishop. }
19... Nxa4 20. f3
{ We even offer to give Black back a second pawn now - this does come at a cost though. }
20... Rxg2 21. Bc6 Ra7 22. Nf2
{ The once active rook on the second rank is now pretty much shut out of the game. Even though material is equal technically, White's significantly more active pieces give him the advantage. The rook on the kingside is completely offside and will struggle to rejoin the fight later on. This is particularly dangerous for Black since we do have a passed pawn on a2 which could become a serious threat later on. Ultimately, White is doing very well here - practically-speaking especially, I think it's very difficult to defend this as Black. Of course, as already mentioned, this line is far from forced, but I think it gives some indication of the resources available for both sides. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }
3. cxd5
{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Black wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... e6
{ This is very common but simply bad positionally as I already mentioned. Black wants to develop his dark bishop quickly, but completely neglects the well-being of the other one. Limiting his light bishop is a major concession and White is quite a bit better already. }
7. Bd3
{ In this line, we usually want to develop our light bishop before our knight on the kingside. This is for two reasons. The first one is that a premature Nf3 sometimes allows the annoying ...Nh5, swapping off our dark bishop and with it completely neutralising any edge we might have had. The second reason will be revealed shortly... }
7... Bd6
{ This is inaccurate, and the other reason why we delayed developing our knight to f3 will become apparent in a second. }
8. Bxd6 Qxd6 9. f4
{ The point ! With the knight still at home on g1, we have the opportunity to play this fantastic move. We clamp down on e5, and transform the pawn structure into one reminiscent of the Stonewall, except without all the usual defects - like a bad dark bishop or a huge hole on e4. Instead, our light bishop is complementing our pawn structure perfectly. The major advantage we get from having a pawn on f4 is the outpost on e5 for our knight. Over the next few moves, we intend to plant our knight on e5 with Nf3-e5, after which it will be virtually untouchable. If Black does decide to get rid of it, then after ...Nxe5 fxe5 the f-file opens up to our advantage. This position pretty much plays itself from here. After we plant our knight on e5, we will most likely castle short and then follow up by launching a kingside attack starting with g4-g5, Qh5, Rf3-h3 etc. It's difficult for Black to defend against this, and moreover, he seriously lacks counterplay. I think it's very important to be familiar with this Bxd6 f4 Nf3-e5 idea. If the majority of your opponents are under 2000, then you can expect a large chunk of your games to go down this road.   The issue that many lower-rated Black players face is that they don't bother really learning theory against the Exchange Slav and expect to be able to just 'wing it' - and even though their position might look OK on the surface, Black is already much worse here positionally. White's plan is simple and his position pretty much plays itself. I've won countless games in the Exchange Slav with this simple idea, especially against lower-rated players - I highly recommend remembering and understanding this simple plan with Bxd6, f4, and Nf3-e5. }
9... O-O 10. Nf3 a6
{ Black is looking to get counterplay on the queenside, but it is very slow and simply not that effective on account of his bad bishop. }
11. O-O b5 12. Ne5 Bb7 13. g4
{ White's play is almost formulaic - Nf3-e5, O-O, g4-g5, Qh5, Rf3-h3, etc. The attack plays itself, and it is very difficult to deal with for Black. Moreover, he lacks easy counterplay on the queenside. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }

{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Blac wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... e6
{ This is very common but simply bad positionally as I already mentioned. Black wants to develop his dark bishop quickly, but completely neglects the well-being of the other one. Limiting his light bishop is a major concession and White is quite a bit better already. }
7. Bd3
{ In this line, we usually want to develop our light bishop before our knight on the kingside. This is for two reasons. The first one is that a premature Nf3 sometimes allows the annoying ...Nh5, swapping off our dark bishop it and with it completely neutralising any edge we might have had. The second reason will be revealed shortly... }
7... Be7
{ This is significantly better than 7... Bd6, which has the problem of allowing that Bxd6 f4 plan we just saw. However, Black still has to deal with the problem bishop on c8. }
8. h3
{ A useful prophylactic move to include before developing our knight in order to have the h2 retreat square available if Black tries ...Nh5. }
8... O-O 9. Nf3 Bd7 10. O-O Qb6 { Hitting the b2 pawn. } 11. a3
{ A cute little trick to cover the pawn on b2. Black can't grab it because his queen would get trapped after Na4. }
11... Rfc8 12. Na4 { Our knight is heading for the c5 outpost. } 12... Qd8 13.
Nc5
{ Black doesn't have a comfortable way to cover the b7 pawn, so he is somewhat forced to exchange on c5. }
13... Bxc5 14. dxc5
{ This Na4-c5 manoeuvre is a typical one and its something which you should definitely be aware of. In a typically symmetrical exchange Slav structure, it's one of the easiest and best ways to unbalance the game. We have not only managed to win the bishop pair, but have also secured a space advantage and queenside pawn majority which we can put into action later on. }

We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... Bf5
{ To my eyes at least, this is the most natural move in the position. Black 'copies' White and develops his own bishop to its best square, on f5. What's important to note here is that if Black manages to exchange our good bishop, the light-squared one, then he is completely fine - as a result, Bd3 is obviously out of the question. If we didn't have the little finesse which I'll show you over the next few moves, Black would probably be completely fine and have no problems. Yet, we can keep up the pressure - the usual problem with the bishop vacating c8 is that the pawn on b7 is left unguarded - and we exploit this in the usual way: with Qb3. }
7. Qb3
{ Hitting the pawn on b7. This is surprisingly difficult to defend in a comfortable way. }
7... Na5
{ Alternatives to this are quite bad. The queen on d7 would be exposed to Nf3-e5 in the future, and ...Qb6 results in a poor endgame for Black where the doubled b-pawns and fantastic b5 outpost gives us a comfortable advantage. ...Na5 is Black's only decent try. }
8. Qa4+
{ Continuing to annoy Black - we are trying to force his light-squared bishop back inside the pawn chain. }
8... Bd7
{ Dropping the knight back is also possible, but allowing the pin on that knight is far from ideal and after ...Nc6 Nf3 Black has little choice but to play ...Bd7 sooner or later to deal with the threat of Ne5. }
9. Qc2
{ This is the point ! Our little dance with the queen, from d1 to b3 to a4 to c2, has achieved what we set out to do from the get-go in the Exchange Slav: trap the bishop inside the pawn chain. With our queen on c2, Black can't get his bishop out to f5 anymore, and the tempting ...Bg4 is met decisively now by Nb5, threatening Nc7+. }
9... e6
{ Black has nothing better than to 'admit defeat' and playing ...e6. We have succeeded in 'trapping' the bishop inside the pawn chain, but I should mention that this isn't as good as the version that we already saw after 6... e6, where Black immediately gave us what we wanted. In this case, we have spent some tempi to achieve our goal, and Black has gone the chance to make some semi-useful moves like ...Bd7 and ...Na5. Often, our queen won't stay on c2 - we might want to shuffle it over to e2 instead in some cases. }
10. Bd3
{ The alternative is the very natural 10. Nf3. Both moves are objectively similar, but I slightly prefer this choice. This is a major branching point in this variation of the Exchange Slav. Black has tried a number of moves here - 10... Nc6, 10... Rc8, 10... Be7, 10... Bb4 and 10... Nh5. I actually think that this line is probably Black's best bet in this chapter. White has a marginal edge due to his more active bishops, but it's nothing more than that since Black is very solid. In one of our Model Games, Aravindh - Sjugirov, White played 10.Bd3 which is also good. }
10... Nh5
{ This is the rarest of Black's options that we'll cover. It is objectively fine though and scores pretty well for Black. It is a decent attempt from Black to unbalance the game. }
11. Be5
{ This is better than the immediate retreat to g3 - we don't want to make it easy for Black to get the bishop pair. We'd rather provoke the weakening ...f6 from Black first. }
11... Nc6
{ Black's most common move by far. He brings his other knight back into the fold with the intention of picking up the bishop pair. }
12. Qe2 { Exploiting Black's somewhat wayward knight on h5. } 12... Nxe5 13.
dxe5 g6 14. Nf3
{ This is a relatively unbalanced position compared to other Exchange Slav lines, which is nice. Black has the bishop pair, but that's not too important in this static pawn structure right now. He is still stuck with a light bishop which has very limited scope. We have a very attractive outpost on d4 for our knights which we'll try to make use of with Nc3-b5-d4. I think White has a slight 'par' advantage here on account of the d4 outpost, the misplaced knight on h5, the slightly weakened dark squares around Black's king and the possibility of playing the e4 break later on. }

Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... Bf5
{ To my eyes at least, this is the most natural move in the position. Black 'copies' White and develops his own bishop to its best square, on f5. What's important to note here is that if Black manages to exchange our good bishop, the light-squared one, then he is completely fine - as a result, Bd3 is obviously out of the question. If we didn't have the little finesse which I'll show you over the next few moves, Black would probably be completely fine and have no problems. Yet, we can keep up the pressure - the usual problem with the bishop vacating c8 is that the pawn on b7 is left unguarded - and we exploit this in the usual way: with Qb3. }
7. Qb3
{ Hitting the pawn on b7. This is surprisingly difficult to defend in a comfortable way. }
7... Na5
{ Alternatives to this are quite bad. The queen on d7 would be exposed to Nf3-e5 in the future, and ...Qb6 results in a poor endgame for Black where the doubled b-pawns and fantastic b5 outpost gives us a comfortable advantage. ...Na5 is Black's only decent try. }
8. Qa4+
{ Continuing to annoy Black - we are trying to force his light-squared bishop back inside the pawn chain. }
8... Bd7
{ Dropping the knight back is also possible, but allowing the pin on that knight is far from ideal and after ...Nc6 Nf3 Black has little choice but to play ...Bd7 sooner or later to deal with the threat of Ne5. }
9. Qc2
{ This is the point ! Our little dance with the queen, from d1 to b3 to a4 to c2, has achieved what we set out to do from the get-go in the Exchange Slav: trap the bishop inside the pawn chain. With our queen on c2, Black can't get his bishop out to f5 anymore, and the tempting ...Bg4 is met decisively now by Nb5, threatening Nc7+. }
9... e6
{ Black has nothing better than to 'admit defeat' and playing ...e6. We have succeeded in 'trapping' the bishop inside the pawn chain, but I should mention that this isn't as good as the version that we already saw after 6... e6, where Black immediately gave us what we wanted. In this case, we have spent some tempi to achieve our goal, and Black has gone the chance to make some semi-useful moves like ...Bd7 and ...Na5. Often, our queen won't stay on c2 - we might want to shuffle it over to e2 instead in some cases. }
10. Bd3
{ The alternative is the very natural 10. Nf3. Both moves are objectively similar, but I slightly prefer this choice. This is a major branching point in this variation of the Exchange Slav. Black has tried a number of moves here - 10... Nc6, 10... Rc8, 10... Be7, 10... Bb4 and 10... Nh5. I actually think that this line is probably Black's best bet in this chapter. White has a marginal edge due to his more active bishops, but it's nothing more than that since Black is very solid. }
10... Nc6
{ Black immediately brings his knight back into the game, threatening ...Nb4 and fighting for the e5 square. }
11. Qe2
{ Of course, we can't allow Black's ...Nb4 which would kill our good bishop. An alternative is 11. a3, but I prefer 11. Qe2 since it gets the queen off the c-file which is usually home to Black's rook. Additionally, the queen on e2 prevents Black's ...Nh5 idea for now. }
11... Be7 12. Nf3
{ You can also play 12. h3 here. It is an equally good option, but I like Aronian's choice here, 12. Nf3. }
12... Nh5 13. Be5
{ Once again, this is the default square where our bishop goes when attacked instead of g3 since we want to provoke ...f6. }
13... f6 14. Bg3 f5 { Black couldn't castle because of the very strong Ng5 !. }
15. Be5
{ This is pretty much as close to equal as Black is going to get in this chapter - I definitely still prefer White, but Black is doing pretty fine. We have managed to provoke Black to weaken the e5 square, which we might be able to take advantage of later on with something like O-O, h3, Bh2 and Ne5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }
3. cxd5
{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Blac wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6.

10... Be7 { Black prioritises kingside development and castling. } 11. h3
{ 11. Nf3 will most likely transpose. } 11... Rc8 12. Nf3 O-O 13. O-O b5
{ Black is threatening ...b4, winning our knight, so we must respond to that. }
14. a3 { Nipping ...b4 in the bud. } 14... Nc4 15. Ne5
{ Black has his outpost on c4, but we have ours on e5. White is doing a bit better here, because ultimately when the time is right, we should be able to kick Black's knight away from c4 with a well-timed b3. Possible moves from here are Qe2, Rfc1 etc. Once b3 comes, Black will also have to be careful with the b5 pawn, which could be hanging - so even if he wins our pawn on a3, we'd win the b5 pawn with a good position. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }
3. cxd5
{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Blac wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... Bf5
{ To my eyes at least, this is the most natural move in the position. Black 'copies' White and develops his own bishop to its best square, on f5. What's important to note here is that if Black manages to exchange our good bishop, the light-squared one, then he is completely fine - as a result, Bd3 is obviously out of the question. If we didn't have the little finesse which I'll show you over the next few moves, Black would probably be completely fine and have no problems. Yet, we can keep up the pressure - the usual problem with the bishop vacating c8 is that the pawn on b7 is left unguarded - and we exploit this in the usual way: with Qb3. }
7. Qb3
{ Hitting the pawn on b7. This is surprisingly difficult to defend in a comfortable way. }
7... Na5
{ Alternatives to this are quite bad. The queen on d7 would be exposed to Nf3-e5 in the future, and ...Qb6 results in a poor endgame for Black where the doubled b-pawns and fantastic b5 outpost gives us a comfortable advantage. ...Na5 is Black's only decent try. }
8. Qa4+
{ Continuing to annoy Black - we are trying to force his light-squared bishop back inside the pawn chain. }
8... Bd7
{ Dropping the knight back is also possible, but allowing the pin on that knight is far from ideal and after ...Nc6 Nf3 Black has little choice but to play ...Bd7 sooner or later to deal with the threat of Ne5. }
9. Qc2
{ This is the point ! Our little dance with the queen, from d1 to b3 to a4 to c2, has achieved what we set out to do from the get-go in the Exchange Slav: trap the bishop inside the pawn chain. With our queen on c2, Black can't get his bishop out to f5 anymore, and the tempting ...Bg4 is met decisively now by Nb5, threatening Nc7+. }
9... e6
{ Black has nothing better than to 'admit defeat' and playing ...e6. We have succeeded in 'trapping' the bishop inside the pawn chain, but I should mention that this isn't as good as the version that we already saw after 6... e6, where Black immediately gave us what we wanted. In this case, we have spent some tempi to achieve our goal, and Black has gone the chance to make some semi-useful moves like ...Bd7 and ...Na5. Often, our queen won't stay on c2 - we might want to shuffle it over to e2 instead in some cases. }
10. Bd3
{ The alternative is the very natural 10. Nf3. Both moves are objectively similar, but I slightly prefer this choice. This is a major branching point in this variation of the Exchange Slav. Black has tried a number of moves here - 10... Nc6, 10... Rc8, 10... Be7, 10... Bb4 and 10... Nh5. I actually think that this line is probably Black's best bet in this chapter. White has a marginal edge due to his more active bishops, but it's nothing more than that since Black is very solid. }
10... Rc8
{ Another very popular and natural way to play. Black brings the rook to its best post. }
11. Nf3 b5 { Threatening ...b4. } 12. a3
{ We deal with the threat in the same way as before. } 12... Be7 13. h3
{ Securing our dark bishop's future by providing it with a retreat square on h2. }
13... O-O 14. O-O a6 15. Ne5 Bc6
{ Black is manoeuvring the bishop around to b7, where it is less in the way and it can aid the fight for the e4 square. }
16. b3
{ Keeping Black's knight out of c4. Next, we can play natural moves like Qb2 and Rfc1, enjoying a slight edge. Long-term, we will probably fight for the c-file by doubling rooks with Rc2 and Rac1. The pawn structure is symmetrical, but I think White's position is definitely preferable here - when the queenside inevitably opens, our more active pieces will be better placed to take advantage. }

{ This exchanging idea makes a lot more sense now with our prior idea of Bxd6 followed by f4 being impossible now. }
9. Ne5
{ This has been played a lot less than the natural 9. Bxd6, but I think it's stronger and this is backed up by most strong GMs opting for 9. Ne5 instead here. }
9... Bxe5 10. Bxe5
{ Taking with the pawn would be an awkward blunder since we actually can't defend e5 after dxe5 ...Nd7. }
10... Nxe5 11. dxe5 Nd7 12. f4
{ I really like White's position here. We have the good vs bad bishop advantage that we've been trying so long and hard to establish, as well as a fantastic outpost on d4 for our knight and prospects for a kingside attack later to boot. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }
3. cxd5
{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Blac wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... a6
{ I already mentioned this, but I think it's worth repeating the point behind this little move. By playing 6... a6, Black prepares ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 in the future without having to worry about the Qb3-Qa4+ idea we just saw, since Black just meet Qa4+ now with ...b5.6... a6 is also just a useful all-round move, since Black after wants to play ...a6 and ...b5 anyway. However, it does have a downside, which is that Black does fall a bit further behind in development, which is something we definitely want to try to exploit. }
7. Be2
{ This is quite a lot less common than the very natural 7. Bd3, but it scores better and I think it's a better try objectively-speaking. The bishop on e2 prevents Black from going ... Bg4. }
7... e6
{ This shouldn't be too critical, as once again, we have managed to 'trap' Black's light bishop inside the pawn chain. It's a slightly inferior version to the one after 6... e6, but this is good for us nonetheless. }
8. Nf3 Be7 9. h3 { The usual prophylactic move. } 9... O-O 10. O-O Bd7 11. Rc1
Rc8 12. Bd3
{ We have technically 'lost' a tempo - Black got ...a6 in for free - but time isn't too vital in this type of position. The main thing is that Black's light bishop is passive on d7. }
12... b5 13. Qe2
{ Once again, I think White is doing pretty well here. Some possible ideas to consider are Bb1, dropping the bishop out of harm's way, and then Ne5. Long-term we might be looking to carry out the e4 break when the time is right, so consider preparing this with Rfd1 as well. }

14... e5 15. dxe5 fxe5 16. Nc5 Bxc5 17. Rxc5 Be6 18. Qd2
{ Black has a nice looking centre here, but I'd claim it's more of a target than a threat right now. Moreover, we have very active pieces and control over the c-file. Next, we can play Rfc1 and then maybe something like a4 or b4, getting our pawns on the queenside rolling. }

By playing 6... a6, Black prepares ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 in the future without having to worry about the Qb3-Qa4+ idea we just saw, since Black just meet Qa4+ now with ...b5.6... a6 is also just a useful all-round move, since Black after wants to play ...a6 and ...b5 anyway. However, it does have a downside, which is that Black does fall a bit further behind in development, which is something we definitely want to try to exploit. }
7. Be2
{ This is quite a lot less common than the very natural 7. Bd3, but it scores better and I think it's a better try objectively-speaking. The bishop on e2 prevents Black from going ... Bg4. }
7... Bf5
{ This must be critical, of course. Black has prepared ...Bf5 with . .. a6, and now he finally gets the chance to play it. }
8. Nf3
{ The natural and obvious developing move, but I'd look to draw your attention to one very interesting alternative here, which is 8. g4 !?. I actually played this once and won a pretty nice game with it - it's objectively 100% sound, and Black needs to know what he's doing to equalise here. In spite of this, I think "normal" play with 8. Nf3 is a bit better objectively, once the surprise value of 8. g4 has worn off. }
8... e6 9. Qb3
{ Yet again, we have this annoying move, taking advantage of the undefended b7 pawn. The reason it works well now is because of Black's last move - his bishop no longer has access to d7. This means that ...Na5 is a blunder because of Qa4+ ...b5 Bxb5+ etc. Black needs to find a way to deal with the threat to the b7 pawn. }
9... Ra7
{ This is another benefit of ...a6, and an idea which is borrowed from the Chebanenko/...a6 Slav, where it features prominently in many variations. Black covers b7, but on the flip side the rook on a7 does look pretty awful. }
10. Ne5
{ I think it's best to play relatively forcefully like this, while Black is still behind in development. }
10... Nxe5 11. Bxe5 Nd7
{ Black's looking to pick up the bishop pair now, but this shouldn't bother us. As a rule of thumb, the structure in the Exchange Slav after dxe5 is usually quite pleasant for White on account of the d4 outpost for our knight. }
12. O-O Nxe5 13. dxe5 Be7 14. g4 { Booting Black's bishop away. } 14... Bg6 15.
f4
{ White's advantage has grown and become a serious headache for Black here. He lacks counterplay while White has a very simple plan of rolling his kingside pawns forward, starting with f5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This first chapter covers a secondary weapon - you can learn this as your main line if you prefer, or as a backup. It has the huge advantage of being very easy to learn, fairly simple to play and it cuts down on a lot of Black's options later on. Over the next two chapters, we'll be examining my main recommendation: 3. Nc3 4. e3 and the Anti-Meran for White. Those lines are more theoretical and they do tend to put Black under more pressure, but obviously, this requires more thorough preparation. The Slav comprises of a variety of different defences, including the Classical Slav, Semi-Slav, a6-Slav and Schlechter Slav.   In this chapter, as already mentioned, we rule out all these individual defences since we're going to opt for the Exchange Slav. In the next chapter, we'll be looking at how my main recommendation fares against the a6-Slav, Schlechter Slav and Classical Slav, while the 3rd and final chapter dealing with the Slavs covers the Semi-Slav. }
3. cxd5
{ The Exchange Slav. If you get an audible groan from your opponent when you place this, don't worry - the Exchange Slav has a reputation for being boring, but I think this is hugely exaggerated. The real reason Slav and Semi-Slav players typically hate facing the Exchange Slav is due to it being a safe, reliable way to get a very slight edge out of the opening without taking many risks or giving Black good winning chances. In the past, you'd often see the Exchange only being used by White players who lacked ambition or as an easy way to secure a pre-arranged draw, but over the last few years, it has been used more and more as a genuine winning attempt - which is exactly what I think it is. The positions are pretty symmetrical and can be dry, but White has a number of tricks up his sleeve to spice up a line which could fizzle out quickly if one doesn't want to try to win.   In addition to being a decent way to fight for a slight edge, I think the Exchange Slav has a number of practical advantages too. Firstly, many Black players really dislike facing it because it can be very difficult for Black to generate any significant winning chances if White plays decently, or if White just wants to make a simple draw. Secondly, because Black players dislike facing it, they often dislike studying it as well ! I've played countless players who didn't really bother learning theory against the Exchange Slav and instead decided to 'wing it', only to end up in a very bad position out of the opening. Thirdly, it's very safe - you don't take many risks and the chance of being surprised in the opening is low.   I should make it clear that the Exchange Slav isn't my main recommendation though. My main choice, covered in the next 2 chapters, leads to more unbalanced, interesting positions in my view, but it requires you to be better prepared. This chapter serves as an easy-to-learn backup weapon, but you can make this your main choice if you like it, or ignore it completely if you don't. Ideally, I highly recommend learning both. The Slav Defences are, in my view, together with the Nimzo-Indian, the best defences against 1. d4. Being able to vary your choice of variation based on the game situation and in order to surprise your opponent or simply be less predictable is a vital trump card to have available. }
3... cxd5
{ Taking back with the queen isn't even worth analysing - Black loses time and the centre after the simple 4. Nc3. I think now is a good time to pause and discuss some general characteristics of the Exchange Slav. Why did we play 3. cxd5 ? What did we gain from it ? Don't we just free up the c6 square and allow Black's knight to develop without any hassles ? These are all important questions to consider and be aware of.   The main thing that we gained by taking on d5 is stability in the centre - in other words, we prevent Black from taking on c4 later himself. This might seem obvious and relatively minor, but it's actually got wide-ranging ramifications. As you'll see in the next two chapters, the possibility of ...dxc4 is key to Black's counterplay in both the Classical Slav as well as the Semi-Slav. In the Classical Slav, Blac wants to take on c4 to facilitate ...Bf5 later, while in the Semi-Slav ...dxc4 is played with the intention of following up with ...b5 and ...Bb7. In a nutshell, 3. cxd5 does a good job of extinguishing some of Black's main plans for counterplay.   However, this comes at a cost. The space advantage we enjoyed by virtue of our pawn being on c4 and Black's being on c6 is no more. Black is free to develop his queenside knight to its best square on c6 now.   The final question then is: how are we going to try and use our extra tempo in this symmetrical position to generate some kind of meaningful edge ? The answer lies with the bishop on c8. Just like in the QGD chapters, where the bishop on c8 was Black's problem piece, here we will also be trying to ensure that Black's poor light bishop never sees the light of day outside the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain. You'll see how we try to keep the bishop inside that pawn chain a bit later. Summing up, our advantage in this line will often lie in our more active pieces - in particular, our bishop will be active on f4 while its counterpart will hopefully be stuck on c8 or d7. }
4. Bf4
{ Our next 3 moves - Bf4, Nc3 and e3 - can be played in different orders too. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter too much - although e3 obviously can't be played before Bf4... The reason I like this 4. Bf4 move order a bit more than the more common 4. Nc3 is that it rules out a rare but slightly annoying idea Black has in connection with an ... e5 pawn sacrifice. }
4... Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nc3
{ Pretty much the starting point of this chapter and a very important branching point. Black needs to decide on a development scheme to try to solve his problems. Even though he is 'only' a tempo behind, he already has to carefully consider how he's going to get his pieces out.   
 6... e6 is very natural and quite common, but it's not very good. As I mentioned already, one of our goals in this variation is to ensure that Black's light bishop remains stuck inside the pawn chain. Often, we need to work a bit to make this happen, but 6... e6 hands us our goal on a silver platter. Clearly, it's not critical.  6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 are very natural ideas to try and improve over 6... e6 - Black simply wants to activate his light bishop before locking it inside the pawn chain with ...e6. However, this comes with a downside too, which you should definitely become familiar with - the pawn on b7 is left undefended. This is something we can exploit with Qb3, as we will see after 6... Bf5 and 6... Bg4 - both these lines are met in the same way.    A more refined way to play is the most common move here, 6... a6. This has the point of preparing ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, without allowing the annoying Qb3 idea since it can be met by ...Na5 Qa4+ ...b5 now - ...b5 isn't possible after 6... Bf5 of course. However, 6... a6 has another downside - it's a bit slow, and Black falls further behind in development.   
We'll be examining all these lines individually, of course - I just wanted to give you a brief taster of the dilemma that Black already faces in this simple position. }
6... a6
{ I already mentioned this, but I think it's worth repeating the point behind this little move. By playing 6... a6, Black prepares ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 in the future without having to worry about the Qb3-Qa4+ idea we just saw, since Black just meet Qa4+ now with ...b5.6... a6 is also just a useful all-round move, since Black after wants to play ...a6 and ...b5 anyway. However, it does have a downside, which is that Black does fall a bit further behind in development, which is something we definitely want to try to exploit. }
7. Be2
{ This is quite a lot less common than the very natural 7. Bd3, but it scores better and I think it's a better try objectively-speaking. The bishop on e2 prevents Black from going ... Bg4. }
7... Bf5
{ This must be critical, of course. Black has prepared ...Bf5 with . .. a6, and now he finally gets the chance to play it. }
8. Nf3
{ The natural and obvious developing move, but I'd look to draw your attention to one very interesting alternative here, which is 8. g4 !?. I actually played this once and won a pretty nice game with it - it's objectively 100% sound, and Black needs to know what he's doing to equalise here. In spite of this, I think 'normal' play with 8. Nf3 is a bit better objectively, once the surprise value of 8. g4 has worn off. }
8... e6 9. Qb3
{ Yet again, we have this annoying move, taking advantage of the undefended b7 pawn. The reason it works well now is because of Black's last move - his bishop no longer has access to d7. This means that ...Na5 is a blunder because of Qa4+ ...b5 Bxb5+ etc. Black needs to find a way to deal with the threat to the b7 pawn. }
9... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move - Black ignores the threat to the b7 pawn and tries to catch up on development. He hopes that our pawn-grabbing won't go unpunished... }
10. Bxd6 Qxd6 11. Qxb7
{ Black is a little bit too far behind in development to fully exploit our pawn-grabbing, since he still needs to castle. }
11... O-O 12. Qb3
{ We have enough time to extract our queen from b7 before it gets trapped. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qa3
{ The only way to hold on to our extra pawn is to head into an endgame. } 13...
Qxa3 14. bxa3
{ Black has some activity here in exchange for the pawn, and with accurate defence, he should be able to hold, but I don't think he has nearly enough compensation here to claim full equality. Even though our doubled a-pawns seem pretty useless as far as an extra pawn goes, they actually do a good job of taking away squares from Black's knights. The following line is far from forced, but it's just an indication of how the play might proceed from here: }
14... Na7 { ...Nb5 is the threat. } 15. a4
{ Good prophylactic play, ruling out Black's ...Nb5 idea. } 15... Rb2
{ Black sacrifices the pawn on a6 to activate his pieces as much as possible. }
16. Bxa6
{ We continue grabbing material - eventually, we can give a pawn back to unravel. }
16... Rc2 17. Nd1 Nc8 18. Bb5 { Defending a4. } 18... Nb6 19. Ne5
{ With the idea of f3 next to take vital squares away from Black's knight and bishop. }
19... Nxa4 20. f3
{ We even offer to give Black back a second pawn now - this does come at a cost though. }
20... Rxg2 21. Bc6 Ra7 22. Nf2
{ The once active rook on the second rank is now pretty much shut out of the game. Even though material is equal technically, White's significantly more active pieces give him the advantage. The rook on the kingside is completely offside and will struggle to rejoin the fight later on. This is particularly dangerous for Black since we do have a passed pawn on a2 which could become a serious threat later on. Ultimately, White is doing very well here - practically-speaking especially, I think it's very difficult to defend this as Black. Of course, as already mentioned, this line is far from forced, but I think it gives some indication of the resources available for both sides. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted.

In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6
{ The most common and the most natural move, just developing.   3...dxc4  As I mentioned already, this is meant to be one of the downsides of the 3. Nc3 move order, as 3... dxc4 is supposed to be more effective here since the knight becomes a target of the b-pawn after ...b5-b4. However, I think this ultimately isn't too important - White still gets a healthy advantage after 3... dxc4.  4.e3  Intending to simply regain the pawn with Bxc4. 4. e4 is another option, but this has the downside of giving Black a target on e4 after the somewhat inevitable ...b5-b4.  b5  The most simple and logical way to defend the c4 pawn.   4...Be6  Black defends the pawn and develops simultaneously, but the bishop on e6 is exposed to a future Nf3-g5 and it also gets in the way of the e7 pawn, making it harder for Black to develop his kingside.  5.Nf3  This transposes into a relatively common position which is typically reached via a different move order with 3. Nf3 dxc4 4. e3 Be6.  b5  Overprotecting the c4 pawn so that Ng5 is a bit pointless now that Black can simply retreat his bishop.   5...Nf6  6.Ng5  Targeting the bishop.  Qc8  7.Be2 !?  This is not the most common move, but it is very natural. We want to wait for Black to force us to capture on e6 by playing ...h6, and in the meanwhile, we develop. It's not easy to find a plan for Black here, while we can expand in the centre very quickly with e4.  h6  8.Nxe6  Qxe6  9.O-O  Nbd7  10.Qc2  ±  Followed by e4-e5 with massive compensation for the pawn. We have the bishop pair, a big centre and Black still needs to find a way to finish development and castle.  6.Be2  We intend to just develop and castle for now. Black's bishop on e6 is in the way and makes it difficult for Black to do the same.  Nf6  7.O-O  g6  With the bishop on e6 blocking the e7 pawn, this is the best way for Black to try to unravel his kingside and then castle.  8.b3 !  A very strong move with an idea which will be revealed on the next move.  cxb3  9.Ng5 !  Hitting the bishop on e6 - we want to chase Black's bishop away so that we can recapture on b3 with our queen.  Bc8  10.Qxb3  Attacking the soft spot on f7.  e6  11.e4  ±  White has more than enough compensation for the pawn in the form of a big centre, more space and active pieces, while Black is yet to develop at all - as a result, we're already clearly better.   4...e5  Black tries to counterattack in the centre while we spend time recouping our pawn, but this isn't so effective since d4 is well-supported.  5.Bxc4  exd4  6.exd4  In spite of our IQP, we have a comfortable edge because of our lead in development.  Nf6  7.Qb3 !  Targeting the exposed f7 pawn. It's important to note the differences between the IQP structure with a pawn on c6 and one on e6. The pawn on e6 has the advantage of blunting our bishop, but the downside is that it blocks in Black's own bishop on c8. In this case though, with the pawn on c6, our light bishop is a monster, baring down on the unprotected f7 pawn.  Qe7+  8.Nge2  g6  9.O-O  Bg7  10.Re1  +=  White's huge lead in development gives him a comfortable edge here.  5.a4  Not letting Black rest, and immediately undermining the c4 pawn.  b4  6.Ne4 !  This is an important move to remember since it might not be your natural instinct to venture forth with knight into the centre. The point is so that it can hop into c5 in the event that Black tries to defend c4 with ...Ba6.  Qd5  7.Nd2  Keeping up the pressure on the pawn on c4. Black has two ways to deal with this: he can either try to protect the pawn, or he can advance.  c3  Black's pawn keeps on marching forwards, but the deeper into our camp it goes, the less support it gets.   7...Ba6  Defending c4.  8.Qc2  We are determined to win back our pawn. Black can't defend the pawn anymore, so he should rather just switch to developing moves.  Nf6  9.Ngf3  e6  10.Bxc4  Bxc4  11.Nxc4  +=  We've recouped our pawn with a better position thanks to our lead development and better pawn structure.  8.bxc3  bxc3  9.Nb1  Once again, preparing to win back the pawn.  Qa5  10.Qc2  Blocking the pawn.  Na6  11.Qxc3  Nb4  Black is threatening ...Nc2+ so we have to be a little careful here.  12.Bd2 !  A good prophylactic move, dealing with the threat of ...Nc2+.  e6  13.Nf3  Nf6  14.Bc4  +=  Material is level, but White is better due to his more active pieces and better pawn structure.   3...e6  This is the Triangle System - aptly named on account of the triangle pawn formation: c6, d5, e6. I find this to be quite an interesting system, as Black is very flexible. By delaying ...Nf6 for the time being, he keeps his options open - he can play the Stonewall with ...f5 next, he can just transpose into the Semi-Slav with ...Nf6 or, after 4. Nf3, he can omit ...Nf6 for now and go into the notoriously sharp Noteboom Variation after 4... dxc4.  4.e3 !  I think this move makes the most sense in conjunction with my other repertoire choices. Firstly, we invite a transposition into the next chapter with 4... Nf6 5. Nf3. Black only really has one independent option and that is the Stonewall setup with 4... f5. I should point out that I spent a long time analysing the very sharp and interesting Marshall Gambit with 4. e4, but ultimately I thought that Black was doing pretty fine there if he is well-prepared. Instead, 4. e3 is a good way to fight for an opening advantage while cutting down on the lines we need to learn by inviting a transposition to the Semi-Slav.  f5  The Stonewall. Black accepts severe positional drawbacks such as the e5 weakness and the bad bishop on c8 in exchange for the outpost on e4 and some plausible kingside play.   4...Nf6  leads straight to the Semi-Slav covered in the next chapter after  5.Nf3  5.Bd3  I looked at a few alternatives here, most notably the very interesting 5. g4 !? but I couldn't find what to suggest there against the simple 5... Nf6. Instead, I really like the look of 5. Bd3 - note that 5. Nf3 isn't a valid alternative which would transpose, because our knight is going to be heading to e2 instead of f3. The point of this is so that we can play f3, taking the e4 outpost away from Black's knight.  Nf6  6.Nge2  Keeping the f3 square clear for the pawn.  Bd6  7.f3  I should mention that the pawn's purpose on f3 is not purely prophylactic - in fact, we will most likely want to play the e4 break later to open up the position once we have completed development.  O-O  8.O-O  Black has tried a few moves here, and we'll have a look at the 4 most common ones to give you an idea of how play can proceed. Overall though, I'm very happy with how White's chances look in this line.  Nbd7  Black's most flexible and natural move.   8...Kh8  Black gets his king off the a2-g8 diagonal, which could open up in the future if Black ends up playing the ...e5 break.  9.c5  Normally I'd recommend being very cautious when playing c5 because it can make Black's ... e5 counterpunch much stronger, but here ...e5 is fairly harmless and White's play on the queenside is very fast.  Bc7  10.b4  Getting the queenside play going.  b6  11.Qc2  +=  Later on White can continue expanding on the queenside with Rb1 and a4, and when the time is right he can consider playing the e4 break.   8...Qc7  Attacking h2.  9.h3  Dealing with the simple threat to the h2 pawn.  dxc4  10.Bxc4  Kh8  Getting out of the pin on the e6 pawn so that Black can play ...e5.  11.e4  e5  12.Be3  +=  The central tension favours our more active and better-developed pieces.   8...b6  This is a tempting way to try to solve the problem of the light bishop with ...Ba6/...Bb7, but it's a bit too slow and weakening.  9.cxd5 !  Black is forced to make a difficult choice here. If he recaptures with the c-pawn, then the e4 break is very strong because of the exposed h1-a8 diagonal, whereas if he recaptures with the e-pawn, the light bishop is tied to the defence of the f5 pawn.  exd5  10.a3  +=  Followed by b4, clamping down on Black's queenside with a great position.  9.Bd2  Continuing to develop.  dxc4  10.Bxc4  Nb6  11.Bb3  Keeping the pin on the e6 pawn.  Kh8  12.e4  Now is the right time for this thematic break.  fxe4  13.Nxe4 !  Recapturing with the pawn allows Black to play the strong response ...e5.  Nxe4  14.fxe4  +=  White's centre and more active pieces give him a comfortable advantage. }
4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... Bf5
{ Of all the moves Black has available, this is most in-line with the Classical Slav - Black wants to solve the problem of his light bishop, so he does - he simply develops it to f5 and asks White what he will do about it. Fortunately, we can do plenty about it... In fact, the whole point of our 3. Nc3 4. e3 setup was directed against this move, 4... Bf5 ! This is because, with our knight on c3, we are ideally placed to exploit the unguarded b7 pawn by attacking both b7 and d5 with Qb3. Although this was thought to be bad for Black for a long time, Black has recently begun to play in a way where he sacrifices the b7 pawn and tries to get compensation in the form of piece activity. This was recommended by GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav and it's definitely one of the critical tests of this whole repertoire, however, I think White is actually doing pretty well here.   4...a6  The ...a6 Slav. This opening goes by many names, like the Chebanenko Slav, or the Chameleon Slav, but let's stick with the simple "...a6 Slav". This flexible little move doesn't commit Black to a development scheme yet while introducing a few ideas for Black into the position. Firstly, it allows Black to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 without having to worry about the loose b7 pawn after Qb3, since now Black can defend it with ...Ra7 or play ...b5. The second, more obvious idea of ...a6 is to prepare ...b5 for Black. However, this all can come at the detriment of the bishop on c8 - if Black isn't careful in this line, that bishop can truly end up with zero prospects.  5.Qc2  Delaying Nf3 is one virtue of using the 3. Nc3 4. e3 move order. 5. Qc2 is a prophylactic move, directed against the development of Black's light bishop to f5. The most popular move here is the very natural 5. Nf3, but this scores a bit better and I think it's a good way to make use of our move order.  e6   5...g6  This combination of the ...a6 Slav and Schlechter Slav was one of the recommendations of GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav.  6.Bd3  Bg7  7.Nf3  O-O  8.O-O  Bg4  Passive play with 8... Nbd7 or the like doesn't challenge White at all. Black needs to develop the bishop actively to have a shot at equalising.  9.Ne5  We can't allow ...Bxf3 of course.  Be6  10.c5  Closing the centre. Usually, this move carries some risk since it makes Black's ...e5 break more powerful, but as we can see here, Black is very far from carrying out that break. We will generally be looking to play on the queenside now, with the intention of carrying out the b4-b5 break in the future.  Nbd7  11.Nxd7  11. f4 looks very tempting but Black's dark bishop will become very strong on the h6-c1 diagonal after ...Nxe5 fxe5.  Qxd7  Recapturing with the queen contains the idea of trading off Black's bad bishop with ...Bf5 next.   11...Bxd7  12.f4  Clamping down on e5, ruling out Black's break for the time being.  Qc7  13.h3 !  I like this first to prevent the ...Nf6-g4-h6 manoeuvre Malakhov has used twice with success as Black.  Rab8  14.Na4  With the obvious idea of putting our knight on the very attractive b6 outpost.  Nh5  15.Nb6  +=  I find it difficult to see a clearcut plan for Black here. Clearly playing on the queenside is out of the question, but it's not easy to find something productive to do on the kingside either - White seems to be dominating on all fronts.  12.Bd2  Bf5  13.Bxf5  gxf5  The doubled f-pawns might seem inconsequential - maybe even beneficial due to the newly-opened g-file. However, I'm not convinced that this is the case - one of Black's issues now is that the typical ...e5 break is far less effective since it leaves f5 extremely weak.   13...Qxf5  This might be objectively better, but it's a difficult move to play since it's clear that Black is grovelling for a draw in this endgame.  14.Qxf5  gxf5  15.Ne2  By all measures, our bishop on d2 looks like a very bad piece, however, it does actually have some prospects on the queenside from the a5 square.  Nd7  16.Ba5  +=  White is most definitely better in this endgame but it takes some technique to convert such positions. The key thing to keep in mind is to play on both sides of the board - we can't breakthrough by just playing on the queenside here. I highly recommend taking a look at the following game to see how it was done: 1-0  (46)  Malakhatko, V  (2556)  -Groffen, H  (2210)  Port Erin 2005. White first tied Black down to the defence of the queenside with Rc1-c3-b3, then opened up the kingside a bit with the g4 break, and then switched his focus back to the queenside, and eventually prevailed. I should reiterate one of the main problems Black faces here - his ...e5 break is counterproductive since it leaves the f5 pawn horribly weak.  14.Ne2  Nh5  15.a4  Getting queenside play underway. The rook lift, Ra1-a3-b3 is now a possibility.  Kh8  16.b4  Another decent plan is 16. Ra3-b3. Instead, we are going for the b5 break directly here.  Rg8  17.b5  This looks like a pawn sacrifice for the moment, but it's not a pawn that Black can hold on to.  axb5  18.axb5  cxb5  19.Rxa8  Rxa8  20.Rb1  ±  We've opened up the queenside with a better position thanks to our far superior pawn structure. We intend to recoup the b5 pawn next with Qd2xb5.   5...Bg4  This is an interesting idea - Black intends to neutralise our light bishop which is coming to d3 by playing ...Bg4-h5-g6. This is quite slow though, and we have time to take advantage of this.  6.h3  Bh5  7.Qb3  Attacking b7 and getting the queen off the b1-h7 diagonal.  Ra7  8.cxd5  cxd5  9.g4 !  Rushing the g-pawn forward, with the idea of kicking the knight on f6 off its perch.  Bg6  10.g5  Black can't hold on to the d5 pawn anymore.  Ne4  11.Qxd5  Qxd5  12.Nxd5  Nxg5  13.Bg2  ±  Black's d5 pawn was definitely more valuable to capture than our g5 pawn. We are clearly better because of our more active pieces.   5...b5  Black immediately carries out the "threat" created by 4... a6.  6.b3  This simple reaction, maintaining the status quo on the queenside, is the best move by far. It's too early to play c5, and cxd5 yields nothing for White of course. We'll typically be developing our bishop to b2 and then maybe play c5, after which the bishop on b2 is ideally placed to counter Black's typical central break ... e5.  Bg4  Black is trying to carry out an idea which we saw just a short while ago: ...Bg4-h5-g6 to trade off his bad bishop for our light bishop which will most likely come to d3.   6...g6  A typical development scheme which we've already seen before. Black's idea is to have the bishop on g7 to support the ...e5 break in the future.  7.Bd3  Bg7  8.Nf3  O-O  9.O-O  Nbd7  10.Bb2  Bb7  So far all the move have been very natural - both sides have developed according to their planned development schemes.  11.Rfd1  There's always a debate as to which rook belongs where, in many openings. There are often pros and cons to each, but this is my preference and also the most common move. We want to play c5 - Black will counter this with ...e5 and then once we capture on e5, the rook is ideally-placed on the d-file in the event that we want to play the e4 break. The other rook is also well-placed on a1 where it can either support the a4 break or come to c1 to cover the pawn which will be on c5.  Rc8  12.c5 !  With Black's rook committed to the c-file, now is the ideal time to play c5. As is typical in this structure, White has a couple of breaks to consider - a4 and e4, whereas Black is playing for ...e5.  e5  This is very thematic of course, and we need to know how to deal with it.  13.Nxe5  Nxe5  14.dxe5  Nd7  15.Ne2  Our priority is to protect the pawn on c5 of course.  Nxe5  16.a4 !  ±  White was already clearly better in 1-0  (40)  Miton, K  (2605)  -Savchenko, S  (2477)  Germany 2018. With a4, White is looking to open the a-file now that Black's rook is on c8 instead of a8. White is generally doing very well here since his pieces all have access to good squares while Black's light bishop is horrible on b7.   6...e6  This isn't too great positionally-speaking - the a6-b5-c6-d5-e6 pawn structure is a prison for Black's light bishop, and by playing ...e6 Black wastes a tempo if he ever wants to carry out the ...e5 pawn break.  7.Nf3  Nbd7  8.Bd3  Bb7  9.c5 !  With Black's bishop committed to b7, now is the right time to close the position.  g6  10.O-O  Bg7  11.e4  ±  We have a good version of this typical structure after Black takes on e4. Black gets the d5 outpost for his knight, but it isn't nearly enough to compensate for the hole on d6, his cramped position and the poor bishop on b7.  7.Nge2 !  An important idea to remember - we pre-empt Black's ...Bh5-g6 manoeuvre by planning to meet it with the very simple and strong Nf4 !.  Nbd7   7...Bh5  doesn't really make much sense anymore due to  8.Nf4  Bg6  9.Nxg6  hxg6  10.g3  The bishop will be well-placed on g2 now in order to maximise pressure on Black's queenside when we play e4. Additionally, the g3 pawn kills any ideas Black might have of attacking h2 with his queen and rook when we castle.  e6  11.Bg2  Nbd7  12.O-O  Be7  13.e4  ±  We have achieved our standard break with a great position - the bishop pair, more space, more active pieces etc.  8.h3  Forcing Black's bishop to h5 so that we can exchange it with Nf4xg6.  Bh5  9.Nf4  Just like in the previous line.  Bg6  10.Nxg6  hxg6  11.Bb2  e5 !?  This is Black's best way to try to free his pieces a bit and get some counterplay here. Standard play with 11... e6 doesn't challenge White in the slightest.  12.dxe5  Nxe5  13.Be2  bxc4  14.bxc4  Nxc4  15.Bxc4  dxc4  16.Rd1  +=  Black won a pawn, but this is obviously very temporary since we'll get it back shortly with Rd4xc4. White enjoys a comfortable edge due to his better pawn structure - we can target the c6 pawn and hopefully win it.  6.Nf3  c5 !  This move might look strange at first glance, seeing as Black played ...c6 just a handful of moves ago, but it is very strong and received Anand's vote of confidence in his 2012 World Championship match against Gelfand. Black argues that he isn't really losing a tempo with ...c6-c5, since White's move 5. Qc2 isn't nearly as useful in this Tarrasch structure - in fact, it's debatable whether it is better on d1 or c2. In spite of this, I still think White gets good prospects in this variation - we often end up in an IQP structure, or a symmetrical position, where White is the only one with winning chances   6...Nbd7  Normal play shouldn't challenge us too much.  7.b3  This is a typical move we have already seen before, with the point of developing the bishop to b2 and also allowing us to recapture on c4 with the b-pawn, thus preventing Black's thematic plan of ...dxc4 followed by ...b5.  Bd6  8.Bb2  O-O  9.Bd3  e5  10.cxd5  cxd5  11.Nxe5  Nxe5  12.dxe5  Bxe5  This position has been reached a couple of dozen times, with a very good score for White. Black has managed to free his pieces a bit, but at the cost of being saddled with an IQP and no kingside attack to speak of.  13.Ne2 !  Exchanging Black's good bishop and preparing to maybe plant the knight on d4 later to blockade the d5 pawn.  Qa5+  14.Bc3  Bxc3+  15.Qxc3  +=  Whether Black exchanges queens or not, he is struggling here in the long-term. He has exchanged his good, dark bishop, meaning that he has no real prospects of a kingside attack anymore. Instead, he will be subjected to the long-term defence of the pawn on d5 which will not be too much fun.  7.cxd5  Naturally, we want to play against the IQP here, and this exchange is the way to reach that structure.  exd5  8.Be2  8. g3 !? is a very rare and strange-looking suggestion of Leela's, but one which I can recommend to those who are looking for something different - either as a surprise weapon or if you aren't satisfied with the positions we get after 8. Be2.  Nc6  9.O-O  Be6  10.Rd1  In this position, there is a fork in the road: Black can play 10... Nb4 or 10... cxd4. The latter was Anand's choice in his WC match, and it is certainly the safer option, however, the position leaves Black with very few winning chances. 10... Nb4 is more active and scores better, which is why it is marginally more popular.  Nb4   10...cxd4  This move is good for trying to draw, but nothing more.  11.Nxd4  Nxd4  12.Rxd4  Bc5  13.Rd1  Qe7  13... Qe7 was necessary to protect the bishop on c5, preventing the Nxd5 tactic.  14.Bf3  O-O  Long-term, Black probably won't be able to hold on to the d5 pawn, so he decides to jettison it as soon as possible and then get compensation in the form of piece activity.  15.Nxd5  Nxd5  16.Bxd5  Bxd5  17.Rxd5  Rac8  18.Bd2  Now it's best for us not to be greedy and to just give the pawn back. Black will level the material, but we'll still retain a slight pull since we are more active.  Bxe3  19.Bc3  Bb6  20.Qf5  Qe6  21.Qf3  +=  Keeping the queens on the board, with some slight pressure still. Black should hold this with good play of course, but White's position is still slightly preferable due to our more active pieces. This was reached in the 2012 World Championship match in a game where Anand went on to hold: -  (29)  Gelfand, B  (2727)  -Anand, V  (2791)  Moscow 2012 CBM 149  11.Qb1 !  The slightly more popular move here is 11. Qd2 but it comes at the downside of allowing 11... Ne4, after which I think Black is doing completely fine. That's why I prefer 11. Qb1, which is directed against ...Ne4 since it keeps a grip on that vital e4 square. There is a downside to this though - the queen is a bit awkwardly placed on b1, meaning that Black can try to exploit its position by trapping it with ...Qc8 and ...Bf5.  Qc8  Threatening to trap our queen with ...Bf5.  12.Bd2  Clearing the c1 square for our queen.  Bf5  13.Qc1  c4  Black's best bet, with the intention of putting the knight on the d3 outpost. If Black tries to repeat moves instead with ...Nc2-b4, we can sacrifice the exchange after ...Nb4 by playing dxc5 with a good position.  14.a3  Nd3  15.Bxd3  Bxd3  Black's position looks promising, especially if he could consolidate his control over e4. However, as we shall see, this is not possible...  16.Ne5  Bf5  17.e4 !  The main thing to remember in this line - we can't allow Black to keep our dark bishop trapped on d2. The e4 pawn sacrifice is temporary, with the point of freeing our pieces, especially our dark bishop.  dxe4  18.Bg5  Hitting the knight, a defender of the e4 pawn.  Qe6  19.Re1  We want to get our pawn back.  Bd6  20.Bxf6  gxf6  21.Nf3  O-O  22.d5  Qe7  23.Nd2  +=  And we'll regain the pawn very soon with a good position, thanks to Black's wrecked pawn structure. Black was able to hold in -  (53)  Martinovic, S  (2535)  -Schneider, I  (2487)  Austria 2014, but White was doing well at this point.   4...g6  The Schlechter Slav. I've never been a huge fan of combining the Slav and ...g6, as it seems like a pretty passive setup to me. Despite this, it is quite solid and a perfectly viable way to play. The next few moves are the most common by far until we reach an important branching point on move 7:  5.Nf3  Bg7  6.Be2  We do actually have one other move here, which is the seemingly more active 6. Bd3. The primary advantage 6. Be2 has is that it covers the knight on f3. This is particularly useful since Black often develops his light bishop to g4, where it "threatens" to take on f3. The benefit of having a bishop on e2 is that in this case, we are still free to move our queen to b3 without having to worry about ...Bxf3 leaving us with doubled f-pawns.  O-O  7.O-O  This is a major branching point, where Black has tried pretty much every legal move under the sun. We'll take a look at the 8 most logical and popular ideas which he has tried from here. Black can try many things, he can try those many things in many different move orders - it's not practical to cover everything here since White can typically respond in a similar way to most of Black's tries. That's why I recommend paying special attention to the ideas and manoeuvres we use in the following few variations, and not just the actual moves. I could summarise our plans in two broad scenarios here: 1. Black develops his bishop either to e6, f5, or g4. We respond by playing cxd5 and follow up with Qb3, attacking the b7 pawn which was left unprotected. 2. Black doesn't develop his bishop and instead does something else like ...e6 or ...b6. In this case, we develop our own dark bishop with b3 and Ba3. In both situations, we should look to play Ne5 when the time is right.  Bg4  The most natural move, developing the bishop to its most active square. However, this is where the point of 7. Be2 becomes particularly clear - the bishop is ideally placed to meet ...Bxf3 so that we are still free to move our queen to b3.   7...Bf5  This is not great, and we take advantage of the usual downside of moving the light bishop: b7 is left undefended.  8.cxd5  cxd5  9.Qb3  Hitting b7, and once again Black doesn't have a comfortable way to defend it.  Bc8  10.Bd2  Nc6  11.Rac1  e6  12.Ne5  Nxe5  13.dxe5  Nd7  14.f4  ±  Both of Black's bishops are effectively buried alive, while all our pieces have good squares available.   7...Be6  Black attacks c4, but we meet this in the exact same way as 7... Bf5:  8.cxd5  cxd5  9.Qb3  Hitting b7 once again.  Qb6  This endgame is usually quite bad for Black - the doubled b-pawns are not only a long-term weakness, but we get the b5 outpost for our minor pieces as well.  10.Qxb6  axb6  11.b3  Preparing Na4 to attack b6.  Bg4  12.Na4  Nfd7  13.h3  Bxf3  14.Bxf3  +=  White has the bishop pair and a better pawn structure. White went on to win a very instructive endgame in 1-0  (49)  Epishin, V  (2675)  -Gulko, B  (2615)  Dos Hermanas 1994 CBM 041   7...e6  This looks very passive to me.  8.b3  The usual response we will be using when Black decides not to develop his light bishop.  Nbd7  9.Ba3  b2 is also a fine square for the bishop, but I like the more active a3 square more - by fianchettoing, Black has vacated the a3-f8 diagonal, which is something I think we should exploit.  Re8  10.Rc1  b6  11.Ne5  With pretty much everything else developed now is the right time to play Ne5.  Bb7  12.f4  Cementing the knight in on e5.  Rc8  13.Bf3  +=  White has more space and much more active pieces, and is far better as a result.   7...b6  This is met in a very similar way to 7... e6: with b3, Ba3 and Rc1.  8.b3  Bb7  9.Ba3  Once again, I like this active square for the bishop.  Nbd7  10.Rc1  Rc8  11.Qd2  +=  White can continue with the usual plan: Rfd1, Ne5, f4, Bf3, etc. His more active pieces guarantee at least a slight edge.   7...a6  Black is angling for the ...b5 break, but this idea can be dispatched simply with  8.a4  Preventing ...b5.  a5  Black's reasoning is that the inclusion of ...a5 and a4 favours him since now he gets the b4 outpost for knight.  9.cxd5  This makes sense, forcing the c-pawn to recapture and thus ensuring that we get the b5 outpost for our minor pieces.  cxd5  10.b3  Preparing to develop our worst piece, the dark bishop, by placing it on a3 once again.  Nc6  11.Ba3  The bishop does a good job of covering the b4 square, which Black would like to use for his knight.  Bg4  12.Ne5 !  A very strong move which was played recently in a top-level game between Xiong and Artemiev.  Bxe2  13.Qxe2  Nxe5  14.dxe5  Ne4  15.Nxe4  dxe4  16.Qc4  +=  Before this game was played, I had 16. Qb5 in my file but I think 16. Qc4 is just as strong, and since it was played in 1-0  (61)  Xiong, J  (2712)  -Artemiev, V  (2731)  Wijk aan Zee 2020 I think I'll recommend that. White is in a better position to take advantage of the weak pawns because his pieces are much more active.   7...dxc4  Taking on c4 before developing the bishop makes some sense, since it does prevent the plan we've been using so far with cxd5 and Qb3. However, Black does give up some of his central control so I think White should be quite a bit better anyway.  8.Bxc4  Bg4   8...Nbd7  Black wants to play ...b5 and ...e5 next.  9.e4  Grabbing the whole centre.  b5  10.Bd3  e5  Black fights back in the centre by temporarily sacrificing a pawn, with the intention of regaining it by playing ...Ng4xe5.  11.dxe5  Ng4  12.e6 !  A simple and strong idea. We give back the pawn voluntarily and in doing so, damage Black's pawn structure.  fxe6  13.Be2  Getting our bishop out of the way.  Qc7  Black threatens ...Rxf3 with mate on h2, which we should just prevent with  14.g3 !  +=  And here White is doing very well and has a healthy edge on account of Black's poor pawn structure and bad bishop on c8.  9.h3  Forcing the situation and picking up the bishop pair.  Bxf3  10.Qxf3  Nbd7  11.Rd1  The best square for our rook, in preparation for Black's ...e5 break.  e5  12.d5  Keeping Black's pieces as cramped as possible.  e4 !  Black needs to sacrifice this pawn to activate his minor pieces a bit.  13.Nxe4  Nxe4  14.Qxe4  Nb6  Black is down a pawn, but he has some compensation in the form of active pieces - he is also most likely going to regain the d5 pawn.  15.Rb1  Getting the rook off the long diagonal with the intention of developing our dark bishop after playing b3.  Re8  16.Qc2  cxd5  17.Be2  +=  Black has regained his pawn, but White retains the better chances because of the bishop pair and Black's weak IQP.   7...Nbd7  This is quite a popular way to play, but it doesn't solve the problem of the bishop on c8.  8.cxd5  cxd5   8...Nxd5  just allows us to build up a massive centre for free after  9.e4  Nxc3  10.bxc3  e5  11.Qc2  +=  The queen is well-placed on c2 to cover the e4 pawn in the event that Black goes ...Re8. Our big centre ann active pieces give us a clear advantage.  9.Bd2  A small, useful developing move - the bishop gets out of the way so we can get our rooks to the c-file.  Nb6  10.h3  Ne4  11.Be1  +=  Even though the bishop is a bad piece for the moment, it's still good to keep the bishop for when the position opens up in the future. White can look to play Ne5 next with a good position.  8.cxd5  Just like after 7... Be6 and 7... Bf5.  cxd5   8...Nxd5  Giving up the centre like this shouldn't challenge White much.  9.h3  Bxf3  10.Bxf3  e6  11.e4  Nxc3  12.bxc3  ±  White has a huge centre and the bishop pair, so we are clearly better.  9.Qb3  Hitting b7, once again.  b6  10.h3  Bxf3  11.Bxf3  e6  12.Bd2  Nc6  13.Rfc1  It's best to put this rook on the c-file, since it was doing nothing on f1 - the other rook could conceivably be useful on a1 or b1 in the future.  Na5  14.Qc2  Nc4  15.Be1  +=  Once again, keeping the bishop pair for when the position opens up in the future. Next, we can boot the knight away from c4 with Be2 and b3, and follow up by conquering the c-file by controlling c8 with Ba6. }
5. cxd5
{ The usual move to prepare Qb3 - the immediate Qb3 isn't quite as good because ...Qb6 is a decent way to play for Black there. }
5... cxd5
{ 5...Nxd5  doesn't make much sense to me since White does get the centre basically for free now.  6.Nge2 !  A very strong move - threatening to play e4 next, since we can now recapture on c3 with our knight. There is another strong idea though, which is Ng3 followed by e4.  e6  7.Ng3 !  I think this is even stronger than the very natural 7. e4. We force Black's bishop back before playing e4.  Bg6   7...Nxc3  8.bxc3  Bg6  9.e4  Bd6  10.f4  ±  White's massive centre gives him a clear advantage here - Qf3, Bc4 and later f5 is on its way.  8.e4  Nb6  9.h4 !  Continuing to harass Black's light bishop. h5 is threatened.  h6  10.Be3  +=  White is quite a bit better once again by virtue of his big centre. }
6. Qb3
{ The whole point - Black doesn't have a comfortable way to deal with the threat to the b7 pawn. }
6... Nc6
{ The possibility of this move, in connection with a pawn sacrifice, is what re-popularised 4... Bf5 and made GM Avrukh recommend it in his Classical Slav repertoire book.   6...Bc8  This looks pretty awful, but it is actually Black's most common move ! Black reckons that the time wasted with ...Bf5-c8 isn't too significant since he is solid enough in this Exchange Slav pawn structure, and moreover our dark bishop is also stuck inside the pawn chain on c1. However, we can use the time Black has wasted to play Nf3-e5 and f4, with a good position.  7.Nf3  The knight is on its way to e5.  e6   7...Nc6  8.Ne5  Black can't take the knight since d5 would hang after dxe5.  e6  9.f4  Supporting the monster knight on e5.  Be7  10.Bd3  O-O  11.O-O  +=  Our knight on e5 defines our advantage here. Black can't really get rid of it with ... Nxe5 since after fxe5 the semi-open f-file will be to our advantage. This position is examined slightly deeper after 7... e6.  8.Ne5  Be7  9.Bd3  O-O  10.O-O  Nc6  11.f4  We already reached this position in the previous variation. Let's have a quick look at what happens if Black tries to get rid of our knight and how play might proceed:  Nd7  12.Bd2  Ndxe5  13.fxe5  Bd7  14.Rf3  +=  Black has got rid of the thorn on e5, but in doing so opened the f-file for our rook. We now have good attacking chances on the kingside which White capitalised on in 1-0  (31)  Sadler, M  (2625)  -Ernst, S  (2581)  Oslo 2011   6...Qd7  This looks perfectly natural, but as usual, the queen is exposed to Nf3-e5 on this square, so this isn't ideal either.  7.Nf3  e6  7... Nc6 is met by 8. Ne5 !.  8.Ne5  Qc7  9.Bb5+  We quickly begin to ramp up the pressure on Black.  Nc6  10.Qa4  Rc8  11.Qxa7  +=  Black lacks compensation for the pawn. }
7. Qxb7 { Grabbing the pawn is critical, of course. } 7... Bd7 8. Qb3
{ We should immediately extract the queen before it starts getting kicked around. }
8... Rb8 9. Qd1 e5
{ Black seeks to open up the position quickly while we are temporarily behind in development. In this position, White has two possible moves: 10. dxe5 and 10. Nf3. Although these moves will transpose in many cases, my preference is for 10. Nf3, because it doesn't allow 12... Nxf3+ ! in the variation, I'll show after 10. dxe5. }
10. Nf3
{ As we just saw after the 10. dxe5, Black has the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea available there. Instead, by playing 10. Nf3 first, my intention is to avoid this following dxe5 up next by immediately playing Nd4 !, as we shall see.   10.dxe5  I think this is a slightly inaccurate move order due to 12... Nxf3+, as we'll see in a couple, moves time.  Nxe5  11.Be2  Bd6  12.Nf3  Nxf3+ !  This very strong move equalises for Black I believe. It isn't the most popular move, nor is it recommended by GM Avrukh, but I think it's Black's best bet. The idea is to remove a defender of our kingside, and then follow up with ... Qc7 and ...Bh2±e5. Often, Black has a very dangerous idea in the form of the ...Bxh3 sacrifice, which I think is the key to Black equalising here.  13.Bxf3  Qc7  14.h3  O-O  15.O-O  Rfd8  Black is down a pawn still of course, but he has plenty of compensation, for example:  16.a4  Bh2+  17.Kh1  Be5  This little finesse with ...Bh2±e5 has forced our king on to a worse square, where it is more exposed to possible ...Bxh3 sacrifices.  18.Nxd5  Nxd5  19.Bxd5  Bxh3 !  The king idea, which secures equality for Black.  20.gxh3  Qd7  White needs to deal with the threat of ...Qxh3 followed by mate, but he can't play Bg2 because the queen on d1 would hang.  21.Kg2  Qxd5+  22.Qxd5  Rxd5 =  Black is still down a pawn, but Black's activity fully compensates for it in this endgame and Black held relatively easily in -  (31)  Al Sayed, M  (2520)  -Matlakov,M  (2684)  Doha 2015 }
10... Bd6 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nd4
{ Within a couple of moves, this should transpose to the mainline after 12. Be2, but it cuts out the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea which we just saw. }
12... O-O 13. Be2
{ An important branching point in this line. 12. Nd4 is very rare, so there aren't too many practical games to go off, unfortunately. I examined two ideas here: 13... Qe7, which transposes to the mainline which was covered by GM Avrukh, and 13... Ne4 which tries to keep the game independent waters. }
13... Ne4
{ Black wants to saddle us with a weak, isolated c-pawn.   13...Qe7  This leads to a position covered by Avrukh after we castle.  14.O-O  Rfc8  An important position for the assessment of this variation. Black definitely has some compensation for the pawn in the form of his activity and pressure on our queenside, but I still think our pawn should give us a slight edge as I don't think Black has full compensation. I looked at a few ideas here such as 15. h3, 15. a4 and 15. Ncb5, but ultimately I settled for something which goes unmentioned in GM Avrukh's book: 15. Ndb5.  15.Ndb5  We try to chase the bishop off the h2-b8 diagonal, with the point of following up with a3 and b4 with tempo.  Bc5  The only move which has been tried so far.   15...Neg4  Attacking h2. In this case, we don't actually want to take on d6 because Black gets some mate threats and decent counterplay after ...Qxd6.  16.h3 !  is much stronger than taking on d6 immediately. Play can become a bit sharp and tactical now though:  Bh2+  17.Kh1  Be5  18.Bxg4 !  It's important to take with the bishop here - 18. hxg4 looks very tempting, but the complications after 18... Nxg4 seem to favour Black there and he should be able to equalise at the very least. 18. Bxg4 seems to be good enough for a slight edge on the other hand.  Nxg4  19.f4  Bxc3  20.Nxc3  Nf6  21.Qd4  +=  Black still has some compensation for the pawn, but I think White should retain an edge here.  16.a3  Intending b4 next, kicking the bishop back and preparing Bb2.  Bb6  Retreating prophylactically in preparation for b4, but this does leave d5 free for the taking.   16...Nc4  This was played in the only practical game from this position by Goryachkina, but it only alleviates the pressure Black had.  17.b3  Nd6  18.Nd4  Bxd4  19.Qxd4  +=  Black can win the b3 pawn, but then we pick up the d5 pawn. We are better regardless.   16...a6  Black boots our knight away and clears the a7 retreat square for his bishop in preparation for b4.  17.Nd4  Qd6  18.b4  Ba7  19.Bb2  +=  Once again, my impression is that Black certainly has some compensation for the pawn, but I don't think it's enough to claim full equality. We can gradually improve our position with moves like h3, Re1 and then look to start pushing Black back with f4.  17.Nxd5  Greedily grabbing a second pawn, but I don't see why not.  Nxd5  18.Qxd5  Bc6  19.Qd6  Qe8  20.Nc3  +=  Black certainly has plenty of compensation here and his bishops do look menacing, but I'm not convinced it's two pawns' worth of compensation. Black can recoup one of the pawns fairly easily, by targeting b2, but this will lead to exchanges meaning that some of Black's pressure will be neutralised and that White should still retain an edge thanks to his remaining extra pawn. }
14. O-O
{ Don't even consider taking on e4 - after ...dxe4 Black has more than enough compensation for the pawn. He is just simply too active and has far too much space there. }
14... Nxc3 15. bxc3 Qc7 16. Qc2
{ Black has a weak pawn to target on c3, but we are still up a pawn after all. }
16... Rfc8
{ Immediately applying pressure on c3.   16...Ng4  17.h3  Booting the knight away.  Nf6  18.Bd3  Improving the position of the bishop slightly.  Rfc8  19.Bd2  +=  Once again, Black has some compensation but I don't think he is fully equal. We can work on gradually unravelling by playing on the queenside, with Rfb1 and a4. }
17. Rd1 { Ignoring the c3-pawn and focussing our attention on Black's IQP. }
17... Qxc3 18. Qxc3 Rxc3 19. a4
{ Intending Nb5 next. Black has won back his pawn and restored material equality, but White retains an edge in this endgame because of the weak IQP. Black should hold with best play, but White's position is definitely preferable. Overall, my impression of the pawn sacrifice after 4... Bf5 is that Black definitely gets some compensation and it might be a good practical try, but objectively-speaking I think White should retain a slight edge as far as I can see. Now, on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6 ! }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... dxc4
{ As I mentioned already, this is meant to be one of the downsides of the 3. Nc3 move order, as 3... dxc4 is supposed to be more effective here since the knight becomes a target of the b-pawn after ...b5-b4. However, I think this ultimately isn't too important - White still gets a healthy advantage after 3... dxc4. }
4. e3
{ Intending to simply regain the pawn with Bxc4. e4 is another option, but this has the downside of giving Black a target on e4 after the somewhat inevitable ...b5-b4. }
4... Be6
{ Black defends the pawn and develops simultaneously, but the bishop on e6 is exposed to a future Nf3-g5 and it also gets in the way of the e7 pawn, making it harder for Black to develop his kingside. }
5. Nf3
{ This transposes into a relatively common position which is typically reached via a different move order with 3. Nf3 dxc4 4. e3 Be6. }
5... Nf6 6. Ng5 { Targeting the bishop. } 6... Qc8 7. Be2
{ This is not the most common move, but it is very natural. We want to wait for Black to force us to capture on e6 by playing ...h6, and in the meanwhile, we develop. It's not easy to find a plan for Black here, while we can expand in the centre very quickly with e4. }
7... h6 8. Nxe6 Qxe6 9. O-O Nbd7 10. Qc2
{ Followed by e4-e5 with massive compensation for the pawn. We have the bishop pair, a big centre and Black still needs to find a way to finish development and castle. }

This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... dxc4
{ As I mentioned already, this is meant to be one of the downsides of the 3.

However, I think this ultimately isn't too important - White still gets a healthy advantage after 3... dxc4. }
4. e3
{ Intending to simply regain the pawn with Bxc4. e4 is another option, but this has the downside of giving Black a target on e4 after the somewhat inevitable ...b5-b4. }

7... Ba6 { Defending c4. } 8. Qc2

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that.

3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.

I should point out that I spent a long time analysing the very sharp and interesting Marshall Gambit with 4. e4, but ultimately I thought that Black was doing pretty fine there if he is well-prepared.

{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... e6
{ This is the Triangle System - aptly named on account of the triangle pawn formation: c6, d5, e6. I find this to be quite an interesting system, as Black is very flexible. By delaying ...Nf6 for the time being, he keeps his options open - he can play the Stonewall with ...f5 next, he can just transpose into the Semi-Slav with ...Nf6 or, after 4. Nf3, he can omit ...Nf6 for now and go into the notoriously sharp Noteboom Variation after 4... dxc4. }
4. e3
{ I think this move makes the most sense in conjunction with my other repertoire choices. Firstly, we invite a transposition into the next chapter with 4... Nf6 5. Nf3. Black only really has one independent option and that is the Stonewall setup with 4... f5. I should point out that I spent a long time analysing the very sharp and interesting Marshall Gambit with 4. e4, but ultimately I thought that Black was doing pretty fine there if he is well-prepared. Instead, 4. e3 is a good way to fight for an opening advantage while cutting down on the lines we need to learn by inviting a transposition to the Semi-Slav. }
4... f5
{ The Stonewall. Black accepts severe positional drawbacks such as the e5 weakness and the bad bishop on c8 in exchange for the outpost on e4 and some plausible kingside play. }
5. Bd3
{ I looked at a few alternatives here, most notably the very interesting 5. g4 !? but I couldn't find what to suggest there against the simple 5... Nf6. Instead, I really like the look of 5. Bd3 - note that 5. Nf3 isn't a valid alternative which would transpose, because our knight is going to be heading to e2 instead of f3. The point of this is so that we can play f3, taking the e4 outpost away from Black's knight. }
5... Nf6 6. Nge2 { Keeping the f3 square clear for the pawn. } 6... Bd6 7. f3
{ I should mention that the pawn's purpose on f3 is not purely prophylactic - in fact, we will most likely want to play the e4 break later to open up the position once we have completed development. }
7... O-O 8. O-O
{ Black has tried a few moves here, and we'll have a look at the 4 most common ones to give you an idea of how play can proceed. Overall though, I'm very happy with how White's chances look in this line. }
8... b6
{ This is a tempting way to try to solve the problem of the light bishop with ...Ba6/...Bb7, but it's a bit too slow and weakening. }
9. cxd5
{ Black is forced to make a difficult choice here. If he recaptures with the c-pawn, then the e4 break is very strong because of the exposed h1-a8 diagonal, whereas if he recaptures with the e-pawn, the light bishop is tied to the defence of the f5 pawn. }
9... exd5 10. a3
{ Followed by b4, clamping down on Black's queenside with a great position. } *

{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav.

3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... a6
{ The ...a6 Slav. This opening goes by many names, like the Chebanenko Slav, or the Chameleon Slav, but let's stick with the simple '...a6 Slav'. This flexible little move doesn't commit Black to a development scheme yet while introducing a few ideas for Black into the position. Firstly, it allows Black to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 without having to worry about the loose b7 pawn after Qb3, since now Black can defend it with ...Ra7 or play ...b5. The second, more obvious idea of ...a6 is to prepare ...b5 for Black. However, this all can come at the detriment of the bishop on c8 - if Black isn't careful in this line, that bishop can truly end up with zero prospects. }
5. Qc2
{ Delaying Nf3 is one virtue of using the 3. Nc3 4. e3 move order. 5. Qc2 is a prophylactic move, directed against the development of Black's light bishop to f5. The most popular move here is the very natural 5. Nf3, but this scores a bit better and I think it's a good way to make use of our move order. }
5... g6
{ This combination of the ...a6 Slav and Schlechter Slav was one of the recommendations of GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav. }
6. Bd3 Bg7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O Bg4
{ Passive play with 8... Nbd7 or the like doesn't challenge White at all. Black needs to develop the bishop actively to have a shot at equalising. }
9. Ne5 { We can't allow ...Bxf3 of course. } 9... Be6 10. c5
{ Closing the centre. Usually, this move carries some risk since it makes Black's ...e5 break more powerful, but as we can see here, Black is very far from carrying out that break. We will generally be looking to play on the queenside now, with the intention of carrying out the b4-b5 break in the future. }
10... Nbd7 11. Nxd7
{ 11. f4 looks very tempting but Black's dark bishop will become very strong on the h6-c1 diagonal after ...Nxe5 fxe5. }
11... Bxd7 12. f4
{ Clamping down on e5, ruling out Black's break for the time being. } 12... Qc7
13. h3
{ I like this first to prevent the ...Nf6-g4-h6 manoeuvre Malakhov has used twice with success as Black. }
13... Rab8 14. Na4
{ With the obvious idea of putting our knight on the very attractive b6 outpost. }
14... Nh5 15. Nb6
{ I find it difficult to see a clearcut plan for Black here. Clearly playing on the queenside is out of the question, but it's not easy to find something productive to do on the kingside either - White seems to be dominating on all fronts. }

12. Bd2 Bf5 13. Bxf5 Qxf5

{ By all measures, our bishop on d2 looks like a very bad piece, however, it does actually have some prospects on the queenside from the a5 square. }
15... Nd7 16. Ba5
{ White is most definitely better in this endgame but it takes some technique to convert such positions. The key thing to keep in mind is to play on both sides of the board - we can't breakthrough by just playing on the queenside here. I highly recommend taking a look at the following game to see how it was done: 1-0  (46)  Malakhatko, V  (2556)  -Groffen, H  (2210)  Port Erin 2005. White first tied Black down to the defence of the queenside with Rc1-c3-b3, then opened up the kingside a bit with the g4 break, and then switched his focus back to the queenside, and eventually prevailed. I should reiterate one of the main problems Black faces here - his ...e5 break is counterproductive since it leaves the f5 pawn horribly weak. }

{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... a6
{ The ...a6 Slav. This opening goes by many names, like the Chebanenko Slav, or the Chameleon Slav, but let's stick with the simple '...a6 Slav'. This flexible little move doesn't commit Black to a development scheme yet while introducing a few ideas for Black into the position. Firstly, it allows Black to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 without having to worry about the loose b7 pawn after Qb3, since now Black can defend it with ...Ra7 or play ...b5. The second, more obvious idea of ...a6 is to prepare ...b5 for Black. However, this all can come at the detriment of the bishop on c8 - if Black isn't careful in this line, that bishop can truly end up with zero prospects. }
5. Qc2
{ Delaying Nf3 is one virtue of using the 3. Nc3 4. e3 move order. 5. Qc2 is a prophylactic move, directed against the development of Black's light bishop to f5. The most popular move here is the very natural 5. Nf3, but this scores a bit better and I think it's a good way to make use of our move order. }
5... g6
{ This combination of the ...a6 Slav and Schlechter Slav was one of the recommendations of GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav. }
6. Bd3 Bg7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O Bg4
{ Passive play with 8... Nbd7 or the like doesn't challenge White at all. Black needs to develop the bishop actively to have a shot at equalising. }
9. Ne5 { We can't allow ...Bxf3 of course. } 9... Be6 10. c5
{ Closing the centre. Usually, this move carries some risk since it makes Black's ...e5 break more powerful, but as we can see here, Black is very far from carrying out that break. We will generally be looking to play on the queenside now, with the intention of carrying out the b4-b5 break in the future. }
10... Nbd7 11. Nxd7
{ 11. f4 looks very tempting but Black's dark bishop will become very strong on the h6-c1 diagonal after ...Nxe5 fxe5. }
11... Qxd7
{ Recapturing with the queen contains the idea of trading off Black's bad bishop with ...Bf5 next. }
12. Bd2 Bf5 13. Bxf5 gxf5
{ The doubled f-pawns might seem inconsequential - maybe even beneficial due to the newly-opened g-file. However, I'm not convinced that this is the case - one of Black's issues now is that the typical ...e5 break is far less effective since it leaves f5 extremely weak. }
14. Ne2 Nh5 15. a4
{ Getting queenside play underway. The rook lift, Ra1-a3-b3 is now a possibility. This is where Avrukh's analysis diverges - he looks at 15.Ng3 and 15.f3. }
15... Kh8 16. b4
{ Another decent plan is 16. Ra3-b3. Instead, we are going for the b5 break directly here. }
16... Rg8 17. b5
{ This looks like a pawn sacrifice for the moment, but it's not a pawn that Black can hold on to. }
17... axb5 18. axb5 cxb5 19. Rxa8 Rxa8 20. Rb1
{ We've opened up the queenside with a better position thanks to our far superior pawn structure. We intend to recoup the b5 pawn next with Qd3xb5. }

Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter.

This flexible little move doesn't commit Black to a development scheme yet while introducing a few ideas for Black into the position. Firstly, it allows Black to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 without having to worry about the loose b7 pawn after Qb3, since now Black can defend it with ...Ra7 or play ...b5. The second, more obvious idea of ...a6 is to prepare ...b5 for Black. However, this all can come at the detriment of the bishop on c8 - if Black isn't careful in this line, that bishop can truly end up with zero prospects. }

6... e6
{ This isn't too great positionally-speaking - the a6-b5-c6-d5-e6 pawn structure is a prison for Black's light bishop, and by playing ...e6 Black wastes a tempo if he ever wants to carry out the ...e5 pawn break. }
7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. Bd3 Bb7 9. c5
{ With Black's bishop committed to b7, now is the right time to close the position. }
9... g6 10. O-O Bg7 11. e4
{ We have a good version of this typical structure after Black takes on e4. Black gets the d5 outpost for his knight, but it isn't nearly enough to compensate for the hole on d6, his cramped position and the poor bishop on b7. }

As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav.

It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.

It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... a6
{ The ...a6 Slav. This opening goes by many names, like the Chebanenko Slav, or the Chameleon Slav, but let's stick with the simple '...a6 Slav'. This flexible little move doesn't commit Black to a development scheme yet while introducing a few ideas for Black into the position. Firstly, it allows Black to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 without having to worry about the loose b7 pawn after Qb3, since now Black can defend it with ...Ra7 or play ...b5. The second, more obvious idea of ...a6 is to prepare ...b5 for Black. However, this all can come at the detriment of the bishop on c8 - if Black isn't careful in this line, that bishop can truly end up with zero prospects. }
5. Qc2
{ Delaying Nf3 is one virtue of using the 3. Nc3 4. e3 move order. 5. Qc2 is a prophylactic move, directed against the development of Black's light bishop to f5. The most popular move here is the very natural 5. Nf3, but this scores a bit better and I think it's a good way to make use of our move order. }
5... e6 6. Nf3 c5
{ This move might look strange at first glance, seeing as Black played ...c6 just a handful of moves ago, but it is very strong and received Anand's vote of confidence in his 2012 World Championship match against Gelfand. Black argues that he isn't really losing a tempo with ...c6-c5, since White's move 5. Qc2 isn't nearly as useful in this Tarrasch structure - in fact, it's debatable whether it is better on d1 or c2. In spite of this, I still think White gets good prospects in this variation - we often end up in an IQP structure, or a symmetrical position, where White is the only one with winning chances }
7. cxd5
{ Naturally, we want to play against the IQP here, and this exchange is the way to reach that structure. }
7... exd5 8. Be2
{ 8. g3 !? is a very rare and strange-looking suggestion of Leela's, but one which I can recommend to those who are looking for something different - either as a surprise weapon or if you aren't satisfied with the positions we get after 8. Be2. }
8... Nc6 9. O-O Be6 10. Rd1
{ In this position, there is a fork in the road: Black can play 10... Nb4 or 10... cxd4. The latter was Anand's choice in his WC match, and it is certainly the safer option, however, the position leaves Black with very few winning chances. 10... Nb4 is more active and scores better, which is why it is marginally more popular. }
10... cxd4 { This move is good for trying to draw, but nothing more. } 11. Nxd4
Nxd4 12. Rxd4 Bc5 13. Rd1 Qe7
{ 13... Qe7 was necessary to protect the bishop on c5, preventing the Nxd5 tactic. }
14. Bf3 O-O
{ Long-term, Black probably won't be able to hold on to the d5 pawn, so he decides to jettison it as soon as possible and then get compensation in the form of piece activity. }
15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. Bxd5 Bxd5 17. Rxd5 Rac8 18. Bd2
{ Now it's best for us not to be greedy and to just give the pawn back. Black will level the material, but we'll still retain a slight pull since we are more active. }
18... Bxe3 19. Bc3 Bb6 20. Qf5 Qe6 21. Qf3
{ Keeping the queens on the board, with some slight pressure still. Black should hold this with good play of course, but White's position is still slightly preferable due to our more active pieces. This was reached in the 2012 World Championship match in a game where Anand went on to hold: -  (29)  Gelfand, B  (2727)  -Anand, V  (2791)  Moscow 2012 CBM 149 }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3.

10... Nb4 11. Qb1
{ The slightly more popular move here is 11. Qd2 but it comes at the downside of allowing 11... Ne4, after which I think Black is doing completely fine. That's why I prefer 11. Qb1, which is directed against ...Ne4 since it keeps a grip on that vital e4 square. There is a downside to this though - the queen is a bit awkwardly placed on b1, meaning that Black can try to exploit its position by trapping it with ...Qc8 and ...Bf5. }
11... Qc8 { Threatening to trap our queen with ...Bf5. } 12. Bd2
{ Clearing the c1 square for our queen. } 12... Bf5 13. Qc1 c4
{ Black's best bet, with the intention of putting the knight on the d3 outpost. If Black tries to repeat moves instead with ...Nc2-b4, we can sacrifice the exchange after ...Nb4 by playing dxc5 with a good position. }
14. a3 Nd3 15. Bxd3 Bxd3
{ Black's position looks promising, especially if he could consolidate his control over e4. However, as we shall see, this is not possible... }
16. Ne5 Bf5
{ In one of our Model Games, Tomashevsky - Ni we take a look at the rarer 16...Bg6. }
17. e4
{ The main thing to remember in this line - we can't allow Black to keep our dark bishop trapped on d2. The e4 pawn sacrifice is temporary, with the point of freeing our pieces, especially our dark bishop. }
17... dxe4 18. Bg5 { Hitting the knight, a defender of the e4 pawn. } 18... Qe6
19. Re1 { We want to get our pawn back. } 19... Bd6 20. Bxf6 gxf6 21. Nf3 O-O
22. d5 Qe7 23. Nd2
{ And we'll regain the pawn very soon with a good position, thanks to Black's wrecked pawn structure. Black was able to hold in 1/2 - 1/2  (53)  Martinovic, S  (2535)  -Schneider, I  (2487)  Austria 2014, but White was doing well at this point. }

4... g6
{ The Schlechter Slav. I've never been a huge fan of combining the Slav and ...g6, as it seems like a pretty passive setup to me. Despite this, it is quite solid and a perfectly viable way to play. The next few moves are the most common by far until we reach an important branching point on move 7: }
5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be2
{ We do actually have one other move here, which is the seemingly more active 6. Bd3. The primary advantage 6. Be2 has is that it covers the knight on f3. This is particularly useful since Black often develops his light bishop to g4, where it 'threatens' to take on f3. The benefit of having a bishop on e2 is that in this case, we are still free to move our queen to b3 without having to worry about ...Bxf3 leaving us with doubled f-pawns. }
6... O-O 7. O-O
{ This is a major branching point, where Black has tried pretty much every legal move under the sun. We'll take a look at the 8 most logical and popular ideas which he has tried from here. Black can try many things, he can try those many things in many different move orders - it's not practical to cover everything here since White can typically respond in a similar way to most of Black's tries. That's why I recommend paying special attention to the ideas and manoeuvres we use in the following few variations, and not just the actual moves. I could summarise our plans in two broad scenarios here: 1. Black develops his bishop either to e6, f5, or g4. We respond by playing cxd5 and follow up with Qb3, attacking the b7 pawn which was left unprotected. 2. Black doesn't develop his bishop and instead does something else like ...e6 or ...b6. In this case, we develop our own dark bishop with b3 and Ba3. In both situations, we should look to play Ne5 when the time is right. }
7... Bf5
{ This is not great, and we take advantage of the usual downside of moving the light bishop: b7 is left undefended. }
8. cxd5 cxd5 9. Qb3
{ Hitting b7, and once again Black doesn't have a comfortable way to defend it. }
9... Bc8 10. Bd2 Nc6 11. Rac1 e6 12. Ne5 Nxe5 13. dxe5 Nd7 14. f4

This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... g6
{ The Schlechter Slav. I've never been a huge fan of combining the Slav and ...g6, as it seems like a pretty passive setup to me. Despite this, it is quite solid and a perfectly viable way to play. The next few moves are the most common by far until we reach an important branching point on move 7: }
5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be2
{ We do actually have one other move here, which is the seemingly more active 6. Bd3. The primary advantage 6. Be2 has is that it covers the knight on f3. This is particularly useful since Black often develops his light bishop to g4, where it 'threatens' to take on f3. The benefit of having a bishop on e2 is that in this case, we are still free to move our queen to b3 without having to worry about ...Bxf3 leaving us with doubled f-pawns. }
6... O-O 7. O-O
{ This is a major branching point, where Black has tried pretty much every legal move under the sun. We'll take a look at the 8 most logical and popular ideas which he has tried from here. Black can try many things, he can try those many things in many different move orders - it's not practical to cover everything here since White can typically respond in a similar way to most of Black's tries. That's why I recommend paying special attention to the ideas and manoeuvres we use in the following few variations, and not just the actual moves. I could summarise our plans in two broad scenarios here: 1. Black develops his bishop either to e6, f5, or g4. We respond by playing cxd5 and follow up with Qb3, attacking the b7 pawn which was left unprotected. 2. Black doesn't develop his bishop and instead does something else like ...e6 or ...b6. In this case, we develop our own dark bishop with b3 and Ba3. In both situations, we should look to play Ne5 when the time is right. }
7... Be6
{ Black attacks c4, but we meet this in the exact same way as 7... Bf5: } 8.
cxd5 cxd5 9. Qb3 { Hitting b7 once again. } 9... Qb6
{ This endgame is usually quite bad for Black - the doubled b-pawns are not only a long-term weakness, but we get the b5 outpost for our minor pieces as well. }
10. Qxb6 axb6 11. b3 { Preparing Na4 to attack b6. } 11... Bg4 12. Na4 Nfd7 13.
h3 Bxf3 14. Bxf3
{ White has the bishop pair and a better pawn structure. White went on to win a very instructive endgame in 1-0  (49)  Epishin, V  (2675)  -Gulko, B  (2615)  Dos Hermanas 1994 CBM 041. }

3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3.

Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... g6
{ The Schlechter Slav. I've never been a huge fan of combining the Slav and ...g6, as it seems like a pretty passive setup to me. Despite this, it is quite solid and a perfectly viable way to play. The next few moves are the most common by far until we reach an important branching point on move 7: }
5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be2
{ We do actually have one other move here, which is the seemingly more active 6. Bd3. The primary advantage 6. Be2 has is that it covers the knight on f3. This is particularly useful since Black often develops his light bishop to g4, where it 'threatens' to take on f3. The benefit of having a bishop on e2 is that in this case, we are still free to move our queen to b3 without having to worry about ...Bxf3 leaving us with doubled f-pawns. }
6... O-O 7. O-O
{ This is a major branching point, where Black has tried pretty much every legal move under the sun. We'll take a look at the 8 most logical and popular ideas which he has tried from here. Black can try many things, he can try those many things in many different move orders - it's not practical to cover everything here since White can typically respond in a similar way to most of Black's tries. That's why I recommend paying special attention to the ideas and manoeuvres we use in the following few variations, and not just the actual moves. I could summarise our plans in two broad scenarios here: 1. Black develops his bishop either to e6, f5, or g4. We respond by playing cxd5 and follow up with Qb3, attacking the b7 pawn which was left unprotected. 2. Black doesn't develop his bishop and instead does something else like ...e6 or ...b6. In this case, we develop our own dark bishop with b3 and Ba3. In both situations, we should look to play Ne5 when the time is right. }
7... dxc4
{ Taking on c4 before developing the bishop makes some sense, since it does prevent the plan we've been using so far with cxd5 and Qb3. However, Black does give up some of his central control so I think White should be quite a bit better anyway. }
8. Bxc4 Nbd7 { Black wants to play ...b5 and ...e5 next. } 9. e4
{ Grabbing the whole centre. } 9... b5 10. Bd3 e5
{ Black fights back in the centre by temporarily sacrificing a pawn, with the intention of regaining it by playing ...Ng4xe5. }
11. dxe5 Ng4 12. e6
{ A simple and strong idea. We give back the pawn voluntarily and in doing so, damage Black's pawn structure. }
12... fxe6 13. Be2 { Getting our bishop out of the way. } 13... Qc7
{ Black threatens ...Rxf3 with mate on h2, which we should just prevent with }
14. g3
{ And here White is doing very well and has a healthy edge on account of Black's poor pawn structure and bad bishop on c8. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... g6
{ The Schlechter Slav. I've never been a huge fan of combining the Slav and ...g6, as it seems like a pretty passive setup to me. Despite this, it is quite solid and a perfectly viable way to play. The next few moves are the most common by far until we reach an important branching point on move 7: }
5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be2
{ We do actually have one other move here, which is the seemingly more active 6. Bd3. The primary advantage 6. Be2 has is that it covers the knight on f3. This is particularly useful since Black often develops his light bishop to g4, where it 'threatens' to take on f3. The benefit of having a bishop on e2 is that in this case, we are still free to move our queen to b3 without having to worry about ...Bxf3 leaving us with doubled f-pawns. }
6... O-O 7. O-O
{ This is a major branching point, where Black has tried pretty much every legal move under the sun. We'll take a look at the 8 most logical and popular ideas which he has tried from here. Black can try many things, he can try those many things in many different move orders - it's not practical to cover everything here since White can typically respond in a similar way to most of Black's tries. That's why I recommend paying special attention to the ideas and manoeuvres we use in the following few variations, and not just the actual moves. I could summarise our plans in two broad scenarios here: 1. Black develops his bishop either to e6, f5, or g4. We respond by playing cxd5 and follow up with Qb3, attacking the b7 pawn which was left unprotected. 2. Black doesn't develop his bishop and instead does something else like ...e6 or ...b6. In this case, we develop our own dark bishop with b3 and Ba3. In both situations, we should look to play Ne5 when the time is right. }
7... Bg4
{ The most natural move, developing the bishop to its most active square. However, this is where the point of 7. Be2 becomes particularly clear - the bishop is ideally placed to meet ...Bxf3 so that we are still free to move our queen to b3. }
8. cxd5 { Just like after 7... Be6 and 7... Bf5. } 8... Nxd5
{ Giving up the centre like this shouldn't challenge White much. } 9. h3 Bxf3
10. Bxf3 e6 11. e4 Nxc3 12. bxc3

Fortunately, we can do plenty about it... In fact, the whole point of our 3. Nc3 4. e3 setup was directed against this move, 4... Bf5 ! This is because, with our knight on c3, we are ideally placed to exploit the unguarded b7 pawn by attacking both b7 and d5 with Qb3. Although this was thought to be bad for Black for a long time, Black has recently begun to play in a way where he sacrifices the b7 pawn and tries to get compensation in the form of piece activity. This was recommended by GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav and it's definitely one of the critical tests of this whole repertoire, however, I think White is actually doing pretty well here. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }

{ Of all the moves Black has available, this is most in-line with the Classical Slav - Black wants to solve the problem of his light bishop, so he does - he simply develops it to f5 and asks White what he will do about it. Fortunately, we can do plenty about it... In fact, the whole point of our 3. Nc3 4. e3 setup was directed against this move, 4... Bf5 ! This is because, with our knight on c3, we are ideally placed to exploit the unguarded b7 pawn by attacking both b7 and d5 with Qb3. Although this was thought to be bad for Black for a long time, Black has recently begun to play in a way where he sacrifices the b7 pawn and tries to get compensation in the form of piece activity. This was recommended by GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav and it's definitely one of the critical tests of this whole repertoire, however, I think White is actually doing pretty well here. }
5. cxd5
{ The usual move to prepare Qb3 - the immediate Qb3 isn't quite as good because ...Qb6 is a decent way to play for Black there. }
5... cxd5 6. Qb3
{ The whole point - Black doesn't have a comfortable way to deal with the threat to the b7 pawn. }
6... Nc6
{ The possibility of this move, in connection with a pawn sacrifice, is what re-popularised 4... Bf5 and made GM Avrukh recommend it in his Classical Slav repertoire book. }
7. Qxb7 { Grabbing the pawn is critical, of course. } 7... Bd7 8. Qb3
{ We should immediately extract the queen before it starts getting kicked around. }
8... Rb8 9. Qd1 e5
{ Black seeks to open up the position quickly while we are temporarily behind in development. In this position, White has two possible moves: 10. dxe5 and 10. Nf3. Although these moves will transpose in many cases, my preference is for 10. Nf3, because it doesn't allow 12... Nxf3+ ! in the variation, I'll show after 10. dxe5. }
10. dxe5
{ I think this is a slightly inaccurate move order due to 12... Nxf3+, as we'll see in a couple, moves time. }
10... Nxe5 11. Be2 Bd6 12. Nf3 Nxf3+
{ This very strong move equalises for Black I believe. It isn't the most popular move, nor is it recommended by GM Avrukh, but I think it's Black's best bet. The idea is to remove a defender of our kingside, and then follow up with ... Qc7 and ...Bh2±e5. Often, Black has a very dangerous idea in the form of the ...Bxh3 sacrifice, which I think is the key to Black equalising here. }
13. Bxf3 Qc7 14. h3 O-O 15. O-O Rfd8
{ Black is down a pawn still of course, but he has plenty of compensation, for example: }
16. a4 Bh2+ 17. Kh1 Be5
{ This little finesse with ...Bh2±e5 has forced our king on to a worse square, where it is more exposed to possible ...Bxh3 sacrifices. }
18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Bxd5 Bxh3
{ The king idea, which secures equality for Black. } 20. gxh3 Qd7
{ White needs to deal with the threat of ...Qxh3 followed by mate, but he can't play Bg2 because the queen on d1 would hang. }
21. Kg2 Qxd5+ 22. Qxd5 Rxd5
{ Black is still down a pawn, but Black's activity fully compensates for it in this endgame and Black held relatively easily in -  (31)  Al Sayed, M  (2520)  -Matlakov,M  (2684)  Doha 2015 }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }

{ As we just saw after the 10. dxe5, Black has the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea available there. Instead, by playing 10. Nf3 first, my intention is to avoid this following dxe5 up next by immediately playing Nd4 !, as we shall see. }
10... Bd6 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nd4
{ Within a couple of moves, this should transpose to the mainline after 12. Be2, but it cuts out the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea which we just saw. }
12... O-O 13. Be2
{ An important branching point in this line. 12. Nd4 is very rare, so there aren't too many practical games to go off, unfortunately. I examined two ideas here: 13... Qe7, which transposes to the mainline which was covered by GM Avrukh, and 13... Ne4 which tries to keep the game independent waters. }
13... Qe7 { This leads to a position covered by Avrukh after we castle. } 14.
O-O Rfc8
{ An important position for the assessment of this variation. Black definitely has some compensation for the pawn in the form of his activity and pressure on our queenside, but I still think our pawn should give us a slight edge as I don't think Black has full compensation. I looked at a few ideas here such as 15. h3, 15. a4 and 15. Ncb5, but ultimately I settled for something which goes unmentioned in GM Avrukh's book: 15. Ndb5. }
15. Ndb5
{ We try to chase the bishop off the h2-b8 diagonal, with the point of following up with a3 and b4 with tempo. }
15... Neg4
{ Attacking h2. In this case, we don't actually want to take on d6 because Black gets some mate threats and decent counterplay after ...Qxd6. }
16. h3
{ is much stronger than taking on d6 immediately. Play can become a bit sharp and tactical now though: }
16... Bh2+ 17. Kh1 Be5 18. Bxg4
{ It's important to take with the bishop here - 18. hxg4 looks very tempting, but the complications after 18... Nxg4 seem to favour Black there and he should be able to equalise at the very least. 18. Bxg4 seems to be good enough for a slight edge on the other hand. }
18... Nxg4 19. f4 Bxc3 20. Nxc3 Nf6 21. Qd4
{ Black still has some compensation for the pawn, but I think White should retain an edge here. }

{ As we just saw after the 10. dxe5, Black has the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea available there. Instead, by playing 10. Nf3 first, my intention is to avoid this following dxe5 up next by immediately playing Nd4 !, as we shall see. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav Defence - one of the very best all-round defences to 1. d4 that Black has at his disposal. Let's start off by discussing some of its basic characteristics. Black supports the pawn on d5 with another pawn, thus not surrendering control over the centre by taking on c4 like in the Queen's Gambit Accepted. As we already saw in the previous chapters, there is another viable way to cover the d5 pawn - namely, with 2... e6, the Queen's Gambit Declined. Compared to the QGD, the Slav has a major advantage: the bishop on c8 isn't locked in by a pawn on e6 yet. In the Classical Slav, Black will typically try to make use of this by developing his light bishop to f5 or g4 in the future, while in the Semi-Slav, Black just plays ...e6 anyway and usually follows up with ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. As mentioned in the prior chapters though, the QGD has one major perk too - Black can develop his minor pieces faster on the kingside, meaning that he can get his king castled very quickly. In the Slav, it takes usually takes a bit longer to get the king to safety.   We'll be dealing with the Slav complex in 3 chapters. This is the second chapter, which begins to cover my main recommendation against the Slav complex. In the previous chapter, we examined a secondary, back-up weapon of mine, the Exchange Slav. This chapter deals with all of Black's options besides the Semi-Slav - in other words, everything besides 4... e6 and all deviations before that. In the next chapter, we'll move on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6. }
3. Nc3
{ White is looking to develop his knights, but which one should we develop first ? Both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have their pros and cons. If White intends to play the absolute Slav mainline, then 3. Nf3 followed by 4. Nc3 is probably the better move order because 3... dxc4 is less effective here. However, both 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3 have independent options - White has alternatives on move 4, meaning that he doesn't have to develop his knights to f3 and c3 automatically. The main independent option that both 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 have is the move 4. e3. Interestingly enough, it makes a huge difference whether we play 3. Nc3 4. e3 or 3. Nf3 4. e3. We'll be opting for the former, for reasons that I'll explain in just a second. The latter option, 3. Nf3 4. e3, is something that was recommended by GM Avrukh in his acclaimed 1. d4 repertoire books, and it's something that I've also played plenty of times. It tends to lead to a slower, more positional game - against 4... Bf5 White typically gains the bishop pair at some point with Nh4, but Black remains very solid. I think it isn't that easy to take advantage of this unless you are a very strong positional/technical player, so I decided to go for something a bit more direct and confrontational.   Our choice going to be 3. Nc3 4. e3. This has one major advantage over 3. Nf3, which is that the knight on c3 puts pressure on Black's d5 pawn. This makes it harder for Black to develop his light bishop as we'll see because we have Qb3 ideas available which are very strong. The supposed downside to 3. Nc3 is that Black has 3... dxc4 which is a bit stronger than against 3. Nf3, but I don't think this is an issue at all since 3... dxc4 is still good for us.   The more genuine downside in my view is that we are locked into a Meran/Anti-Meran against the Semi-Slav - some people might find this a little bit annoying since 5. Bg5 lines are often considered to be a bit more challenging against the Semi Slav than 5. e3 lines, but I think this is more a matter of preference. In a nutshell, I suppose you could say that in comparison to the mainline with 3. Nf3 4. Nc3, we gain something against the Classical Slav since it is harder for Black to get his typical plan with ...Bf5 in, but we lose something against the Semi-Slav since we don't have the option of playing the 5. Bg5 line against the Semi-Slav. }
3... Nf6 { The most common and the most natural move, just developing. } 4. e3
{ I already discussed some of the ideas behind this on the previous move, but I think I should elaborate. The most popular move here - the mainline - is 4. Nf3. After that, Black can head into the Classical Slav with 4... dxc4. Black's idea there is that he'll have time to develop his light bishop outside the pawn chain to f5 while White spends time trying to recoup the pawn on c4 with either Ne5xc4 or e3 Bxc4. However, after 4. e3, this plan is clearly not effective at all since we can just immediately recapture the pawn with Bxc4. That's why this move order with 3. Nc3 4. e3 is specifically directed against the Classical Slav. I should also reiterate why we play 3. Nc3 instead of 3. Nf3 - it is to put pressure on the d5 pawn. This pressure on the d5 pawn makes it possible to meet 4... Bf5 with 5. Qb3 ! - Black can still play this way, but it involves a pawn sacrifice now, as we shall see. I consider Black's best option at this point to transpose into the Semi-Slav with 4... e6, which we'll analyse in the next chapter. In this chapter, we'll be looking at all other moves that Black has at his disposal: 4. ..g6, 4... a6 and 4... Bf5. }
4... Bf5
{ Of all the moves Black has available, this is most in-line with the Classical Slav - Black wants to solve the problem of his light bishop, so he does - he simply develops it to f5 and asks White what he will do about it. Fortunately, we can do plenty about it... In fact, the whole point of our 3. Nc3 4. e3 setup was directed against this move, 4... Bf5 ! This is because, with our knight on c3, we are ideally placed to exploit the unguarded b7 pawn by attacking both b7 and d5 with Qb3. Although this was thought to be bad for Black for a long time, Black has recently begun to play in a way where he sacrifices the b7 pawn and tries to get compensation in the form of piece activity. This was recommended by GM Avrukh in his book on the Classical Slav and it's definitely one of the critical tests of this whole repertoire, however, I think White is actually doing pretty well here. }

Nxd5 18. Qxd5 Bc6 19. Qd6 Qe8 20. Nc3
{ Black certainly has plenty of compensation here and his bishops do look menacing, but I'm not convinced it's two pawns' worth of compensation. Black can recoup one of the pawns fairly easily, by targeting b2, but this will lead to exchanges meaning that some of Black's pressure will be neutralised and that White should still retain an edge thanks to his remaining extra pawn. }

{ As we just saw after the 10. dxe5, Black has the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea available there. Instead, by playing 10. Nf3 first, my intention is to avoid this following dxe5 up next by immediately playing Nd4 !, as we shall see. }
10... Bd6 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nd4
{ Within a couple of moves, this should transpose to the mainline after 12. Be2, but it cuts out the strong 12... Nxf3+ idea which we just saw. }
12... O-O 13. Be2
{ An important branching point in this line. 12. Nd4 is very rare, so there aren't too many practical games to go off, unfortunately. I examined two ideas here: 13... Qe7, which transposes to the mainline which was covered by GM Avrukh, and 13... Ne4 which tries to keep the game independent waters. }
13... Ne4 { Black wants to saddle us with a weak, isolated c-pawn. } 14. O-O
{ Don't even consider taking on e4 - after ...dxe4 Black has more than enough compensation for the pawn. He is just simply too active and has far too much space there. }
14... Nxc3 15. bxc3 Qc7 16. Qc2
{ Black has a weak pawn to target on c3, but we are still up a pawn after all. }
16... Rfc8 { Immediately applying pressure on c3. } 17. Rd1
{ Ignoring the c3-pawn and focussing our attention on Black's IQP. } 17... Qxc3
18. Qxc3 Rxc3 19. a4
{ Intending Nb5 next. Black has won back his pawn and restored material equality, but White retains an edge in this endgame because of the weak IQP. Black should hold with best play, but White's position is definitely preferable. Overall, my impression of the pawn sacrifice after 4... Bf5 is that Black definitely gets some compensation and it might be a good practical try, but objectively-speaking I think White should retain a slight edge as far as I can see. Now, on to the Semi-Slav with 4... e6 ! }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example, 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order.   5...a6  is a pretty common and very respectable way to play, but we already covered this after  6.Qc2  and we transpose to a line we covered after 4... a6 in the previous chapter. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ 6...dxc4  This is exactly what 6. Qc2 was directed against. Taking on c4 here is very premature since we haven't moved our light bishop here, meaning that we can take back on c4 in one move without losing any time. Black tries to play a Meran variation, but the fact that we got Qc2 in for free makes a very big difference.  7.Bxc4  b5  8.Bd3  a6  9.O-O  c5  This plan of ...dxc4, ...b5, ...a6 followed by ...c5 is standard in the Meran, but here it simply isn't nearly as effective because our queen is on c2.  10.a4  Provoking ...b4.  b4  11.Ne4  Bb7  12.Nxf6+  Nxf6  13.dxc5  Bxc5  14.e4  +=  This is just one illustration of the differences between having the queen on c2 instead of d1. e4 wouldn't be possible otherwise and the bishop on c5 wouldn't be attacked here. Because of the possibility of e4, White is doing better here and he went on to win in 1-0  (60)  Melkumyan,H  (2628)  -Benidze,D  (2530)  Plovdiv 2012   6...Bb4  This makes little sense to me in the Semi-Slav pawn structure. I don't see what the pin achieves for Black here, and there's no reason he'd want to give up his good bishop for our knight here.  7.Bd3  O-O  8.O-O  Re8  9.a3  Since taking on c3 is not great, since it just gives away the bishop pair, we have in effect got a3 for free here.  Bd6  10.e4 !  Just like after 6... b6, the e4 break is particularly strong when Black's bishop is on d6.  dxe4  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  +=  Attacking the h7 pawn with a very good position. Black has no time to play ...b6 and ...Bb7, let alone ...c5 here.   6...a6  7.b3  transposes once again to a line that we covered after 4... a6 in the previous chapter.   6...b6  Black intends to fianchetto his position and just play solidly, but these plans never appear too challenging to me. If Black plays slowly and passively like this, White can usually prepare the e4 break and get a good position with minimal effort.  7.Bd3  Bb7  8.O-O  Black has played all the obvious moves and now has an important decision to make. In this structure, it is pretty important whether Black puts his bishop on d6 or e7. There are several pros and cons to each square, which we'll look at in the relevant variation.  Bd6  This looks like the better and more active square, but it does have a major downside: the bishop is much more exposed on d6. This is something we can exploit with our next move.   8...Be7  This is the more common square for the bishop, but it will just transpose to a line that we look at a bit later. The bishop on e7 has the major advantage of not being that exposed to a knight on e4 after we play the e4 break.  9.b3  O-O  10.Bb2  transposes to a position we cover after 6... Be7.  9.e4 !  This break is much stronger with Black's bishop on d6 since after ...dxe4 Nxe4 Black's bishop is attacked. Black has no choice but to take on e4 since the e5 advance would be crushing.  dxe4  10.Nxe4  The bishop on d6 is attacked - this is important since Black would otherwise have the chance to play the thematic freeing break ...c5.  Nxe4  Black doesn't want to admit defeat so early by retreating the bishop.  11.Bxe4  Black is just a bit too slow here. He can't play the freeing ...c5 break, because we have the c6 pawn pinned, and he ...Nf6 doesn't manage to boot our bishop away from e4 since we have the annoying Bg5 pin.  h6  As a result, this move makes the most sense - Black prepares ...Nf6 by stopping Bg5, which prepares ...c5 since it would get rid of the pin on the c6 pawn. Moreover, Black couldn't even castle here because the h7 pawn was hanging.  12.Re1  A good square for the rook in general in this structures.  O-O  12... Nf6 still isn't ideal because we have the very thematic 13. c5 ! available.  13.Bd2  A good square for the bishop where it can help prepare the b4 advance in the future.  Nf6  14.c5 !  This is an important idea to be aware of in this structure. If Black gets to play ...c5 under good conditions in this structure, he can often equalise without many problems. By playing c5 ourselves, Black's freeing break is obviously out of the question now. It does look like an anti-positional move though since we cede the d5 outpost for Black's knight and give ourselves a backward d4 pawn, but neither of these things are that important. The knight on d5 would look pretty, but not threaten much, while the pawn on d4 only looks weak on the surface since Black can't attack it while it can be easily defended. On the other hand, the positional benefits of c5 are numerous - the bishop on b7 is buried alive on b7, we can make use of the d6 outpost in the future, Ne5 becomes even strong etc.  Bc7  15.Bd3  +=  Dropping the bishop back, keeping the bishop pair and ensuring Black's light bishop remains stuck on b7.   6...Be7  This is also a natural move, but unlike 6... Bd6 it does nothing to further Black's goal of playing the ...e5 break later on. As a result, it's a bit passive and I think White should get an edge here. The main advantage of having the bishop on e7 instead of d6 is that it is less exposed to our e4 break, meaning that ...Be7 is often combined with the development scheme of ...b6 and ...Bb7.  7.b3  We want to fianchetto our bishop on b2. The pawn on b3 also does a good job of ruling out Black's plan of ...dxc4 followed by ...b5 since we can now just recapture with our pawn. I should point out that this b3 plan isn't effective against 6... Bd6 because Black can then just play the ...e5 break and equalise relatively effortlessly. The passivity of the bishop on e7 gives us time to play b3 and Bb2.  O-O  8.Bb2  b6  9.Bd3  Bb7  10.O-O  After all the 'automatic' moves have been made, we have transposed to a position which we also reached a short while ago after 6... b6. Here our plan of e4, which worked well against the bishop on d6, is much less effective since Black has time to take on e4 and then play the thematic freeing break, ...c5. Play can proceed in several ways here, but I'll show you two sample lines where we carry out our plan: we will generally be looking to play Ne5 and then support the knight by playing f4. One line will look at when Black plays the prophylactic ...h6, while the other will deal with the situation where Black tries to save a tempo by omitting this move. transposes to a position we cover after 6... Be7.  h6  Black gets the pawn away from the dangerous b1-h7 diagonal. This is a useful move since often when we play Ne5, taking on e5 wouldn't be possible because the defender of h7 would be booted away after dxe5.   10...Rc8  Black intends to get the ...c5 break in quickly to try and force simplifications and equality.  11.Rad1  c5  This isn't the most popular move, but I think it's important that we see what to do against this ...c5 break. The most common move is 11... Qc7, but against this 'slow' play we proceed in a similar way to the game after 10... h6 - with Ne5 and f4, etc.  12.cxd5  The standard response to ...c5. We want to take twice so that we get to play against the hanging pawns.  exd5  13.dxc5  bxc5  Black doesn't want to recapture with a piece since that would leave an IQP on d5, so recapturing with the pawn is best. In this hanging pawn structure, the usual idea for White is to prepare either the e4 break or the b4 break to 'break up' Black's c5-d5 pawns and thus create holes and outposts for our minor pieces. Usually, we will be playing for the e4 break since it is much easier to carry out but here we have an even stronger idea available:  14.Bf5 !  This is another thematic idea in these structures. The bishop can be incredibly annoying on the h3-c8 diagonal, pinning Black's knight. Our threat right now is Nxd5 which works out quite nicely for us tactically. We provoke ...g6, which weakens the long diagonal and enables a plan of maybe playing Ba1 and Qb2.  Re8  This is a perfectly natural move, intending to tuck the bishop away on f8.  15.Nxd5 !  A bolt from the blue. d5, which was seemingly well-protected, was not so well-protected after all.  Bxd5  Taking on d5 with the knight is good for us after Bxh7+.  16.Bxf6  Nxf6  17.e4 !  This little tactic is what makes Nxd5 possible.  Bxe4  18.Bxe4  +=  We have regained our piece with a pleasant advantage thanks to the long-term weakness of the isolated c-pawn.  11.Rfd1  Putting the other rook on d1 is also perfectly playable. It's a difficult choice, deciding which rook setup to recommend, or play in an actual game, as they are objectively similar and they each have their pros and cons. This time around I'm showing 11. Rfd1 based on a nice game played by Jakovenko:  Rc8  12.Qe2  This is a good square for our queen where it is less exposed than on the c-file. It's always a bit unpleasant to have your queen on the same file as the enemy's rook.  Qc7  13.Rac1  Qb8  14.Ne5 !  A thematic lunge - it can often be played even if e5 is seemingly covered because of tactics. If Black takes twice on e5 here, we have the very strong Nxd5 discovered attack.  Rfd8  15.Bb1  Dropping the bishop back clears the d-file for the rook and maybe also prepares some Qc2/Qd3 mating ideas in the future.  Nxe5  This isn't forced, but Black wanted to get rid of the knight on e5 before we have the chance to support it with f4.  16.dxe5  Nd7  17.f4  +=  White was already clearly better in 1-0  (22)  Jakovenko, D  (2752)  -Van Delft, M  (2381)  Porto Carras 2018. Our space advantage and active pieces allow us to even switch plans here and launch a kingside attack with Qh5, Rf1-f3-g3 etc. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety.   7...b6 ?!  It is too late for this now - this is a genuine inaccuracy which we can exploit with the very rare but strong  8.cxd5 !  Neither of the recaptures are good for Black - ...exd5 allows us to castle and play e4 with a very good position, while the alternative recapture also has its problems after...  cxd5  9.Nb5 !  Black can't retreat his bishop to b8 since Qc6 wins the rook. Black's reply is forced:  Bb4+  10.Bd2  Bxd2+  11.Nxd2  ±  Even though the pawn structure is symmetrical, we are clearly better. We have traded off Black's good bishop and have complete control over the vital c-file, the only open file on the board.   7...e5  This is playable, but it is quite rare to play this break so early, before castling.  8.cxd5  cxd5  9.Nb5 !  This is a very thematic way to play against ..e5 breaks - we first take on d5, and then play Nb5 because the ...cxd5 recapture left b5 uncovered.  Bb8  10.dxe5  Leaving Black with an IQP now.  Nxe5  11.Nxe5  Bxe5  12.Bd2  Intending to exchange Black's good bishop next with Bc3.  O-O  13.Bc3  Bxc3+  14.Qxc3  +=  White has a very pleasant edge here. The IQP is a long-term weakness, especially with the missing dark-squared bishop and our iron-clad grip over the d4 blockading square.   7...dxc4  is perfectly fine, but this should just transpose in basically all cases to a line we will be covering shortly, for example:  8.Bxc4  O-O   8...b5  9.Be2  It's important to retreat to e2 to make our repertoire cohesive. d2 is also a possible move, but that wouldn't allow us then to transpose to the mainline after  Bb7  10.O-O  O-O  11.e4  which is a vital position covered in the absolute mainline of this chapter.   8...e5  9.O-O  O-O  10.h3  transposes to a pretty important option Black has which we'll be examining after 7...O-O and 8... e5.  9.O-O  leads straight into our mainline with 7...O-O 8. O-O. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4.   8...h6  This is certainly a useful improving move, but I think it's just too slow. We have time now to develop our dark bishop with b3 and Bb2.  9.b3  b6  10.Bb2  Bb7  11.Rad1  As usual, when Black's bishop is on d6 in this structure, we should be looking to carry out the e4 break. The rook on d1 is well-placed to support this break by discouraging Black from playing his own ...c5 break.  Qc7  12.e4 !  With all our pieces on their best squares, now is the best time for this break.  dxe4  13.Nxe4  Nxe4  14.Bxe4  +=  We are doing well here and have a pleasant edge. One idea I'd like to mention is meeting ... Nf6 Bd3 ...c5, which looks like it should equalise, with the very strong d5 !. Black's knight on f6 would be exposed to Bxf6, wrecking Black's kingside pawn structure.   8...Qe7  This is also pretty popular, but I don't think it's too great. Black is preparing for the ...e5 break, but this is a bit too slow.  9.c5 !  Usually this is a bit risky since it strengthens Black's ...e5 break, but here things work for us concretely.  Bc7  10.e4 !  Very thematic - as we saw in previous lines, after e4 ...dxe4, we often play c5 to clamp down on Black's queenside and blunt his bishop on c8. We are effectively reaching the same structure now, but in a more forcing way by playing c5 first - if we played e4 first, Black could play ... dxc4 !followed by ...e5.  dxe4  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  This is a structure we are already familiar with. The weakness of the d5 square and the d4 pawn are only optical, whereas Black has real issues on the queenside and trying to activate his light bishop. An example of how the play might proceed follows:  h6  13.Re1  Discouraging Black from even trying to carry out the ...e5 break, which is his one active plan.  Nf6  14.Bd3  Rd8  15.b4 !  We begin getting our queenside play underway by rolling our pawns forward.  a5  16.bxa5 !  It might be a bit surprising to play this instead of b5, but the problem with b5 is that can get his light bishop into the game after ...cxb5 followed by ...Bd7. Now Black still has to deal with his bad light bishop on top of the backward b7 pawn.  Bxa5  17.Bd2  b5 !  Black tries to rid himself of the b7 weakness but only manages to shift the weakness to c6.  18.Bxa5  Rxa5  19.Qd2  +=  White is positionally dominating thanks to the good vs bad bishop scenario. We can continue with Bc2-b3, where the bishop is well-placed.   8...e5  This is a very thematic break, but it was relatively rare to try to play it so early. However, it is a genuinely good try, which is why it has picked up in popularity so much recently, especially among strong GMs like Ding Liren, who has used it repeatedly. The downside of playing in this way is that if White knows what he is doing, the very best that Black can do is land up in a symmetrical position where White is more active and Black has very few winning chances. After our next move, White scores a very healthy 62%.  9.cxd5  The typical response to the ...e5 break.  cxd5  10.e4 !  A very strong and somewhat surprising move if you haven't seen it before. Playing in a similar way to 7... e5 with 10. Nb5 is also a viable line, but there are some minor differences in this case which I think allow Black. Instead, 10. e4 is a good way to fight for an advantage. The tension in the centre favours White because we are more active. Black has two ways to play here: 10... dxe4, and the more popular 10... exd4. Both options are decent, but I feel like Black is fighting for a draw in both cases with minimal winning chances.  exd4  The more popular of the two captures.   10...dxe4  This is rarer but objectively similar to 10... exd4.  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  Black needs to deal with the threat to the h7 pawn.  h6  The only decent option.  13.Be3  exd4  Black has managed to completely liquidate the centre, but White still has a slight, nagging edge due to his more active pieces.  14.Bh7+ !  This is a very small finesse, but it's useful to include - the point is that we want to play Bf5 after Bxd4 ... Nf6, but having the king further away from the centre on h8 is a bit better than on g8. This seemingly minor difference can have real consequences later on - for example, with the king on h8, Black might want to move his rook from f8 but this could leave the f7 pawn hanging.  Kh8  15.Bxd4  Nf6  16.Bf5  Qa5  The better way to force the exchange - Black activates his queen.   16...Bxf5 ?!  is a bit premature - often, rushing trades to equalise is a bad idea.  17.Qxf5  Qc8  18.Nh4 !  ±  Protecting the queen. Once again, I think it's worth repeating that the route to equality often isn't by trying to force trades as quickly as possible. In this case, White allows trades but improves his position slightly after each trade. At this point, Black is already seriously struggling - after ...Qxf5 Nxf5 for example, he is already losing the h6 pawn due to Bxf6.  17.Bxc8  Rfxc8  18.Qb3  Hitting the f7 and b7 pawns - the seemingly minor issue of forcing Black's king to h8 proves its worth.  Qd5  19.Rfd1  Not rushing the trade and encouraging Black to take on b3.  Qxb3  20.axb3  Ne4  21.Rxa7  Rxa7  22.Bxa7  Rc2  23.Bd4  +=  We've managed to win a pawn - admittedly, not the most impressive pawn but it is a pawn nonetheless. Black should hold this endgame with good play, of course, but it's not easy at all in practice. White has scored 80% from the 5 games between pretty strong players that I have in my database. Take a look at 1-0  (45)  Solozhenkin, E  (2535)  -Komarov, D  (2570)  Reggio Emilia 1998 to see how White managed to unravel and win the endgame against a very strong opponent.  11.Nxd5 !  Taking on d4 allows Black to liquidate the centre completely and equalise quite comfortably.  Nxd5  12.exd5  h6  Preventing Bxh7+.  13.Nxd4  We are up a pawn for the moment, but the d5 pawn is a goner. However, we do have one other trump card here: our active pieces.  Qh4  Threatening our knight and mate simultaneously.   13...Nf6  actually just allows us to hold on to the pawn after  14.Bc4  +=  with a good position - it's not so easy for Black to recoup the pawn now.  14.Nf3  Qh5  15.Bh7+  We want to offer the trade of queens with Qf5 next.  Kh8  16.Qf5  Qxf5  The safest and best way to play. Black will now look to regain the pawn and hold the endgame.   16...g5 !?  is a very, very risky way to decline the queen trade which has been tried a few times - once even by Kramnik against Karpov. Kramnik managed to hold that game, but many other Black players weren't so fortunate.  17.Be3  Simply intending to put our bishop on d4 next.  Kg7  18.Bd4+  f6  19.Qe6 !  Hitting the bishop on d6.  Bf4  20.Qe4  ±  Black's king looks very shaky to me and White went on to take full advantage of this in 1-0  (44)  Onischuk, A  (2687)  -Perez Rodriguez,L  (2483)  Monterrey 2010  17.Bxf5  Nf6  18.Bxc8  Rfxc8  19.Rd1  Making it as difficult as possible for Black to recoup the pawn.  Rd8  20.Be3  A good, active square for the bishop.  Be7  21.d6  Rxd6  22.Rxd6  Bxd6  23.Rd1  Bc7  24.Kf1  +=  White still has a slight edge here due to our more active pieces, even in this seemingly very dry and equal endgame. I highly recommend taking a look at 1-0  (48)  Gledura, B  (2515)  -Anand, V  (2784)  Caleta 2016, to see how even one of the world's greatest players ever was unable to hold this endgame. White prevailed by eventually exchanging down into a knight vs bishop endgame where his activity ended up being the deciding factor. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back intending to develop his light bishop on b7.   9...c5  Let's first have a look at this direct attempt to force equality. If Black could comfortably equalise here, then all the other lines would be a bit redundant. The problem for Black is that despite the symmetrical pawn structure which ensues, White can still pose Black significant problems with his more active pieces.  10.dxc5  Bxc5  11.e4 !  I like this active way to play. We free up our dark bishop and threaten to continue marching our pawn down the board with e5.  Qc7  Covering the e5 square.  12.Qe2  Reinforcing the threat of e5.  Ne5  Ruling out e5 once and for all and trying to exchange some pieces to alleviate our pressure.  13.Bf4  Bd6  14.Nxe5  If you don't like the look of this line, you can try 14. Nb5 which leads to a pleasant endgame for White.  Bxe5  15.Bxe5  Qxe5  Black has succeeded in exchanging some pieces, but he hasn't fully equalised yet...  16.f4 !?  This hasn't been played yet, but I think gaining space on the kingside like this makes sense.  Qc5+  17.Kh1  e5  18.f5  +=  I think White has a pleasant position here, thanks to his extra space, active pieces and the d5 outpost.   9...Qe7  This is a decent move which is fairly popular, but it just transposes to a line we cover after 9... e5 after  10.h3  e5  11.a3  leading straight into the mainline of 9... e5.   9...e5  Black decides that he is going to focus on getting counterplay in the centre instead of playing for any queenside plan with ...b5.  10.h3  This is a very useful prophylactic move and White's most popular choice. It serves two purposes: 1. It takes g4 away from Black's minor pieces. 2. It ensures that Black never has some dangerous ...Bxh2+ tactical idea after he plays ...e4.  Qe7  A useful, multi-purpose move. e7 is the best square for the queen, where it protects e5 and supports a potential ...e4 advance later on.   10...h6  Black plays his prophylactic move, but it isn't quite as useful as ours.  11.Rd1  Qc7  12.b3  Preparing to develop our dark bishop.  Re8  13.Bb2  exd4  14.Nxd4  Nb6  15.Bd3  +=  All White's pieces are active and have good squares. Next, we can look at expanding in the centre with e4.   10...exd4  taking play into an IQP position.  11.exd4  Taking with the knight is also possible, but this IQP position is pretty good for us. The major difference with the 'usual' IQP position is that Black's pawn is on c6 instead of e6. This means that our bishop on c4 is significantly more powerful, but Black's bishop on c8 is also able to develop a bit more easily now to e6 later on.  Nb6  Hitting the bishop and intending to blockade the IQP on d5.  12.Bb3  Nbd5  Blockading the d-pawn and blunting our bishop.   12...h6 ?!  is a very natural move to prevent us from playing Bg5, but this backfires spectacularly in a very instructive way:  13.Bxh6 !  This move is made possible by the very dangerous bishop on b3.  gxh6  14.Qg6+  Kh8  15.Qxh6+  Nh7  16.Ne4  We are down a piece for two pawns, but our initiative and attacking chances more than compensate for that.  Be7  17.Nf6 !  A very strong tactic, with the point being that ...Bxf6 leads to mate after Bc2 since the bishop obstructs Black from playing ...f5.  Bf5  Forced.  18.Nh5  Threatening mate once again.  Bf6  19.Ng5  Keeping up the pressure on Black - the knight on g5 is untouchable.  Bxd4  20.Nxh7  Bxh7  21.Rad1  +=  White soon broke through and won a crushing game in 1-0  (28)  Smagin, S  (2495)  -Monin, N  (2375)  Pinsk 1986. Black can't deal with all the threats here, like Bc2 Qxh7# etc.  13.Bg5  Black hasn't had a chance to play ...h6 yet so we can develop our dark bishop to its most active square.  Be6  A very natural move and Black's most common choice, supporting the knight and developing the bishop.   13...Qa5  The queen is active on a5 and it supports d5.  14.Nxd5  Nxd5  15.Rfe1  h6  16.Bd2  Bb4  17.Bxd5  cxd5  18.Re7 !  +=  Even in this symmetrical position, White retains serious pressure. Black's bishop is tied to the defence of the b7 pawn, and our rook is extremely active on e7.  14.Ne4  Threatening to win the bishop pair with Nxd6, while also intending to manoeuvre the knight to the c5 outpost.  Be7  15.Nc5  Bxc5  16.dxc5  +=  The position is symmetrical, but Whit retains good pressure and a comfortable edge thanks to his more active pieces and bishop. White went on to convert in 1-0  (47)  Smeets, J  (2628)  -Sveshnikov, V  (2407)  Vlissingen 2011  11.a3  A regrouping intending Ba2 which was played many times by Karpov when he popularised whole Anti-Meran starting with 6. Qc2. 11. Bb3 is another good move, which even more popular now. Black has a wide variety of options from this position:  Bb8  This has become Black's most popular choice here. It has a major advantage over ...Bc7 of not allowing any Nb5 ideas.   11...e4  This seems a bit premature to me as I don't think the e4 is well enough supported.  12.Ng5  Nb6  13.Ba2  Bf5  Black seems to have unravelled and protected e4 sufficiently, but we have one more trick up our sleeve:  14.f3 !  Ramping up the pressure on e4 even more by exploiting the fact that the e4 pawn is pinned to Black's bishop on f5.  Rae8  15.fxe4  Bg6  16.Qf2  ±  White is simply up a pawn right now. 16. Qf2 is a clever move which eyes Black's pawn on f7 - if Black decides to take the e4 pawn, then f7 also falls.   11...b5  Black decides to combine ...e5 ideas with ...b5 and ...c5, but this doesn't work too well.  12.Ba2  Our pawn on a3 is perfectly-positioned to neutralise any ...b4 ideas that Black might have had.  Bb7  13.e4  We are threatening dxe5 followed by Nd4, intending to invade the f5 outpost, so Black needs to act fast.  c5  Probably Black's best move here, but I'm very sceptical of this plan of combining ...e5 and ...c5.  14.dxc5  Nxc5  15.Bg5  Pinning the knight is vital in securing the d5 outpost.  Rac8  16.Bd5  +=  In this symmetrical pawn structure, White's control over the d5 outpost is what gives him a healthy advantage.   11...h6  This is a decent prophylactic move, but I think that Black has more pressing matters to deal with. Black might be intending to transpose to the mainline here with 11... Bb8 and 12... h6, but this is an inaccurate move-order because we have an extra option available:  12.Nh4 !  This is very strong, and it's the reason why it is better to play 11... Bb8 first - to not have to worry about losing a piece after Nf5. I think it's very important to be aware of this theme - when Black plays ...h6, the Nh4-f5 manoeuvre immediately becomes much stronger because Black no longer has ...g6 available.  Nb6  Black attacks c4 and covers the f5 square with his light bishop.  13.Ng6 !  Good, active play, taking full advantage of the pinned f7 pawn - Black would be doing fine after 13. Ba2 Be6.  Qc7  14.Nxe5  The knight protects the bishop on c4.  Bxe5  15.dxe5  Qxe5  16.Bd3  +=  Material is still equal, but White retains a pleasant edge due to his bishop pair. Often in this variation, when White reaches this pawn structure where he has a majority on the kingside, it tends to favour him because it is very easy to get his central pawns moving - it's no different in this position, and f4 followed by e4 is a very promising idea.   11...Bc7  Black drops his bishop back for a similar reason to ...Bb8, but this square has the slight downside of allowing us to sometimes exploit the pin on the c6 pawn after playing Ba2 by going Nb5, attacking the bishop on c7.  12.Ba2  h6  Black wants to play ...Re8 without allowing the very annoying Ng5.  13.Nh4 !  Once again, this thematic counter to ...h6 is very strong.The knight is on its way to f5 or g6.  Re8  14.Nf5  Qf8  15.Nb5  Or the immediate 15. Bd2 is good too, however, this was Karpov's choice.  Bb8  16.Bd2  Continuing to harass Black's queen, this time with the threat of Bb4.  a5  Preventing Bb4.  17.dxe5  Bxe5  18.f4  Booting Black's bishop away and preparing to roll our central pawns forward.  Bb8  19.Nc3  +=  White has consolidated his position and has a pleasant edge thanks to his active pieces and control of the centre. Karpov went on to win a classic game in crushing style in 1-0  (32)  Karpov, A  (2730)  -Anand,V  (2650)  Brussels 1991 Candidates  12.Ba2  h6  The usual idea - preventing Ng5 so that Black can develop his rook.  13.Nh4 !  Once again, exploiting the downside of ...h6 and preparing to invade on the f5 square.  Rd8  This has been the near-exclusive choice of Black players - this option wasn't available after ...Bc7 because Nb5 was very strong in that case. Black's idea here is to regroup with ...Qe8 and ...Nf8, after which the rook is well-placed on d8 to put pressure on our d4 pawn.  14.Nf5  Qe8  15.Bd2  Nf8  16.Ne2 !  This is a relatively rare but strong idea to activate our dark bishop on c3, b4, or even a5 while also maybe playing Neg3.  exd4  17.Nfxd4  Qe4  Black's best bet is to head into an endgame here.  18.Qxe4  Nxe4  19.Ba5  Re8  20.Rfd1  +=  Material is equal, but White has the more pleasant endgame here. All our pieces are pretty active and as usual, our e and f-pawns can start rolling forwards very quickly starting with f3 and e4.   9...a6  This is a flexible move, preparing ...b5 with the intention of ...b5. It is a common choice of players who would rather avoid some of the crazy complications which can arise after the most popular move, 9... b5.  10.Rd1  A simple, good move - the rook is well-placed here to deal with Black's ...c5 break.  b5  Attacking our bishop, gaining some space and preparing to get Black's bad bishop into the game via b7. Black has been playing a bit of a waiting game until now, but he finally shows his cards - as we'll see, against 9... b5 we plan to play 10. e4. However, it isn't as effective against 9... a6 because Black can just go 10... e5 after 10. e4. Instead, we played a small improving move while Black played an improving move of his own.   10...Qe7  This is a bit slow and not too good:  11.e4  Black has no choice but to put his pawn on e5 now since e5 is threatened.  e5  12.h3  exd4  13.Nxd4  Ne5  14.Bf1  Dropping the bishop back is best, intending to fianchetto a bit later.  Ng6  15.g3  +=  Our bishops are heading to g5 and g2 in the future, with a good position thanks to our active pieces and control of the centre.   10...c5  This break usually isn't too effective if Black hasn't played ...b5 yet, and this situation is no different. Black manages to get a symmetrical pawn structure, but White's more active pieces ensure that we still have an edge.  11.dxc5  Bxc5  Here we would like to play e4 with a similar idea to a line we saw already with an early ...c5, but here with our rook on d1 instead of f1 Black has the very annoying ...Ng4, targeting the f2 pawn.  12.Bd3  Dropping the bishop back prophylactically before Black gets a chance to play ...b5 with tempo. The bishop is also well-placed here to meet ...b6/...b5 with Be4 ! in certain cases.  h6  13.b3  Intending to simply develop our dark bishop now.  Be7  14.Bb2  b6  15.Be4  Nxe4  16.Qxe4  Recapturing with the knight is good too.  Ra7  17.Ne5  +=  Black can't stop White's knight from invading on c6. White went on to win from here in 1-0  (43)  Adorjan, A  (2530)  -Polgar,Z  (2535)  Budapest 1991   10...Qc7  This is sometimes also played with the idea of preparing ...b5 followed by ...c5, but it runs into a thematic counter:  11.Ne4 !  We'll be seeing more of this idea later. Black doesn't want to lose the bishop pair, nor waste time retreating his bishop, so his best option is to take on e4.  Nxe4  12.Qxe4  We have succeeded in removing one of Black's key kingside defenders. Now he has to be a bit careful, since 'automatic' play with ...b5 will lead to serious trouble since White can generate a pretty strong attack with Bd3, Qh4 and Ng5.  e5  Black should instead switch plans and fight back in the centre now.  13.dxe5  Nxe5  14.Ng5  Continuing to play forcefully and directly, threatening mate.  g6  15.Qh4  h5  16.Bb3  +=  Black's pawn moves on the kingside, ...g6 and ...h5, could cause him some problems in the long run with king safety and as a result, White's a bit better.  11.Bd3  e2 is another possible square for the bishop, but d3 scores better and is my preferred choice. Black has two equally popular moves here: 1. 11... Bb7, developing naturally and intending ...c5 next. 2. 11... Qc7, preparing ...c5 and preventing our thematic Ng5 hop. Note that the tempting immediate 11... c5 runs into the strong, typical counter 12. Ne4 !.  Qc7  Black ties our knight down to the defence of the h2 pawn and prepares to play ...c5 since Ne4 can now be met by ...c4 since the bishop on d6 wouldn't be hanging.   11...Bb7  Very natural, just developing and intending ...c5 next. If Black can get his next move in, he will be doing pretty well, so we need to find a way to throw a spanner in the works - fortunately, we can do just that by playing  12.Ng5 !  Attacking h7 and not giving Black a chance to play his freeing ...c5 break yet.  h6  Dealing with our basic threat and booting our knight away.   12...Bxh2+  is a little tactic winning a pawn, but this shouldn't concern us since we get huge compensation:  13.Kxh2  Ng4+  14.Kg1  Qxg5  15.f3  Don't worry about regaining the pawn with 15. Bxh7+ - the compensation here is more than sufficient.  Ngf6  16.e4  Qh4  17.Be3  +=  White is down a pawn but is better on account of his big centre, bishop pair and active pieces. We can even considering offering a trade of queens on the next move with 18. Qf2 since our compensation persists into the endgame - you'll see a similar example of this in the mainline with 9... b5.  13.Nge4  Be7  Other bishop retreats like 13... Bc7 are met similarly.  14.a3  We intend to clamp down on Black's whole queenside by playing b4 next, so Black needs to deal with this threat.  a5  This is somewhat forced to prevent b4, but an unintended consequence of this is that ...c5 would hang the b5 pawn.  15.b3  Intending to just develop our bishop next.  Qb8  16.Bb2  Rc8  17.Nxf6+  Nxf6  18.Qe2  +=  This position was reached in a game which White went on to win in 1-0  (82)  Svane, R  (2542)  -Braeuer, F  (2413)  Germany 2016. White is well-developed and Black lacks easy counterplay, since any active ideas on the queenside now create weaknesses.  12.Bd2  Simply continuing development. There isn't a way to prevent ...c5 anymore.  c5  Black should get this break-in while he still has the chance.   12...Bb7  is just too slow since now we actually can clamp down on the queenside and prevent ...c5 with a clever tactical idea:  13.b4 !  Preventing ...c5 for good. Black can't grab the pawn because of Nxb5.  e5  Black switches plans, but it's too late since his bad bishop is doomed to passivity on b7.  14.Ne4  Nxe4  15.Bxe4  +=  White is doing well simply due to the bad bishop on b7 and the weak c6 pawn.  13.Ne4 !  Once again, we see this thematic counter to ...c5. Black doesn't want to take on e4 since after Bxe4 we attack both Black's rook on a8 and the pawn on h7.  c4  Closing the queenside like this is Black's only decent option.  14.Nxd6  Qxd6  15.Be2  Bb7  After a few semi-forced moves, I think it's a good time to take stock. Black has given up the bishop pair but has a lot of compensation for it. What was once a bad bishop, stuck on c8, has become an absolute monster on the long diagonal - on top of that, Black has more space and we are very cramped on the queenside. Black would be comfortably equal if he could have one more move to consolidate his queenside, with ...Bd5 for example. However, he doesn't - we need to take advantage of this by immediately laying siege to Black's a6-b5-c4 pawn chain to free our pieces a bit.  16.b3 !  Attacking c4. Black doesn't want to take on b3 since after axb3 our pieces get plenty of breathing room and a6 becomes weak. Instead, he wants to find a way to maintain the pawn on c4.  Bd5 !  This is Black's best way to defend the c4 pawn. The point is so that Black can recapture on c4 if we play bxc4 with ...Bxc4 !, ensuring that he doesn't end up with an isolated c-pawn as he did after 16... Rfc8.   16...Rfc8  I don't think this is as good as 16... Bd5, because here Black gets saddled with an isolated c-pawn which is more of a weakness than a strength.  17.bxc4 !  We have a chance to isolate the c-pawn so we should take it.  bxc4  17... Be4 is something a young Giri faced in 1-0  (38)  Giri, A  (2687)  -Spoelman, W  (2564)  Boxtel 2011 but this wasn't too great - I'd recommend taking a look at that game though to see how Giri went on to win.  18.Rdc1  The rook has served its use on the d-file and now its switches its attention to attacking the c4-pawn.  Bd5  19.Be1  Intending Nd2 next to start attacking the c4 pawn. That c4-pawn will most likely turn out to be more of a liability than a strength for Black, as this correspondence game showed: 1-0  (81)  Lins, T  (2440)  -Uecker, D  (2305)  GER email 2017. White managed to win the c-pawn and then went on to convert.  17.Qb2  We don't want to allow bxc4 ...Bxc4, so we get our queen off the c-file.  Rfc8  18.Be1  18. Ba5 is a more popular square for the bishop, but we need to be a bit careful there sometimes to not allow ...b4, trapping our bishop offside.  Ne4  Black threatens ...c3.  19.Rac1  Dealing with the threat of ... c3 and now we are threatening Ne5, so Black needs to deal with that.  f6  Preventing Ne5.  20.Ba5 !  This might seem truly bizarre - we just played 18. Be1 two moves ago ! It is quite difficult to understand, but the reason for this lies in a specific variation: if Black plays 20... cxb3 21. axb3 b4 in this line, then in the future the e6 pawn could become a serious weakness since we'll eventually get the c4 square for our bishop. After the immediate 18. Ba5, Black doesn't have this problem because he wouldn't be forced to play...f6. In effect, we have lost a tempo to provoke ...f6 which is to our advantage.  Rab8  21.Ne1  A typical idea in this line, intending to kick Black's knight out of e4 with f3 next and then manoeuvre our knight to the queenside with Nc2.  f5  Securing a retreat square for the knight.  22.f3  Booting the knight away.  Nef6  23.Nc2  +=  White went on to win a very good game from here in 1-0  (79)  Bukavshin, I  (2629)  -Artemiev, V  (2660)  Khanty-Mansiysk 2014, where White's bishop pair eventually prevailed. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7
{ Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far.   10...a6  If Black tries to transpose into the previous variation we looked at after 9... a6, we have a very strong independent option:  11.Ng5 !  Exploiting the fact that Black hasn't played ...Qc7 yet. We intend to put a knight on e4 to counter Black's intended ...c5 break. There are some other points to Ng5, which will be revealed shortly...  Qc7  The most common move by far, hitting the h2 pawn.  12.e4 !  This is the point ! We ignore the threat to h2 and sacrifice the pawn, to get compensation in the form of our big rolling centre. The other point of 11. Ng5 was that that 12... dxe5 can now be met simply by 13. dxe5 followed by f4 !.  h6  This is rarer than 12... Bxh2+, but it looks more 'human' to me and it does result in slightly less crazy complications.   12...Bxh2+  Grabbing the pawn is the critical test of course.  13.Kh1  c5 !  White was intending e5 so Black needs to fight back in the centre immediately. There's no time to extract the bishop from h2 because of this threat.  14.e5 !  Attacking the knight on f6, which defends h7 against mate. Complications ensue...  cxd4  15.exf6  Nxf6  16.f4 !  A very strong move, cutting off the queen's access to the bishop on h2.  Bg3  17.Qd3  Continuing to harass Black's bishop.  dxc3  18.Qxg3  h6  19.Nh3  +=  This wild position was reached quite a couple of dozen times in correspondence games but on a handful in OTB games. White is doing quite a bit better here, with his piece for three pawns, but So managed to hold here against -  (54)  Yilmaz, M  (2582)  -So,W  (2779)  Kocaeli 2015  13.e5  No time to retreat !  hxg5  14.exd6  Qxd6  15.Bxg5  +=  Another interesting position has appeared - Black can grab a pawn if he wants, but White has a good position and plenty of compensation regardless thanks to his bishop pair and active pieces. }
11. e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }
11... e5
{ The only decent move at Black's disposal - he needs to deal with the threat of e5. }
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ The knight is heading for the outpost on f5. We do have a very valid alternative in the form of the slightly rarer 13. Nh4, but 13. Nd4 is in my opinion a bit stronger and it scores better - a whopping 69% in my database of OTB games ! }
13... Neg4
{ Black's most popular and best move by far - he doesn't give us a chance to play Nf5 by first threatening the h2 pawn. }
14. g3
{ The only decent game once again - please don't play 14. h3, even though it looks very tempting - Black has 14... Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ ! followed by ...Qxd4. 14. g3 does a good job of blunting Black's dark bishop and reducing these tactical tricks that Black has at his disposal. }
14... Bc5
{ This is catching up in popularity to the natural 14... Bxg3 in OTB games, as I think it is Black's best way to equalise. Black starts putting some pressure on the f2 pawn.   14...Bxg3  This is a very tempting move, seemingly winning a pawn, which I was lucky enough to face in practice and score a win against. For the time being, it's Black's most common move in OTB games, but White scores a whopping 72% from here. A better choice is 14... Bc5, which we'll be looking at next - however, I imagine most of our opponent's opening knowledge/preparation will end around here, and it will be difficult for those players to resist the temptation to grab what looks like a free pawn. Black seems to have spotted a little tactic that wins a pawn, but White has more than enough compensation in the endgame which we'll force in a couple moves time...  15.hxg3  Qxd4  16.Qd1 !  An important follow-up to remember, taking the game into an endgame by force.  Qxd1  17.Rxd1  Let's take stock briefly. We are down a pawn in this endgame and our compensation isn't immediately apparent. However, the more you look at this and analyse it, the more you realise how difficult matters are for Black. Our compensation mainly consists of 1. The bishop pair. 2. The possibility of rolling our central pawns forward with f3-f4 and e5. 3. The bad bishop on b7, and our more active pieces by contrast. 4. The weak c6 pawn and exposed Black queenside pawns in general. These things in combination provide us with more than enough for the pawn. Black has struggled from this point in practice, and even objectively he is a long way from being able to equalise. I'm going to show a couple of sample lines here, but I'd recommend taking a look at a few games from this endgame as well to see how the play might proceed.  Rfe8  18.f3  Pushing Black's knight back.  Ne5  19.Be3  A good, active square for our bishop.  a5  Black's most popular choice here, grabbing some space on the queenside.   19...a6  20.Rd6  White sets about taking over the d-file.  Rad8  21.Rad1  Rxd6  22.Rxd6  +=  White went on to win in an instructive game in 1-0  (58)  Fressinet,L  (2702)  -Ragger,M  (2655)  Germany 2013  20.Rac1  h5 !  Black really should play this at some point to secure a knight which might land on g4 after we play f4.  21.b3  +=  I like this little move, taking the c4 square away from Black's knight. White still has more than enough compensation for the pawn and a very pleasant endgame.   14...Re8  is a decent move, but it has little independent value since it should just transpose to 14... Bc5 after  15.Nf5  Bc5  16.Bf4  transposing directly into the mainline after 14... Bc5. }
15. Nf5 Re8
{ Putting some pressure on the e4 pawn.   15...Qb6  This is a typical idea, but it's better played on the next move.  16.Kg2 !  Black can't take on f2, for example:  Nxf2 ?  17.b4 !  +-  and Black is dropping a piece. }
16. Bf4
{ Simply developing and making it possible for the other rook to enter the game now. }
16... Qb6
{ Ramping up the pressure against the f2 pawn. Pretty much all the games have gone this way, but I think 16... Nxf2 might be a better option.   16...Nxf2 !  This is yet to be tried in an OTB game, and only once in a correspondence game, but based on that correspondence game I think it might be the cleanest way for Black to equalise in this whole line. 16... Bxf2+ is a move with a similar idea, but White might have the extra option of 17. Kg2 there - otherwise, it just transposes to this line.  17.Rxf2  Bxf2+  18.Kxf2  b4  This is part of the idea - without a bishop on c5, and with our king on f2, ...b4 intending ...Nxe4+ works much better.  19.e5 !  The only move - we can't allow ...Nxe4+ of course.  bxc3  20.exf6  Qxf6  21.g4  Covering the knight on f5.  cxb2  seems like the best way for Black to hold. The correspondence game -  (47)  Poetz, F  (2334)  -Cvak, R  (2237)  ICCF email 2014 continued with 21... g5, but White got a good position there and had plenty of winning chances.  22.Rb1  Bc8  23.Qxb2  Bxf5  24.Qxf6  Rxe2+  25.Kxe2  Bxg4+  26.Kf2  gxf6  27.Rg1  h5  28.h3  f5  29.hxg4  hxg4  30.Rc1 =  We have a bishop for what will soon be 3 pieces, but this is just a draw, unfortunately. If Black finds and then memorises this line, then hats off to him and the draw is well-deserved ! }
17. Kg2
{ Prophylaxis against . ..Bxf2+. The lines which follow are incredibly sharp and complex - the odds of an under 2200 player reaching this position as Black is very slim. It only has happened once before ! You might even want to pause the next 10 lines or so if you wish and stop studying up until this point, because the likelihood of this cropping up is low - however, if you want to be super well prepared, go for it ! The lines are complex and sharp, and 'things work just because they work'. }
17... g6
{ Booting our knight out from f5.   17...Nxf2 ?!  looks very tempting, seemingly winning a pawn, but it falls short on account of:  18.e5  N6g4  19.Ne4  Nxe4  20.Bxg4  Black's knight is awkwardly stuck in the middle of the board with nowhere to go.  Bf8  Preventing Qxe4 because of ...c5.  21.Bf3  ±  Black can rescue his knight for the moment after ... Nc5, but White is clearly better there regardless due to Be3 followed by b4, winning the knight. }
18. h3
{ The knight has nowhere to go, so instead we counterattack Black's knight. Here Black has tried two moves: 18... Ne5 and 18... gxf5. }
18... gxf5
{ This has been the more popular choice in practice.   18...Ne5  Black decides to keep his knight alive.  19.Nh6+  Kg7  20.Rad1  This position was reached in a theoretical draw in -  (32)  Nakamura, H  (2790)  -Giri, A  (2793)  Moscow 2016 CBM 172, but I'd like to suggest 20. Rad1 instead of Nakamura's 20. Bg5. Instead of Bg5 with the idea of drawing Black's king out into the open after Bxf6+, our idea is going to be to launch the pawn forwards with g4-g5.  Bd4  The bishop does an important job on d4 of covering the dark squares. If given the chance, Black would like to support it with ...c5 next, which also opens up the long diagonal for his other bishop.  21.g4  Intending g5 next of course.  Ng8  22.g5  Nxh6  23.gxh6+  Kg8  24.a4 !  Attacking b5 and threatening to play a5-a6.  a6  This is better to secure the a7 retreat square for the queen and prevent a5-a6.   24...b4 ?  This is poor as Black doesn't want to allow a5-a6 as after  25.a5  Qc5  26.a6  Bc8  27.Qd2  +-  White is just crushing.  25.a5  Qa7  26.Bxe5  Getting the bishop out of the way so we can start marching our f-pawn forwards.  Rxe5  27.f4  Gaining space and booting Black's rook away.  Re7  28.Bf3  +=  Despite Black's bishop pair, our space, active pieces and big centre gives us an edge. }
19. hxg4 Bd4
{ This has been the more common choice in OTB games, but correspondence players have preferred 19... Nxe4 instead.   19...fxe4  This isn't good since White gets dangerous play down the h-file after  20.Rh1  Bxf2  21.g5  Nd5  22.Nxe4  Nxf4+  23.gxf4  c5  24.Bf3  +=  The open h-file leads to serious problems for Black.   19...Nxe4  The most common choice of correspondence players here.  20.gxf5  Nxc3   20...Nf6  Black brings the knight back to defend his kingside.  21.Bf3  Bd4  22.Rae1  c5  23.Bxb7  Qxb7+  24.f3  +=  This ended up as a draw in the correspondence game -  (34)  Baumgartner, U  (2371)  -Marti Pericot, J  (2467)  ICCF email 2015, but there's plenty of play here and White's position is definitely preferable due to Black's exposed king.  21.bxc3  Bf8  22.f3  A typical idea which we've already seen, blunting Black's bishop on b7 and securing the important e4 square.  c5  23.Rab1  a6  24.a4  Forcing Black's pawn forward so we get c4 for our bishop.  b4  25.Bc4  +=  Again, I prefer White due to his safer king and more active pieces. }
20. gxf5 Bxc3 21. bxc3 c5 22. f3
{ The pawn on f3 does an important job of protecting our king on the long diagonal. }
22... Rxe4
{ We can't recapture on e4 since we lose our queen after ... Bxe4+.   22...Nxe4  is another tempting way to grab the e4 pawn.  23.Rae1  c4  24.Bxc4 !  A little tactic to win a pawn.  bxc4  25.fxe4  +=  Black has some compensation in the form of pressure on e4, but I don't think it's enough to claim equality. }
23. Rae1 Rxf4 24. gxf4
{ This was what happened in two crazy OTB games, including one by Shirov. Black sacrifices the exchange to triple our pawns and allow his knight to start causing problems. Ultimately, I don't think this is the best way to play and I think we should be better here, even though both games ended in a draw. }
24... Nd5 25. Bd1 c4 26. Qe4
{ The queen is heading to e5, after which we can start to create some mating threats. }
26... Nxc3 { This was a mistake, but Black's position was difficult anyway, }
27. Qe5 Nd5
{ This position was reached in -  (39)  Erdos, V  (2628)  -Bellaiche, A  (2463)  Biel 2017. }
28. Rg1
{ would have been decisive instead of 28. Rh1, which was played. This line is wild and complex and it's difficult to memorise everything - ultimately, I think White is doing very well, which is confirmed by practical games, but Black can equalise if he is very well prepared with something like 16... Nxf2, for example. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }

8... Bd6
{ This looks like the better and more active square, but it does have a major downside: the bishop is much more exposed on d6. This is something we can exploit with our next move. }
9. e4
{ This break is much stronger with Black's bishop on d6 since after ...dxe4 Nxe4 Black's bishop is attacked. Black has no choice but to take on e4 since the e5 advance would be crushing. }
9... dxe4 10. Nxe4
{ The bishop on d6 is attacked - this is important since Black would otherwise have the chance to play the thematic freeing break ...c5. }
10... Nxe4
{ Black doesn't want to admit defeat so early by retreating the bishop. } 11.
Bxe4 h6
{ Black is just a bit too slow here. He can't play the freeing ...c5 break, because we have the c6 pawn pinned, and he ...Nf6 doesn't manage to boot our bishop away from e4 since we have the annoying Bg5 pin.   As a result, this move makes the most sense - Black prepares ...Nf6 by stopping Bg5, which prepares ...c5 since it would get rid of the pin on the c6 pawn. Moreover, Black couldn't even castle here because the h7 pawn was hanging. }
12. Re1 { A good square for the rook in general in this structures. } 12... O-O
{ 12... Nf6 still isn't ideal because we have the very thematic 13. c5 ! available. }
13. Bd2
{ A good square for the bishop where it can help prepare the b4 advance in the future. }
13... Nf6 14. c5
{ This is an important idea to be aware of in this structure. If Black gets to play ...c5 under good conditions in this structure, he can often equalise without many problems. By playing c5 ourselves, Black's freeing break is obviously out of the question now. It does look like an anti-positional move though since we cede the d5 outpost for Black's knight and give ourselves a backward d4 pawn, but neither of these things are that important. The knight on d5 would look pretty, but not threaten much, while the pawn on d4 only looks weak on the surface since Black can't attack it while it can be easily defended. On the other hand, the positional benefits of c5 are numerous - the bishop on b7 is buried alive on b7, we can make use of the d6 outpost in the future, Ne5 becomes even strong etc. }
14... Bc7 15. Bd3
{ Dropping the bishop back, keeping the bishop pair and ensuring Black's light bishop remains stuck on b7. }

12. cxd5
{ The standard response to ...c5. We want to take twice so that we get to play against the hanging pawns. }
12... exd5 13. dxc5 bxc5
{ Black doesn't want to recapture with a piece since that would leave an IQP on d5, so recapturing with the pawn is best. In this hanging pawn structure, the usual idea for White is to prepare either the e4 break or the b4 break to 'break up' Black's c5-d5 pawns and thus create holes and outposts for our minor pieces. Usually, we will be playing for the e4 break since it is much easier to carry out but here we have an even stronger idea available: }
14. Bf5
{ This is another thematic idea in these structures. The bishop can be incredibly annoying on the h3-c8 diagonal, pinning Black's knight. Our threat right now is Nxd5 which works out quite nicely for us tactically. We provoke ...g6, which weakens the long diagonal and enables a plan of maybe playing Ba1 and Qb2. }
14... Re8

Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example, 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... e5
{ This is playable, but it is quite rare to play this break so early, before castling. }
8. cxd5 cxd5 9. Nb5
{ This is a very thematic way to play against ..e5 breaks - we first take on d5, and then play Nb5 because the ...cxd5 recapture left b5 uncovered. }
9... Bb8 10. dxe5 { Leaving Black with an IQP now. } 10... Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Bxe5
12. Bd2 { Intending to exchange Black's good bishop next with Bc3. } 12... O-O
13. Bc3 Bxc3+ 14. Qxc3
{ White has a very pleasant edge here. The IQP is a long-term weakness, especially with the missing dark-squared bishop and our iron-clad grip over the d4 blockading square. }

That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... Qe7
{ This is also pretty popular, but I don't think it's too great. Black is preparing for the ...e5 break, but this is a bit too slow. }
9. c5
{ Usually this is a bit risky since it strengthens Black's ...e5 break, but here things work for us concretely. }
9... Bc7 10. e4
{ Very thematic - as we saw in previous lines, after e4 ...dxe4, we often play c5 to clamp down on Black's queenside and blunt his bishop on c8. We are effectively reaching the same structure now, but in a more forcing way by playing c5 first - if we played e4 first, Black could play ... dxc4 !followed by ...e5. }
10... dxe4 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Bxe4
{ This is a structure we are already familiar with. The weakness of the d5 square and the d4 pawn are only optical, whereas Black has real issues on the queenside and trying to activate his light bishop. An example of how the play might proceed follows: }
12... h6 13. Re1
{ Discouraging Black from even trying to carry out the ...e5 break, which is his one active plan. }
13... Nf6 14. Bd3 Rd8 15. b4
{ We begin getting our queenside play underway by rolling our pawns forward. }
15... a5 16. bxa5
{ It might be a bit surprising to play this instead of b5, but the problem with b5 is that can get his light bishop into the game after ...cxb5 followed by ...Bd7. Now Black still has to deal with his bad light bishop on top of the backward b7 pawn. }
16... Bxa5 17. Bd2 b5
{ Black tries to rid himself of the b7 weakness but only manages to shift the weakness to c6. }
18. Bxa5 Rxa5 19. Qd2
{ White is positionally dominating thanks to the good vs bad bishop scenario. We can continue with Bc2-b3, where the bishop is well-placed. }

{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

The downside of playing in this way is that if White knows what he is doing, the very best that Black can do is land up in a symmetrical position where White is more active and Black has very few winning chances. After our next move, White scores a very healthy 62%. }
9. cxd5 { The typical response to the ...e5 break. } 9... cxd5 10. e4
{ A very strong and somewhat surprising move if you haven't seen it before. Playing in a similar way to 7... e5 with 10. Nb5 is also a viable line, but there are some minor differences in this case which I think allow Black to have great chances to equalise. Instead, 10. e4 is a good way to fight for an advantage. The tension in the centre favours White because we are more active. Black has two ways to play here: 10... dxe4, and the more popular 10... exd4.

{ This is a very small finesse, but it's useful to include - the point is that we want to play Bf5 after Bxd4 ... Nf6, but having the king further away from the centre on h8 is a bit better than on g8. This seemingly minor difference can have real consequences later on - for example, with the king on h8, Black might want to move his rook from f8 but this could leave the f7 pawn hanging. }

{ is a bit premature - often, rushing trades to equalise is a bad idea. } 17.
Qxf5 Qc8 18. Nh4
{ Protecting the queen. Once again, I think it's worth repeating that the route to equality often isn't by trying to force trades as quickly as possible. In this case, White allows trades but improves his position slightly after each trade. At this point, Black is already seriously struggling - after ...Qxf5 Nxf5 for example, he is already losing the h6 pawn due to Bxf6. }

That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }

Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }

{ This is a very thematic break, but it was relatively rare to try to play it so early. However, it is a genuinely good try, which is why it has picked up in popularity so much recently, especially among strong GMs like Ding Liren, who has used it repeatedly. The downside of playing in this way is that if White knows what he is doing, the very best that Black can do is land up in a symmetrical position where White is more active and Black has very few winning chances. After our next move, White scores a very healthy 62%. }
9. cxd5 { The typical response to the ...e5 break. } 9... cxd5 10. e4
{ A very strong and somewhat surprising move if you haven't seen it before. Playing in a similar way to 7... e5 with 10. Nb5 is also a viable line, but there are some minor differences in this case which I think allow Black. Instead, 10. e4 is a good way to fight for an advantage. The tension in the centre favours White because we are more active. Black has two ways to play here: 10... dxe4, and the more popular 10... exd4. Both options are decent, but I feel like Black is fighting for a draw in both cases with minimal winning chances. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here.

White prevailed by eventually exchanging down into a knight vs bishop endgame where his activity ended up being the deciding factor. }

{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example, 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... e5
{ Black decides that he is going to focus on getting counterplay in the centre instead of playing for any queenside plan with ...b5. }
10. h3
{ This is a very useful prophylactic move and White's most popular choice. It serves two purposes: 1. It takes g4 away from Black's minor pieces. 2. It ensures that Black never has some dangerous ...Bxh2+ tactical idea after he plays ...e4. }
10... Qe7
{ A useful, multi-purpose move. e7 is the best square for the queen, where it protects e5 and supports a potential ...e4 advance later on. }
11. a3
{ A regrouping intending Ba2 which was played many times by Karpov when he popularised whole Anti-Meran starting with 6. Qc2. 11. Bb3 is another good move, which even more popular now. Black has a wide variety of options from this position: }
11... Bb8
{ This has become Black's most popular choice here. It has a major advantage over ...Bc7 of not allowing any Nb5 ideas. }
12. Ba2 h6
{ The usual idea - preventing Ng5 so that Black can develop his rook. } 13. Nh4
{ Once again, exploiting the downside of ...h6 and preparing to invade on the f5 square. }
13... Rd8
{ This has been the near-exclusive choice of Black players - this option wasn't available after ...Bc7 because Nb5 was very strong in that case. Black's idea here is to regroup with ...Qe8 and ...Nf8, after which the rook is well-placed on d8 to put pressure on our d4 pawn. }
14. Nf5 Qe8 15. Bd2 Nf8 16. Ne2
{ This is a relatively rare but strong idea to activate our dark bishop on c3, b4, or even a5 while also maybe playing Neg3. }
16... exd4 17. Nfxd4 Qe4 { Black's best bet is to head into an endgame here. }
18. Qxe4 Nxe4 19. Ba5 Re8 20. Rfd1
{ Material is equal, but White has the more pleasant endgame here. All our pieces are pretty active and as usual, our e and f-pawns can start rolling forwards very quickly starting with f3 and e4. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example, 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... a6
{ This is a flexible move, preparing ...b5 with the intention of ...b5. It is a common choice of players who would rather avoid some of the crazy complications which can arise after the most popular move, 9... b5. }
10. Rd1
{ A simple, good move - the rook is well-placed here to deal with Black's ...c5 break. }
10... b5
{ Attacking our bishop, gaining some space and preparing to get Black's bad bishop into the game via b7. Black has been playing a bit of a waiting game until now, but he finally shows his cards - as we'll see, against 9... b5 we plan to play 10. e4. However, it isn't as effective against 9... a6 because Black can just go 10... e5 after 10. e4. Instead, we played a small improving move while Black played an improving move of his own. }
11. Bd3
{ e2 is another possible square for the bishop, but d3 scores better and is my preferred choice. Black has two equally popular moves here: 1. 11... Bb7, developing naturally and intending ...c5 next. 2. 11... Qc7, preparing ...c5 and preventing our thematic Ng5 hop. Note that the tempting immediate 11... c5 runs into the strong, typical counter 12. Ne4 !. }
11... Bb7
{ Very natural, just developing and intending ...c5 next. If Black can get his next move in, he will be doing pretty well, so we need to find a way to throw a spanner in the works - fortunately, we can do just that by playing }
12. Ng5
{ Attacking h7 and not giving Black a chance to play his freeing ...c5 break yet. }
12... Bxh2+
{ is a little tactic winning a pawn, but this shouldn't concern us since we get huge compensation: }
13. Kxh2 Ng4+ 14. Kg1 Qxg5 15. f3
{ Don't worry about regaining the pawn with 15. Bxh7+ - the compensation here is more than sufficient. }
15... Ngf6 16. e4 Qh4 17. Be3
{ White is down a pawn but is better on account of his big centre, bishop pair and active pieces. We can even considering offering a trade of queens on the next move with 18. Qf2 since our compensation persists into the endgame - you'll see a similar example of this in the mainline with 9... b5. }

{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... a6
{ This is a flexible move, preparing ...b5 with the intention of ...b5. It is a common choice of players who would rather avoid some of the crazy complications which can arise after the most popular move, 9... b5. }
10. Rd1
{ A simple, good move - the rook is well-placed here to deal with Black's ...c5 break. }
10... b5
{ Attacking our bishop, gaining some space and preparing to get Black's bad bishop into the game via b7. Black has been playing a bit of a waiting game until now, but he finally shows his cards - as we'll see, against 9... b5 we plan to play 10. e4. However, it isn't as effective against 9... a6 because Black can just go 10... e5 after 10. e4. Instead, we played a small improving move while Black played an improving move of his own. }
11. Bd3
{ e2 is another possible square for the bishop, but d3 scores better and is my preferred choice. Black has two equally popular moves here: 1. 11... Bb7, developing naturally and intending ...c5 next. 2. 11... Qc7, preparing ...c5 and preventing our thematic Ng5 hop. Note that the tempting immediate 11... c5 runs into the strong, typical counter 12. Ne4 !. }
11... Qc7
{ Black ties our knight down to the defence of the h2 pawn and prepares to play ...c5 since Ne4 can now be met by ...c4 since the bishop on d6 wouldn't be hanging. }
12. Bd2
{ Simply continuing development. There isn't a way to prevent ...c5 anymore. }
12... c5 { Black should get this break-in while he still has the chance. } 13.
Ne4
{ Once again, we see this thematic counter to ...c5. Black doesn't want to take on e4 since after Bxe4 we attack both Black's rook on a8 and the pawn on h7. }
13... c4 { Closing the queenside like this is Black's only decent option. } 14.
Nxd6 Qxd6 15. Be2 Bb7
{ After a few semi-forced moves, I think it's a good time to take stock. Black has given up the bishop pair but has a lot of compensation for it. What was once a bad bishop, stuck on c8, has become an absolute monster on the long diagonal - on top of that, Black has more space and we are very cramped on the queenside. Black would be comfortably equal if he could have one more move to consolidate his queenside, with ...Bd5 for example. However, he doesn't - we need to take advantage of this by immediately laying siege to Black's a6-b5-c4 pawn chain to free our pieces a bit. }
16. b3
{ Attacking c4. Black doesn't want to take on b3 since after axb3 our pieces get plenty of breathing room and a6 becomes weak. Instead, he wants to find a way to maintain the pawn on c4. }
16... Rfc8
{ I don't think this is as good as 16... Bd5, because here Black gets saddled with an isolated c-pawn which is more of a weakness than a strength. }
17. bxc4 { We have a chance to isolate the c-pawn so we should take it. } 17...
bxc4
{ 17... Be4 is something a young Giri faced in 1-0  (38)  Giri, A  (2687)  -Spoelman, W  (2564)  Boxtel 2011 but this wasn't too great - I'd recommend taking a look at that game though to see how Giri went on to win. }
18. Rdc1
{ The rook has served its use on the d-file and now its switches its attention to attacking the c4-pawn. }
18... Bd5 19. Be1
{ Intending Nd2 next to start attacking the c4 pawn. That c4-pawn will most likely turn out to be more of a liability than a strength for Black, as this correspondence game showed: 1-0  (81)  Lins, T  (2440)  -Uecker, D  (2305)  GER email 2017. White managed to win the c-pawn and then went on to convert. }

{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

12... Bxh2+ { Grabbing the pawn is the critical test of course. } 13. Kh1 c5

Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back intending to develop his light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... a6
{ If Black tries to transpose into the previous variation we looked at after 9... a6, we have a very strong independent option: }
11. Ng5
{ Exploiting the fact that Black hasn't played ...Qc7 yet. We intend to put a knight on e4 to counter Black's intended ...c5 break. There are some other points to Ng5, which will be revealed shortly... }
11... Qc7 { The most common move by far, hitting the h2 pawn. } 12. e4
{ This is the point ! We ignore the threat to h2 and sacrifice the pawn, to get compensation in the form of our big rolling centre. The other point of 11. Ng5 was that that 12... dxe5 can now be met simply by 13. dxe5 followed by f4 !. }
12... h6
{ This is rarer than 12... Bxh2+, but it looks more 'human' to me and it does result in slightly less crazy complications. }
13. e5 { No time to retreat ! } 13... hxg5 14. exd6 Qxd6 15. Bxg5
{ Another interesting position has appeared - Black can grab a pawn if he wants, but White has a good position and plenty of compensation regardless thanks to his bishop pair and active pieces. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }

e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }

14... Bxg3
{ This is a very tempting move, seemingly winning a pawn, which I was lucky enough to face in practice and score a win against. For the time being, it's Black's most common move in OTB games, but White scores a whopping 72% from here. A better choice is 14... Bc5, which we'll be looking at next - however, I imagine most of our opponent's opening knowledge/preparation will end around here, and it will be difficult for those players to resist the temptation to grab what looks like a free pawn. Black seems to have spotted a little tactic that wins a pawn, but White has more than enough compensation in the endgame which we'll force in a couple moves time... }
15. hxg3 Qxd4 16. Qd1
{ An important follow-up to remember, taking the game into an endgame by force. }
16... Qxd1 17. Rxd1
{ Let's take stock briefly. We are down a pawn in this endgame and our compensation isn't immediately apparent. However, the more you look at this and analyse it, the more you realise how difficult matters are for Black. Our compensation mainly consists of 1. The bishop pair. 2. The possibility of rolling our central pawns forward with f3-f4 and e5. 3. The bad bishop on b7, and our more active pieces by contrast. 4. The weak c6 pawn and exposed Black queenside pawns in general. These things in combination provide us with more than enough for the pawn. Black has struggled from this point in practice, and even objectively he is a long way from being able to equalise. I'm going to show a couple of sample lines here, but I'd recommend taking a look at a few games from this endgame as well to see how the play might proceed. }

That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we "lose" a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back intending to develop his light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7 { Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far. } 11.
e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves "work just because they work". This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }
11... e5
{ The only decent move at Black's disposal - he needs to deal with the threat of e5. }
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ The knight is heading for the outpost on f5. We do have a very valid alternative in the form of the slightly rarer 13. Nh4, but 13. Nd4 is in my opinion a bit stronger and it scores better - a whopping 69% in my database of OTB games ! }
13... Neg4
{ Black's most popular and best move by far - he doesn't give us a chance to play Nf5 by first threatening the h2 pawn. }
14. g3
{ The only decent game once again - please don't play 14. h3, even though it looks very tempting - Black has 14... Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ ! followed by ...Qxd4. 14. g3 does a good job of blunting Black's dark bishop and reducing these tactical tricks that Black has at his disposal. }
14... Re8
{ is a decent move, but it has little independent value since it should just transpose to 14... Bc5 after }
15. Nf5 Bc5 16. Bf4 { transposing directly into the mainline after 14... Bc5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6

This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }

Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9...

I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example, 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back intending to develop his light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7 { Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far. } 11.
e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }

12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4

13... Neg4
{ Black's most popular and best move by far - he doesn't give us a chance to play Nf5 by first threatening the h2 pawn. }
14. g3
{ The only decent game once again - please don't play 14. h3, even though it looks very tempting - Black has 14... Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ ! followed by ...Qxd4. 14. g3 does a good job of blunting Black's dark bishop and reducing these tactical tricks that Black has at his disposal. }
14... Bc5
{ This is catching up in popularity to the natural 14... Bxg3 in OTB games, as I think it is Black's best way to equalise. Black starts putting some pressure on the f2 pawn. }
15. Nf5 Re8 { Putting some pressure on the e4 pawn. } 16. Bf4
{ Simply developing and making it possible for the other rook to enter the game now. }
16... Qb6
{ Ramping up the pressure against the f2 pawn. Pretty much all the games have gone this way, but I think 16... Nxf2 might be a better option. }
17. Kg2
{ Prophylaxis against . ..Bxf2+. The lines which follow are incredibly sharp and complex - the odds of an under 2200 player reaching this position as Black is very slim. It only has happened once before ! You might even want to pause the next 10 lines or so if you wish and stop studying up until this point, because the likelihood of this cropping up is low - however, if you want to be super well prepared, go for it ! The lines are complex and sharp, and 'things work just because they work'. }
17... g6 { Booting our knight out from f5. } 18. h3
{ The knight has nowhere to go, so instead we counterattack Black's knight. Here Black has tried two moves: 18... Ne5 and 18... gxf5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
{ Up until now, we have looked at all the alternatives Black has to 4... e6. In the previous chapter, we covered 4... Bf5, 4... a6 and 4... g6. This chapter will be dealing with the most popular move by far, 4... e6, which leads to the Semi-Slav defence. I also consider it to be the best option Black has in this position after 4. e3. Back at the start of the previous chapter, I mentioned that one of the downsides of 3. Nc3 4. e3 is that we limit our choices against the Semi-Slav. If we played 4. Nf3 instead of 4. e3, we would have the extra option of playing 5. Bg5 on the following move, which is another, challenging way to meet the Semi-Slav. As it stands though, we are locked into playing e3 lines, but I don't think this is that much of a downside since I still think these lines are pretty good for White.   What is Black's idea behind 4... e6, the Semi-Slav ? 4... e6 looks very passive, locking in Black's bishop, but this is only temporary. Black has the intention of freeing his bishop later on with a very thematic sequence: ... dxc4, followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7. As we see, Black has no intention of developing his light bishop along the c8-h3 diagonal and instead wants to fianchetto it on b7. The Semi-Slav is a top-notch opening which has a reputation for being very sharp, complex but 100% theoretically watertight. As a result, it's a popular choice among GMs and super-GMs who can put the work in to learn the theory and are rewarded with a bullet-proof opening repertoire. To get the most out of the Semi-Slav though, one has to learn the theory since some lines, in particular the 5. Bg5 lines can become very sharp - obviously, this is true for all openings, but I think it is particularly important for Black to learn the theory in the Semi-Slav.   As a result, I think the best way to meet the Semi-Slav is by picking the most critical, theoretically-challenging lines available. We won't get anything if we play timid sidelines here. Black might be able to equalise in long, sharp forcing lines if he memorises 25 moves of theory, but the vast majority of opponents that you and I face aren't super-GMs who can reel out theory like this. The more likely scenario is that your opponents will deviate somewhere before move 10-12 or so, which will allow you to get an edge in most cases. }
5. Nf3
{ Simply developing and transposing to a position which is more frequently reached after 3. Nf3 4. Nc3 5. e3. }
5... Nbd7
{ The most flexible way to play and the most common moves by far. Alternatives will most likely just transpose within a move or two, for example, 5... Bd6 6. Qc2 Nbd7. One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back intending to develop his light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7 { Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far. } 11.
e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening.

22... Nxe4 { is another tempting way to grab the e4 pawn. } 23. Rae1 c4 24.
Bxc4
{ A little tactic to win a pawn, temporarily. The game does fizzle out a bit now into a very marginally more pleasant endgame for White, but there are a number of ways to keep the game complex here instead like 24.Bd1, 24.Qc1 and 24.a4, which go unmentioned by GM Schandorff in his book on the Semi-Slav. }
24... bxc4 25. fxe4
{ Black will regain the pawn shortly with ...Qc6 and ...Rxe4, taking play into a rook and bishop ending with opposite coloured bishops. This was how Schandorff's analysis ended, with conclusion being that Black has nothing to fear in that endgame. I'd agree, with the small caveat that White has the more pleasant side of the endgame there due to our more active pieces and Black's somewhat precarious position. If this doesn't appeal to you, I recommend checking out alternatives to 24.Bxc4 - both 24.Qc1 and 24.Bd1 look promising to me. }

One thing to keep in mind in this chapter is that there are many possible transpositions, at many different points. Black can often play ...Nbd7, ...Bd6, ...dxc4, ... O-O, ...a6, ...b5 etc. in many different orders. That's why I'd recommend paying special attention to the setups we use throughout this chapter instead of just the individual moves. That way you won't be thrown if Black tries something you hadn't seen before since you can revert to a development scheme you saw we used against a different move order. }
6. Qc2
{ This is about equally common as 6. Bd3. 6. Bd3 will most likely lead to the Meran variation when Black goes for the aforementioned plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. 6. Bd3 used to be the main move almost exclusively until Karpov popularised 6. Qc2 in the 90s. 6. Qc2, logically named the Anti-Meran, is directed against Black's plan of ...dxc4, ...b5 and ...Bb7. The point is that we delay the development of our light bishop so that we don't lose a tempo if Black plays ...dxc4 on the next move, and in the meanwhile, we play a useful move which improves our queen's position. }
6... Bd6
{ Black's most popular move by far. The bishop is more actively placed here than on the timid e7 square. It serves a very important purpose on d6 too: since the Black ...dxc4, ...b5, ... Bb7, ...a6 plan intending a ...c5 break is not as effective now with our queen on c2, Black will often be looking to play the ...e5 break instead. This bishop is ideally placed on d6 to support this break. }
7. Bd3
{ The other very natural plan here is to play with 7. b3, analogously to 6... Be7. However, here I don't think it is nearly as effective since Black can use his active bishop on d6 to play the ...e5 break and that should usually equalise for him. }
7... O-O
{ The most natural and most common move by far, just getting the king to safety. }
8. O-O
{ We do the same, getting our king to safety. Black's main move by far here is 8... dxc4, but he has one very important and pretty good alternative which has become quite popular recently: 8... e5. }
8... dxc4
{ Black's most popular move by far. Now that we have moved our bishop, it makes perfect sense to take on c4 since we 'lose' a tempo due to Bd3xc4. }
9. Bxc4
{ This is a very important branching point since this is the point where Black decides what plan exactly he wants to follow. His main options are as follows: 1. 9... e5 foregoes queenside play to get counterplay in the centre as quickly as possible. 2. 9... a6 is a flexible move which tries to implement the standard plan of ...b5 and then ...c5. 3. 9... b5 immediately intends to solve the problem of the bad light bishop on c8 by playing ...Bb7 next. Black will typically delay ...a6 here until much later and instead play for the ...e5 break. Black has some other minor options too, such as 9... Qe7 which should just transpose to 9... e5, and 9... c5 which is a direct attempt to force equality which doesn't quite work. }
9... b5
{ The sharp mainline. Black immediately kicks our bishop back intending to develop his light bishop on b7. }
10. Be2
{ 10. Bd3 is also a very viable way to play, but I prefer 10. Be2. Our plan is to play e4 next which Black will most likely meet with ...e5, dxe5 ...Nxe5. From e5, the knight would attack our bishop on d3, which forces us to play Nxe5 instead of the plan I'll advocate here with Nd4-f5. It's a pretty minor difference between two popular and good lines, but they result in vastly different positions. }
10... Bb7 { Simply developing is the most common choice Black's by far. } 11.
e4
{ White has a more popular option here in the form of 11. Rd1, but I think 11. e4 ! immediately, threatening e5, is much more direct, challenging and forcing. I don't think we can get any objective advantage by playing slow, non-critical lines here - we need to test Black theoretically by playing sharp lines which put him under the maximum amount of pressure. I think this sentiment is backed up by the results - 11. e4 scores over 61% in my database of OTB games, while 11. Rd1 scores a respectable but lower 57%. Ultimately, correspondence players - or very well prepared Black players - will be able to neutralise my recommendations after 11. e4, but this is to be expected of course - chess is a draw and the Semi-Slav is a great opening. However, I think 11. e4 is our best chance to put Black under pressure both theoretically and practically. The vast majority of players won't be prepared well enough to deal with the complications in this line, in which case you could be scoring some quick victories pretty much straight out of preparation. The lines and analysis which follows is very concrete - I'll try my best to explain the positional concepts and ideas behind the moves where I can, but often moves 'work just because they work'. This is quite possibly one of the sharpest sections in the whole course, so good preparation and the ability to calculate well are of paramount importance. Enjoy the craziness ! }
11... e5
{ The only decent move at Black's disposal - he needs to deal with the threat of e5. }
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4
{ The knight is heading for the outpost on f5. We do have a very valid alternative in the form of the slightly rarer 13. Nh4, but 13. Nd4 is in my opinion a bit stronger and it scores better - a whopping 69% in my database of OTB games ! }
13... Neg4
{ Black's most popular and best move by far - he doesn't give us a chance to play Nf5 by first threatening the h2 pawn. }
14. g3
{ The only decent game once again - please don't play 14. h3, even though it looks very tempting - Black has 14... Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ ! followed by ...Qxd4. 14. g3 does a good job of blunting Black's dark bishop and reducing these tactical tricks that Black has at his disposal. }
14... Bc5
{ This is catching up in popularity to the natural 14... Bxg3 in OTB games, as I think it is Black's best way to equalise. Black starts putting some pressure on the f2 pawn. }
15. Nf5 Re8 { Putting some pressure on the e4 pawn. } 16. Bf4
{ Simply developing and making it possible for the other rook to enter the game now. }
16... Qb6
{ Ramping up the pressure against the f2 pawn. Pretty much all the games have gone this way, but I think 16... Nxf2 might be a better option. }
17. Kg2
{ Prophylaxis against . ..Bxf2+. The lines which follow are incredibly sharp and complex - the odds of an under 2200 player reaching this position as Black is very slim. It only has happened once before ! You might even want to pause the next 10 lines or so if you wish and stop studying up until this point, because the likelihood of this cropping up is low - however, if you want to be super well prepared, go for it ! The lines are complex and sharp, and 'things work just because they work'. }
17... g6 { Booting our knight out from f5. } 18. h3
{ The knight has nowhere to go, so instead we counterattack Black's knight. Here Black has tried two moves: 18... Ne5 and 18... gxf5. }
18... gxf5 { This has been the more popular choice in practice. } 19. hxg4 Bd4
{ This has been the more common choice in OTB games, but correspondence players have preferred 19... Nxe4 instead. }
20. gxf5 Bxc3 21. bxc3 c5 22. f3
{ The pawn on f3 does an important job of protecting our king on the long diagonal. }
22... Rxe4
{ We can't recapture on e4 since we lose our queen after ... Bxe4+. } 23. Rae1
Rxf4 24. gxf4
{ This was what happened in two crazy OTB games, including one by Shirov. Black sacrifices the exchange to triple our pawns and allow his knight to start causing problems. Ultimately, I don't think this is the best way to play and I think we should be better here, even though both games ended in a draw. }
24... Nd5 25. Bd1 c4 26. Qe4
{ The queen is heading to e5, after which we can start to create some mating threats. }
26... Nxc3 { This was a mistake, but Black's position was difficult anyway, }
27. Qe5 Nd5
{ This position was reached in -  (39)  Erdos, V  (2628)  -Bellaiche, A  (2463)  Biel 2017. }
28. Rg1
{ would have been decisive instead of 28. Rh1, which was played. This line is wild and complex and it's difficult to memorise everything - ultimately, I think White is doing very well, which is confirmed by practical games, but Black can equalise if he is very well prepared with something like 16... Nxf2, for example. }

[White "The Dutch Defence"]
[Black "The Dutch Defence"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 f5
{ We'll be examining the 'pure Dutch' here, starting with 1... f5. The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }
2. Bg5
{ This is an incredibly popular recommendation for White in repertoire books, including in those of Kaufman and Schandorff. Its appeal is easy to understand - 2. Bg5 is forcing and quite disruptive. In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6.2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ...e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works here too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendation. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }
2... g6
{ The most popular move in this position and a very logical one. Of the three plans I mentioned that Black has in the Dutch - the Classical with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Stonewall with ...d5, ...e6 and ...c6, and the Leningrad with ...g6 - it is the Leningrad with ...g6 which seems to be the least affected by our disruptive 2. Bg5. Black intends to complete development with ...Bg7, ...Nf6, ...O-O etc. but as we shall see, we are going to throw a spanner in the works very soon with a timely h4-h5 pawn storm.   2...c6  Black's idea is to ignore the kingside for the time being and continue with one of two possible plans: either he will play ...d5 and ...Nd7-f6, or try to exploit the fact that the b2 pawn is unprotected since our bishop is on g5.  3.Nd2  Just developing. 3. e3 is also perfectly playable and it can be played first, followed by 4. Nd2.  Qb6  Hitting the b2 and d4 pawn, but this shouldn't concern us. I think this whole idea of ...c6, ...Qb6xb2 is very speculative. Going pawn-grabbing this early, without having developed a single piece, simply can't be good.   3...d5  This whole setup makes very little sense to me but it has been tried a few times.  4.e3  Nd7  Black's trying to put his queen's knight on f6, but this looks suspicious, as it doesn't solve the problem of the knight on g8.  5.Bd3  Ndf6  6.Ngf3  g6  7.c4  Bg7  8.O-O  ±  I'm not sure how Black intends to solve the problem of the knight on g8, and as a result, White is clearly better here.  4.e3 !  Sacrificing the b2 pawn, covering d4 and preparing to develop the light bishop.  Qxb2  5.Bd3  White has already developed 3 pieces while Black hasn't developed any, and he still has to waste time extracting his queen from b2.  d5  6.Ne2  We want the knight on e2 so it can potentially go to f4 later. Here follows a sample line from a practical game which demonstrates how easily White can develop his initiative:  Qa3  7.Nf4  Threatening Qh5+ now.  Qd6  Extracting the queen eventually and preparing to meet Qh5+ with ...g6.  8.c4 !  Of course, we want to open the position to exploit our huge lead in development.  Nf6  9.Rc1  dxc4  10.Nxc4  Qc7  11.O-O  +-  White already had a decisive initiative in 1-0  (18)  Galyas, M  (2441)  -Leitner, G  (2201)  Ratten 2014. Next, he can just play something like Ne5, Qb3, Bc4 etc.   2...Nf6  Black decides to ignore the bishop on g5 and develop according to his pre-planned schemes anyway. This line is critical in the sense that if Black is doing fine here, then there wouldn't be much point to 2. Bg5. Fortunately though, White is doing very well here both theoretically and in practice.  3.Bxf6  Of course we double Black's pawns since that is why our bishop was developed to g5.  exf6  The only decent recapture - taking back with the g-pawn leaves the h5-e8 diagonal critically weakened after e4.  4.e3  If Black could magically move his pawn on f5 back to f7, he would be doing pretty fine here - however, he obviously can't. This fact causes Black several problems in this variation - most notably, the a2-g8 diagonal is exposed, which is something we exploit in many cases in this line by playing c4, cxd5, Qb3, Bc4, etc. and force Black's king to the h-file. Another issue for Black is that the f5-pawn can potentially become a target, and on top of that it restricts Black's bishop on c8.  d5   4...g6  A relatively rare line given by GM Williams as a backup weapon, but I think White gets a clear advantage here anyway.  5.h4 !  Just like after 2... g6 which we'll be looking at a bit later, this is a very strong response - we are intending h5 of course to harass Black's structure on the kingside.  d5  6.c4  Be6  7.h5  Quite a natural move that goes unmentioned by GM Williams.  g5  Probably the lesser of the two evils.  8.cxd5  Qxd5  9.Nc3  Qa5  10.Bd3  ±  White has developed soundly and has good central control, while Black has advanced the pawns around his king which could become a serious issue later on.  5.c4  transposes to 2... d5, which we'll be covering next.   2...d5  This is rarer than 2... Nf6, but they usually transpose on the next move to the same position.  3.e3  Nf6   3...c6  This is the only real independent option that Black has here with the idea of ...Qb6 once again attacking the pawn on b2 which was left undefended by our bishop.  4.c4  Qb6  5.Qc2  In this case, we have enough time to cover the b2 pawn without making any concession. We are also threatening cxd5, with a pin on the c6 pawn.  e6  6.Nc3  Once again threatening to take twice on d5, exploiting the pin on the c6 pawn.  Nd7  7.Bd3  Ngf6  8.Nge2  ±  Much like in the Slav chapter, where in one line we reached a Stonewall structure via a Triangle System move order with 1.. .d5, 2... c6 and 3... c6, here we counter the Stonewall with Nge2 and f3. This has the advantage of taking away Black's biggest trump card, the e4 outpost for his knight. After f3, we will want to work towards the e4 break most likely.  4.Bxf6  Once again, we take on f6 - this is the whole point of Bg5 of course.  exf6  Note that this is the same position we could have reached after 2... Nf6 3... d5.  5.c4  As I mentioned, one of the major problems Black has in this line is the exposed a2-g8 diagonal. To that end, we want to open that diagonal up by forcing Black to take on c4. With that in mind, we plan to put as much pressure on d5 as quickly as possible with moves like c4, Nc3, and Qb3.  c6  Supporting d5.   5...Be6  This is another way to defend d5, but it runs into the problem that Black wastes time retreating his bishop from the centre if he wants to retain the bishop pair, which is the one advantage he does possess.  6.cxd5  Opening the a2-g8 diagonal and luring Black's bishop to the centre.  Bxd5  7.Nc3  Hitting the bishop.  Bb4  8.Nge2 !  An idea which should be familiar by now from other lines in the Dutch - we want to put our knight on f4 to ramp up the pressure on d5.  Nc6  9.a3  Forcing Black to cede one of the bishops.  Bxc3+  10.bxc3  O-O  11.Nf4  ±  Fighting for d5 and preparing c4 in the future. The knight on f4 is virtually untouchable since ... g5 just weakens Black's king so much.   5...Bb4+  Developing the bishop with tempo makes sense here too, however, Black will most likely have to give up the bishop pair.  6.Nc3  O-O  7.Qb3  Hitting d5 and c3, forcing Black to cede the bishop pair.  Bxc3+  8.bxc3  We take with the b-pawn to open up the b-file as well as support d4. If Black decides to support d5 with ...c6, at some point we might want to play cxd5 followed by c4, forcing the a2-g8 diagonal open.  dxc4   8...c6  Trying to prevent the a2-g8 diagonal from opening.  9.Bd3  Be6  10.Ne2  Once again, the knight is on its way to f4.  dxc4  11.Bxc4  Bxc4  12.Qxc4+  ±  White has several advantages here - our better centre, more space, better pawn structure, while we can target the Black pawns on b7 and f5.  9.Bxc4+  Kh8  10.Ne2  ±  We have successfully opened the a2-g8 diagonal, which leads straight to Black's king and forces Black's king to h8. This often facilitates various attacking ideas, such as h4-h5 followed by Nf4-g6. Black's king is a permanent worry, while we enjoy the more active pieces, better central control and better pawn structure. White went on to win an instructive game from here in 1-0  (26)  Moskalenko, V  (2558)  -Karlsson,L  (2468)  Sitges 2009  6.Nc3  Be6  7.Qb3  Hitting b7 and putting some pressure on d5.  Qd7  8.Rc1  Our rook will be useful on the c-file, whether we exchange on d5 or Black ends up taking on c4.  dxc4  9.Bxc4  Bxc4  10.Qxc4  Na6  11.Nge2  ±  Once again, with a good centre, control over a2-g8 which makes it difficult for Black to castle, and a better pawn structure, White has a healthy advantage.   2...h6  This is one of Black's two main choices after 2. Bg5, with the other being 2... g6.2... h6 seeks to exploit our bishop placement by kicking it around and expanding on the kingside quickly. This is a double-edged sword though, as the more pawns that Black pushes on the kingside, the more potential weaknesses that he creates.  3.Bh4 !  Don't worry about getting the bishop trapped with ...g5 and ...f4 - Black can't do this due to problems on the h5-e8 diagonal, as we shall see. h4 is the most active square for the bishop and the only one which is worth considering as it continues disrupting Black's development by preventing ...e6 and discouraging ...Nf6.  g5  Gaining space on the kingside and preparing to fianchetto the bishop on g7.  4.e3 !  The point - Black can't take on h4 due to Qh5 mate. We could play e3 on the next move too, after Bg3. Another option for White here is 4. e4, but after I analysing both I ended up preferring 4. e3.  Nf6  Dealing with the mate threat, and now the bishop on h4 is genuinely attacked so we must retreat of course.  5.Bg3  d6  Covering f5 with the bishop, blunting our bishop on g3 and maybe preparing ...e5 in the distant future.   5...Bg7  is another popular alternative, but this should ultimately transpose in a few moves - for example:  6.Nc3  d6  7.h4  transposes.  6.h4 !  A very thematic idea - I already mentioned that the downside of Black rushing his kingside pawns forward is that it can leave weaknesses, and h4 is our way of trying to create one of those weaknesses. We want to get the f4 outpost for our knight, so we trying to force Black to play ...g4 by challenging g5 with h4.  g4  Black obliges and gives us the f4 outpost. As we saw after 6... Rg8, this is almost inevitable.   6...Rg8  Recommended by Simon Williams, aka the GingerGM. Black stubbornly refuses to budge with the g5 pawn and thus denies us the f4 outpost for our knight.  7.Be2 !  A very rare move which wasn't covered by GM Williams - which is quite understandable since it is super rare. The idea is Bh5+ of course, to get Black to play ...g4 to give us the f4 square for our knight.  g4  The most natural move, ruling out our threat of Bh5+, however, this is exactly what we were looking for. We now have the f4 outpost for our knight.   7...e6  Black can continue to be stubborn, and refuse us the f4 square, but this will lead to us playing Bh5+ eventually, taking away Black's king's castling privileges.  8.hxg5  hxg5  9.c4  The immediate 9. Bh5+ is tempting, and it is also good, but that idea is pretty much always available. As the saying goes - the threat is stronger than the execution.  Ne4  This position was only reached in one game so far, which was a correspondence game, and this was Black's choice. He logically wants to grab the bishop pair and wreck our pawn structure with ...Nxg3.  10.Bh5+  Ensuring that Black's king will be stuck in the centre for a long time, and clearing the e2 square for our knight so that we can recapture on g3 with the knight.  Kd7  11.Ne2  c6  Black is clearing the c7 square for his king.  12.Nbc3  Nxg3  13.Nxg3  ±  White is clearly better here. Black still has to deal with the problem of his king and in the long-term its unlikely that he'll ever be completely safe. White will play Qc2 and O-O-O next most likely, and then work on opening up the centre with e4 or d5 while Black's king is still vulnerable. White went on to win from here in 1-0  (33)  Yunusov,A  (2452)  -Mueller,A  (2183)  ICCF email 2018  8.Bd3 !  Now with ...g4 played, we free up e2 so that our knight can hop into f4. Even though it seems like we "lost" a tempo, this isn't the case. We have a similar position to the one after 6... g4, except that Black has got ...Rg8 in "for free" - if anything though, this is a worse square for the rook than on h8 though.  Bg7  9.Ne2  Heading straight for f4.  Nh5  This is a logical idea - Black fights for the f4 outpost and prepares to exchange our knight if we ever try to occupy that square. Black also opens up the dark bishop's diagonal in the hope of playing ...e5 later. This does come at a cost though - the knight no longer covers the e4 square, meaning that we can make this thematic break much more easily now.  10.e4  Other good moves exist too, but forcing matters like this is both strong and direct. A fine alternative is 10. Nbc3. Black needs to find a way to deal with the threat to the f5 pawn now.  Rf8  Black shouldn't even consider grabbing on e4, since our bishop then gets access to the weakened h5-e8 diagonal - as I said right at the start of the chapter, 1... f5 has terrible long-term consequences for Black on that diagonal ! What follows is far from forced, but I think it's a useful line which illustrates some of the problems which Black can experience in this variation:  11.Nbc3  Nc6  Both sides just develop for now.  12.exf5  With all our minor pieces developed, it's time to take action.  Bxf5  13.d5  Black's lack of any central control allows us to march forward and kick his knight around. Take note of the backward e-pawn and outpost on e6 for our knight in the future.  Nb4  14.Bxf5  Rxf5  15.a3  Continuing to kick Black's knight around.  Nxg3  16.fxg3  It's important to recapture this way and not with the knight so that ...Bxc3+ can be met by Nxc3 which doesn't allow Black to win the d5 pawn.  Na6  17.Nd4  ±  White is so much better positionally that we are objectively winning already. We have more space, more active pieces, a target on g4, outpost on e6 etc. If Black tries ...Re5+, we just play Kf2 with a crushing advantage.  7.Nc3  Just developing - other moves are fine too.  Nh5  A standard follow-up to ...g4 that we've already seen. Black fights for the f4 outpost and this has the additional idea of maybe taking on g3 in the future.   7...Bg7  Developing normally.  8.Bc4  Another decent move here, and a thematic idea to keep in mind, is h5. This has the benefit of taking h5 away from the knight and cutting off support to the pawn on g4, while ensuring that if we get the knight to f4, we'll also have another outpost available on g6. Despite this, I slightly prefer 8. Bc4 here - we prioritise development and prevent Black from castling.  Nh5  9.Nge2 !  I think it's important not to fear the ...Nxg3 exchange. We'll see in the next line how to deal with this - it's not dangerous at all.  e6  10.Qd2  As is typical in this line, we want to long castle and then prepare the e4 break. Qd2 does a good job of preparing both of these things.  a6  11.a3  Castling long immediately is fine too, but this is a useful prophylactic move to insert first - we rule out ...b5-b4, and also free up the a2 square as a retreat square for the bishop.  Qf6  12.e4  +=  With Black's queen on f6, the immediate e4 break is particularly strong since Nxe4 comes with tempo now. We will look to long castle over the next couple moves. White went on to win in the correspondence game 1-0  (63)  Crabb,N  (2314)  -Hugo,T  (2123)  ICCF email 2014  8.Bc4 !  I already mentioned in the previous line that there is no need to fear ...Nxg3 ! Even if we are "forced" by Black to destroy our pawn structure with fxg3, this is still good for us.  Nxg3  This certainly looks very tempting - destroying our pawn structure and grabbing the bishop pair.  9.fxg3  The problem here for Black is that our pawn structure isn't nearly as bad as it might look at first glance. We get a semi-open f-file for our rook, the f4 outpost is stronger than ever and the e4 break is still on the cards later. Black has no way to take advantage of the defects in our pawn structure, and his bishop pair isn't useful yet as the position is relatively closed.  c6  The engine suggests a Stonewall setup for Black - this doesn't look convincing to me at all though, but the alternatives look bleak as well.  10.Nge2  d5  11.Bd3  e6  12.Nf4  ±  White is doing a lot better here - even though Stockfish doesn't realise it at first, this evaluation is confirmed by Leela. Positionally, Black is struggling due to his bad bishop on c8, which will never have good prospects. Eventually, Black will be forced to part with either his dark bishop or knight or both, to get rid of our knights which have great outposts available on f4 and e5. This will leave the poor bishop on c8. The discrepancy between Stockfish and Leela in this position is amazing - most human players would think White is doing clearly better here, and this is backed up by Leela, but Stockfish thinks Black is at least equal. I analysed this deeper out of curiosity, but it's clear that Stockfish is completely wrong here - if you're interested in this sort of thing, I recommend exploring this position a bit yourself if you have the time and interest - it gives a good feel for the differences between the two strongest engines in the world. }
3. Nc3
{ For now, we just develop. Don't worry too much about blocking the c-pawn in these lines - we often castle long, meaning our pawn is better on c2 where it provides cover for our king, and we are typically playing for the e4 and g4 pawn breaks. }
3... Bg7
{ The most common move and the most flexible way to get the pieces out.   3...d5  Black rules out our e4 break for now, but this looks positionally suspect since it weakens the e5 square so much and it only prevents e4 temporarily - we will most likely want to just prepare it with f3 and then play it anyway.  4.h4  Our usual idea in this line - we rush h4-h5 to exploit the pawn on g6.  Bg7  The most natural move, just developing and preparing to get the knight out next with ...Nf6.   4...Nh6  This idea of manoeuvring the knight to f7 seems a bit slow to me.  5.Qd2  The usual square for the queen in this line, since I want to long castle as already mentioned.  Nf7  6.Bf4  No need to surrender the bishop pair unnecessarily.  c6  7.f3  Preparing e4 - this break will be even more devastating with Black having committed to ...d5.  Bg7  8.O-O-O  b5  Black is desperately looking for counterplay - he wants to have ... b4 available to remove a defender of the e4 square and thus make it harder to carry out that break.  9.e4 !  We are in time to carry out the break anyway !  fxe4  10.fxe4  b4  Black kicks our knight away but this doesn't matter too much - the b4 pawn becomes a target now.  11.Nb1  dxe4  12.Qxb4  +=  White is better developed and has a better pawn structure. h4-h5 is still on its way once Black castles short, with a very good position.   4...h6  Kicking our bishop away so that Black can develop with ...Nf6 without allowing Bxf6. This has the added benefit of taking the sting out of h5 since now Black has ...g5 available. However, this comes with a major drawback - g6 is left undefended, meaning that our knight hop with Nf3-e5 is incredibly annoying and surprisingly difficult to deal with.  5.Bf4  Nf6  6.Nf3  Targeting the weak g6 pawn with Nf3-e5. As mentioned already, it's surprisingly difficult for Black to deal with this simply threat. The plan of...Bg7, ...O-O and ...Kh7 is just too slow.  Be6  7.Ne5  Rg8  Covering g6, but this is already just so bad for Black - on top of having given the e5 outpost away, he has also forfeited castling rights.  8.Qd2  ±  Hitting h6 - Black's position is just falling apart.  5.Qd2  Once again, this is a useful move intending long castling next.  c6  6.O-O-O  With our king tucked away safely, we can switch our focus to carrying out the e4 break now.  Be6  7.f3  Preparing e4 as usual.  h6  8.Bf4  Nf6  9.e3  We want to get our bishop to d3 first before we play the e4 break.  Nbd7  10.Bd3  The best square for the bishop here of course. It is ideally placed to take advantage of the loose g6 pawn once we open the centre with e4.  Bf7  Black's bishop drops back to cover the weakened g6 pawn.  11.e4  The time is right to carry out this thematic pawn break.  dxe4  12.fxe4  fxe4  13.Nxe4  Nxe4  14.Bxe4  With the dust having somewhat settled, we can take stock. Material is still equal, but we are doing well because of our better pawn structure, more active pieces and safer king.  e5  Getting rid off the isolated e-pawn and hoping for some piece exchanges in the centre.  15.dxe5  Nxe5  16.Qc3 !  ±  Of course, we want to keep as many pieces on the board as possible to exploit Black's exposed king. In fact, it is Black's exposed king that defines our advantage here.   3...Nf6  Black has no fear of Bxf6 here.  4.h4  While Bxf6 is not a terrible move here, it's not quite as good as it is after 2... Nf6. The reason is that we have already committed to Nc3, blocking our c-pawn - after Bxf6 ...exf6, we would ideally want to control the centre and then open up the a2-g8 diagonal with c4, but obviously, this is difficult to achieve with a knight on c3. As a result, we revert to the usual plan against ...g6, which is to harass Black's kingside with h4-h5.  Bg7  5.h5 !  In situations like this, where Black has completely disregarded what we've been doing and blindly plays ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bh7, h5 is particularly strong. This is played with the idea of a thematic exchange sacrifice after ... Nxh5 Rxh5, and if Black doesn't grab the material on offer he will be forced to play the shameful retreat ...Bf8 after we go h6.  d5  Black ignores our h-pawn, but this obviously can't be good either.   5...Nxh5 ?!  Greedy, but critical. White must be aware of how to follow-up here:  6.Rxh5 !  Of course, we sacrifice the exchange. Even though we are down a pawn and the exchange for the moment, the compensation here is tremendous - Black's pawn structure is wrecked, his king is exposed and White is much more active.  gxh5  7.Nd5 !  There are other good moves, but this is particularly strong - we are hitting e7.  Nc6  8.e3  +-  Followed by Qxh5+ and/or Bb5, intending Bxc6 is crushing.  6.h6 !  Kicking the bishop back to its home base. It's going to be a long time until Black can castle short now.  Bf8  Absolutely shameful :-  7.Qd2  ±  White is much better - no further comment needed. }
4. e3
{ Not the most common move - both 4. e4 and 4. h4 are more common - but I think it's a very strong one with a rather subtle point to it. We delay 4. h4 for the moment so that we can meet ...h6 with Bh4. We are in effect waiting for 4... Nf6 so that ...h6 later can be met by Bxf6. }
4... Nf6
{ 4...h6  This is the difference between 4. e3 and the immediate 4. h4. After 4. h4, 5. Bf4 would be forced, which isn't ideal - but now we have the h4 square available.  5.Bh4  We want the bishop on h4 so that it can chop the knight once it lands on f6.  Nf6  6.Bxf6  It looks counterintuitive, giving up the bishop pair like this, but there is a point to it...  Bxf6  7.Nd5 !  Without Black's knight on f6, our knight gets the d5 square - it is heading to f4 from which it can begin targeting the weakened g6 pawn. As we've already seen, the g6 pawn is a typical soft spot in these Leningrad setups once Black goes ...h6 and it's surprisingly difficult for him to defend.  e6  8.Nf4  One way or another, Black is forfeiting short-castling rights since he can't comfortably defend g6.  Rg8  9.g4 !  Up until now, we've been focusing on the e4 break, but now let me introduce another break which we'll be using extensively in this chapter - the g4 break !  c5  10.c3  ±  Just supporting the d4 pawn for now. In the future, we'll want to take on f5, which somewhat forces Black to recapture with the e-pawn which gives our light bishop free rein on the a2-g8 diagonal.   4...d5  is a possible move once again.  5.h4  Standard procedure.  c6  6.Bd3  Be6  7.Nf3  Our knights on c3 and f3 want to exploit the f4 and e5 outposts respectively.  Nf6  8.Ne2  +=  The knight is on its way to f4, while the other is heading to e5 with a good position. }
5. h4
{ Now, with Black having committed to ... Nf6, it is the right time to launch our h-pawn down the board since ...h6 can be met by Bxf6. }
5... h6
{ Forcing us to decide with the bishop.   5...d5  Once again, this is playable, but ignoring our h-pawn rush is a very bad idea.  6.h5 !  Onwards !  Nxh5  The alternative, allowing us to play h6, is horrible. 6. ..Nxh5 is even worse objectively-speaking, but I think it's useful to demonstrate the compensation and initiative we get for the exchange.  7.Rxh5 !  The standard, thematic exchange sacrifice that we've already seen before.  gxh5  8.Qxh5+  Kf8  9.Bd3  We're down an exchange, but our compensation is huge - Black's king is exposed, we are ahead in development and his pawn structure is full of holes.  c6  10.Nf3  Qe8  11.Qh2  ±  Of course, we can't allow the exchange of queens. Next, we intend to castle long and then begin bringing our pieces to aid in the kingside attack, e.g. Ne2, Rg1 etc. We don't have a forced win or anything like that, but White has more than enough compensation for the exchange - Black's king is unlikely to ever be safe. }
6. Bxf6
{ As I said already, this is the way we want to deal with ...h6 if there is a knight on f6. We don't want to retreat and give Black a chance to catch a breath - instead, we are playing quickly, forcefully and trying to develop an initiative. }
6... Bxf6 7. Qf3
{ Intending to play g4 later on. The queen is well-placed on f3 where it can support a kingside attack. We prevent Black from castling now due to the very strong h5 !. }
7... d6
{ 7...e6  is met in a very similar way to 7... d6:  8.g4 !  ±  Cranking open Black's kingside with a very dangerous initiative. We have Nge2-f4 on the way, attacking the usual weak point on g6. }
8. Bc4
{ A good, active square for the bishop which also prevents Black from castling, }
8... e6 9. g4
{ This position was reached in the game 1/2-1/2  (33)  Teplyi, I  (2389)  -Kristiansen, J  (2411)  Aarhus 2015. White is doing clearly better here, but Black managed to hold. We intend to develop our initiative further with O-O-O and then Nge2-f4 next, targeting the weak g6 pawn. }

Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ...e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6.

This has the advantage of taking away Black's biggest trump card, the e4 outpost for his knight. After f3, we will want to work towards the e4 break most likely. }

1. d4 f5
{ We'll be examining the 'pure Dutch' here, starting with 1... f5. The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }
2. Bg5
{ This is an incredibly popular recommendation for White in repertoire books, including in those of Kaufman and Schandorff. Its appeal is easy to understand - 2. Bg5 is forcing and quite disruptive. In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6.2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ...e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works here too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendation. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }

{ Gaining space on the kingside and preparing to fianchetto the bishop on g7. }
4. e3
{ The point - Black can't take on h4 due to Qh5 mate. We could play e3 on the next move too, after Bg3. Another option for White here is 4. e4, but after I analysing both I ended up preferring 4. e3. }
4... Nf6
{ Dealing with the mate threat, and now the bishop on h4 is genuinely attacked so we must retreat of course. }
5. Bg3 d6
{ Covering f5 with the bishop, blunting our bishop on g3 and maybe preparing ...e5 in the distant future. }
6. h4
{ A very thematic idea - I already mentioned that the downside of Black rushing his kingside pawns forward is that it can leave weaknesses, and h4 is our way of trying to create one of those weaknesses. We want to get the f4 outpost for our knight, so we trying to force Black to play ...g4 by challenging g5 with h4. }
6... Rg8
{ Recommended by Simon Williams, aka the GingerGM. Black stubbornly refuses to budge with the g5 pawn and thus denies us the f4 outpost for our knight. }
7. Be2
{ A very rare move which wasn't covered by GM Williams - which is quite understandable since it is super rare. The idea is Bh5+ of course, to get Black to play ...g4 to give us the f4 square for our knight. }
7... g4
{ The most natural move, ruling out our threat of Bh5+, however, this is exactly what we were looking for. We now have the f4 outpost for our knight. }
8. Bd3
{ Now with ...g4 played, we free up e2 so that our knight can hop into f4. Even though it seems like we 'lost' a tempo, this isn't the case. We have a similar position to the one after 6... g4, except that Black has got ...Rg8 in 'for free' - if anything though, this is a worse square for the rook than on h8 though. }
8... Bg7 9. Ne2 { Heading straight for f4. } 9... Nh5
{ This is a logical idea - Black fights for the f4 outpost and prepares to exchange our knight if we ever try to occupy that square. Black also opens up the dark bishop's diagonal in the hope of playing ...e5 later. This does come at a cost though - the knight no longer covers the e4 square, meaning that we can make this thematic break much more easily now. }
10. e4
{ Other good moves exist too, but forcing matters like this is both strong and direct. A fine alternative is 10. Nbc3. Black needs to find a way to deal with the threat to the f5 pawn now. }
10... Rf8
{ Black shouldn't even consider grabbing on e4, since our bishop then gets access to the weakened h5-e8 diagonal - as I said right at the start of the chapter, 1... f5 has terrible long-term consequences for Black on that diagonal ! What follows is far from forced, but I think it's a useful line which illustrates some of the problems which Black can experience in this variation: }
11. Nbc3 Nc6 { Both sides just develop for now. } 12. exf5
{ With all our minor pieces developed, it's time to take action. } 12... Bxf5
13. d5
{ Black's lack of any central control allows us to march forward and kick his knight around. Take note of the backward e-pawn and outpost on e6 for our knight in the future. }
13... Nb4 14. Bxf5 Rxf5 15. a3 { Continuing to kick Black's knight around. }
15... Nxg3 16. fxg3
{ It's important to recapture this way and not with the knight so that ...Bxc3+ can be met by Nxc3 which doesn't allow Black to win the d5 pawn. }
16... Na6 17. Nd4
{ White is so much better positionally that we are objectively winning already. We have more space, more active pieces, a target on g4, outpost on e6 etc. If Black tries ...Re5+, we just play Kf2 with a crushing advantage. }

1. d4 f5
{ We'll be examining the 'pure Dutch' here, starting with 1... f5. The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }
2. Bg5
{ This is an incredibly popular recommendation for White in repertoire books, including in those of Kaufman and Schandorff. Its appeal is easy to understand - 2. Bg5 is forcing and quite disruptive. In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6.2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ...e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works here too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendation. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }
2... h6
{ This is one of Black's two main choices after 2. Bg5, with the other being 2... g6.2... h6 seeks to exploit our bishop placement by kicking it around and expanding on the kingside quickly. This is a double-edged sword though, as the more pawns that Black pushes on the kingside, the more potential weaknesses that he creates. }
3. Bh4
{ Don't worry about getting the bishop trapped with ...g5 and ...f4 - Black can't do this due to problems on the h5-e8 diagonal, as we shall see. h4 is the most active square for the bishop and the only one which is worth considering as it continues disrupting Black's development by preventing ...e6 and discouraging ...Nf6. }
3... g5
{ Gaining space on the kingside and preparing to fianchetto the bishop on g7. }
4. e3
{ The point - Black can't take on h4 due to Qh5 mate. We could play e3 on the next move too, after Bg3. Another option for White here is 4. e4, but after I analysing both I ended up preferring 4. e3. }
4... Nf6
{ Dealing with the mate threat, and now the bishop on h4 is genuinely attacked so we must retreat of course. }
5. Bg3 d6
{ Covering f5 with the bishop, blunting our bishop on g3 and maybe preparing ...e5 in the distant future. }
6. h4
{ A very thematic idea - I already mentioned that the downside of Black rushing his kingside pawns forward is that it can leave weaknesses, and h4 is our way of trying to create one of those weaknesses. We want to get the f4 outpost for our knight, so we trying to force Black to play ...g4 by challenging g5 with h4. }
6... g4
{ Black obliges and gives us the f4 outpost. As we saw after 6... Rg8, this is almost inevitable. }
7. Nc3 { Just developing - other moves are fine too. } 7... Bg7
{ Developing normally. } 8. Bc4
{ Another decent move here, and a thematic idea to keep in mind, is h5. This has the benefit of taking h5 away from the knight and cutting off support to the pawn on g4, while ensuring that if we get the knight to f4, we'll also have another outpost available on g6. Despite this, I slightly prefer 8. Bc4 here - we prioritise development and prevent Black from castling. }
8... Nh5 9. Nge2
{ I think it's important not to fear the ...Nxg3 exchange. We'll see in the next line how to deal with this - it's not dangerous at all. }
9... e6 10. Qd2
{ As is typical in this line, we want to long castle and then prepare the e4 break. Qd2 does a good job of preparing both of these things. }
10... a6 11. a3
{ Castling long immediately is fine too, but this is a useful prophylactic move to insert first - we rule out ...b5-b4, and also free up the a2 square as a retreat square for the bishop. }
11... Qf6 12. e4
{ With Black's queen on f6, the immediate e4 break is particularly strong since Nxe4 comes with tempo now. We will look to long castle over the next couple moves. White went on to win in the correspondence game 1-0  (63)  Crabb,N  (2314)  -Hugo,T  (2123)  ICCF email 2014 }

8. Bc4
{ I already mentioned in the previous line that there is no need to fear ...Nxg3 ! Even if we are 'forced' by Black to destroy our pawn structure with fxg3, this is still good for us. }
8... Nxg3
{ This certainly looks very tempting - destroying our pawn structure and grabbing the bishop pair. }
9. fxg3
{ The problem here for Black is that our pawn structure isn't nearly as bad as it might look at first glance. We get a semi-open f-file for our rook, the f4 outpost is stronger than ever and the e4 break is still on the cards later. Black has no way to take advantage of the defects in our pawn structure, and his bishop pair isn't useful yet as the position is relatively closed. }
9... c6
{ The engine suggests a Stonewall setup for Black - this doesn't look convincing to me at all though, but the alternatives look bleak as well. }
10. Nge2 d5 11. Bd3 e6 12. Nf4
{ White is doing a lot better here - even though Stockfish doesn't realise it at first, this evaluation is confirmed by Leela. Positionally, Black is struggling due to his bad bishop on c8, which will never have good prospects. Eventually, Black will be forced to part with either his dark bishop or knight or both, to get rid of our knights which have great outposts available on f4 and e5. This will leave the poor bishop on c8. The discrepancy between Stockfish and Leela in this position is amazing - most human players would think White is doing clearly better here, and this is backed up by Leela, but Stockfish thinks Black is at least equal. I analysed this deeper out of curiosity, but it's clear that Stockfish is completely wrong here - if you're interested in this sort of thing, I recommend exploring this position a bit yourself if you have the time and interest - it gives a good feel for the differences between the two strongest engines in the world. }

1. d4 f5
{ We'll be examining the 'pure Dutch' here, starting with 1... f5. The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }
2. Bg5
{ This is an incredibly popular recommendation for White in repertoire books, including in those of Kaufman and Schandorff. Its appeal is easy to understand - 2. Bg5 is forcing and quite disruptive. In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6.2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ...e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works here too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendation. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }
2... g6
{ The most popular move in this position and a very logical one. Of the three plans I mentioned that Black has in the Dutch - the Classical with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Stonewall with ...d5, ...e6 and ...c6, and the Leningrad with ...g6 - it is the Leningrad with ...g6 which seems to be the least affected by our disruptive 2. Bg5. Black intends to complete development with ...Bg7, ...Nf6, ...O-O etc. but as we shall see, we are going to throw a spanner in the works very soon with a timely h4-h5 pawn storm. }
3. Nc3
{ For now, we just develop. Don't worry too much about blocking the c-pawn in these lines - we often castle long, meaning our pawn is better on c2 where it provides cover for our king, and we are typically playing for the e4 and g4 pawn breaks. }
3... Nf6 { Black has no fear of Bxf6 here. } 4. h4
{ While Bxf6 is not a terrible move here, it's not quite as good as it is after 2... Nf6. The reason is that we have already committed to Nc3, blocking our c-pawn - after Bxf6 ...exf6, we would ideally want to control the centre and then open up the a2-g8 diagonal with c4, but obviously, this is difficult to achieve with a knight on c3. As a result, we revert to the usual plan against ...g6, which is to harass Black's kingside with h4-h5. }
4... Bg7 5. h5
{ In situations like this, where Black has completely disregarded what we've been doing and blindly plays ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bh7, h5 is particularly strong. This is played with the idea of a thematic exchange sacrifice after ... Nxh5 Rxh5, and if Black doesn't grab the material on offer he will be forced to play the shameful retreat ...Bf8 after we go h6. }
5... Nxh5
{ Greedy, but critical. White must be aware of how to follow-up here: } 6. Rxh5
{ Of course, we sacrifice the exchange. Even though we are down a pawn and the exchange for the moment, the compensation here is tremendous - Black's pawn structure is wrecked, his king is exposed and White is much more active. }
6... gxh5 7. Nd5
{ There are other good moves, but this is particularly strong - we are hitting e7. }
7... Nc6 8. e3 { Followed by Qxh5+ and/or Bb5, intending Bxc6 is crushing. } *

{ Without Black's knight on f6, our knight gets the d5 square - it is heading to f4 from which it can begin targeting the weakened g6 pawn. As we've already seen, the g6 pawn is a typical soft spot in these Leningrad setups once Black goes ...h6 and it's surprisingly difficult for him to defend. }

The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }
2. Bg5
{ This is an incredibly popular recommendation for White in repertoire books, including in those of Kaufman and Schandorff. Its appeal is easy to understand - 2. Bg5 is forcing and quite disruptive. In the Dutch, Black usually takes his pick from either the Classical Dutch, with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Leningrad Dutch with ...g6, ...Nf6 and ...Bg7 or the Stonewall Dutch with ... d5, ...e6 and ...c6.2. Bg5 disrupts all of these plans - Black can't play ...e6 since the queen on d8 would drop, and if Black plays ...Nf6 to prepare it we chop the knight and damage Black's pawn structure - this already makes the Stonewall and Classical Dutch plans difficult to carry out. This leaves the Leningrad Dutch, where Black intends to fianchetto his dark bishop with ...g6. However, we can throw a spanner in the works here too - we'll often be harassing Black's kingside with h4-h5, making it very difficult for the second player to get his desired setup. 2. Bg5 has many advantages, which is why it's such a popular recommendation. It's objectively strong, scores well practically and is disruptive as we've already discussed. Black has two main moves here: Black can try to take advantage of our dark bishop on g5 by kicking it around with 2... h6, or he can play 2... g6 in Leningrad Dutch style which is Black's most popular choice. }
2... g6
{ The most popular move in this position and a very logical one. Of the three plans I mentioned that Black has in the Dutch - the Classical with ...e6, ...Nf6 and ...Be7, the Stonewall with ...d5, ...e6 and ...c6, and the Leningrad with ...g6 - it is the Leningrad with ...g6 which seems to be the least affected by our disruptive 2. Bg5. Black intends to complete development with ...Bg7, ...Nf6, ...O-O etc. but as we shall see, we are going to throw a spanner in the works very soon with a timely h4-h5 pawn storm. }
3. Nc3
{ For now, we just develop. Don't worry too much about blocking the c-pawn in these lines - we often castle long, meaning our pawn is better on c2 where it provides cover for our king, and we are typically playing for the e4 and g4 pawn breaks. }
3... Bg7
{ The most common move and the most flexible way to get the pieces out. } 4. e3
{ Not the most common move - both 4. e4 and 4. h4 are more common - but I think it's a very strong one with a rather subtle point to it. We delay 4. h4 for the moment so that we can meet ...h6 with Bh4. We are in effect waiting for 4... Nf6 so that ...h6 later can be met by Bxf6. }
4... Nf6 5. h4
{ Now, with Black having committed to ... Nf6, it is the right time to launch our h-pawn down the board since ...h6 can be met by Bxf6. }
5... h6 { Forcing us to decide with the bishop. } 6. Bxf6
{ As I said already, this is the way we want to deal with ...h6 if there is a knight on f6. We don't want to retreat and give Black a chance to catch a breath - instead, we are playing quickly, forcefully and trying to develop an initiative. }
6... Bxf6 7. Qf3
{ Intending to play g4 later on. The queen is well-placed on f3 where it can support a kingside attack. We prevent Black from castling now due to the very strong h5 !. }
7... d6 8. Bc4
{ A good, active square for the bishop which also prevents Black from castling, }
8... e6 9. g4
{ This position was reached in the game 1/2-1/2  (33)  Teplyi, I  (2389)  -Kristiansen, J  (2411)  Aarhus 2015. White is doing clearly better here, but Black managed to hold. We intend to develop our initiative further with O-O-O and then Nge2-f4 next, targeting the weak g6 pawn. }

1. d4 e6
{ In the previous chapter, we examined the Dutch Defence, starting with 1... f5. We met the Dutch with 2. Bg5 ! - I hope you agree with me when I think that it's a very strong and irritating move for Black to face since it is so disruptive. Many Black players think the same things, which brings us to the topic of this chapter. By playing 1... e6, Black hopes to reach the Dutch without allowing the 2. Bg5 idea from the previous chapter. Black is able to reach a kind of Dutch in this chapter, but the most dangerous option that he has available, the Leningrad Dutch, is no longer possible since Black committed to ...e6 already instead of ...g6. As a result, 1... e6 is often played by players who are happy to go into either a Stonewall Dutch or a Classical Dutch setup. 1... e6 is a typical choice of Black players who are equally willing to play the French. If you are happy to play the French, be my guest and transpose with 2. e4 - however, I'm not much of an 1. e4 player, so I think it's better that we keep the game in 1. d4 waters. As a result, we will be opting for 2. c4. }
2. c4
{ Ensuring that the game won't transpose into the French Defence, as it would after 2. e4. While the bulk of this chapter will be covering the transposition into the Dutch Defence with 2... f5, we will also be looking at the other options Black has tried here on move 2. Among those, the only two independent tries are 2... b6, transposing to some version of the Owen's Defence I believe, and 2... Bb4+ which is unnamed to my knowledge - it's, in essence, an accelerated version of the Bogo-Indian. Other moves like 2... d5, 2... Nf6 and 2... c5 are covered elsewhere. }
2... f5
{ As mentioned before, this 1... e6 2... f5 line is a favourite weapon of Black players who want to get into a Stonewall or a Classical Dutch without allowing some of the extra, dangerous options that White has after the 1... f5 move order such as my recommendation of 2. Bg5.   2...c5  will transpose into some form of Benoni which will be covered in the second part of this course after  3.d5  This is dealt with in the second part of this 1. d4 course.   2...Nf6  leads straight into the Nimzo-Indian after  3.Nc3  This is going to be covered in great depth in the second part of this course, where I will offer two very different but equally good options for White, just like against the Slav.   2...d5  transposes straight into the Queen's Gambit Declined which we've already looked at after  3.Nc3   2...b6  This transposes to some kind of Owen's Defence. Black is looking to fianchetto his bishop on b7 and then fight for the vital e4 square with ...f5 and ...Nf6. Unfortunately for Black, he doesn't have any control over the e4 square for the time being, which is something we can take advantage of with our very simple next move.  3.e4  Since we have the chance to, there's no reason not to grab the whole centre. With our 3 pawns in the centre, we fully control the middle of the board and have a lot more space - Black is on the back foot already.  Bb7  Developing and hitting e4.   3...Bb4+  Black is combining the Owen's Defence with some kind of accelerated Bogo-Indian. This move is pretty logical - Black wants to trade pieces so that his space deficit is less noticeable.  4.Bd2  4. Nc3 Bb7 5. Bd3 f5 now isn't so bad for Black. I'd prefer to avoid this and play simply.  Bxd2+  5.Qxd2  d5  6.Bd3 !  I think this is a very important move to remember in this line. The most common choice is 6. cxd5, but Black actually scores better there than White ! We still have the option of playing cxd5 followed by e5, but we are first waiting for Black to do something, or make some kind of concession.  Nc6 !  This, the strongest move in the position, has been played 4 times - all 4 times it was played by a Rapport ! Twice by Richard Rapport, and twice by Jovana Rapport ! Black targets the d4 pawn which was left undefended after we played 6. Bd3.   6...Ba6  is Black's most common move here.  7.cxd5  Bxd3  8.Qxd3  exd5  9.e5  Ne7  10.f4  +=  Our extra space and control over the centre gives us a comfortable edge here. Space is particularly important when knights are on the board since it is a major determining factor whether the knights get a good square or not. We have good squares for our knights on f3 and c3, while it's not so clear where Black's knights are heading.  7.cxd5 !  All the games went 7. Ne2 after which Black got a decent position after ...dxe4.  exd5  8.exd5  Nce7  9.Bb5+  Provoking Black's bishop to d7, so that the queen's access to d5 is blocked.  Bd7  10.Bc4  With the bishop on d7, we drop our bishop back to support the d5 pawn.  Nf6  11.Nc3  O-O  12.Nf3  Bc8  Black needs to find a way to recoup the d5 pawn, but this does obviously lose some time.  13.O-O  Nexd5  14.Rac1  +=  Black's position is actually not that bad - especially considering his very unorthodox opening. However, White still does retain an edge for sure - our IQP isn't weak at all, and all our pieces are active with good prospects.  4.Bd3 !  It's important to defend the e4 pawn in this way because we don't want to allow the annoying pin after 4. Nc3 Bb4 !. Black can try to exploit the downside of 4. Bd3, which is that g2 is left unguarded, by playing 4... f5, but this backfires spectacularly as we shall see.  Bb4+   4...Nc6  Targeting the undefended d4 pawn, with the intention of following up with ...Nb4xd3 to get the bishop pair makes perfect sense.  5.Ne2  Nb4  6.O-O  We can't avoid ...Nxd3, so we simply castle.  Nxd3  7.Qxd3  Ne7  8.Nbc3  d6  9.d5  ±  Black's bishop pair is almost irrelevant in a position like this. What matters is our control of the centre and huge space advantage. The bishops aren't able to wreak havoc because the position is relatively closed and they have no space to manoeuvre. We can continue advancing more with f4-f5 next.   4...f5 ?!  This is very tempting, and it is actually Black's most popular move in this position, however, it is definitely a mistake. I imagine many Black players were freestyling at this point already and noticed that g2 was hanging so they decide to exploit this pin by ramping up the pressure on e4. However, the pin isn't as ironclad as it seems.  5.exf5 !  Concretely, things just don't work out for Black here - the weakness of the h5-e8 diagonal is much more important than whatever material Black might gain after ...Bxg2. Many Black players realise this at this point and try to bail with 5... Bb4+, which is a better try than the obvious 5... Bxg2, greedily grabbing the material.  Bb4+  Black tries to bail now and turn 4... f5 into a pawn sacrifice, but Black doesn't have nearly enough compensation.   5...Bxg2  I'm not going to analyse this line to death because I don't think it's worthwhile - I'll show you the mainline and then a sample game of how play might proceed. White scores well over 65% in my database and should already be objectively winning, assuming he plays decently.  6.Qh5+  The downside to grabbing the material - Black has no way to deal with the danger along the h5-e8 diagonal.  g6  7.fxg6  Bg7  8.gxh7+  Kf8  9.Bg5  White has tried some other moves here, but this is best.  Nf6  10.Qh4  Bxh1  We are down a rook for only a couple of pawns, but this is irrelevant - Black's king is virtually defenceless.  11.Ne2  The knight is going to hop into f4 most likely.  Nc6  12.Nd2  Covering the f3 square and preparing to trap the bishop with f3.  e5  13.f3  Trapping the bishop.  Qe7  14.O-O-O  exd4  15.Rxh1  +-  Black is only up an exchange for a pawn here, which isn't nearly enough material for the terrible situation Black's kingside is. White went on to win relatively easily in 1-0  (23)  Malek, D  (2415)  -Pakleza,Z  (2480)  Germany 2017  6.Kf1  Of course, now that Black has the f8 square available for the king, Qh5+ is no longer such a massive threat and ...Bxg2 is actually dangerous - meaning that it's best to just protect g2 now with our king. Black has prevented us from castling, but this is a very minor victory here since our king is perfectly safe and we can activate our rook with h4 and Rh3.  Nf6  7.a3  Booting the bishop away so we can develop our knight to c3.  Bd6  8.Nc3  O-O  9.h4 !  Intending Rh3 and Nf3.  Qe8  10.Rh3  The rook does a great job here of supporting the knight which will be developed to f3.  Nc6  11.Nf3  ±  Black is a pawn down and has zero compensation for it. We can pick up the bishop next with Nb5 maybe, or simply develop with Bg5, or rush our h-pawn forwards with h5 - there are too many good options.  5.Kf1 !  Once again, we see this idea. The king on f1 covers the g2 square, while the bishop on b4 is left to look stupid. Our king is perfectly safe on f1 and our big centre and space advantage give us a very good position.  Be7  6.Nc3  d6  7.Nf3  Nd7  8.Qe2  ±  Our big centre and space advantage give us a big advantage. The fact that we've lost castling privileges here is not so important, since our king is still perfectly safe.   2...Bb4+  I'm not aware of any name for this opening, but it isn't that bad - Black is playing a kind of accelerated Bogo-Indian, except one where he still has the option of play ...f5 since he hasn't played ...Nf6 yet.  3.Bd2  All three ways to block the check are viable, but this is my preference. 3. Nc3 was what I initially wanted to suggest, but Black isn't forced to transpose into the Nimzo-Indian with 3... Nf6 and can instead play 3... f5, 3... c5 or even 3... b6 - all of which score pretty well for Black.  a5  This is a logical and typical way to cover the bishop. We don't really want to take on b4 since Black then activates his rook and gets some irritating pressure on the a2 pawn.   3...Bxd2+  4.Qxd2  It's better to recapture with the queen I think - we want our knight on c3, not d2.  Nf6   4...f5  This Dutch-style move makes sense, but it is a little bit slow and allows us to take over the long diagonal with our next move.  5.g3  Nf6  6.Bg2  We are the first to get to the h1-a8 diagonal.  O-O  7.Nc3  d6  8.Nf3  Nc6  9.Rd1  Prophylaxis against ...e5.  Qe7  Preparing ...e5 once again.  10.O-O  e5  11.Nd5 !  This is a very important thematic counter to ...e5 to remember.  Nxd5  12.cxd5  Nxd4  13.Nxd4  exd4  14.Rc1  ±  No need to rush to grab the d4 pawn here. Black has two weak pawns here - namely d4 and c7, while we only have one, and as a result, we are better. We can win the pawn on d4 in a few moves time with something like Rc1-c4xd4 or Bf3 followed by Qxd4.  5.Nc3  d5  Black decides to switch to a QGD structure, but this favours us. We get a better version of the QGD positions from the earlier chapters where our queen is well-placed on d2 to support the eventual e3, f3 and e4 break.  6.e3  O-O  7.cxd5  exd5  8.Bd3  Re8  9.Nge2  Nbd7  10.O-O  +=  The position looks like a QGD Exchange Variation where Black has managed to exchange dark bishops, but we managed to get the Qd2 move in for free. We can take our pick now between the minority attack plan with b4-b5 or the central break with e4.   3...c5  This is another typical way to support the bishop, but I'm always a bit sceptical of its positional merits. After taking on b4, we get the whole centre for ourselves, and at the right time we can exchange the pawn on b4 with a3 as we shall see.  4.Bxb4  cxb4  5.Nf3  Nf6  6.e3  We have a big centre and easy development - the next few moves are very natural.  O-O  7.Be2  b6  8.O-O  Bb7  9.Nbd2  d6  10.Qb3  With all the standard developing moves taken care of, now we can set about exploiting this exposed pawn on b4. Black needs to find a way to defend it.  a5  This is the best way to cover the pawn since Black doesn't want to have his knight permanently tied to its defence.  11.a3 !  A very thematic idea which is useful to remember - we attack before, encouraging Black to take on a3 so we open up the b-file which we can use to attack the backward b6 pawn.  bxa3  12.bxa3  +=  With good play against the backward b6 pawn.   3...Qe7  This is a very flexible move and a standard way to cover the bishop in the normal Bogo-Indian. Here it is also popular - it's the second most common move just behind 3... a5.  4.Nc3  Black will have little choice but to give up the bishop pair in short order.  Nf6  5.e3  We reach a position reminiscent of the 4. e3 Nimzo which I'll cover in the second part of this course as a backup weapon, except a very good version of it because Black's ...Qe7 makes very little sense in this position.  Bxc3  6.Bxc3  Ne4  Black wants the bishop pair back, but this whole exchanging manoeuvre takes time, which allows us to develop and build up a pleasant edge in the meanwhile.  7.Ne2  We don't want to allow our c-pawns to be doubled and instead want to recapture on c3 with our knight.  b6  8.f3  Booting Black's knight away and blunting the a8-h1 diagonal which Black's light bishop will soon be occupying.  Nxc3  9.Nxc3  +=  We have a pleasant edge here thanks to our space advantage and control over the centre. Black's ...Qe7 makes little sense in this structure.  4.a3 !  Very rare, but a simple and good way to play.  Bxd2+  5.Qxd2  Nf6   5...f5  This Dutch-style move is less common than 5... Nf5, which we cover next.  6.Nc3  Nf6  7.e3  O-O  8.Bd3  b6  9.O-O-O !  ±  The natural 9. Nge2 is fine too, but I like long castling here. We have a lead in development and control over the centre which gives us a good foundation to castle on opposite sides and maybe launch a kingside attack in the long-term. Next on the agenda is to play f3, and then either prepare the e4 break or maybe even the g4 break.  6.Nc3  d6  6... d5, in QGD style, is actually very rare here, even though it's not such a bad way to play. Play would proceed similarly there to the line after 3... Bxd2+, except with the inclusion of ...a5 and a3. However, most players who play this whole line enjoy their Bogo-Indian structures, which are characterised by ...d6 and ...e5.  7.Nf3  Preventing Black's ...e5 for now.  O-O  8.e4  Grabbing the whole centre.  Nc6  9.Rd1  Prophylaxis against ...e5 once again.  Qe7  Now Black is finally ready to play ...e5.  10.Be2  e5  11.dxe5  Nxe5  12.Nd4  +=  I like White, who has a space advantage and can hop into d5 with his knight whenever he pleases. I think we have a healthy advantage here. }
3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3
{ An important branching point for this chapter. This is the stage where Black has to decide which setup he intends to adopt - a Stonewall setup with 4... d5, a Classical Dutch setup with 4... Be7 or an interesting Nimzo-Dutch hybrid with 4... Bb4. }
4... Bb4
{ This is Black's most popular move here and also the favoured choice of top players. It even got an outing from Carlsen who used it to win a rapid game against Aronian in 2016. Black's play is very logical - he is devoting all of his efforts to win the battle for the vital e4 square, with the knight on f6, pawn on f5 and bishop on b4 all doing their part. The downside to playing 4... Bb4 is that the bishop is effectively a goner - Black will at some point in the future be forced to take on c3 most likely, which could leave White with the bishop pair.   4...d5  Heading for a Stonewall, but quite a bad version of it for Black.  5.Bf4  The difference is that our bishop is now outside the pawn chain. This means that we have one more piece fighting for control over the e5 square. The simple plan that I've followed in these positions is to land a minor piece on e5 - ideally one knight, supported by the other knight - and then cement it on e5 by playing f4. Inevitably, Black will probably take on e5 after which we can recapture on e5 with either the d-pawn - which would give us the d4-outpost - or the f-pawn in certain situations. When the time is right, we'll also capture Black's knight which lands on e4. The long-term strategic goal of White's here is to end up in a position where Black is left with his bad bishop on c8 against our good knight. As long as you follow this plan or general positional principles, you should fare very well here. Black often relies on some sort of kingside counterattack to get play, but this comes across as speculative at best to me. Let's have a look at a possible line here:  c6  6.e3  Be7  7.Bd3  O-O  8.h3  Freeing up the h2 retreat square for our bishop.  Ne4  9.O-O  Nd7  10.Rc1  g5  11.Bh2  Qe8  12.Ne2  A standard manoeuvre for the knight - it often goes Nc3-e2-f4-d3-e5, but here it is just doing a good job of covering the f4 square.  Qg6  13.Ne5  Nxe5  14.Bxe5  ±  Possibly followed by f4 to secure the bishop on e5 and make sure that our king is safe. As you can see, as long as White plays decently, Black's kingside attack never really gets going and Black struggles in the long term positionally.   4...Be7  is a better and more flexible way to play than the immediate 4... d5. Black can still go for a Stonewall now, but he has alternatives too.  5.Bf4  Relatively rarer than 5. e3 and 5. g3, but I think it's a simple and good way to play that synergises well with what I recommended in the previous line against the Stonewall.  O-O  6.e3  d6  Black is aiming for the thematic ...e5 break, but this is a lot harder to carry out with our bishop on f4.   6...b6  Intending to fianchetto the bishop in order to aid the fight for the e4 square.  7.Be2  Bb7  8.O-O  Ne4  9.Nxe4  Bxe4  10.h3  Making the h2 retreat square available for our bishop - ...g5 was threatened.  d6  11.Nd2  Bb7  12.b4  +=  12. Bf3 is a common idea here, but I don't think this has to be rushed. Instead, we can grab space on the queenside with 12. b5 with a pleasant edge.  7.Be2  Qe8  8.O-O  Nc6  9.c5 !  Ramping up pressure against d6 - this is made possible by Black's ...Qe8. d5 is on the way too if Black isn't careful.  dxc5  10.Bxc7  ±  White's doing better here because of his active pieces and better pawn structure. If Black's pawn wasn't on f5 and was on f7 instead, Black might be a bit closer to equality as then the e6 pawn wouldn't be so weak and exposed. }
5. Qb3
{ I think this is the best counter - we attack Black's bishop and prepare to recapture on c3 with our queen once Black goes ...Bxc3+. }
5... Qe7
{ This is slightly more common than the other way to defend b4 with 5... a5.   5...a5  is a common way to cover the bishop. The advancing a-pawn has the advantage that Black can meet our a3 with ...a4 after the bishop is exchanged, which cramps our queenside and makes it difficult to expand on that side of the board without leaving ourselves with an isolated a-pawn.  6.g3  b6  7.Bg2  Bb7  8.O-O  Bxc3 !  This is best now. Otherwise, we had 9. Nb5 which is still quite strong here, even though Black played ...a5 instead of ...Qe7.  9.Qxc3  O-O  10.b3  Preparing to get the last minor piece into the game via b2.  d6  11.Bb2  +=  We have the bishop pair, and even though Black is certainly solid here, White is definitely to be preferred. }
6. Bg5 O-O 7. e3
{ In this line I prefer not to fianchetto for concrete reasons. The reason is apparent on move 9 - Black is somewhat forced to play ...Bxc3 since we threaten the very strong Nb5, which isn't as effective in the line with 5... a5. }
7... b6 8. Be2 Bb7 9. O-O { White now threatens the very strong Nb5. } 9...
Bxc3
{ Black deals with the 9. Nb5 threat by chopping our knight.   9...Nc6  Black's idea is to meet 10. Nb5 with ... a6, when things become murky after we grab the pawn on c7 and then struggle to extract our knight from behind enemy lines. White should still be better there, but I prefer our next move:  10.d5 !  Nd8  11.Rad1  ±  Supporting d5 with a very pleasant edge thanks to our space and active pieces. }
10. Qxc3 h6
{ Black immediately recovers the bishop pair which he just surrendered.   10...d6  This is the most common move here, but we have a very thematic break at our disposal now:  11.c5 !  ±  Either way, Black needs to make a concession now - either we will be opening up the c-file to our advantage, or Black can grab the pawn temporarily but destroy his pawn structure. It's a difficult choice to make, and White's doing very well here. }
11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Rac1
{ The rook is well-placed here in preparation for the centre opening up. }
12... Nc6 13. d5
{ Another important break to remember - always be on the lookout and try to prepare either the d5 or the c5 break in these structures. 13. c5 is also a decent move here actually, but 13. d5 is very strong - we simply want to open up lines in the centre for our rooks, as well as get d4 in the future for our knight. }
13... Qxc3 14. Rxc3 Ne7 15. dxe6 dxe6 16. c5
{ Continuing with the plan of opening up the c-file. White has a pleasant edge here thanks to his well-placed pieces and Black's weaknesses - most notably, the e6 pawn and the c7 pawn are targets. White went on to convert in 1-0  (45)  Bartel, M  (2569)  -Rendle, T  (2382)  Calvia 2006 }

1. d4 e6
{ In the previous chapter, we examined the Dutch Defence, starting with 1... f5. We met the Dutch with 2. Bg5 ! - I hope you agree with me when I think that it's a very strong and irritating move for Black to face since it is so disruptive. Many Black players think the same things, which brings us to the topic of this chapter. By playing 1... e6, Black hopes to reach the Dutch without allowing the 2. Bg5 idea from the previous chapter.

{ The difference is that our bishop is now outside the pawn chain. This means that we have one more piece fighting for control over the e5 square. The simple plan that I've followed in these positions is to land a minor piece on e5 - ideally one knight, supported by the other knight - and then cement it on e5 by playing f4. Inevitably, Black will probably take on e5 after which we can recapture on e5 with either the d-pawn - which would give us the d4-outpost - or the f-pawn in certain situations. When the time is right, we'll also capture Black's knight which lands on e4. The long-term strategic goal of White's here is to end up in a position where Black is left with his bad bishop on c8 against our good knight. As long as you follow this plan or general positional principles, you should fare very well here. Black often relies on some sort of kingside counterattack to get play, but this comes across as speculative at best to me. Let's have a look at a possible line here: }

12... Qg6 13. Ne5 Nxe5 14. Bxe5
{ Possibly followed by f4 to secure the bishop on e5 and make sure that our king is safe. As you can see, as long as White plays decently, Black's kingside attack never really gets going and Black struggles in the long term positionally. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4
{ In this chapter, we will be dealing with all of the miscellaneous 1... d5 defences Black has at his disposal. That is, everything after 1... d5 that we haven't already covered - this includes the Chigorin with 2... Nc6, the Albin Countergambit with 2... e5, the Baltic Defence with 2... Bf5 and the Symmetrical Defence with 2... c5. These are all rarer than everything we've covered beforehand, which is why I grouped them into a single chapter. Most of the lines here are also not 100% correct, meaning that White should be able to get a slight edge at the very least in a few ways in this chapter. The most serious option for Black here is the Chigorin, which isn't so bad but White should get a comfortable edge regardless. }
2... Nc6
{ The Chigorin Defence. Of all the openings covered in this chapter, this is the most decent one and it's almost worthy of its own chapter - White has a few ways to get an edge, but Black isn't doing too badly. Black violates two opening guidelines in exchange for trying to get quick development/piece play and pressure against our centre: he doesn't support the d5 pawn and he blocks his c-pawn. This second fact is quite important since the c-pawn is often instrumental in Black's counterplay in many Queen's Gambit openings. I spent a while analysing different options against the Chigorin before settling on my choice. 3. Nc3 and 3. Nf3 are the two most popular moves, but both of these lead to unusual positions which are surprisingly complex. I was looking for a simple line which could get us a pleasant edge without allowing anything to bizarre, and I think I found the ideal solution in the form of 3. cxd5.   2...Nf6  I was very surprised to see how popular this move is. In fact, I wasn't even intending to cover because it is plain bad until I saw how many players play like this ! As far as I know, it is called the Marshall Defence, but unlike the other opening named after Marshall after 1. e4 e5, this one isn't particularly great. The problem is that after 3. cxd5 Black loses time irrespective of which piece he recaptures the pawn with.  3.cxd5  Black has a difficult choice to make already. Whether he recaptures the pawn with the knight or the queen, he will lose time due to either e4 against ...Nxd5 or Nc3 against ...Qxd5.  Qxd5  The queen is exposed on d5, much like in the Scandinavian, and this allows us to gain time with 3. Nc3.   3...g6  Black tries to transpose into the Grunfeld, but of course we shouldn't allow this by playing 4. Nc3 Nxd5 - we have better options, and moreover I don't recommend the Exchange Grunfeld for White in the second part of the course.  4.Qa4+ !  We intend to make the recapture of the d5 pawn as difficult as possible - we first do this by provoking Black's light bishop to d7 where it gets in the way of the queen which attached d5.  Bd7  5.Qb3  Defending d5.  c6  Black sacrifices the pawn since he can't regain it, and otherwise the d5 pawn makes it very difficult for Black to develop.  6.dxc6  Nxc6  7.Nf3  ±  We are simply a pawn up and Black has no compensation realistically-speaking.   3...Nxd5  The knight is exposed to e4 now, controlling the centre and kicking the knight back with tempo, however 4. e4 shouldn't be rushed...  4.Nf3  The immediate 4. e4 is also good for White, but not as good on account of 4... Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 !. With 4. Nf3, we are preventing ... e5 before kicking Black back with e4.  e6  5.e4  Nb6  6.Nc3  Be7  7.Be3  O-O  8.Be2  ±  White is clearly better of course, due to his lead in development, massive centre, space advantage etc.  4.Nc3  I will examine two possible retreat squares here - d8 and a5. White gets a clear advantage after both of them.  Qd8  The queen is safer, but more passive on d8 and we are free to claim the whole centre for ourselves.   4...Qa5  The queen is more exposed on a5, but it does prevent e4 for the time being by pinning our knight.  5.Bd2  Unpinning our knight and intending e4 next.  c6  6.e4  Qb6  Hitting d4 and b2, but Black really shouldn't try to go pawn-grabbing when he is so underdeveloped.  7.Nf3  Bg4  8.Qa4  Unpinning the knight and covering d4.  Bxf3  9.gxf3  ±  White is clearly better once again due to his big centre, space advantage and bishop pair.  5.Nf3  e6  6.e4  Be7  7.Bd3  O-O  8.O-O  b6  9.Qe2  ±  Once again, White's clearly better here.   2...c5  The Symmetrical Defence is not actually as bad as it might seem. I was surprised a few years ago to find out that this is even reasonably playable. Black is trying to force equality ASAP by liquidating the entire centre. White is of course better here since he is a tempo up, but there isn't anything close to a clearcut refutation of 2... c5.  3.cxd5  Qxd5   3...Nf6  Black prioritises development over the d5 pawn for the moment.  4.e4 !  Only White's third most common move, but I think the best one. We cover the d5 pawn, forcing Black's knight to take on e4. In the meantime, we manage to support our d5 pawn and develop quickly, as we shall see.  Nxe4  5.dxc5  Nxc5   5...Qa5+  doesn't go anywhere after  6.Bd2  Nxd2  7.Qxd2  ±  Either White keeps his pawn or Black's queen becomes horribly exposed on c5 - White is better in both cases.  6.Nc3  e5  Black needs to find a way to develop his kingside.  7.Nf3  Bd6  8.Be2  ±  White's advantage here is thanks to the strong passed d-pawn, space advantage and well-developed pieces.  4.Nf3  Developing and intending to follow up with Nc3 to boot Black's queen away.  cxd4  5.Nc3  Qa5  Black's queen is active on a5, but also a bit exposed.   5...Qd8  is a bit passive.  6.Qxd4  We head into an endgame where our more active pieces give us a big advantage.  Qxd4  7.Nxd4  Nf6  8.Ndb5  Na6  9.g3  ±  White's more active pieces and pressure on the queenside give him a decisive advantage.  6.Nxd4  Nf6  7.Nb3  Harrassing Black's queen.  Qc7  8.e4  There are other plans here, like 8. g3, which are also good.  Nc6  9.Bb5  e6  10.O-O  Bd7  11.Be3  +=  Even though the pawn structure is symmetrical, White has a pleasant edge here due to the difference in piece active - in particular, Black's bishop is stuck inside the pawn chain on d7. Additionally, we have a space advantage here due to the pawn on e4 vs the pawn on e6.   2...Bf5  The Baltic Defence. Black's idea, if allowed, is to play an "improved QGD" after 3... e6 if allowed, where his bishop will be active on f5 instead of passive on c8, stuck inside the pawn chain. The downside to this is of course that the support for the d5 pawn is lacking, and nothing prevents us from playing 3. cxd5 right now.  3.cxd5  This must be critical of course. Black's queen will be forced to recapture on d5 where it is exposed to Nc3.  Bxb1 !  One of the chief ideas behind the Baltic Defence is to remove the knight on b1 so that Black can leave his queen on d5 without worrying about Nc3. However, the bishop pair is the bishop pair.. .  4.Rxb1  4. Qa4+ is more popular, but I prefer this on account of our next move.  Qxd5  5.Nf3 !  This move is relatively rare, but very strong. We simply offer the a2 pawn as a sacrifice and continue developing.  Qxa2  Grabbing the pawn must be critical of course.   5...Nc6  Black ignores the a2 pawn and hopes to crack open the centre, Chigorin-style, with ...e5.  6.e3  O-O-O  7.b4  We launch our b-pawn down the board to claim some space and harrass Black's knight.  e5  8.b5  Bb4+  9.Nd2  Bxd2+  10.Bxd2  Nce7  11.dxe5  Qxe5  12.Qc2  ±  White's bishop pair and looming queenside attack give him a clear advantage.  6.Bd2  Defending the rook and threatening to grab the whole centre now with e4.  Qd5  7.Rc1  Keeping up the pressure on Black by attacking c7.  c6  8.e4 !  Another very strong move, sacrificing yet another pawn ! We drag Black's queen further into the centre and clear the diagonal so that we can develop our light bishop.  Qxe4+  9.Be2  Nd7  10.O-O  +-  White's initiative is already decisive here. He has managed to fully develop and castle, while Black has only managed to get one minor piece out - and moreover, his queen is still horribly exposed on e4. Next, we can develop our initiative with Re1, Qb3, Ne5 etc. White won easily in the correspondence game 1-0  (19)  Voveris,G  (2240)  -Kokorin,V  (2161)  ICCF email 2015   2...e6  You must be wondering: but we've covered this already ?! Yes, almost, but not entirely ! We still need to deal with one small gambit that Black has at his disposal.  3.Nc3  c5  4.cxd5  Up until now, this has all been covered in the chapter on the Tarrasch.  cxd4  The Von Hennig-Schara Gambit.  5.Qa4+  Bd7  6.Qxd4  exd5  7.Qxd5  Black has sacrificed the pawn in the hope of getting quick development and play against our exposed queen.  Nc6   7...Nf6  8.Qb3  Nc6  9.Nf3  transposes to 7... Nc6.  8.Nf3  Nf6  9.Qb3  9. Qd1 is a popular alternative.  Bc5   9...Be6  10.Qc2  Rc8  11.e3  Bd6  12.Be2  O-O  13.O-O  ±  Black's pieces are all relatively well-placed, but White has no weaknesses and is simply a pawn up and as a result is clearly better.  10.Bg5  10. e3 is fine too.  h6  11.Bxf6  Qxf6  12.e3  ±  Again, we are just a pawn up here. Black's bishop pair counts for something, but it's not nearly enough for equality.   2...e5  The Albin Countergambit. Black sacrifices the e5 pawn in order to get a thorn on d4 which is a little bit annoying since it cramps our centre and kingside - however, we are still a pawn up. Often, Black will either try to regain the e5 pawn later with ...Nc6 and ...Nge7-g6, or start some kind of kingside attack. We will look to return the pawn at the right time with a pleasant positional advantage.  3.dxe5  d4  The d4 pawn does a good job of restricting our knight from coming to c3 and making e3 difficult.  4.Nf3  Nc6  The real start of the Albin Countergambit. There are a few typical ideas you should try to remember here: - a3, to prepare b4 and Bb2. - Nbd2, just developing and possibly intending Nb3 to attack d4. - g3 intending to fianchetto our light bishop and castle. These ideas can be played in virtually any order. If you remember them, the Albin shouldn't pose you any problems - often Black can mix up his move order here or try different, wacky ideas, but if you remember White's setup everything should turn out just fine.   4...c5 ?!  This is inaccurate.  5.e3  The point is that now Black doesn't have his thematic riposte to e3 available which is ...Bb4+ since the c5 pawn is in the way.  Nc6  6.exd4  cxd4  7.Bd3  Bg4  8.O-O  ±  We are simply a clean pawn up here, and are objectively winning already.  5.Nbd2  A flexible move, developing the knight to its second-best square now that c3 is no longer available.  Bg4   5...Be6  6.a3  Preparing b4.  Nge7  A typical maneuver from Black, intending ...Ng8-e7-g6xe5.  7.b4  Ng6  8.Bb2  Qd7  9.b5  Removing a defender of d4.  Ncxe5  10.Nxd4  Bxc4  11.Qa4  Be6  12.e3  ±  We have returned our extra pawn, but retain a clear advantage due to our more active pieces. Next we can pick up the bishop pair with Nxe6.   5...f6  Black decides to sacrifice the pawn permanently, but this is very suspect.  6.exf6  Nxf6  7.g3  The usual way to unravel our kingside.  Bg4  8.Bg2  Qd7  9.O-O  O-O-O  Black is intending to whip up a kingside attack quickly with ...h5-h4 but this shouldn't really go anywhere if White is careful.  10.a3  h5  11.h4  ±  A simple way to halt Black's kingside attack. We're a pawn up and clearly better here.   5...Nge7  The knight is either going to f5, supporting d4, or g6 with the intention of grabbing e5.  6.Nb3  We counter with our own knight maneuver, attacking d4.  Nf5  Protecting d4.   6...Ng6  7.Nbxd4  Grabbing the pawn on offer.  Ngxe5  8.Nxc6  Qxd1+  9.Kxd1  Nxc6  10.Bd2  ±  Intending Bc3 next, where the bishop is very well-placed. We're simply a pawn up in this endgame. Black can try to claim some compensation maybe based on our centralised king, but we'll just tuck it away on c2 after which Black doesn't have nearly enough for the pawn.  7.e4 !  A thematic idea to remember which works very well concretely here since we've played Nb3 and Black's knight is on f5.  dxe3  8.Qxd8+  Nxd8  9.fxe3  Bb4+  10.Kf2  ±  Our double e-pawns might not look like much, but in fact they're very strong here since Black has no way to win them and they do a great job of taking squares away from Black's minor pieces.  6.a3  Preparing b4 and Bb2 to attack d4.  Qe7  Attacking e5 and preparing to castle long.   6...Nge7  The same old idea we've already seen.  7.h3  Bxf3  8.Nxf3  Ng6  9.e3  dxe3  10.Bxe3  Ngxe5  11.Nxe5  Nxe5  12.Qb3  ±  Material is equal, but we're already objectively winning. We have the bishop pair, but moreover Black's queenside is falling apart - we threaten Qxb7 and Qb5+.   6...Qd7  Intending to quickly long castle and then attack our kingside.  7.h3  Bh5  8.b4  The b-pawn serves two purposes: we can now develop with Bb2, and b5 is a very strong idea in many cases.  O-O-O  9.b5  Booting the knight off its perch.  Na5  10.g3  ±  Followed by Bg2, O-O, Qa4 etc. with a great position.   6...a5  This makes sense in order to prevent our b4 idea, but the inclusion of a3 and ...a5 benefits White since it's now very dangerous for Black to castle long, which is one of his main ideas. We now just revert to unravelling our kingside with g3 and Bg2:  7.h3  Bh5  8.g3  Bc5  9.Bg2  Nge7  10.O-O  ±  We've managed to unravel our kingside and castle. Next we can consider playing Nb3 or Ne4, followed by developing our dark bishop.  7.h3  Bh5   7...Bxf3  is not dangerous at all, since now our dark bishop enters the game.  8.Nxf3  O-O-O  9.Bg5  f6  10.exf6  gxf6  11.Bh4  ±  We're up a clean pawn and have the bishop pair to boot.  8.g4  This looks a bit risky, but it isn't really. Black's kingside attack is a very long way off.  Bg6  9.Bg2  O-O-O  10.b4  Once again intending Bb2 and b5.  Nxe5  11.O-O  ±  Black's d4 pawn is very weak after we play Bb2, and so is his king after Qa4. Black's queenside is in far more danger than our kingside. }
3. cxd5
{ This is rarer than the two main moves, 3. Nf3 and 3. Nc3, but I think it is a very simple and strong way to defuse the Chigorin Defence - especially when played in conjunction with my recommendation of 6. a3 !. }
3... Qxd5 4. e3
{ Supporting d4 and threatening to boot Black's queen away from centre with 3. Nc3 next. }
4... e5 { Black attacks our centre and gets ready to develop his dark bishop. }
5. Nc3 Bb4 6. a3
{ The most popular move is 6. Bd2, but this is simpler I think and at least as strong - probably stronger. We force ...Bxc3+, gaining the bishop pair, and use our b-pawn to support the d4 pawn. This can lead to similar positions to 6. Bd2, but leaving the bishop on c1 has some perks - most notably, after 8... Qd6 in the mainline, we have the idea of harassing Black's queen with a4 and Ba3, which isn't possible if the bishop is on d2 instead. }
6... Bxc3+ 7. bxc3
{ Now our idea is to expand in the centre with tempo by playing c4 followed by d5, kicking away Black's queen and knight respectively. We should be better here due to our extra space and bishop pair after that. }
7... Nf6
{ 7...exd4  Black prevents our idea of c4 d5, but this doesn't solve his problems at all...  8.cxd4  Nf6  9.Ne2 !  A rare but strong move with the simple idea of attack Black's queen with Nc3. The knight is better on c3 than it would have been on f3.  Bf5  10.Nc3  Qd6  11.Be2  O-O  12.O-O  +=  White has a pleasant edge thanks to his control over the centre and bishop pair. Next, White can look to play down the b-file with Qb3 or to expand in the centre later on starting with f3. }
8. c4 Qd6
{ This is the more natural square for the queen, but I think d8 might be marginally better since the queen isn't exposed to a4 Ba3 there.   8...Qd8  The better square for the queen since it isn't exposed to a4 Ba3 here, however d8 also has a downside - after we play d5, the e5 pawn is left undefended.  9.d5  Ne7  10.Bb2  c6  11.Bxe5  +=  This position was reached in 1-0  (22)  Sjugirov,S  (2652)  -Kotronias,V  (2529)  Moscow 2018 where White went on to win very quickly. }
9. d5 { Gaining space and evicting Black's knight. } 9... Ne7 10. a4
{ An important idea to remember - we want to activate our dark bishop with Ba3 next. }
10... Qb4+
{ Black provokes our bishop to d2, so that it can't go Ba3 on the next move.   10...Nd7  is of course bad, since we can execute our idea:  11.Ba3  Nc5  This pin on the knight is incredibly annoying for Black.  12.Ne2  The knight is heading to c3, after which it can go to b5 maybe.  f5  13.Nc3  ±  White is clearly better here due to the bishop pair and the irritating pin on the knight, as well as a big space advantage. }
11. Bd2 Qd6
{ Black is effectively offering a draw here, but it's his best objective try. Of course we don't have to repeat here with 12. Nf3, but instead we can just play }
12. Nf3
{ Now our plan is to play Bc1-a3 once again, except this time we can meet the annoying ...Qb4+ with Nd2. }
12... O-O 13. Bc1 Nd7 14. Ba3
{ White is clearly better once again thanks to the usual factors - bishop pair, space and the monstrous bishop on a3. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4
{ In this chapter, we will be dealing with all of the miscellaneous 1... d5 defences Black has at his disposal. That is, everything after 1... d5 that we haven't already covered - this includes the Chigorin with 2... Nc6, the Albin Countergambit with 2... e5, the Baltic Defence with 2... Bf5 and the Symmetrical Defence with 2... c5. These are all rarer than everything we've covered beforehand, which is why I grouped them into a single chapter. Most of the lines here are also not 100% correct, meaning that White should be able to get a slight edge at the very least in a few ways in this chapter. The most serious option for Black here is the Chigorin, which isn't so bad but White should get a comfortable edge regardless. }
2... e5
{ The Albin Countergambit. Black sacrifices the e5 pawn in order to get a thorn on d4 which is a little bit annoying since it cramps our centre and kingside - however, we are still a pawn up. Often, Black will either try to regain the e5 pawn later with ...Nc6 and ...Nge7-g6, or start some kind of kingside attack. We will look to return the pawn at the right time with a pleasant positional advantage. }
3. dxe5 d4
{ The d4 pawn does a good job of restricting our knight from coming to c3 and making e3 difficult. }
4. Nf3 Nc6
{ The real start of the Albin Countergambit. There are a few typical ideas you should try to remember here: - a3, to prepare b4 and Bb2. - Nbd2, just developing and possibly intending Nb3 to attack d4. - g3 intending to fianchetto our light bishop and castle. These ideas can be played in virtually any order. If you remember them, the Albin shouldn't pose you any problems - often Black can mix up his move order here or try different, wacky ideas, but if you remember White's setup everything should turn out just fine. }
5. Nbd2
{ A flexible move, developing the knight to its second-best square now that c3 is no longer available. }
5... Bg4 6. a3 { Preparing b4 and Bb2 to attack d4. } 6... a5
{ This makes sense in order to prevent our b4 idea, but the inclusion of a3 and ...a5 benefits White since it's now very dangerous for Black to castle long, which is one of his main ideas. We now just revert to unravelling our kingside with g3 and Bg2: }

1. d4
{ In this chapter I will deal with everything that hasn't been covered so far. I'll either cover the very minor first moves that White has available, or direct you to where it will be covered, like in an earlier chapter or in the second part of this 1.d4 course. The minor moves in this chapter are minor for a reason - they aren't particularly good. Typically they surrender the centre with little intention of fighting over it in the short term. This means that you can pretty much handle most of these lines with simple, natural moves, and multiple lines should lead to a healthy edge for White - just play e4, control the centre, develop your pieces, castle, etc. }
1... b6
{ The Owen's Defence - almost a "hyper-hyper-accelerated" Queen's Indian. Black's bishop on b7 intends to put pressure on our b7 pawn.   1...d6  is a very flexible move, but one which has much more to do with the Old Indian and Modern/Pirc defences which will be covered in the second part of this 1.d4 course.  2.e4  reaching a position which will be dealt with in the second part of this course.   1...g6  This is also closely related to the Modern/Pirc defences as well as the King's Indian. We'll be dealing with this in the second part of the course after  2.e4   1...c5  This is also covered in the second part of the course after  2.d5  This will lead to one of the Benonis which are covered in-depth in the second part of the course.   1...c6  In the vast majority of cases, this is played with the intention of playing 2...d5 next to transpose to either the Slav or the Caro-Kann, depending on White's response.  2.c4  Avoid playing 2. e4 here of course, since after 2...d5 we would reach the Caro-Kann and that would take us out of our repertoire.  d5  transposing to the Slav.  3.Nc3  Or 3.cxd5, which leads to the Exchange Slav.   1...Nf6  This, the most popular first move, makes up the bulk of the second part of the course. It's a very flexible and strong move which can lead to a variety of openings - the Nimzo-Indian, King's Indian, Grunfeld, various Benonis, the Old Indian, and even the Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav by transposition.  2.c4  This position, leading to a variety of Indian defences, is what will be covered in great depth in the second part of the course.   1...Nc6  This is a very provocative move akin to the Alekhine Defence, but it isn't too great. The "Black Knight's Tango" with 1...Nf6 2...Nc6 is a better version of a similar idea, but even that is objectively pretty bad.  2.d5  Of course we kick Black's knight around, seeing as Black did give us the chance to.  Ne5  3.f4  Continuing to kick the knight around and grab space in the centre.  Ng6  4.e4  We have a huge space advantage and complete control over the centre. Black's argument is that the centre is overextended, but I don't think this holds water.  e5  Black needs to get some foothold in the centre - otherwise he was simply going to get run over.  5.dxe6  Black has a tough choice to make here - how to recapture the e6 pawn.  fxe6   5...dxe6  This leads to an endgame but one where White is clearly better.  6.Qxd8+  Kxd8  7.Nf3  Bc5  8.Bd3  ±  White was clearly better in this endgame thanks to his space advantage and central control, as well as Black's king being stuck in the centre. One of Black's main problems here is that he can't find good squares for his knights due to the cramped nature of his position. White went on to win in 1-0  (44)  Volkov,S  (2557)  -Vlasenko,M  (2430)  St Petersburg 2019  6.Nc3  Bc5  7.Nf3  We simply develop both our knight. Now our idea, if allowed, is to kick Black's knight on g6 away by playing h4-h5.  Nf6  This is directed against h4-h5, since ...Ng4 becomes very stong then. Instead, we play  8.e5 !  Ng4  9.Ne4  ±  Our dark squares might look weak, but everything is actually full under control thanks to the knight on e4. Next we can play g3 or h3 and just unravel with a decisive advantage.   1...e5  This is known as the Englund Gambit, but besides one little trap that it contains, there is very little to it.  2.dxe5  Nc6  3.Nf3  Just defending the pawn.  Qe7  4.Nc3  The trap is after 4.Bf4 Qb4+ 5.Bd2 Qxb2 6.Bc3? Bb4. Barely anyone falls for this though. It's much simpler to just give back the e5 pawn and enjoy a far better position.  Nxe5  5.Bf4  This is a pretty rare response, but it's very strong and it makes perfect sense to me. We develop quickly, attack the knight on e5 and intend to follow up with Qd2 and 0-0-0.  Nxf3+  6.gxf3  The damaged pawn structure on the kingside doesn't matter since we will be long castling anyway.  c6  7.Qd2  d5  8.O-O-O  ±  White has a clear advantage due to his huge lead in development.   1...b5  I believe this is called the Polish Defence. Black is obviously looking to fianchetto his bishop on b7, just like in the Owen's Defence with 1...b6. There are some differences with the pawn on b5 though - Black prevents us from playing c4, which is in his favour of course - but the major downside is that the pawn on b5 is exposed. We can exploit this by attacking the b5 pawn with our light bishop or by playing a4.  2.e4  Grabbing the centre and attacking the b5 pawn.  Bb7  Black counterattaks our e4 pawn.  3.Nd2  This is the most logical way to defend e4 in my view. Our e4 pawn is more valuable than the b5 pawn since it is a central pawn. The knight on d2 isn't exposed to ...b4 like it would be after 3.Nc3.  a6  4.a4  This is the second most common move but it makes perfect sense - we attack b5, encouraging the b-pawn to advane which gives us access to the c4 square.  b4  5.Ngf3  e6  6.Bd3  We simply develop.  c5  7.O-O  cxd4  8.Nxd4  ±  White is simply clearly better thanks to his huge lead in development, control of the centre and space advantage.   1...a6  I wasn't aware of this until I researched it, but 1... a6 does have a name - the St. George Defence. As you can imagine, it's not particularly great since Black does nothing to fight for the centre. Black's main idea is to prepare ...b5, meaning that play often proceeds similarly to the Polish Defence with 1...b5 which we just analysed. The biggest claim to fame that 1...a6 has is that it was once used by Anthony Miles to defeat Karpov after 1.e4.  2.e4  We grab the centre of course.  b5  transposes to the Polish Defence after   2...e6  This is a funny line which has been played dozens of times by Christian Bauer, a strong GM, but besides that I wouldn't expect to face it too often. Black is angling for a French structure next with ...d5.  3.Bd3  d5  4.Nc3  This is directed against 4...c5, as we shall see.  c5  5.dxc5 !  Bxc5  6.exd5  exd5  7.Nxd5  Black can't recapture the knight immediately since Bb5+ wins the queen.  Bxf2+ !  Ensuring that now Black can take on d5 since the queen will cover the b5 square, meaning that Bb5+ isn't possible anymore.  8.Kxf2  Qxd5  9.Qe2+  Be6  10.Nh3  ±  Material is equal, but White is clearly better due to his lead in development and bishop pair.  3.a4  Bb7  4.Nd2  reaching a position which we cover after 1...b5. }
2. e4 { Once again, we grab the centre since we can. } 2... Bb7 3. Bd3
{ I'd rather delay the development of our knight to c3 since that would allow Black to maybe play ... e6 followed by ...Bb4, pinning our knight. }
3... e6
{ 3...Nf6  Black ramps up pressure on the e4 pawn quickly.  4.Qe2  The best way to cover the pawn - we don't allow Black's idea of ...e6 followed by ...Bb4 after Nc3 while also keeping the f3 square available for our knight.  Nc6  Attacking the exposed d4 pawn.   4...e6  Black intends to get a foothold in the centre by playing ... d5 next.  5.Nf3  d5  6.e5  Nfd7  7.O-O  The queenside fianchetto doesn't combine very well with the French structure and ...d5.  c5  8.c3  Be7  9.a3  Intending b4 next.  Nc6  10.b4  ±  Putting pressure on c5. If Black closes the queenside with ...c4, he effectively kills his own play and we'll have a free hand on the kingside to make use of our space advantage there.  5.c3  e5  6.Nf3  d6  7.d5  Nb8  8.c4  ±  White is better of course thanks to his big centre and space advantage. }
4. c4 { transposes to a variation we already covered after 1...e6. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Model Games Introduction@@HeaderEnd@@In this chapter, I've provided 15 annotated Model Games. I think Model Games are useful to have in any opening repertoire, with some of the benefits being:  
 A better illustration of the ideas and plans in the middlegames and endgames which can arise from the opening repertoire.   More confidence in the lines and 'inspiration' in your own games, since you can see how top players have utilised the variations with success.   It helps you remember the lines you learnt in the previous chapters, since you can now relate a game and player names to each variation. I find this helps a lot - for example, if you face the 9...e5 variation of the Semi-Slav, you might recall the fantastic Karpov - Anand game and this will help guide your play.  
I've tried to choose games for their instructive value, theoretical importance and also simply aesthetics. I haven't generally gone for quick, crushing wins, but instead have picked games where Black has put up significant resistance and where White had to play well to win.  These are the Model Games we will be examining:  
 Model Game 1: Svane - Sprenger. Queen's Gambit Accepted with 3...e5. Illustrates the weakness of the c7 pawn and the power of White's central advance with f4.   Model Game 2: Svidler - Mamedyarov. Queen's Gambit Declined with 3...Be7. Illustrates the long-term weakness of the c6-pawn after ...b5 and how easy it is to play against the IQP.    Model Game 3: Carlsen - Kramnik. Queen's Gambit Declined with 3...Nf6 and 6...Bf5. Illustrates the 'Carlsen Plan' against the 6...Bf5 endgame.   Model Game 4: Sasikiran - C. Hansen. Queen's Gambit Declined with 3...Nf6 Mainline. Illustrates how to prepare the e4 break, and just how easy the ensuing positions are for White once that break is played successfully.    Model Game 5: Moiseenko - Hellers. Tarrasch Defence. Shows how to convert a typical endgame for our line where we are playing against isolated c- and a-pawns.   Model Game 6: Aravindh - Sjugirov. Exchange Slav. Shows that the Exchange Slav isn't a dead draw even at 2600+ level - moreover, it illustrates how dangerous Black's position becomes once we get a knight on e5 and support it with f4.   Model Game 7: Tomashevsky - Ni. Slav with 4...a6. Illustrates the fantastic e4 break to free the dark bishop, and two monster White knights.   Model Game 8: Epishin - Gulko. Slav with 4...g6. Shows how to slowly, but surely, grind out a win in endgames where Black has met Qb3 with ...Qb6, leaving him with double b-pawns.   Model Game 9: Sadler - Ernst. Slav with 4...Bf5. Shows how to deal with the passive 6...Bc8 - land a knight on e5, cement it in with f4 and then attack.   Model Game 10: Gledura - Anand. Semi-Slav with 8...e5. Shows that even seemingly dead-equal endgames still have life in them - a good example of how to use your more active pieces in the endgame to extract the full point.    Model Game 11: Karpov - Anand. Semi-Slav Mainline with 9...e5. A classic encounter from the 90s which pioneered many of the ideas which are now standard against 9...e5.    Model Game 12: Bukavshin - Artemiev. Semi-Slav Mainline with 9...a6. Illustrates the power of the bishop pair in the long-term.   Model Game 13: Fressinet - Ragger. Semi-Slav Mainline with 9...b5. Shows how to convert a better endgame where White has huge compensation for the pawn after the popular 14...Bxg3.   Model Game 14: Delchev - Beerdsen. Dutch Defence with 2...h6. Illustrates the e4 break and the long-term danger that Black's king is in.   Model Game 15: Bartel - Rendle. 1...e6 with 2...f5. A powerful demonstration of the typical c5 and d5 breaks, and how to convert the ensuing better endgame. }

1. d4 f5
{ We'll be examining the 'pure Dutch' here, starting with 1... f5. The Dutch Defence is a favourite of those who love unorthodox, unbalanced positions - positions that are great when playing for a win. It's the mirror-equivalent of the Sicilian Defence which meets 1. e4 with ...c5. However, whereas the Sicilian is of course an elite, watertight opening, the Dutch is seen as relatively risky and doesn't enjoy quite the same theoretical reputation as the Sicilian. This is reflected by the fact that it's a very infrequent guest at elite tournaments. This bares little relevance on the average player at lower levels though - the Dutch is still popular at amateur and club levels. It is one of those openings that has developed something of a cult-following, perhaps due to the influence of the GingerGM, Simon Williams. The downside to the Dutch as opposed to the mirror opening, the Sicilian, is that it weakens Black's king position slightly - in particular, along the h5-e8 diagonal. This may seem relatively minor so early on, but it can have major ramifications later on, as we shall see. }

{ In this, final chapter of the course, I'll provide you with a few dozen puzzles. The puzzles include simple tactics, some key theoretical ideas/moments and some strategic tests too. The order of the puzzles is entirely random. Most of the puzzles shouldn't be too difficult - the tactics are relatively simple but I think they are useful to get a feel for some of the resources that are available in this opening. All the tactics are taken from real games with pretty strong titled players. }
