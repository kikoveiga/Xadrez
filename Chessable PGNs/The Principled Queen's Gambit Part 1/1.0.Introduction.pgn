 Hello and welcome to the first part (of two) of my complete repertoire with 1.d4, based on the Queen's Gambit!  This project is the culmination of close to a year of work and I think does qualify as a labour of love - I've played 1.d4 pretty much as long as I've played tournament chess - 14 years. The Queen's Gambit has formed the backbone of my White repertoire throughout. As this will most likely be my last opening course on Chessable, I want to make this my best one yet.  As a result, a huge amount of effort has gone into this course - I've tried to provide as much content and material as possible, while trying to make use of all the incredible features that Chessable has to offer.   In this Introduction chapter, I'll go over my 'Opening Manifesto' (the theme or 'philosophy' behind this repertoire), the Repertoire Clashes (a summary of how this course matches up against some of the best Black repertoires available), my Analysis Methodology (basically just a summary of how I chose and analysed the lines, in the pursuit of full transparency and in the event anyone might want to do similar analysis), my Recommended Learning Order and finally an FAQ of some questions I thought might crop up.  Seeing as this is my own repertoire, I'll update it as frequently as possible - I'll try to commit to updates every 3 months or so, at least for the first year after release.  All that's left for me to do is wish you luck on your journey with 1.d4!  Cheers!  Daniel Barrish  Cape Town, March 20201.-- *
