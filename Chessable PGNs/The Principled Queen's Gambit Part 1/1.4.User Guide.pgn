 In this section, I just want to briefly go over some suggestions I have for learning the material to follow, as well as explaining some conventions which I'll use.  I'd recommend most people learn this course in order, from start to finish, but this largely depends on how much time you have available. If time is limited, I'd recommend reading/watching the Quickstarter Guide and then reading/watching the chapter on Plans, Structures and Pawn Breaks. After that, you should be ready to start playing this repertoire at a decent level. If you simply don't have time for the rest of the theory and analysis, you could skip over the theoretical section and go straight to the Model Games and Puzzles.  Even if you're a strong player who already plays the Queen's Gambit, I'd still recommend taking a look at the Quickstarter as it gives you a good overview of what to come. One thing I like to do after getting a general overview of openings is to play lots of online blitz games with them to test the lines and get a feel for the positions. The important thing though is to then check each game's theory against the analysis here, and as a result see where you or your opponent deviated and how each side could possibly improve. Excessive blitz can be detrimental, but I still think that it's one of the fastest ways to learn a repertoire and get comfortable in the ensuing positions, before playing them in serious over-the-board games.  You might notice that at the start of each chapter there is a "Reference" line. This contains all of the following lines in a single place, which makes it easier to read over a chapter at a glance (having this in my Chessable courses has been invaluable when cramming some theory before games on my phone :-) .  The most up-to-date lines will always be the trainable lines - if there is a discrepancy between the trainable lines, the reference line and the video, then the trainable lines are always correct. This is because it is significantly harder to update the video/reference line.1.-- *
