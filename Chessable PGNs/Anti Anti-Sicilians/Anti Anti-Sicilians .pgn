{ Welcome to the most comprehensive Anti Anti-Sicilian repertoire from Black's perspective in the world! Usually, I create lengthy intros  (which are probably skipped by 90% of users and I can't blame them!)  , but this time, I decided to do a shorter introduction!  Firstly, and most importantly, this course is designed for every Sicilian player who responds to 2.Nf3 with 2 ... d6 2... e6 or 2... Nc6.   I don't cover 2..Nf6, 2..a6 or 2..g6 etc. because I consider those to give White a little something, and 95%+ of Sicilians might be reached via ... d6 ... e6 or ... Nc6.  Secondly, this course is divided into four main parts which are:  1. Chapters #2 - #5 - for everybody! No matter if you play the Sveshnikov, Najdorf or Four Knights  (you rock!)  , you will meet the Morra, Alapin or 2.b3. That means that everybody can learn chapters #2 - #5.  2. Chapters #6 - #13 - for 2... e6 players only.  3. Chapters #14 - #25 - for 2... d6 players with the exceptions in chapters #14 and #19, which are also designed to suit 2... Nc6 players.  4. Chapters #26 - #30 - for 2... Nc6 players only.  Now, how to work with this course? It is obvious you don't need all of those chapters and you will learn only about half of them - that's what is usually necessary to be ready to meet all of the Anti-Sicilians that will harm your favourite move order.  A very simple trick is to click on the chapter you don't want and tick the Pause all chapters option -  - more on that in the video introduction for the course! You might simply customize the course so it suits you in the best way!  For example, if you play the Four Knights, then you only need chapters #2 - #13 and you might even skip no #5 because you have your own Alapin in #13.  If you play the Najdorf, you need #2 - #5 and #14 - #25 - so you pause everything else. You get the point!  Now the best thing! In a year from now, you will switch to the other Sicilian, for example now you play the Sveshnikov, and in a year you start the Dragon. You might simply pause 2... Nc6 chapters and stick to 2... d6 ones. Easy  The last thing I want to mention is how I use arrows. I created a system that goes like this:  1. green arrow - move/moves that we will most certainly play in the nearest future  2. blue arrow - general ideas in the positions/secondary plans  3. red arrows - bad pieces, weak squares, non-working plans  4. yellow arrows - either alternative options for us or how we react vs opponent's move.  I know that it might look confusing, so here you have some examples:  a. @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/variation/8226540/#/15/b@@LinkEnd@@ - a simple one - we will play ... Nb6 and the a4-pawn is weak - easy  b. @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/variation/8225940/#/8/b@@LinkEnd@@ - on move 8 White threatened Qxg7 and Qxd5, so now I highlight with red arrows those don't work. With the yellow arrows, you see that Nc7 runs into ... Nc6.  c. @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/variation/8225883/#/16/b@@LinkEnd@@ - here a creative example showing in three colours our responses to three different ideas; if Nh4 we play ... Nd5, if Bf4 we go ... Qxd4 and Be3 runs into ... Nc4.  d. @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/explore/edit/8225865/@@LinkEnd@@ - green arrows - our next two moves, blue arrows - moves we play after the green moves, yellow arrows show that if White goes f4 we strike with ... d6 or ... d5 and with the red circle I highlight the weakness of the e5-pawn.  e.@@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/variation/8226400/#/11/b@@LinkEnd@@ - green arrow highlights we will play next, then blue arrow shows we will follow it up with ... e5 and the secondary plan is ... h6 followed by ... Qe8 - yellow arrows.  I am sure you get the point and the arrows are going to be a pleasant addition to the course!  Creating this course was the most challenging task for me so far, but I am proud of this work! As the main course page states, I made many boring lines not boring - which was my motto when working. Also, whenever I found out that a certain variation was analysed by the other author, I usually went for the alternative line to give you some fresh lines. I did my best to do the lines exciting and dynamic. I hope you will like this course. Get ready to beat your opponents who dare to skip 3. d4 on move three or play the Morra or Alapin!

1. e4 c5
{ So here we are. I guess that if you purchased this course, you - like me - are a Sicilian player. I don't claim here that you are from Palermo or Catania, but that you like to play unbalanced chess by replying 1. e4 with 1... c5. In the first theoretical chapter  (which means the 2nd chapter of the course, since the 1st one is devoted to the intro)  , we will take a look at all of White's rare 2nd moves. Some of them are more playable and some are just dubious, but I wanted to cover all of the options that at least from time to time appear in tournament practice. Of course, don't expect me to cover 2. h3 or 2. a4 because you can get a decent position vs those moves without doing anything extraordinary. But any reasonable move from White that isn't a main-line has been covered. }
2. Be2
{ I consider this move to be the interesting one for White. Our opponent's idea is quite non-standard - White wants to play f4 next with a reversed Dutch setup ! White, therefore, avoids problems that can be seen in the 2. f4 d5 line. }
2... Nc6 3. f4
{ This is White's idea behind the move 2. Be2. White wants to play Nf3, d3, castle kingside and start some attack on the kingside. I recommend to immediately counter-attack in the centre. }
3... e6 { Black prepares a quick ... d5. } 4. Nf3 d5 5. e5
{ This is played from time to time but I think it is inferior to 5. d3. White shouldn't close the centre leaving us with the d5 - c5 pawn duo and the f5-square for the Knight. }
5... Nh6 { A typical plan of planting the Knight on f5. } 6. O-O Be7
{ It is also possible to put the Knight on f5 immediately but before we move the same piece twice, we will develop. }
7. c3
{ White is ready to play d4 and I would like to stop that plan immediately. }
7... d4
{ This move is a novelty but I really like this approach. We immediately stop White's d4, gain space in the centre and prepare to play ... b6 followed by ... Bb7 when the light-squared Bishop rules on the long diagonal. I don't claim that Black is better but in practical play, it should be much easier to play this position with Black. }

6. O-O Nge7 7. c3
{ This is the most popular move for White but I think that Black gets a great game with the following setup. }
7... f6
{ We will make Ben Finegold unhappy by breaking his rule no. 1 - never play ... f6. However, we have a good reason for that. Firstly, we take away the option of going e5 from White. Secondly, we claim the e5-square and will develop smoothly with ... O-O and ... b6 followed by ... Bb7 next. }
8. Be3 O-O { We will play ... b6 and ... Bb7 next with very good prospects. } *

My Dad and his friends sat down relieved that they were able to fish in peace. After a few seconds, I threw the biggest stone in the water. A promise is a promise - no sticks! We do the same thing - whenever they forbid us to castle kingside - we castle queenside like little rebels. }

1. e4 c5
{ So here we are. I guess that if you purchased this course, you - like me- are a Sicilian player. I don't claim here that you are from Palermo or Catania, but that you like to play unbalanced chess by replying 1. e4 with 1... c5. In the first chapter, we will take a look at all of White's rare 2nd moves. Some of them are more playable and some are just dubious, but I wanted to cover all of the options that at least from time to time appear in tournament practice. Of course, don't expect me to cover 2. h3 or 2. a4 because you can get a decent position vs those moves without doing anything extraordinary. But any reasonable move from White that isn't a main-line has been covered. }
2. Bc4
{ A popular move on the amateur level. It is quite a decent option with ...d6 played but to play it on move 2 is a strategically risky option. }
2... e6
{ Black uses the fact that the Bishop on c4 asks to be kicked with ... d5. } 3.

{ Renewing the threat of ... d5. } 5. e5 Ng4

Bxd6 10. exd6 Qxd6 11. d5 Nce5 { I don't see full compensation for White. } *

1. e4 c5 2. c3
{ The so-called Alapin Variation championed by GM Evgeny Sveshnikov. White's idea is crystal-clear - push d4 and claim the centre.

Nf3 e6 3. c3 move order. Note that in this chapter we avoid playing ... e6 which means that it was necessary to prepare an additional setup for Black.   Also note that if White starts with  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.c3  , it will sooner or later transpose to one of the main options from this chapter after  3...Nf6  4.e5  Nd5  White will now play either 5. Bc4 or 5. d4 reaching one of the main lines. }
2... Nf6
{ In my opinion, this is not only the most popular move and the best continuation at Black's disposal, but also the line that is the easiest to play and understand. Black will reach a highly improved version of the Alekhine, where the pawn on c3 is just badly placed. }

9... Qxe2+ 10. Kxe2 e6
{ Black has a normal position with the White King on e2. Despite the fact it is the endgame, the King might feel a little heat in the centre of the board. Black's basic plan is to castle long - but watch out for Ng5 jumps - with or without ... f6 included. Sometimes ... Rd8 followed by ... Be7 / ... Bd6 and short castle will be a decent plan. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ As I've mentioned in the introduction, Black's reply to this move has to be connected with your main repertoire in the Sicilian. Remember, that White might play Nf3 next and go for d4 transposing to the Open Sicilian! So if you are a Najdorf or Sveshnikov player - you won't play 2... e6 because after 3. Nf3 you are going to be tricked from your original repertoire. So this chapter is designed for players who play 2... e6 vs the Open Sicilian. But don't worry! There are two more chapters about the Closed Sicilian - one for 2... d6 players and one for the 2... Nc6 players! Here, we will focus on 2... e6 lines. }

{ Note that in this and the next 7 chapters we will take a look at all of White's Anti-Sicilians connected with the move 2... e6. It is designed for players who play the Taimanov, Kan/Paulsen, Scheveningen or, of course - Four Knights! }
3. g3
{ In this chapter we will take a look at the lines where White goes for the Closed Sicilian. White wants to fianchetto the Bishop and build up slowly with moves such as d3 f4 Nf3 etc. However, by starting with 2... e6, we have an additional option that I highly recommend using! }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3
{ As I've mentioned in the introduction, Black's reply to this move has to be connected with your main repertoire in the Sicilian. Remember, that White might play Nf3 next and go for d4 transposing to the Open Sicilian ! So if you are a Najdorf or Sveshnikov player - you won't play 2... e6 because after 3. Nf3 you are going to be tricked from your original repertoire. So this chapter is designed for players who play 2... e6 vs the Open Sicilian. But don't worry ! There are two more chapters about the Closed Sicilian - one for 2... d6 players and one for the 2... Nc6 players ! Here, we will focus on 2... e6 lines. }
2... e6
{ Note that in this and the next 7 chapters we will take a look at all of White's Anti-Sicilians connected with the move 2... e6. It is designed for players who play the Taimanov, Kan/Paulsen, Scheveningen or, of course - Four Knights ! }
3. g3
{ In this chapter we will take a look at the lines where White goes for the Closed Sicilian. White wants to fianchetto the Bishop and build up slowly with moves such as d3 f4 Nf3 etc. However, by starting with 2... e6, we have an additional option that I highly recommend using ! }
3... d5
{ By playing this way, we immediately push White from his original ideas. White doesn't have time to get all of his standard moves and has to play something else. On the other hand, we do all of the right things - we immediately strike in the centre and plan to expand even further. }
4. exd5
{ This is a more popular option than all of the other moves combined. White opens up the position and will try to put pressure on our d5-pawn. Also, White avoids the situations that you could see in the previous lines where our opponent was spacially suffocating. }
4... exd5 5. Bg2
{ The most popular move attacking the pawn on d5.   Note that  5.d3  h6  6.Bg2  Nf6  transposes. }
5... Nf6
{ Calmly defending the d-pawn. Our basic idea is to play ... d4 now.   I don't like  5...d4  due to  6.Qe2  followed by Nd5. }
6. d3 { The most popular move. } 6... h6
{ I think that with the White pawn already on d3 we might change gears and abandon the ... d4 plan for the moment and wait for White to commit to some setup. By playing ... h6, we stop Bg5. }
7. Nge2
{ The most natural setup.   7.Nf3  Nc6  8.O-O  Be7  with mutual chances. I really like Black with this  d5  -  c5  pawn duo. }
7... d4 { Everything is ready for this pawn push. } 8. Ne4 Nxe4 9. Bxe4 Bd6 10.
O-O O-O 11. Bf4 Re8 12. Re1 Nc6
{ Black's space advantage should give a small edge. One of the ideas is to drop the Bishop back to f8 and play ... g5. }

{ Remember the theme, that whenever there is a pawn trio on g4 f4 and e4, we reply with ... f5 immediately! White's ideas connected with ... f5 should be stopped. }
9... f5
{ More than 10 years ago I read the rule that if White captures on f5 we should recapture asymmetrically. That means that if the g-pawn takes we should take back with the e-pawn and if the e-pawn takes then we take back with the g-pawn. However, now I have another rule - virtually always take back with the e-pawn! When working on this course, I checked some situations with captures for White, and in ALL of them ... exf5 was the best choice - no matter what White takes with! }
10. Ng3 O-O
{ Black is already slightly better. Our setup is more compact and we have many dynamic options. }
11. h3 b6

6... Rb8
{ This plan is copied from the English Opening. Before committing to anything on the kingside, it is useful to prepare quick counterplay with ... b5. Then we can adjust our plan depending on White's setup. }
7. Nf3 { By far the most popular option. } 7... b5
{ With the Knight on f3, we don't have to be afraid of White going for a quick f5. That means that we can create counterplay on the queenside immediately. }
8. O-O b4 9. Ne2 { A more popular of the two retreats. } 9... Nf6

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4
{ This is the 2nd chapter in this course, where I analyse Black's approach towards the Grand Prix Attack. This time, it is devoted to players who want to play 2... d6 so all of you who have the Najdorf, Classical, Scheveningen or Dragon in their repertoires. }
3... g6
{ I think that from 2... e6 2... d6 and 2... Nc6, White has the best chances of obtaining a good position against 2... d6 exactly. Why is that ? When we start with 2... e6, we are not going to fianchetto our Bishop and will go for a quick ... d5 instead. In the 2... Nc6 line, we will play ... g6 and then ... e6 followed by ... d5. By starting with ... d6, our options are limited but don't worry ! Our positions are going to be great anyway. }
4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5+
{ White tries to lure us into playing ... Nc6 with a great version of the Rossolimo for White. Now we see the benefit of starting with ... Nc6 not ... d6 - we would skip d6 and play ... Nd4 instead - as in the Grand Prix 2... Nc6 chapter. However, not having the Knight committed to c6 is also a great thing. That means that we can just block the check with the Bishop. }
5... Bd7 6. a4 Nc6
{ We are ready to recapture on c6 with the Bishop, therefore this move is perfectly playable. }
7. O-O a6 8. Bc4 e6
{ Black is ready to play ... Nge7 ... O-O and then prepare ... d5 or ... b5. }
9. d3 Nge7 { The Knight belongs on e7. On f6 it would be prone to e5 ideas. }
10. Qe1 O-O 11. Qh4 { This is White's standard attacking scheme. } 11... Nd4
{ It is essential to get counterplay in the centre. We follow a basic rule - whenever one attacks you on the wing, you counter-attack either on the other wing or in the centre. }
12. Nxd4 cxd4 { We will undouble our pawns by continuing with ... d5. } 13. Ne2
d5 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Qxd8 Rfxd8
{ If Black manages to consolidate with ... Nb4 or ... Bc6, we will be much better. }
16. Bxd5
{ The only chance for White to get a slightly worse position. Everything else was bad. }
16... exd5
{ We will follow with ... Re8 and ... Rac8. Black's pair of Bishops more than enough compensates for the structural weaknesses. }

7. O-O e6 8. f5
{ White can play this pawn thrust immediately. I think that the timing is quite good because we haven't played ... Nge7 yet. }
8... Nf6
{ With f5 already played, we should put the Knight on f6. One reason for that is that ideas connected with e5 are not possible now. }
9. d3 O-O
{ I recommend to simply ignore the pawn and avoid opening up lines for White in this case. Normally, we will have lines where we grab the pawn, but here, White has the best version of this position, therefore I recommend to stay solid. ... exf5 is a big threat now which forces White to make a decision. }
10. fxg6 fxg6
{ 10...hxg6 ?!  11.Qe1  followed by Qh4 and Bg5 would lead to a strong attack for White. By recapturing with the f-pawn, we keep the Knight on f6 defended with the Rook. }
11. Bf4 Qe7
{ Black's basic idea is to play ... Ng4 followed by ... Nge5. Note that ... Nxe4 is a threat now. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3
{ Starting from this chapter, we will take a look at White's options connected with the move 2. Nf3. We won't touch an Open Sicilian - besides the 5. f3 chapter - but there are many different options that White might choose from. In this chapter, we take a look at 3. Bc4 3. b4 and 3. c4 which are White's most popular rare options. }
2... d6 3. Bc4
{ I think that if Bc4 ever makes sense on move 3, it makes most sense against ... d6. The reason for that is if Black wants to go for the ... e6 + ... d5 idea, it will cost a tempo because the pawn is already on d6. }
3... Nf6 4. d3
{ In this chapter, we will take a look at White's options connected with this move.   Note that if White plays  4.Nc3  his idea might be to play d4 next so Black should respond like this:  Najdorf players 4... a6   Classical players 4... Nc6   Dragon 4... g6  Scheveningen 4... e6.   This way, you are going to head for your favourite setup. }
4... e6 { Black blocks the Bishop and prepares ... a6 followed by ... b5. } 5.
Bb3
{ The most popular option stepping away from ... d5 and ... a6 + ... d5 ideas. }
5... b5
{ Played only twice but gaining space on the queenside should be a critical way of playing. }
6. O-O Be7
{ Just don't rush with  6...a5  7.a4 !  and we have to close the queenside by moving the b-pawn up the board. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
{ The most popular alternative to 3. d4 for White which is called the Moscow Variation. White's ideas are similar to the Rossolimo line of the 2... Nc6 Sicilian. However, our Knight is not yet committed to c6 which we can use by blocking this check with other moves. }
3... Nd7
{ It is well-known that 3... Bd7 is the most popular move and the most reliable equalizer. However, some of the lines there lead to dull, dry equality. By playing the text move, Black avoids early exchanges and if White will ever take on d7, we will have a situation with some imbalances. The Bishop on b5 will be kicked with ... a6 at some point. Let me also tell you that after 3... Nd7, Black has the best practical results with more than 50% as our share of points ! }

In this chapter, we will take a look at what happens after White retakes on d4 with the Queen. In the next chapter, we will cover White's last option of not transposing to the main lines of the Open Sicilian - the 5. f3 line. }
3... cxd4 4. Qxd4
{ Taking with the Queen is usually favoured by players who want to avoid a chunk of theory and still play some kind of an open game. The advantage of this move is that White doesn't move the Knight twice. The disadvantage is that the Queen will be exposed on d4. }
4... Nc6
{ I prefer the text move over  4...a6  due to  5.c4  Nc6  6.Qe3  and I think that White has chances to get a nice grip on the position. Also, White's statistics in this line are quite alarming to us. }
5. Bb5
{ By far the most popular move. White tries to keep the Queen on the active spot, and at the same time, our opponent develops the piece. The biggest drawback is that White sooner or later will be forced to part with the Bishop. }
5... Bd7
{ The main idea of this move is to lure your opponent into blundering the Queen! The other idea is to prepare to recapture on c6 with the Bishop and force White to make a decision about the hanging Queen. }
6. Qd3
{ A less popular option, but it is quite logical. The Bishop is already developed so the Queen on d3 doesn't obstruct its development. The disadvantage is that the Queen still might be hit by future ... Nf6 - d7 - c5. }
6... Nf6 7. c4
{ The most critical try going for the Maroczy structure. This pawn duo on e4 and c4 makes it hard for Black to create counterplay with ... d5 or ... b5. Still, with the Queen on d3 we will manage to do that! }
7... g6 8. Nc3 Bg7 9. O-O O-O
{ Black has ideas connected with ... Bg4 or ... Ng4 in the air. } 10. h3
{ White's best option is to cover the g4-square and force us to look for a different plan. }
10... a6 11. Bxc6 { 11.Ba4  Na5  12.Bxd7  Nxd7  gives Black adequate chances. }
11... Bxc6 12. Nd4
{ Attacking the Bishop on c6 is the most popular way forward for our opponent. The Knight from d4 attacks the Bishop forcing us to do something about that. The other benefit of the Knight move is that ... b5 is stopped. }
12... Qb6
{ We prepare to recapture on c6 with the Queen. Remember that we usually don't want to retake with the pawn. }
13. Rd1 Nd7 { A typical Dragon move, transferring the Knight to c5 or e5. } 14.
Be3 { This move starts a forcing sequence that should be memorized! } 14...
Qxb2
{ Grabbing the bull by its horns. We threaten ... Ne5 ... Nc5 or ... Qa3 followed by one of those. White has only one move to prove some compensation. }
15. Rab1 Qa3 16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. Nd5
{ Only this trick allows White to get a good game. } 17... Qxd3 18. Nxe7+ Kh8
19. Rxd3 Ne5 20. Rxd6 Rae8
{ In some lines, White will have the Rook on b7, targetting the f7-pawn. That means that the f7-pawn should stay protected. }
21. Rb7
{ 21.Nxc6  is what we want. After  21...Nxc4  the e4-pawn falls.  It wouldn't work if White was able to answer ... Nxc4 with Rxc6 ! }
21... Nxc4 22. Rd3 Nxe3 23. Rxe3 Bd4 24. Re2 c5
{ Black will play ... Rb8 next with a comfortable position. } 25. Nc6
{ This is the only move that stops our plan and requires an accurate response. }
25... Ba1
{ Keeping the Bishop on the long diagonal. Retreating it to g7 would be risky due to f4 and e5 shutting down the Bishop. }

However, the pawn on h3 makes the difference in White's favour. That's why here we take with the pawn and in the other line with the Queen ! That being said, taking with the Queen is perfectly acceptable.   12.h3 ?  is too slow due to  12...Bxe4 !  13.Nxe4  Nxe4  14.Qxe4  Qxd4  with a pawn advantage for Black. }

3... cxd4 4. Qxd4
{ Taking with the Queen is usually favoured by players who want to avoid a chunk of theory and still play some kind of an open game. The advantage of this move is that White doesn't move the Knight twice. The disadvantage is that the Queen will be exposed on d4. }
4... Nc6
{ I prefer the text move over  4...a6  due to  5.c4  Nc6  6.Qe3  and I think that White has chances to get a nice grip on the position. Also, White's statistics in this line are quite alarming to us. }
5. Bb5
{ By far the most popular move. White tries to keep the Queen on the active spot, and at the same time, our opponent develops the piece. The biggest drawback is that White sooner or later will be forced to part with the Bishop. }
5... Bd7
{ The main idea of this move is to lure your opponent into blundering the Queen! The other idea is to prepare to recapture on c6 with the Bishop and force White to make a decision about the hanging Queen. }
6. Bxc6
{ You should expect to see this move in more than 90% of your games. White prefers to part with the light-squared Bishop than to move the Queen here and there. The position is already double-edged because Black will be left with the pair of Bishops and White has some space advantage and lead in development - typical Sicilian factors! }
6... Bxc6
{ I am sure you are aware that we need to take with the Bishop.   6...bxc6 ?  7.e5  is something I would still prefer to avoid! }
7. Nc3
{ By far the most popular move but I consider it to be less dangerous than 7. c4 which we have extensively analysed. }
7... Nf6
{ With the Knight on c3 instead of the pawn on c4, White's development is faster and we should abandon plans connected with ... g6 whatsoever ! Only if White plays something slow like Be3 or Qd3 we might consider that, but the next move is virtually the only one that appears in practice. }
8. Bg5
{ Played in around 98% of games ! The alternatives practically don't exist so we will focus on this one ! White stops ... g6 and prepares to castle long with a serious pressure on our position ! All of White's pieces will be perfectly placed and we need to play precisely. However, we have a pair of Bishops and chances for an active counterplay ! }
8... e6
{ Preparing to simply develop with ... Be7 and covering the d5-square. } 9.
O-O-O Be7 10. Qd3
{ A typical plan for this chapter, freeing the d4 square for the Knight. Why don't play 4. Nxd4 then ?!?! No idea ! }
10... Qa5
{ Stopping the aforementioned plan by attacking the g5-Bishop. Black also prepares counterplay on the queenside with ... O-O and one of the Rooks to c8 to follow. }
11. h4
{ The most testing continuation, defending the Bishop and renewing the idea of Nd4. }
11... h6 { The Bishop has to choose its destiny. } 12. Bxf6
{ I won't mark this move as an inaccuracy, but I think that Black is already slightly better. The point is that White can't easily win a pawn. }
12... Bxf6 { Once again tactics work in our favour. } 13. Nd4
{ The point is that White can't take the pawn with13.  Qxd6 ?!  Bxc3  14.bxc3  Qxa2  with an edge for Black. }
13... Qb6
{ I consider this move to be the safest option.   13...O-O-O  is more complex and worth trying. }
14. f4 { 14.Nxc6 ?!  bxc6 !  15.Qxd6  Rb8  and White is in trouble. } 14...
Bxd4 15. Qxd4 Qxd4 16. Rxd4 Ke7

{ This time I recommend taking with the Bishop.  13...Nxd5 ?!  14.Ne5 !  is very strong for White here. The reason for that is the line that worked beautifully in the other variation fails here after  14...Nxc3  15.Bxc3  Qxa2  16.Nxc6  and we can't check with the Bishop due to the h-pawns presence.  If you want to keep one approach towards both of these lines, then I recommend sticking to ... Bxd5 and get equal positions. However, I find ... Nxe5 to be a stronger option in the 11.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4
{ I said at the beginning of the course that we don't touch Open Sicilians but there are some exceptions of course. In this chapter, we will take a look at what happens after White retakes on d4 with the Queen. In the next chapter, we will cover White's last option of not transposing to the main lines of the Open Sicilian - the 5. f3 line. }
3... cxd4 4. Qxd4
{ Taking with the Queen is usually favoured by players who want to avoid a chunk of theory and still play some kind of an open game. The advantage of this move is that White doesn't move the Knight twice. The disadvantage is that the Queen will be exposed on d4. }
4... Nc6
{ I prefer the text move over  4...a6  due to  5.c4  Nc6  6.Qe3  and I think that White has chances to get a nice grip on the position. Also, White's statistics in this line are quite alarming to us. }
5. Bb5
{ By far the most popular move. White tries to keep the Queen on the active spot, and at the same time, our opponent develops the piece. The biggest drawback is that White sooner or later will be forced to part with the Bishop. }
5... Bd7
{ The main idea of this move is to lure your opponent into blundering the Queen! The other idea is to prepare to recapture on c6 with the Bishop and force White to make a decision about the hanging Queen. }
6. Bxc6
{ You should expect to see this move in more than 90% of your games. White prefers to part with the light-squared Bishop than to move the Queen here and there. The position is already double-edged because Black will be left with the pair of Bishops and White has some space advantage and lead in development - typical Sicilian factors! }
6... Bxc6
{ I am sure you are aware that we need to take with the Bishop.   6...bxc6 ?  7.e5  is something I would still prefer to avoid! }
7. Nc3
{ By far the most popular move but I consider it to be less dangerous than 7. c4 which we have extensively analysed. }
7... Nf6
{ With the Knight on c3 instead of the pawn on c4, White's development is faster and we should abandon plans connected with ... g6 whatsoever ! Only if White plays something slow like Be3 or Qd3 we might consider that, but the next move is virtually the only one that appears in practice. }
8. Bg5
{ Played in around 98% of games ! The alternatives practically don't exist so we will focus on this one ! White stops ... g6 and prepares to castle long with a serious pressure on our position ! All of White's pieces will be perfectly placed and we need to play precisely. However, we have a pair of Bishops and chances for an active counterplay ! }
8... e6
{ Preparing to simply develop with ... Be7 and covering the d5-square. } 9.
O-O-O Be7 10. Rhe1
{ The most popular move putting the other piece on the perfect square. White's development is astonishing but is it enough to gain the advantage ? The answer is - no ! }
10... O-O
{ This is a position with opposite castlings but we will rarely see razor-sharp attacks. The play has more positional character where White will try to squeeze us and we will search for some active counterplay. }
11. e5
{ Having all of the pieces on the most active squares, it is logical to open up the centre. However, don't forget that we have two Bishops which loooooove open positions. }
11... dxe5 12. Qh4 { A move chosen in more than 80% of games. } 12... Qc7 13.
Nxe5 Rfd8 { White doesn't have an easy way to equality. } 14. Ng4
{ The best try. } 14... Nxg4 15. Bxe7
{ 15.Qxg4 ?  is bad due to  15...Rxd1+  16.Rxd1  f5  17.Qh4  Bxg5+  18.Qxg5  Qxh2  - Black is hugely on top. }
15... Rxd1+ 16. Rxd1 Nh6 { ... Nf5 is next. } 17. Bd6
{ 17.Bd8 ?!  Qe5  just misplaces the Bishop.  We will put the Knight on f5 anyway. }
17... Nf5 { A key intermediate move. } 18. Bxc7 Nxh4 19. g3 Nf3 20. h4 f6
{ We will continue with ... Rc8 ... Kf7 ... e5 having a slight positional advantage in this endgame. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6

3. f4
{ The Grand Prix Attack which I, amazingly, analyse for the third time in this course! How is it even possible? Because after 2. Nc3 Black is obliged to reply with the move that is typical for our Open Sicilian. So for the Kan/Paulsen and Taimanov players we play 2. Nc3 e6 and for the Najdorf, Dragon etc. we go 2. Nc3 d6. So it is obvious that whenever we play the Sveshnikov or the Accelerated Dragon, not to mention that we can choose 2... Nc6 to reach the Classical, the Four Knights or the Taimanov, we should start with 2... Nc6 against 2. Nc3. I could be lazy and just guide you to transpose to the Grand Prix vs 2... d6 lines, but it would be against my philosophy of always going for the most active and concrete approach. That's why I recommended going for a quick ... d5 with a 2... e6 move order, and that's why I add this chapter! Going back to the text move, White's idea is to play Nf3 and then Bc4 or Bb5 followed by the attack on the kingside. }
3... g6
{ This chapter will differ from the 15th chapter of this course, because we are not committed to ... d6 yet. We will use that to our favour by abandoning the move ... d6 completely and play for ... e6 followed by ... d5! }
4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5
{ The most popular move nowadays and understandably so. White experiences some problems in the 5. Bc4 line, where finding equality was very often difficult for our opponent. }
5... Nd4
{ Note that if we allow White to take on c6, it would lead to an improved version of the Rossolimo, where the pawn is already on f4. Not only would White get a typical Rossolimo-style play vs our doubled c-pawns, but also some dangerous attacking chances. }
6. O-O
{ The most popular move for White, completely ignoring our Knight. It is, in my opinion, the best equalizing attempt from White. }
6... a6 7. Bc4
{ This is an inaccuracy since the Bishop will be prone to ... b5 or ... e6 and ... b5 ideas. }
7... b5 8. Bd5 { What else?! } 8... Ra7
{ A much less popular move than ... Rb8, but the Rook will be quite useful on the 7th rank, considering that we will play ... e6 and ... d5 at some point. }

{ 12.Nxd5 ??  Nxb3  ∓   12.Bxd5 ??  b4  ∓ } 12... Ne7
{ Now we see how useful the move ... Ra7 was. } 13. Nxd5 O-O
{ Black sacrificed a pawn, but almost all of our units are developed, and White is under severe pressure. }
14. Nxe7+ Rxe7 15. Rxe7 Qxe7
{ White managed to exchange some pieces, but his lag in development will be more visible now. When White has four pieces developed vs our six, it is not a big deal. But when we have a situation with two vs four, it is more dangerous. It is like in football  (ok, soccer...)  4 attackers vs 3 defenders would be defensible, but 2 vs 1 is usually a goal. }
16. c3
{ 16.Bd2  would be great if it worked. After  16...c4 !  17.dxc4  bxc4  18.Ba4  Rd8  Black is positionally winning. }
16... Nxf3+ 17. Qxf3 Qe1+
{ Even more pieces are being exchanged, but White will still be left with the Rook on a1 and the Bishop on c1. }
18. Qf1 Re8 { If nothing happens, we will continue with ... Bf5 or ... Bb7. }
19. Qxe1 { 19.Bd5 ?  Bxc3 !  20.bxc3  Qxc3  21.Rb1  Qd4+  ∓ } 19... Rxe1+ 20.
Kf2 Rh1
{ The Rook can't be kicked from the first rank. Whenever White goes for a4, we will respond with ... b4 closing the queenside. }
21. Bd5 { The only way of stopping ... Bb7. } 21... h5
{ It is essential to keep the Rook on the 1st rank. The pawn on h2 won't run away. White is in trouble. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ This is the independent possibility for White which is available only vs the 2... Nc6 move order. The discussed line is named after GM Sergei Tiviakov who used it with success for many years, therefore it is called the Tiviakov Grand Prix. White doesn't abandon plans connected with f4 or Bxc6 which means that our opponent will look for either improved Grand Prix Attack or improved Rossolimo. }
3... Nd4 { Avoiding Bxc6 and attacking the Bishop. } 4. Bc4
{ Note that this position with Nf3 and ... e6 included has been analysed in the #8th chapter. However, we didn't include ...e6 here, which leads to an even better version for Black, because we will have the option of postponing ... e6 and playing something even more appealing. }
4... a6 { This is my favourite approach, preparing to play ... b5 next. } 5. a4
{ The most popular move for White, avoiding ... b5. } 5... e6
{ We will continue with ... Nf6 followed by ... d5. } 6. Nge2
{ The most popular move for White. The plus of this move is that the f-pawn is not blocked. The minus is that the kingside is less protected and the Queen is blocked. }
6... Nf6
{ Similarly to the 6. Nf3 line, we put the Knight on the most active square. ... d5 is on the agenda. }
7. O-O d5
{ The biggest disadvantage of omitting the move d3 is that White is forced to take on d5. }
8. exd5 exd5 9. Ba2 Bd6
{ One of many decent options for Black. I chose it because it is the simplest to understand - we put the Bishop on the most active square. Note that the pawn on d5 never hangs due to the ... Bxh2+ trick. }
10. d3 Ne6
{ White started to threaten to take on d4 so it is better to reroute the Knight. }
11. Ng3

11... h5
{ A key move, starting to build up some pressure on the kingside. It is very often a decent plan to push flank pawns vs the Knights on g3 or b3. Our basic plan is to play ... Bb8 - or sometimes ... Bc7 - followed by ... h4 and ... Qd6/c7. }

Note that we will cover all of White's options connected with the move Bxc6 first, and only then we will see what happens after other moves. }
4... bxc6
{ It is a twice less popular recapture which has both pros and cons. A positive thing is that we capture towards the centre and open up the b-file for the Rook. On the negative side, we have to mention that the move ... bxc6 doesn't contribute to development. If we took with the d-pawn, the c8-Bishop would be free to move. }
5. O-O { The most popular and the most flexible move. } 5... Bg7 6. Re1
{ This is a much more popular move that all of the other tries combined. White doesn't touch the queenside and instead focuses on the centre and the e4-pawn. Sometimes e5 will be an idea from our opponent. }
6... Qc7
{ This is only the 8th most popular move for Black but it scores over 50% for us in all of my three databases - even in the correspondence one! Let me mention that this move was used by Carlsen to beat Giri in the Tata Steel India rapid 2019. Black's basic idea is to continue with ... d6 and then ... e5. So why ... Qc7? If we start with ... d6, White will reply with e5 which I find unpleasant. The text move covers the e5-square and makes our plan possible to carry through. }
7. c3
{ This move doesn't have any independent value and sooner or later we will lead in one of the positions that we have analysed. Let's see. }
7... d6 8. d4 { 8.h3  Nf6  also transposes to the previous lines. } 8... cxd4
9. cxd4 Nf6 10. Nc3 O-O 11. h3 c5

4. c3
{ Before doing anything else, White prepares to play d4 next. I think that we should counter this plan with the following move. }
4... Nf6
{ The exclamation mark is from me. The point is that White is unable to continue with d4 being forced to defend the e4-pawn. }
5. Qe2
{ Defending the pawn and planning d4. The problem is that the Queen on e2 is not perfectly placed and White lost a tempo on a sub-ideal move. }
5... Qb6
{ An interesting move threatening ... Nxe4 !   5...e5 !?  is the other decent move. }
6. Na3 { 6.O-O  Nxe4 !  is the point of our previous move. } 6... a6 7. Nc4
{ 7.Bc4  d6  is at least equal for Black.  The text move enables White to try to trap our Queen but for a high price! }
7... Qxb5 8. a4 Qb3 9. d4 { White prepares Nfd2. } 9... b5
{ It is possible to avoid the Queen sacrifice by playing  9...cxd4  10.Ra3  d3  11.Qxd3  Nb4  12.cxb4  Qxd3  13  Rxd3  d6  with approximately equal chances. }
10. Nfd2 Qxc4
{ 10...Nxd4  11.cxd4  Qb4  was the last option to bail out but I consider the text move to be the most critical. }
11. Nxc4 bxc4
{ Initially, Stockfish thinks that White is better. Then, it switches to 0.00. Now from a human perspective - Black has three pieces for the Queen. We have no weaknesses and can develop smoothly and then coordinate the minor pieces. I think that this position is very easy for Black to play while it will be harder for White to coordinate his forces. }
