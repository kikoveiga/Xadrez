{ Welcome to the course! Here I analyze three annoying openings that a 1.d4 player will often encounter  (particularly)  in faster time controls. These are the English Defense and it's two 'cousins', the Accelerated Queen's Indian Defense  (QID)  and Owen's Defense. The coverage of the latter is also useful for 1.e4 players.  Despite them not having a good reputation, these sidelines are quite tricky and White has to be well prepared to emerge with an advantage out of the opening. The good news is they fail to equalize so if you learn the lines in this course, you will have an advantage  (oftentimes a big or even a decisive one)  !  I decided to make this small course FREE as a way of giving back to the wonderful Chessable community with which I've had a great time and learned a lot from.  Finally, if you have any questions  (or even better find improvements for White or Black)  don't hesitate to post in the forums.  I hope you enjoy this course and score a lot of points with it! }

{ I decided to list the repertoire books and databases that recommended the English and Owen's Defenses as well as the Accelerated QID for Black. I've included hyperlinks to my preferred way of tackling their recommendations.   I will try to keep this list as up to date as possible.

1. e4 b6 { This variation is known as Owen's defense. } 2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3

{ Reinforcing the d4 pawn. This is why we held back the development of the knight on b1.   Note that  6.d5  in this particular position is even stronger. I opted to make the text trainable to illustrate the setup White should go for in these structures.  Basically, all you need to know about this setup with ...b6 + ...e6 is to put the bishop on d3, the queen on e2, and the knight on f3. Meet any ...c5 with c3 and enjoy a clear advantage thanks to the big center. A sample continuation is: }
6... Be7 7. O-O
{ A logical move, securing the king.   I opted to make  7.O-O  a trainable to illustrate the setup that White should aim for. It is noteworthy that  7.e5  in this concrete position is even stronger. }

8... O-O 9. Rd1
