1. e4
{ Before we start the intro - an important thing:  This course doesn't contain any Anti-Sicilians for White. It is a full repertoire for Black against 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6. All of the other tries for White such as Alapin, Morra, Grand Prix etc. will be covered in the separate course. More about my decision here:   @@LinkStart@@https://www.chessable.com/discussion/thread/167985/my-upcoming-four-knights-sicilian-course/@@LinkEnd@@  
Firstly, I would like to thank you for purchasing this course. It is the fruit of my latest research and with the 2nd part will cover Black's full repertoire against 1.e4.  
If I were forced to identify my biggest problem with the opening repertoire, I would instantly reply 'Black vs 1.e4'. I have never had any issues with the White colour and also, against 1. d4, 1. c4, 1. Nf3 etc. I've always gone for the King's Indian Defence. However, against 1.e4 I tried no less than 7 different setups throughout the last 10-15 years. I think that finding the right opening vs White's most active first move is a major challenge - especially nowadays. }
1... c5
{ While I keep some options such as Accelerated Dragon or Alekhine as surprising weapons, I decided that if I want to improve, I need to start playing something that at least resembles the main lines. I had some kind of a brainstorm with myself and I was wondering which setups with White I love playing and I tried to look for a similar opening with the Black pieces. When e3 English came into my mind, I knew that some sort of Sicilian with ... e6 will be my choice. }
2. Nf3
{ As I have mentioned in the intro, this course will be only about the open sicilian. }
2... e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6
{ This is the starting position of the Four Knights Sicilian  (which I will also call the Four Horsemen)  . Black's position is very active and full of dynamism. Here are some promises from me:  1   You will ALWAYS have active pieces. There will be some scenarios where our c8-Bishop might be a bad piece, but you will ALWAYS manage to exchange it. This is a promise. Black's basic plan in the diagram position is to play ... Bb4 and put immediate pressure on White's centre.  2   In the lines that I recommend, you will never be left with the weak d5-square as in the Sveshnikov or some lines of the Najdorf. We will either keep the pawn on e6 or will manage to play ... d7 - d5 in one move.  3   All setups with f3 + Be3 or with Bc4 are dubious at best for our opponent, which means no vicious attacks on our King.  4   There will be only a few lines with the opposite castling, but it will usually mean problems for White - no attacks on our King!  5   Vast majority of lines is based on understanding and planning more than memorizing and calculating. Of course, there will be some exceptions - especially the 7.Bf4 chapter - but most of the time, you will manage to outplay your opponent by memorizing plans, not exact moves.  6   The Anti-Sicilians will be much easier to learn and play than after 2... Nc6 or 2... d6 = no Rossolimo and against both the Closed Sicilian and the Grand Prix Attack we will manage to play a quick ... e6 and ... d5.  7   It is a perfect repertoire for rapid and blitz. Note that White will usually be ready for the Najdorf, Sveshnikov or Dragon, but in many cases, your opponent won't be familiar with any line vs Four Horsemen  (or may be familiar with a line but without any plans in mind)  .  8   There are only a few sources that cover this line from Black's perspective, and I also don't agree with many of points from them. That means that my lines are quite fresh and they see the daylight for the first time. That means that your opponent has no chance to be prepared for them.  9   Last but not least, there will be a few variations where White has a MARGINAL advantage, but no more than that. In all cases, we will have active counterplay, even if we are slightly worse.  I must admit that my experience with this system is quite beginnerish  (now it is a word)  and I have played it for not more than 2 months, but I am fully in love with the opening. For the first time in my life, I can't await my opponent to go for 1.e4 and I know I am fully prepared - especially for the Open Sicilian. I hope that you might get the same state of mind after learning this course and I wish you to have even 10% of joy that I have when playing it! Good luck with the course, good luck with learning and have some easy points!  Kamil Plichta, Koszalin 24.02.2020 }

[Black "#1 Rare 6.g3"]
[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6
{ This is the starting position of the so-called Four Knights Sicilian. It is by far less popular than the Najdorf, Sveshnikov, Dragon or Taimanov, but I think we will see a big boost of popularity of this system  (one of the reasons hopefully being an enormous amount of sales of this course !)  . The line is not very popular because there is a common belief that White has a very easy path to an easy advantage and Black can't do anything about that. I hope to convince you that it is not true and all that White can count on is the slightest of advantages in several lines. I've mentioned in the introduction why I have a huge fondness for this system so let's proceed with our learning, shall we ? The last thing to add is that in this chapter we will take a look at White's rare 6th moves. }
6. g3
{ In my opinion the only dangerous sideline - or at least the one that asks some questions. Not hard ones, but still - questions. White's idea is to just put the Bishop on g2, castle short and go on with his life claiming that he has a nice grip on the centre. }
6... Bb4
{ This is the move that you will see as a recurring theme throughout this course. Black actively develops the Bishop and in many cases will continue with ... d5 - not in this case, but in many positions this will be our standard plan. }
7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O d6
{ With the Bishop on g2 we should refrain from pushing ... d5 as the isolated pawn on d5 would be a long-term target. I think we can get a good game by playing more slowly this time. }
9. Nde2
{ The most popular continuation preventing ... Nxd4 and putting some pressure on the d6-pawn. }
9... a6
{ This thematic move covers b5 and frees the a7-square for the Bishop. } 10. h3
Bc5
{ Black's main plan is to play ... b5 followed by ... Bb7 but watch out for the e5 trick from White! We can always support our plan by playing ... Qc7 and/or ... Rb8. }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Be3
{ The 3rd most popular move in this position. What is quite heart-warming is that it scores barely 40% for White ! White follows the usual plan of building the so-called Yugoslav Attack by continuing with f3 and Qd2. Fortunately, the Four Knights Sicilian is not the opening that this plan will work against. I will say more ! It is probably the line in the Sicilian where the Yugoslav is the least efficient against ! }
6... Bb4
{ Developing and putting pressure on the e4-pawn. White should start feeling the heat now ! It is incredible how quickly this position may go downhill for our opponent. }
7. f3 { Insisting on the Yugoslav setup will lead to trouble. } 7... d5
{ That's why it is useful to keep the pawn on d7 - we can strike with ... d5 in one move ! }
8. Bb5
{ White usually pins his hopes on this move. Unsurprisingly, Black will be better at the end and White's practical score of 30% proves that something is wrong !   8.exd5  Nxd5  is already much worse for White who is under pressure and will be forced to lose more tempos with the minor pieces. One fine point is  9.Nxc6  bxc6  10.Bd2  O-O!  with the point that  11.Nxd5  exd5!  doesn't lose the piece due to  12.Bxb4  Qh4+  with a big advantage for Black.   8.Nxc6  bxc6  9.e5  Nd7  is also unappealing for White. }
8... Bd7
{ 8... Qc7 is also popular but I prefer to keep things simple and develop the light-squared Bishop. }
9. Bxc6 Bxc6
{ But not  9...bxc6 ?!  10.e5  and suddenly, White is undeservedly better  ! }
10. e5
{ Taking on c6 won't help White since there is still pressure on e4 that is difficult to cope with. }
10... Nd7 11. f4 Qh4+
{ Once again, our opponent is ready to castle and we want to make this as hard as possible. }
12. g3 Bxc3+
{ Great timing ! White was ready to play Qd2 to protect the Knight. } 13. bxc3
Qh3
{ Black will castle short and play ... Rfc8 next targetting White's weak c-pawns. Note that with the Rook on c8 ... Nc5 is a valid option since after Nxc6 there is ... Rxc6 protecting the Knight on c5. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Be2
{ White's 4th most popular option. White just wants to finish development as fast as possible and castle. It is a good plan in most cases but against the Four Knights, it is not so efficient. I don't say it is completely harmless because Black must avoid some pitfalls but it doesn't guarantee White any push for the edge. }
6... Bb4 { Pin for a win ! } 7. O-O
{ Only this pawn sacrifice enables White to fight for anything. } 7... Bxc3
{ We should accept the pawn sacrifice to get a position typical for our line. Something like ... d6 is too slow to my taste and would lead to a Scheveningen-type-of position. }
8. bxc3 Nxe4 9. Qd3
{ It is a dangerous line to face but not as threatening as 9. Bd3. } 9... d5
{ We have to keep the Knight active on e4. A lot of forcing variations can arise from this position but in all of them Black is at least equal at the end. }
10. Ba3 { Only this move enables White to get decent compensation. } 10... Qa5
11. Nb5 { Only this way. Everything else is dubious. } 11... a6 12. Nd6+ Nxd6

8. bxc3 Nxe4 9. Bd3
{ A critical variation. White sacrifices two pawns for a dangerous initiative. If I need to pick up one or two variations from the whole course then I would definitely go for 6. Ndb5 Bb4 7. Bf4 chapter and the line that we start to analyse now. }
9... d5 10. Ba3
{ I think this is the most dangerous version of the Ba3 plan for Black to face. White's pieces are on good squares and we must react very precisely. Laziness won't do any good - it requires some memorization.   Note that  10.Bxe4  dxe4  will transpose to the 9.Bf3  d5  10.Bxe4  dxe4 from the main course. }
10... Qa5
{ The Bishop on a3 has to be challenged. If White has time for Qg4 then we are in trouble. It is important to keep our opponent busy. }
11. Qc1
{ I would consider this position to be critical for the whole 6. Be2 line. White has good compensation and Black must show some defensive skills to get a good position. }
11... Nxc3
{ Only this way. We go into a full-greed mode but it is more about digging a hole under the Knight on d4 than winning a pawn. }
12. Nb3 Qc7
{ Black's two basic plans are to go for ... f6 or ... d4 fighting for the dark squares. The King's ideal place is on f7. See more lines starting from this position in the 6. Be2 chapter. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. a3
{ Initially, I thought that this move will be easy to handle but things are not that simple. White wastes a tempo on a flank move but ... Bb4 is prevented and we have to look for an alternative plan. }
6... Be7
{ I think that this is the most flexible move. We will sometimes abandon the ... d5 plan but for now I would prefer to keep it as an option. Of course, if you are a Taimanov player, then you can play ... Qc7 and have an improved version of that opening with the White pawn on a3, but since this is a Four Knights Sicilian, then we will play more in style of it. }
7. Be3 { One of the most standard options. White will play Be2 or f4 next. }
7... O-O
{ Flexibility is the key. It is better to castle since it is a move that we will play anyway and only then decide on a further plan. }
8. Be2 d5
{ This is a benefit of keeping the pawn on d7 as usual in this opening. ... e5 is a big idea now forcing White to react.   However, if you are not fine with the positions that will be seen in this and the next game, then you can go for  8...d6  and play a more complex setup. }
9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5 11. O-O Nxd4 12. Qxd4 Qxd4 13. Bxd4 Bd7
{ We managed to exchange some pieces but we have to be careful since White has some tiny initiative. }
14. Bf3 Bc6 15. Bxc6 bxc6
{ Although the pawn on c6 is a weakness I think it is very close to an equal position. Check out the game Chigaev - Korobov, Eu-ch 2019 for more details. }

{ Setting a kind of Maroczy structure and preparing ... c4 winning a piece due to the b3-pawn being overloaded. }
15. Bb5
{ 15.exd5?!  is bad for White after  15...Bxa4  and here the most natural move  16.bxa4??  loses on the spot due to  16...c4!  followed by ... Qb6+ picking up the b2-Bishop.   15.exd5?!  Bxa4  16.d6  is the only move for White but after  16...Qb6  17.dxe7  c4+  Black is better. }

I think that Black has almost enough compensation but I have a feeling that it is always possible for White to press here while I am not fully convinced that it works well for Black. Still, a possible line to try in practice.   12...O-O  is the other idea but I think it is impractical due to  13.Bh6 !  By playing 12... a5 Black defends the Knight and prepares ... Ba6 without committing anything. Also, it might sound stupid but it frees the a7-square for the Black Queen ! }
13. a3
{ 13.Qg4?  Qa7!  is a surprising but a very strong resource with the point being that  14.Qxg7  runs into  14...O-O-O  and Black's position is already dominant. }

{ Black's next move is ... Ba6 against most of White's options. } 15. h4

15... h5 16. Qe4 f5
{ It is necessary to play this move immediately. If we waste a move on something like  16...a4  , then White will play  17.Rh3  and  17...f5  can be answered with  18.exf6  Nxf6  19.Rf3  with a serious advantage for White.  The biggest point of ... f5 is that we need to get our King to the 7th rank to bring the h8-Rook into the game. ... Ba6 comes next and the King will be very safe on f7. The fact that White doesn't have a Knight to jump into g5 is quite significant. }

18. Rd3 a5
{ Preparing ... a4 and ... Rab8/... Rcb8. Let me tell you a small secret about that endgame. In many cases, we even want to give White the c5-pawn. That would enable us to open up the c-file for our pieces. My friend Leela claims that whenever White goes for the c-pawn it is going to backfire quite badly. Check out the main chapter for a more thorough analysis of this endgame. }

Ne4
{ The most dangerous system favoured by many of the top players. Together with 6. Ndb5 Bb4 7. a3 I consider it to be the most dangerous weapon against our setup. White's plan is to play a well-timed c4 and push all of our pieces back while using the d6-square. Things are however far from simple. The e5-pawn is a target and White will be often forced to defend it by f4. Black has many different setups possible but I decided to go for a rather rare and original one. }
8... Bb7
{ Only the 4th most popular move but I really like it. Black's idea is to play ... c5 opening up the Bishop and preparing an attack on the d6-pawn by playing ... Qc7. }
9. Be2
{ The most popular and the best move for White. Our opponent will most probably castle next and claim that the space advantage counts for something. }
9... c5
{ Black has to grab some space and activate the b7-Bishop.   9...Qc7?  which was our move in the previous line doesn't work well here, due to the presence of the White Bishop on  e2  instead of  d3  .  10.Nd6+!  Bxd6  11.exd6  works well for White since  11...Qxd6??  loses to  12.c4!.  With the Bishop on d3 this trick wouldn't work for White because the d-file is blocked. }
10. O-O Qc7
{ Not only planning to take on e5 but keeping the ... c4 idea for the future. For now, White is forced to defend the e-pawn. }
11. c4
{ The other idea is  11.f4  but Black has  11...c4 !  grabbing space with equal chances.  Going back to c4 it forces the Knight to move and we have a surprising resource at our disposal. }
11... Ne3 { 11...Qxe5 ?!  12.cxd5  Qxe4  13.Bf3 !  is too risky for Black. }
12. Bxe3 Bxe4
{ After the Knights exchange we don't have to worry about any Nd6+ ideas. Normally, the Bishop will go to e7, we will castle kingside and then ... Bc6 and ... Qb7 followed by ... Rab8 will come. }
13. Bf4 { This way of defending e5 is inferior to 13. f4. } 13... Be7
{ We will play ... Qb7 followed by ... Bc6 if necessary. } 14. Bf3 Qb7 15. Bxe4
Qxe4 16. Qc1 O-O
{ Black's plan is to put the Queen on b7 and the kingside Rook on b8 to provoke b3. After that the a-pawn will march up to a4 to create a weakness on b3. }

13. f3 { 13.Bf3  allows  13...c4  with good counterplay. } 13... Qb6
{ Played only once but I chose this move by a process of elimination.   13...c4  14.Qd4  O-O  15.Bxc4  Qxd6  is a mainline but leads to a position not to my liking.   13...Nb6 ?!  was my first intention but after  14.a4 !  Black is already significantly worse  !  After 13... Qb6 !? our main idea is to get ... c4 in. }
14. c4 { The most promising continuation. } 14... Nb4 15. Be3
{ This move pins the c-pawn and thereby introduces the threat to win it by putting a pawn on b4 after Black plays ... Nc6. If necessary White will force this with a3. }
15... a5
{ This is the only way to deal with White's threat, with the obvious idea to meet any b2 - b4 with ... axb4.   15...Nc6 ?  would be inaccurate due to  16.b4 !  with a big advantage for White. }
16. Qd2 O-O 17. b3 Nc6 { ... Nd4 with or without ... e5 comes next. } 18. Rad1
e5 19. f4 Rae8
{ White managed to temporarily prevent our plan of ... Nd4 and enjoys a slight advantage. Still, ... Nd4 is an idea and the Bishop on b7 is quite strong, so it is not a depressive position which we have to defend forever, but we have our chances. All in all, I think that the system with 8... Bb7 and 9... c5 is quite underrated and hasn't been analysed anywhere so I think it might come as a surprise for your opponents. }

{ If you decide to include the Four Knights Sicilian into your repertoire, then this is the move that you will see most often.

However, when a number of lines that I was really concerned about reached too big of a number, I decided not to look at it ever again. I think that 6... Bb4 is the best move for Black in this position and only in a few cases, White will be able to claim a marginal advantage.   That being said,  6...d6  is an interesting move order to reach the Sveshnikov Sicilian after  7.Bf4  e5  8.Bg5. }
7. Nd6+
{ From all of White's 7th move alternatives, this is the most common one. White doesn't wait for anything and just jumps to d6 making a 4th move with the same Knight. }

{ When you will work through the course, you will eventually be accustomed to this idea. Black attacks the Knight forcing White to decide its future. }
8. Nxc8+
{ It is not as bad here as in the Bg5 ideas from the main course, but taking on c8 is not a good option for White. Note that our opponent makes 5 moves with the same piece to capture the undeveloped Bishop and force the Rook onto the best square. }

{ Finally, after at least two trips to Mordor and back, we are back to Shire, where the grass is green and life peaceful. This is how I would compare the previous chapters with this and next two. 7. a3 is by far White's most popular move and is widely considered to be a move that gives White an easy advantage. I agree with the part that there are lines where Black's position will be SLIGHTLY inferior but these can be counted on the fingers of one hand. And as I've said, White will be only marginally better. }
7... Bxc3+
{ We are forced to give up the dark-squared Bishop but we will have other positive aspects of our position. }
8. Nxc3 d5
{ This is Black's basic idea. We lost the dark-squared Bishop but as usual, our Knights are on the perfect squares and we immediately start challenging White's centre. }
9. Bd3
{ This is around 10 times less popular than 9. exd5 which is the topic of the final two chapters. White doesn't commit to exd5 yet and just develops the Bishop. The disadvantage is that we will be able to push the pawn to d4. }
9... d4
{ I don't like  9...dxe4  10.Nxe4  Nxe4  11.Bxe4  Qxd1+  12.Kxd1  which is playable but extremely hard to push for a win with Black. White enjoys a pair of Bishops for free and I consider this position to be very impractical. }
10. Ne2 e5
{ Black managed to build a nice pawn duo in the centre. Also, the fact that we exchanged the dark-squared Bishop is quite beneficial since these pawns are on the dark squares and the Bishop would be blocked by them. }
11. O-O O-O
{ This is more or less the starting position of the 9. Bd3 line. White enjoys a pair of Bishops but Black has some space advantage. One plan for Black to remember is that whenever White goes for f4 we will play ... exf4 followed by planting one of the Knights on e5 - most probably the f6-Knight. Our preferred way should be ... Ng4 - e5 because sometimes we might jump into e3 from g4. The alternative way is ... Nd7 - e5. }
12. Ng3 { White prepares to play f4. } 12... Be6
{ ... Nd7 is our next move to prepare ... exf4 followed by ... Nde5 as a response to f4. }

{ Even stronger than 14... Nd7. Black not only wants to play ... Nge5 but ... Ne3 is an option that White has to parry. }
15. Nf5 Nge5
{ Black will follow up with ... f6 and ... Rc8 with a complicated position. White has a pair of Bishops but Black has a perfect Knight on e5. }

{ Both Bishops prevent kingside castling from the opponent but I think that White's pawn structure is weaker and it is easier for Black to find a decent plan. One plan is to play ... Rb8 and bring the Rook into the game while pushing central pawns can also be an option. Note that the King can hide after ... f6 and ... Kf7   while the same plan for White doesn't work due to  14.f3??  Qh4+  and the Bishop is history. }

White follows the usual plan of building the so-called Yugoslav Attack by continuing with f3 and Qd2. Fortunately, the Four Knights Sicilian is not the opening that this plan will work against.

Only at this point does Stockfish start to 'understand' that White's position is just bad.  I think it is a good example why sometimes we shouldn't believe engines, especially on lower depths. That means that the position after 27. Qxd5 is just better for Black ! }

{ There are a few basic plans that I recommend remembering in this position:  1   Black's basic idea is connected with the move ... Re8 to put more pressure on White's centre.  2   Whenever the Bishop abandons c1, the b2-pawn becomes our target and we should focus on preparing ... Qb6. Warning! - it doesn't work well with the White Bishop on g5 because then Bxf6 would be unpleasant to meet.  3   With the White Bishop on g5, we will most probably change our plans to ... Qd6, but we will also try to find different moves of breaking the annoying pin.  4   If White plays f3:  a  We always want to have ... Bh5 as a response.  b  If our pawn is on h6, then after f3 from White we can't play ... Bh5 due to Nf4 so we can't allow that to happen.  c  After White plays f3, our long-term goal is to plant the Knight on the weakened e3-square.  5   If White chooses to play b4 we should include ... a5 as one of our main ideas. }
