{ Welcome to my fourth Chessable course!    This was one of the most ambitious projects I've taken on so far, that is how to maximize White's chances for an advantage against the tricky Pirc, Modern and Philidor Defenses.  Against the Pirc and the Modern, I opted for the Austrian Attack since it's one of White's most ambitious systems and is rightly considered the main line. One of the biggest advantages of the Austrian Attack is that it works very well against both the Pirc and the Modern, and so you don't need to learn two completely different systems. We're thus 'killing two birds with one stone', which makes this repertoire quite practical.  Regarding the Philidor, I went for the mainline with Nc3, Nf3, and Bc4. In particular, I'm recommending an early a4-a5 advance which cuts down Black's options and gives White a sizeable advantage in every single variation.  I used the latest versions of Stockfish and Leela running on powerful cloud engines to thoroughly analyze every line and find White's best chances for an advantage. I also made extensive use of correspondence games and the latest version of the MegaDatabase.  I have tried to remain as objective as possible in this repertoire and have clearly pointed out the lines in which Black is able to equalize. The good news is that there are only a handful. I believe that searching for the best moves for both sides is essential when preparing an effective opening repertoire. My hope is that this repertoire is also useful for Pirc, Modern, and Philidor defense players with the black pieces. Notwithstanding, even when the final position is objectively equal, I have strived to propose continuations where White can pose several practical problems. }
1. e4 d6
{ 1...g6  2.d4  d6   2...Bg7  3.Nc3  Modern setups based on  c6  are quite tricky and need to be handled with care. I've detailed a route to a White advantage inchapter 6.  3.Nc3  Bg7  4.f4  Nf6   4...a6  This variation of the Modern was popularized by GM Tiger Persson and is thus usually referred to as Tiger's Modern. We're going to take the bite out of this hypermodern setup inchapter 7.  5.Nf3  Transposes to the Pirc Defense, making this repertoire very practical. }
2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3
{ 3...c6  4.f4  Qa5  The Czech Pirc is covered inchapter 5. White can count on a clear advantage after  5.e5!   3...e5  The Philidor, including the Black Lion, is covered inchapter 8. }
3... g6 4. f4
{ The biggest drawback of the Pirc and Modern defenses is that they fail to claim a stake in the center.    With 4.f4, we immediately take advantage of this fact by occupying the center and gaining a big space advantage. We will be aiming for setups with a quick e5, which is arguably White's most ambitious plan and one that poses Black numerous problems. }
4... Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O
{ The main line, which is tackled inchapter 2.   5...c5  This is Black's second most popular continuation and theoretically one of the most challenging moves. I spent numerous hours trying to find an advantage for White and I'm delighted to report that I've come up with several strong novelties that pose Black plenty of practical problems. Check outchapter 3 for the details.  Alternatives on move 5 such as   5...c6   5...a6  and   5...Bg4  are covered inchapter 4 - 5th move offshoots. With these continuations, Black is trying to retain a large degree of flexibility and steer clear of the main theoretical battlegrounds. However, this comes at a cost and White can count on a significant edge against all of these moves. }

1. e4 d6
{ 1...g6  2.d4  Bg7  3.Nc3  c6   3...d6  4.f4  a6  This variation was recommended by CM Vjekoslav Nemec in his Chessable course 'The Modern Defense against everything'. I show how White can get a clear advantage in the5...b5 #5 variation.   3...c5  The Sniper, which was popularized by FM Charlie Storey in the book 'The Sniper: Play 1...g6, ...Bg7 And ...c5!'. Storey's recommendations are tackled in theSniper #5 andSniper #6 variations. White can count on a clear advantage in both lines.  4.f4  d5  5.e5  Nh6  This variation was recommended by GM Victor Bologan in his 2017 Chessbase FritzTrainer 'The Modern Pirc'. White can count on a slight advantage, as detailed in the3...c6 5...Nh6 #3 variation.   5...h5  6.Nf3  Nh6  7.Bd3  Bf5  This continuation was recommended by IM Cyrus Lakdawala in his book for Everyman Chess 'Opening Repertoire: The Modern Defence', which was published in 2019. Lakdawala however does not mention White's strongest plan, which grants the first player a clear advantage. See the3..c6 5...h5 #2 variation for the details. }
2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6
{ 3...e5  4.Nf3  Nbd7   4...exd4  The Antonishin variation, which was recommended by GM Erik Zude and IM Jörg Hick in their Book/Chessable course 'Play 1...d6 against everything'. Their specific recommendation is tackled in the4...exd4 #2 variation, where White has a clear advantage.  5.Bc4  Be7  6.a4  c6   6...O-O  7.O-O  c6  was recommended by IM Gerard Welling and FM Steve Giddins in Side-Stepping Mainline Theory. See how White can obtain a pleasant edge in the4...Nbd7 #8 variation.  7.a5  Qc7  was recommended by GM Simon Williams in his Chessable course 'The Black Lion'. He recommended two different setups, which are covered in the4...Nbd7 #3 and4...Nbd7 #4 variations. White can count on a clear advantage against both of these. }
4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O
{ 5...c5  This variation was recommended by GM Mihail Marin in his excellent 2018 'GM Repertoire: The Pirc Defense' for Quality Chess and in the fresh off the press 'The Modernized Modern Defense' book by GM Daniel Fernandez  (published August 2020)  . I propose a strong novelty on move 19, suggested by both Leela and Stockfish running on powerful hardware, that is not covered in either of these books. This leads, at the very least, to a two result endgame where White has a slight advantage and Black needs to play very precisely to hold the draw @@StartBracket@@while White has no risk@@EndBracket@@. Please see the6...Bd7 #13 variation for the details. }
6. e5 Nfd7
{ 6...dxe5  This variation was recommended by GM Alexei Kornev in the book 'A practical Black Repertoire with Nf6, g6, d6' for ChessStars. It does not equalize and Kornev did not cover my recommendation on move 13, which grants White a slight advantage. See the6...dxc3 8... Be6 #2 variation for the details. }
7. Bc4 Nb6 8. Bb3 Na6
{ This continuation was recommended by GM Mihail Marin in his 2014 Chessbase DVD 'Play the Pirc like a Grandmaster: Vol. 2 Attacking lines'. Marin only considered 9.Ne4, which is clearly inferior to my recommendation of 9.Be3. The details can be found in the6...Nfd7 7...Nb6 8...Na6 variation. }
9. Be3 c6
{ This was GM Tiger Persson's main recommendation in his 2018 GingerGM DVD 'Tiger on the Modern'. This is addressed in the6...Nfd7 7...Nb6 8...Na6 #1 variation, where White can count on a slight advantage.   9...c5  10.Qe2  Bg4  11.O-O  Qc8  This move was recommended by GM Tiger Persson in his 2014 book for Quality Chess 'The Modern Tiger'. However, it fails to equalize as shown in the6...Nfd7 7...Nb6 8...Na6 #2 variation. }

{ This position was reached in three games, where 2600+ GM Onischuk was playing Black. In all three games, the lower rated White player forced a draw with Rxe5. However, White should continue the game.  Note that the bishop on f4 is taboo as after   21...Bxf4  22.Re8+−  Black has no good way of stopping f8=Q.   21...Rb8  leads to a draw by repetition after  22.Rxe5  Nxe5  23.Qe1  Kf6  24.Qh4  Kg7  25.Qe1  with a draw. }
22. g3
{ This position is objectively equal, but far from an easy one for Black to play. The pawn on f7 is a bone in Black's throat and White can improve his position with moves like a4, Qg5, and even Re3 later on, whilst it's not clear what Black should do.  If you only need a draw then   22.Rxe5  Nxe5  23.Qe1  leads to a repetition after  Kf6  24.Qh4+  Kg7  25.Qe1  Kf6  26.Qh4+  Draw. }

Nevertheless, Black's king will be left on e8 for quite a while, which is a significant drawback that White can look to exploit. }

4... a6
{ This hypermodern opening gained some popularity after GM Tiger Persson published an opening book recommending this setup for Black. Black leaves his king in the center and seeks to quickly develop his queenside pieces in an attempt to undermine our center. This move was played by several strong GMs, including elite players such as Fabiano Caruana and Magnus Carlsen. However, White's route to a considerable advantage has been found. In fact, GM Tiger Persson has given up this defense precisely because of the lines I'm about to show. }
