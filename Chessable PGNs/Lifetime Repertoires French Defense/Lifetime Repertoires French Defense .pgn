1. e4 e6
{ The topic of this course is the French Defence, which arises after the moves 1.e4 e6 and is the third most popular opening against 1.e4. The French Defence, named after a correspondence chess match between the cities of London and Paris in 1834 @@StartBracket@@god bless Wikipedia@@EndBracket@@ is a fighting, yet reliable weapon at any level from the amateurs and club players, all the way up to the very top. It is strategically positioned between 1.e4 e5 which is too symmetric and 1.e4 c5 which is too risky @@StartBracket@@I don't know how else to sell you this opening@@EndBracket@@ and has been used by many strong players throughout history.I personally have played the French as my first childhood opening and although I haven't returned to it all too much, I still have a soft spot for it, in particular for the fascinating Winawer variation @@StartBracket@@we will get to that!@@EndBracket@@. }
2. d4 d5
{ These moves are usually played automatically @@StartBracket@@although sidelines on move 2 will be carefully examined in this course too of course@@EndBracket@@ and now White is choosing between 3.e5, 3.Nd2 and by far the most critical, as well as the most popular move: 3.Nc3. Oh, and of course there are people who play 3.exd5 here. }
3. Nc3
{ 3.Nd2  This is really the most solid move. I have suffered in the positions that arise after 3...Nf6 all of my childhood, but fortunately now that I am old and wise, I know better.  3...c5  4.exd5  Qxd5  and as the d4- and c5-pawns get traded, we get a particular structure that requires some care and experience. I will give you care, but you will have to gain the experience yourself.  5.Ngf3  cxd4  6.Bc4  Qd6  7.O-O  Nf6  8.Nb3  Nc6  9.Nbxd4  Nxd4  10.Nxd4  This is one of the tabiyas here.   3.e5  This move is clearly principled too and some even claim this to be the best way to punish our petite French adventure. Not so easy.  3...c5  4.c3  Nc6  5.Nf3  Qb6  and while structurally, White has a lot of potential on the kingside, due to his advanced e5-pawn and the h4-h5 potential, in reality he has to deal with nasty pressure on the d4- and b2-pawns. As we will see, Black is in good theoretical shape here, if he knows what he is doing.   3.exd5  exd5  It is very possible to outplay and get outplayed in a position like this. In particular, the fact that Black hasn't committed to Nf6 yet, gives us some flexibility with plans involving Ne7. We will get to that. }
3... Bb4
{ This is the starting position of the Winawer variation. Most cultured opponents would automatically go 4.e5 here, but there are the diehards who try to be funky with moves like 4. Qg4, 4.Nge2, 4.a3, 4.Bd2 4.Bd3 and what not. Recently I even saw 4.Qd3 passing by. And of course, there are those who have studied Harikrishna's excellent Chessable course and will attempt to French toast our Winawer with 4.exd5. }
4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }
7... Qc7 8. Qxg7
{ Apart from the 8.Bd3 move that we have discussed at length, there is no other major alternative to this move at this point in time. }
8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4
{ Most of my childhood games went straight into this position and here it was considered very smart to start with 11...Bd7 and not go 11...dxc3 just yet. Many things changed ever since, but remarkably the line remains very topical. I had to face it myself against Magnus Carlsen in Wijk aan Zee just a couple of editions ago and Nepo was ready to go for it in the Candidates tournament. If it's good enough for them, it should be good enough for us. Right? }

Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board. In this chapter I want to briefly see if there are other moves and talk about some general nonsense.  Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

In this chapter I want to briefly see if there are other moves and talk about some general nonsense.  Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop.

Nh3 is a strong idea if Black would go for the b6, Ba6 plan or c5-c4 push too early, because in those set-ups White's d4-pawn is not really challenged. }

7. f4
{ This is just positionally not very desirable and I think I sort of even understand why. In general, how White usually wants to push the kingside pawns is by starting with h4-h5. Then Black pretty much has to go h7-h6, as allowing h6 would chronically weaken the dark squares f6-g7.   Then White does want to push f4, g4 and eventually f5-f6. After f4 and g4 @@StartBracket@@with the inclusion of h4-h5 and h7-h6@@EndBracket@@ Black usually tries to free himself with g6 or f5, after which White can go exf6 gxf6 and Black's issues will be the weak g6-square and weak h6-pawn.   Now if we go back to this position, we realize things are completely different. g4 will now be met with h5, as will likely be h4. Besides, Black is now even more interested in the f5/ f6 break, as after exf6 gxf6 with pawns on h2 and h7, Black controls much more squares on the kingside, his g6-square is no longer weak and there is no weak h6-pawn.   Let's see how all this blabla translates into moves and come up with an example line. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board. In this chapter I want to briefly see if there are other moves and talk about some general nonsense.  Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. f4
{ This is just positionally not very desirable and I think I sort of even understand why. In general, how White usually wants to push the kingside pawns is by starting with h4-h5. Then Black pretty much has to go h7-h6, as allowing h6 would chronically weaken the dark squares f6-g7.   Then White does want to push f4, g4 and eventually f5-f6. After f4 and g4 @@StartBracket@@with the inclusion of h4-h5 and h7-h6@@EndBracket@@ Black usually tries to free himself with g6 or f5, after which White can go exf6 gxf6 and Black's issues will be the weak g6-square and weak h6-pawn.   Now if we go back to this position, we realize things are completely different. g4 will now be met with h5, as will likely be h4. Besides, Black is now even more interested in the f5/ f6 break, as after exf6 gxf6 with pawns on h2 and h7, Black controls much more squares on the kingside, his g6-square is no longer weak and there is no weak h6-pawn.   Let's see how all this blabla translates into moves and come up with an example line. }
7... Qa5
{ A typical move. In general, we often want to force White to go Bd2. The thing is, we eventually will close the position with c4 and then White will want to go a4 and Ba3. Deep stuff guys. }
8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. Nf3 c4 10. a4
{ White can postpone playing this move, when Black can also just ignore its absence or lock the queenside with the thematic Qa4, making sure that a4 and Bc1-Ba3 is never on the cards. }

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

{ 9...Qa4  looks natural too, but after  10.cxd5  Nxd5  11.h4!  followed by some h5 and Rh4 ideas, I couldn't find a good way for Black to proceed. }

cxd4 15. Re1 { An automatic move - this is where the rook belongs. } 15... Bc6
{ And that's where the bishop belongs. White has all sorts of ideas like Bb4, Qg4, Qh5, but Black seems to be holding. For example: }
16. Bb4
{ This move is slightly annoying, but Black can work around the d6-bishop. }
16... O-O 17. Bd6 Qd7
{ Black will move the f8-rook and play Nf5 with a fine position. } *

Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Nf3 b6
{ This is the most principled move and the one pointing out the downsides of the move 7.Nf3 compared to 7.a4, so I feel obliged to make it our main move. There are alternatives though, in particular ideas with Bd7 are very interesting, trying to transpose into the line I recommend against 7.a4.   Here we want to trade the bishops on a6, which is a good idea at this point, as White no longer has Qg4, nor does he have the Nh3-Nf4-Nh5 plan at his disposal. }
8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bd3 Ba4
{ A good positional move, stopping a3-a4 once and for all and not letting the c1-bishop out onto the a3-f8 diagonal. Black eventually wants to lock the position, but there is no need to start with c5-c4 just yet. A special mention deserves the move  9...Bc8!?  intending to trade via a6 after all, but I dislike the fact that we gave White a free move with Bd3. }
10. h4
{ By the far the most popular and sensible approach. White's plan generally should be to push h5 and then gradually or not so gradually push the g- and f-pawns forward too. }
10... h6 { No need to make this move before h5, but also why not. } 11. h5
{ 11.O-O  can be played first too and will come down to a similar thing. }
11... c4 12. Be2
{ There is an incredibly beautiful plan here, which any Winawer player must definitely know and probably play once or twice too, to boost the ego and impress the fellow clubmates, and that is Kd7! and Qg8-Qh7. I am highly skeptical of this being that smart, because I am not sure it is worth all the tempi, as the c2-pawn will be defended and the queen is very likely also well-placed closer to the center on d7, but I nevertheless spent half of my childhood hoping for a chance to get to play it. }
12... Na6 13. Bf4 Qd7 14. Nh2 O-O-O 15. Ng4 Nc7 16. Ne3 Nf5
{ Nothing is going on here, Black is doing fine after trading a pair of knights as well, and can think of preparing a pawn push on the kingside eventually. }

{ This is the most principled move and the one pointing out the downsides of the move 7.Nf3 compared to 7.a4, so I feel obliged to make it our main move. There are alternatives though, in particular ideas with Bd7 are very interesting, trying to transpose into the line I recommend against 7.a4.

14. O-O Qa7
{ I am sure there may be another way to play this position, but castling short seems too inflexible and dangerous and I also don't think we should rush the maneuvre Kd8-Kc7-Kb7 just yet. This move prepares Ra2 and in the long run b5-b4 is an idea. The king is for now flexible on e8. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade.

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade.

Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade.

The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }
7... Qa5
{ There barely is any difference whether we start with Nbc6 or Qa5, they are practically identical. }
8. Qd2 { This is more than logical, keeping the bishop on the c1-a3 diagonal. }
8... Nbc6
{ 8...b6  is one rare example of an extra option that we have if we start with 7...Qa5 over Nbc6. After  9.Bb5+  Bd7  10.Bd3  Black  has a lot of ideas @@StartBracket@@Bxa4, c4, b5, Nbc6@@EndBracket@@ all of which are interesting, but risky as well. }
9. Nf3 Bd7
{ This is the main theoretical move and it works fine as well. It is also relevant for us if we choose to meet 7.Nf3 with Bd7 8.a4 Qa5 9.Qd2 Nbc6 when we ended up in this exact position. White now has three main options. }
10. Bd3 { The most popular move. } 10... f6
{ 10...c4  is also often played, but I am not sure I like it here, as the bishop on c1 will terrorize us from a3. }
11. O-O fxe5
{ Again, some plans with c4 and 0-0-0 are possible, but it seems to me that White has a good version here, having kept his bishop on c1. }
12. Nxe5 { The stronger move it seems. } 12... Nxe5 13. dxe5 O-O 14. c4
{ If Black gets some time, he has plenty of ideas, such as b5!? and Be8-Bg6. }
14... Qxd2 { Qc7 is also possible, but the endgame is obviously a safer bet. }
15. Bxd2 Bc6
{ I don't imagine White being able to do much with his bishop pair given our superior pawn structure on the queenside and all the potential knight jumps. }

The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }
7... Qa5
{ There barely is any difference whether we start with Nbc6 or Qa5, they are practically identical. }
8. Qd2 { This is more than logical, keeping the bishop on the c1-a3 diagonal. }
8... Nbc6
{ 8...b6  is one rare example of an extra option that we have if we start with 7...Qa5 over Nbc6. After  9.Bb5+  Bd7  10.Bd3  Black  has a lot of ideas @@StartBracket@@Bxa4, c4, b5, Nbc6@@EndBracket@@ all of which are interesting, but risky as well. }
9. Nf3 Bd7
{ This is the main theoretical move and it works fine as well. It is also relevant for us if we choose to meet 7.Nf3 with Bd7 8.a4 Qa5 9.Qd2 Nbc6 when we ended up in this exact position. White now has three main options. }
10. Ba3
{ This forces an endgame, as c4 seems undesirable here with White having put the bishop on a3 so easily. }
10... cxd4 11. cxd4 Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 Nf5 13. Bb2 Na5
{ followed by Nc4 with obvious play on the queenside. White has full control over the dark squares and the bishop pair, but the position is quite closed and the light squares are ours, so there isn't too much to worry about. }
14. h4 { This move should be met with } 14... h5
{ Not allowing White to roll over on the kingside with h5, g4 and so on. } *

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }
7... Qa5
{ There barely is any difference whether we start with Nbc6 or Qa5, they are practically identical. }
8. Qd2 { This is more than logical, keeping the bishop on the c1-a3 diagonal. }
8... Nbc6

9. Nf3 b6
{ The queen on a5 is sort of locked out, but it seems to work out fine for us. }
10. Bb5 Ba6 11. Rb1
{ Our queen on a5 is stuck for now, but we have a way to free it. } 11... Bxb5
12. axb5 Nd8
{ A little more impatient than the more ambitious alternative of Nb8-Nd7. We are now ready to go a6 next and keep the b-pawn in check after dxc5 bxc5 b6, when the knight from d8 covers the b7-square. }
13. O-O a6 { White has a lot of options here, but nothing too scary. } 14. dxc5
bxc5 15. b6
{ This is a little bit of an all-in, as clearly the b-pawn will not have a very long career and is served as a distraction here. }

{ Now we have to show some class and bring the king instantly to where it should go. }
17... Kd7

My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }

Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.

Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play.

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }

8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. Nf3
{ 9.f4  We have pretty much already discussed this move in the chapter about 7th move sidelines.  See here. }
9... Bd7
{ This is a major tabiya with quite some classical games. White usually chooses between Be2 and the cunning Bb5, provoking a6 first. Black in turn is always choosing between the direct f6, allowing a mess after c3-c4, and starting with c5-c4 first, which is slower but more reliable. }

{ We would slightly prefer to have our pawn on a7 here, but frankly it doesn't change the evaluation too much. White still has some passive light pieces and a bunch of weak queenside pawns, all of which provides us with enough assets for the formal pawn deficit. }

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }
7... Qa5
{ There barely is any difference whether we start with Nbc6 or Qa5, they are practically identical. }
8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. Nf3
{ 9.f4  We have pretty much already discussed this move in the chapter about 7th move sidelines.  See here. }
9... Bd7
{ This is a major tabiya with quite some classical games. White usually chooses between Be2 and the cunning Bb5, provoking a6 first. Black in turn is always choosing between the direct f6, allowing a mess after c3-c4, and starting with c5-c4 first, which is slower but more reliable. }
10. Be2 { The main move. } 10... c4
{ This is a very simple way of playing, but probably better to start with  10...h6  in this case. }
11. Ng5
{ The extra option White gets. If  11.O-O  , Black can try the interesting  11...f6!?  , or just go  11...h6  transposing into the 10... h6 11. O-O c4 position.  See here. }
11... h6 12. Nh3 O-O-O 13. Nf4
{ The knight on h5 limits our potential play on the kingside, but it's not a big deal. }
13... Kb8 14. Nh5 Rdg8 { The g7-pawn needs protection. } 15. O-O Nc8
{ The knight also has some future on b6, apparently! } 16. Bg4 Qd8 17. Bc1
{ Very logical, to try to get the bishop to a3 after all. } 17... a5 18. Ba3
Ka7 19. f4 N6e7
{ Black can keep the queenside locked with Ka6 and b6, but it's better to stay flexible with the pawn on b7, and keep the Nb6-xa4 idea open for now. Black can also react on the kingside, with g6 and after Nf6, going Rg7 followed by Ng8, chasing the knight away and pushing f5 eventually. }

Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }

9... Bd7
{ This is a major tabiya with quite some classical games. White usually chooses between Be2 and the cunning Bb5, provoking a6 first. Black in turn is always choosing between the direct f6, allowing a mess after c3-c4, and starting with c5-c4 first, which is slower but more reliable. }
10. Be2 { The main move. } 10... f6
{ It is much simpler to first lock the position with 10...c4 and avoid all the direct complications, but as a tribute to old theory and just for fun, I propose we have a close look at this fascinating position! }
11. c4 Qc7 12. cxd5 Nxd5 13. c4

13... Nde7 14. exf6 gxf6 15. d5

15... exd5 16. cxd5 Nxd5 17. Qc2

17... Ncb4

Qe4+ Kd8 { It looks insane, but it will work out fine. } 19. O-O Re8 20. Qc4 a5
{ The black king is doing much better than it seems. White's pieces aren't well coordinated and once we get Ra6 and Kc8, the position will start to look very nice. And not to forget, we are a pawn up. }

Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }
7... Qa5
{ There barely is any difference whether we start with Nbc6 or Qa5, they are practically identical. }
8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. Nf3
{ 9.f4  We have pretty much already discussed this move in the chapter about 7th move sidelines.  See here. }
9... Bd7
{ This is a major tabiya with quite some classical games. White usually chooses between Be2 and the cunning Bb5, provoking a6 first. Black in turn is always choosing between the direct f6, allowing a mess after c3-c4, and starting with c5-c4 first, which is slower but more reliable. }
10. Be2 { The main move. } 10... f6
{ It is much simpler to first lock the position with 10...c4 and avoid all the direct complications, but as a tribute to old theory and just for fun, I propose we have a close look at this fascinating position! }

11... gxf6 12. c4 Qc7 13. cxd5 Nxd5 14. c3

14... O-O-O 15. O-O Rhg8 16. a5

16... e5 17. a6 { The most consistent. } 17... Bh3 { Ignoring the a-pawn. } 18.

20... e3 { White can't take on e3 because of Rxg3!!. } 21. Bc1 Nc3
{ The knights start to perform some magic. } 22. Qd3 exf2+ 23. Kxf2 Nb4
{ Fighting for the e4-square for the other knight. } 24. Qc4 Ne4+ 25. Kg1 Nc6
{ The knight dance is over and we are suddenly winning, as Rxg3 is incoming, while the queen trade has been dodged. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4.

Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop.

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. a4
{ The purpose of this move, at least as I see it, is to prevent the idea of b6 and Ba6, which is what we do against 7. Nf3.   Here, if we go  7...b6  White will go  8.Bb5+  Bd7  9.Bd3  and we no longer have the Ba4 move, and if we choose to close the position with  9...c4  nonetheless, then White will have a juicy a3-f8 diagonal for his bishop.  My recommendation against this cunning old line is to go Qa5, provoke Bd2 and later, after finishing the development of our queenside, break the center open with f7-f6.  It will also be possible to lock the position with c5-c4 first, in which case the bishop on d2 will be misplaced, a step further away from the a3-f8 diagonal. }
7... Qa5
{ There barely is any difference whether we start with Nbc6 or Qa5, they are practically identical. }
8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. Nf3
{ 9.f4  We have pretty much already discussed this move in the chapter about 7th move sidelines.  See here. }
9... Bd7
{ This is a major tabiya with quite some classical games. White usually chooses between Be2 and the cunning Bb5, provoking a6 first. Black in turn is always choosing between the direct f6, allowing a mess after c3-c4, and starting with c5-c4 first, which is slower but more reliable. }
10. Be2 { The main move. } 10... f6
{ It is much simpler to first lock the position with 10...c4 and avoid all the direct complications, but as a tribute to old theory and just for fun, I propose we have a close look at this fascinating position! }
11. exf6
{ White usually takes and goes c4 in some order, but there are some differences here. }
11... gxf6 12. c4 Qc7 13. cxd5 Nxd5 14. c3
{ This modest looking move is very sensible. White keeps control over the center, after all. }
14... O-O-O 15. O-O Rhg8 16. Re1
{ This is the established move, but there are alternatives. } 16... Na5
{ The old theory is 16...e5 based on some ancient game of Korchnoi against Spassky. Not to disrespect the legends of the game, and while e5 is actually a very sensible move, I would still prefer to stick with the computer recommendation. The point of this weird looking move is first of all to establish domination over the light squares on the queenside with c4 and also to free the c6-square for the bishop. }
17. dxc5 { Otherwise c5-c4 was coming. } 17... Bc6 18. Qb1
{ The only move for White not to lose to all the pins. } 18... Nf4 19. Bxf4
Qxf4 20. Qb4 { White is just in time to neutralize Black's initiative. } 20...
Qxb4 21. cxb4 Nb3 22. Rad1 Rg4

{ Not falling for  25...Rxb4  26.Nd2!. } 26. Bxb3 Bxb3
{ The bishop is not hanging because of the back rank. } 27. Nd2 Ba2
{ and Black saves the piece after all and with it the game. White should take the rook and the ensuing knight vs bishop endgame is just a draw. }

However, after Rb1 or Qb1, if Black is to close the position with c4, he gets a similar position as in our main line.   Also  9.Qg4!?  Qxc2  is some sort of a mess that needs further investigation. Do keep this line in mind, though, it could be our back up for the future. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4

Qg4, 4.Nge2, 4.a3, 4.Bd2 4.Bd3 and what not. Recently I even saw 4.Qd3 passing by.

4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

8. h5
{ Not including h5-h6 is possible and just as sensible, but I believe it is way too subtle and highly unlikely that White would not transpose later on.

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ This is the starting position of the Winawer variation. Most cultured opponents would automatically go 4.e5 here, but there are the diehards who try to be funky with moves like 4. Qg4, 4.Nge2, 4.a3, 4.Bd2 4.Bd3 and what not. Recently I even saw 4.Qd3 passing by. And of course, there are those who have studied Harikrishna's excellent Chessable course and will attempt to French toast our Winawer with 4.exd5. }
4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. h4
{ This has suddenly become all the rage, once Nepomniachtchi picked up the Winawer for the Candidates 2020. It has been played against him twice@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ in the Candidates and later too, in the prestigious online MCI tournament.   This line has always been very critical, but I believe it is not going to be a refutation and eventually people will calm down and start exploring other areas of the Winawer as well.   That said, we have to take it seriously, especially because the way Ian and his team treated this line so far does not look very reliable to me. I propose we go our own way. }
7... Qc7
{ I am not the greatest opening historian, but as far as I remember, this hasn't quite been the main line until very recently. Now, however, with the engines screaming this is the best move, it is overtaking the more active looking plans involving Qa5. The main purpose of Qc7 is to stop Qg4 for now. }
8. h5
{ Not including h5-h6 is possible and just as sensible, but I believe it is way too subtle and highly unlikely that White would not transpose later on. We play exactly the same way as we do after the h5-h6 inclusion, so I think there is no need to double check all the same moves here again. I did that, of course, but I feel it is not neccessary to copy paste the same lines here. }
8... h6
{ Taking on c3 followed by Qc3+-Qxd4 was debated some years ago, but the lines are so much more fun for White there, and there really is no need for it. }
9. Nf3 b6
{ The most principled. Now that Qg4 is not a thing, we can introduce the Ba6 idea. Black can also just play 10...Nbc6 even here, followed by the Bd7, 0-0-0 and c4 plan and although compared to our main line, White saved a tempo on Rb1 @@StartBracket@@which is unclear how useful of a move it is@@EndBracket@@, it remains just very complicated. }
10. Bb5+ Bd7
{ This position is incredibly similar to the one in the 7.Nf3 line - we have just included the moves h4+h5 and h6+Qc7. That barely changes things, mostly it should be to White's advantage, because h4-h5 is his main plan anyway, while Black lost some flexibility. In itself, Qc7 is a very useful move, it's just that there are now less plans available to us - for example that Kd7 Qg8-Qh7 idea is off the cards. }
11. a4
{ Here too, this is very interesting. The 'theoretical' solution doesn't quite meet our strict demands, so I propose an improvement down the line. Dropping the bishop to d3 or e2 instead leads to the very standard and highly complicated position - the type we discussed at length in some of the previous chapters. }
11... Bxb5 12. axb5 a6
{ Most of the games saw Black pushing a5, which is a very clever move, sort of inducing White to take en passant on a6. In case you don't know how en passant works, chess24 has a video of Peter Svidler and Jan Gustafsson explaining that.  Jokes aside, White doesn't and actually shouldn't capture here. In fact, I believe this move is too risky for Black exactly because White keeps the queenside closed.   12...a5  13.Qd3!  This, followed by Ba3 and potentially 0-0-0, is a new set-up that has not been played yet, but is pointed out by some good engines.  13...Nd7  14.Ba3  O-O   14...O-O-O  The black king is not safe on the queenside either:  15.c4!  15.O-O-O!  and White will prepare to crush us on the kingside, while I am not sure I can offer you any counterplay here. }
13. O-O Qb7
{ 13...Ra7  is also possible, with the same idea - we need to distract White from the kingside by opening files on the queenside and getting engaged with his weak pawns. }
14. Qe2 O-O
{ I was not thrilled to see the computer push me to this direction, but somehow the lines he shows work out for us. The issue is that in this version of this position, it is hard for Black to get the king to the queenside or remain in the center, without getting in trouble. }
15. Be3 { This is not the most scary. } 15... cxd4 16. bxa6 Rxa6 17. Rxa6 Qxa6
18. Qxa6 Nxa6
{ I don't think such an endgame can be really dangerous for Black. We've got good knights and a fine pawn structure. Of course the kingside is cramped for us, but we will have counterplay on the queenside. }
19. Nxd4 Nb8 20. f4 Nbc6
{ Black doesn't mind losing the b6-pawn. He will have plenty of counterplay thanks to White's weak doubled c-pawns. }

7... Qc7
{ I am not the greatest opening historian, but as far as I remember, this hasn't quite been the main line until very recently. Now, however, with the engines screaming this is the best move, it is overtaking the more active looking plans involving Qa5. The main purpose of Qc7 is to stop Qg4 for now. }
8. h5
{ Not including h5-h6 is possible and just as sensible, but I believe it is way too subtle and highly unlikely that White would not transpose later on. We play exactly the same way as we do after the h5-h6 inclusion, so I think there is no need to double check all the same moves here again. I did that, of course, but I feel it is not neccessary to copy paste the same lines here. }
8... h6
{ Taking on c3 followed by Qc3+-Qxd4 was debated some years ago, but the lines are so much more fun for White there, and there really is no need for it. }
9. Nf3 b6
{ The most principled. Now that Qg4 is not a thing, we can introduce the Ba6 idea. Black can also just play 10...Nbc6 even here, followed by the Bd7, 0-0-0 and c4 plan and although compared to our main line, White saved a tempo on Rb1 @@StartBracket@@which is unclear how useful of a move it is@@EndBracket@@, it remains just very complicated. }
10. Bb5+ Bd7
{ This position is incredibly similar to the one in the 7.Nf3 line - we have just included the moves h4+h5 and h6+Qc7. That barely changes things, mostly it should be to White's advantage, because h4-h5 is his main plan anyway, while Black lost some flexibility. In itself, Qc7 is a very useful move, it's just that there are now less plans available to us - for example that Kd7 Qg8-Qh7 idea is off the cards. }
11. a4
{ Here too, this is very interesting. The 'theoretical' solution doesn't quite meet our strict demands, so I propose an improvement down the line. Dropping the bishop to d3 or e2 instead leads to the very standard and highly complicated position - the type we discussed at length in some of the previous chapters. }
11... Bxb5 12. axb5 a6
{ Most of the games saw Black pushing a5, which is a very clever move, sort of inducing White to take en passant on a6. In case you don't know how en passant works, chess24 has a video of Peter Svidler and Jan Gustafsson explaining that.  Jokes aside, White doesn't and actually shouldn't capture here. In fact, I believe this move is too risky for Black exactly because White keeps the queenside closed.   12...a5  13.Qd3!  This, followed by Ba3 and potentially 0-0-0, is a new set-up that has not been played yet, but is pointed out by some good engines.  13...Nd7  14.Ba3  O-O   14...O-O-O  The black king is not safe on the queenside either:  15.c4!  15.O-O-O!  and White will prepare to crush us on the kingside, while I am not sure I can offer you any counterplay here. }
13. O-O Qb7
{ 13...Ra7  is also possible, with the same idea - we need to distract White from the kingside by opening files on the queenside and getting engaged with his weak pawns. }
14. Qe2 O-O
{ I was not thrilled to see the computer push me to this direction, but somehow the lines he shows work out for us. The issue is that in this version of this position, it is hard for Black to get the king to the queenside or remain in the center, without getting in trouble. }
15. g4 { The most direct and the scariest option from what I see. } 15... axb5
16. Rxa8 Qxa8 17. g5
{ This looks too blunt, but chess can sometimes be a simple game. Oh well, enough philosophising - we gotta defend. }
17... Nf5 18. gxh6 Nc6
{ The natural  18...gxh6  falls for  19.Nh4!  Nxh4  20.Bxh6!  with the threat of  Qg4  and we are losing the f8-rook. Instead, we switch on our supercomputer and make this work by a miracle! }
19. hxg7 Kxg7 { The king is fine, ready to hide behind White's h-pawn! } 20.
h6+ Kh8 21. h7
{ White would be happy to give up the h-pawn, but we aren't taking it. } 21...

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

11. Bb5+ Kf8 { I looked at Kd8 too, which is a fun move. } 12. Bd3
{ 12.dxc5!?  This is a new move, which ruins White's pawn structure, but does attempt to reduce Black's counterplay along the c-file. With the king on f8 and computer shouting numbers at me, I am not comfortable with this position at all. It can probably be made to work - which is what I was doing before discovering our alternative solution! - but I think whenever possible, it is better to try to make work a position with the king on the queenside and our rooks connected. }

Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

7... Qc7
{ I am not the greatest opening historian, but as far as I remember, this hasn't quite been the main line until very recently. Now, however, with the engines screaming this is the best move, it is overtaking the more active looking plans involving Qa5. The main purpose of Qc7 is to stop Qg4 for now. }
8. h5
{ Not including h5-h6 is possible and just as sensible, but I believe it is way too subtle and highly unlikely that White would not transpose later on. We play exactly the same way as we do after the h5-h6 inclusion, so I think there is no need to double check all the same moves here again. I did that, of course, but I feel it is not neccessary to copy paste the same lines here. }

9. Rb1

White is just much better here.  17...Qe4  18.O-O }
10. Nf3

10... c4

Now besides developing with Bd7 and 0-0-0, we also have the option of throwing out Qa5 first here.   Starting with  10...Bd7  allows  11.Be2  O-O-O  12.a4!?  , which of course is also a very playable unclear position. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

It has been played against him twice@@StartBracket@@!@@EndBracket@@ in the Candidates and later too, in the prestigious online MCI tournament.   This line has always been very critical, but I believe it is not going to be a refutation and eventually people will calm down and start exploring other areas of the Winawer as well.   That said, we have to take it seriously, especially because the way Ian and his team treated this line so far does not look very reliable to me. I propose we go our own way. }
7... Qc7
{ I am not the greatest opening historian, but as far as I remember, this hasn't quite been the main line until very recently. Now, however, with the engines screaming this is the best move, it is overtaking the more active looking plans involving Qa5. The main purpose of Qc7 is to stop Qg4 for now. }
8. h5
{ Not including h5-h6 is possible and just as sensible, but I believe it is way too subtle and highly unlikely that White would not transpose later on. We play exactly the same way as we do after the h5-h6 inclusion, so I think there is no need to double check all the same moves here again. I did that, of course, but I feel it is not neccessary to copy paste the same lines here. }
8... h6
{ Taking on c3 followed by Qc3+-Qxd4 was debated some years ago, but the lines are so much more fun for White there, and there really is no need for it. }
9. Rb1
{ Essentially White is preparing Qg4, as 9.Qg4 can be met with cxd4!. Quite similar are 9.Rh3 and 9.Bd2, while 9.Nf3 is also a serious move, developing the knight, leading to positions very similar to the 7.Nf3 line. }
9... Nbc6
{ This move is not new, but the main point behind it @@StartBracket@@after 10.Qg4@@EndBracket@@ is absolutely stunning and has never been shown before!   9...O-O?!  This can be met with g4 here. Some complications will follow:  10.g4  Nbc6  11.Nf3  cxd4  12.cxd4  f6  13.exf6  Rxf6  14.Be2  e5  It is important that if White had played 9.Bd2 instead of 9.Rb1 in the same position, Black would be doing well, but here White gets  17.Bb2!  15.Nxe5  Nxe5  16.dxe5  Qxe5  17.Bb2!  and White gets full control of the a1-h8 diagonal and the key d4-square. White is just much better here.  17...Qe4  18.O-O }
10. Qg4 Rg8
{ This is a very important novelty with a very beautiful idea behind it. I am proud - I mean I didn't find it on my own, but I did leave my engine to think at the right moment to find it... }
11. Bd3
{ This is obviously why Black never played this way. Bh7 looks like a threat... }
11... c4 { Setting up our beauitful trick. } 12. Bh7 Nxe5 { Boom! } 13. Qg3
{ White might think that he has outsmarted us, but we just got started. } 13...
Nd3+
{ We will give up our knight after all. The bishop on h7 is doomed, the most important thing is not to give up our g7-pawn. }
14. cxd3 Qxg3 15. fxg3 Rh8 { We do pick up the bishop after all. } 16. Be4
{ White is trying to at least repair the structural damage. } 16... dxe4 17.
dxe4 b6 { We have to develop our c8-bishop, then we are totally fine. } 18. Rb2
{ White is ready to meet Bb7 with Re2. } 18... f5
{ Grabbing the light squares. } 19. exf5 Nd5 { A useful intermezzo. } 20. Bd2
exf5
{ We've got a gorgeous d5-square, but unfortunately in order to secure it, we had to give White a very gorgeous e5-square for his knight in return. The position is thus balanced. That's what happens if both sides play like a supercomputer. What matters though is that we have our little trick to look forward to now. Let's hope our opponent is up to date and will follow the latest trends! }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ This is the starting position of the Winawer variation. Most cultured opponents would automatically go 4.e5 here, but there are the diehards who try to be funky with moves like 4. Qg4, 4.Nge2, 4.a3, 4.Bd2 4.Bd3 and what not. Recently I even saw 4.Qd3 passing by. And of course, there are those who have studied Harikrishna's excellent Chessable course and will attempt to French toast our Winawer with 4.exd5. }
4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }
7... Qc7 8. Bd3 c4
{ The old move  8...cxd4  leads by force to an endgame after  9.Ne2  dxc3  10.Qxg7  Rg8  11.Qxh7  Qxe5  12.h4  Nd7  13.Bf4  Qf6  14.Bg5  Qh8  15.Qxh8  Rxh8  16.Nxc3  , which I believe is holdable, but again, quite one-sided with White having many options and Black constantly walking a narrow path in order to stay in the game. The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }
9. Be2 Qa5
{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all. Chess is a concrete game! }
10. Bd2 Nf5
{ The knight sits comfortably here for now, as it can be hit by neither the bishop nor the pawn.   That said, the simple  10...Rg8  can also be investigated, with very similar ideas of finishing the queenside development and going long castle.  This is a pretty complex position that was also very hard to analyse and understand, but at least the pawn structure is very familiar to us by now and in that sense, this position is not that different than the ones we looked at in the previous chapters @@StartBracket@@7. Nf3, 7.a4, 7.h4@@EndBracket@@. Black will follow the same scheme of development with Nc6, Bd7 and 0-0-0, tossing in a Qa4 if possible, to stop a3-a4. White however, has a slightly different piece placement than usual - his queen is suddenly out on g4, and the knight is still on g1 and not yet on f3, which may give him some flexibility.  The queen on g4 has no purpose, now that the g7-pawn is firmly protected @@StartBracket@@Nf3-Nh4 can be met with Nxh4, Nc6-Ne7 or even simply Rg8!@@EndBracket@@. So the queen should probably move at some point to make room for g2-g4, which will come with a tempo, attacking the knight on f5. As for the knight flexibility, White has some Nh3@@StartBracket@@e2@@EndBracket@@-f4-h5 maneuvre, which as we know is not killing, but is a sensible idea, exerting some pressure on the g7- and f6-squares. }
11. Qf4
{ This move with the idea of going Bg4 or g4 also exists.   11.Qh5  and  11.Qh3  are quite similar in this sense. We can react to those in the same way. }
11... Qa4
{ Qf4 is quite slow, so here we are happy to block the a3-a4 push, of course. }
12. Ra2
{ Here we can play in a normal way, but there is also the engine suggestion of being very annoying: }
12... Qb5 13. Bc1 Qa5 { Black prevents the Bg4/g4 moves altogether. } 14. Nf3
{ These positions with the knight on f3 are quite standard as we saw. One nice trick by the way: }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4

4. e5 c5 5. a3

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }

The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }
9. Be2 Qa5
{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all. Chess is a concrete game! }
10. Bd2 Nf5

11... Nc6 12. Ne2 Bd7 13. Ng3 Nce7
{ 13...Rg8  was also possible.  White's Ne2-Ng3 didn't bring him much and the Nf3-Nh4 concept is just faster, not wasting a move on Bd1. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }
7... Qc7 8. Bd3 c4
{ The old move  8...cxd4  leads by force to an endgame after  9.Ne2  dxc3  10.Qxg7  Rg8  11.Qxh7  Qxe5  12.h4  Nd7  13.Bf4  Qf6  14.Bg5  Qh8  15.Qxh8  Rxh8  16.Nxc3  , which I believe is holdable, but again, quite one-sided with White having many options and Black constantly walking a narrow path in order to stay in the game. The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }
9. Be2 Qa5
{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all. Chess is a concrete game! }
10. Bd2 Nf5
{ The knight sits comfortably here for now, as it can be hit by neither the bishop nor the pawn.   That said, the simple  10...Rg8  can also be investigated, with very similar ideas of finishing the queenside development and going long castle.  This is a pretty complex position that was also very hard to analyse and understand, but at least the pawn structure is very familiar to us by now and in that sense, this position is not that different than the ones we looked at in the previous chapters @@StartBracket@@7. Nf3, 7.a4, 7.h4@@EndBracket@@. Black will follow the same scheme of development with Nc6, Bd7 and 0-0-0, tossing in a Qa4 if possible, to stop a3-a4. White however, has a slightly different piece placement than usual - his queen is suddenly out on g4, and the knight is still on g1 and not yet on f3, which may give him some flexibility.  The queen on g4 has no purpose, now that the g7-pawn is firmly protected @@StartBracket@@Nf3-Nh4 can be met with Nxh4, Nc6-Ne7 or even simply Rg8!@@EndBracket@@. So the queen should probably move at some point to make room for g2-g4, which will come with a tempo, attacking the knight on f5. As for the knight flexibility, White has some Nh3@@StartBracket@@e2@@EndBracket@@-f4-h5 maneuvre, which as we know is not killing, but is a sensible idea, exerting some pressure on the g7- and f6-squares. }

{ We can't afford to lose time with  11...Qa4  here. } 12. Nf4 Bd7 13. Nh5
O-O-O
{ We are just in time to meet  14.Nxg7  with  Rhg8   13...Rg8  would lose to  14.Nf6+ }
14. Qf4
{ The white queen steps away, introducing the threat of g2-g4 and Bg4 as well. }
14... Rhg8 15. Bg4
{ I discovered that White sometimes wants to get rid of this bishop in exchange for the knight and just plays on the dark squares with a focus on stopping f7-f6. }
15... Qa4 { I like to block the a3-pawn, whenever we get the time for that. }
16. Ra2
{ This position is not easy for Black, as often White wants to take on f5 and stop our play with h4! and start rearranging his pieces. I propose to for now return the knight home. }
16... Nfe7 17. O-O Rdf8
{ This is a very complex position. White is not crushing us at all, at least not right now, with all his pieces in front of the pawns, but he did manage to discourage our pawn pushes thanks to the knight on h5 pressuring the g7-f6 points and the bishop on g4, potentially pressuring the e6-point as well.   Still, it is hard for White to do something constructive here. I would guess he will try to drop back the pieces and start pushing his queenside pawns, but we will then try to strike with a timely f6/f5. In the meantime we can chill a little with Kb8-Ka8 and if still bored start rerouting the c6-knight in some clever fashion following the arrows. }

Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }
7... Qc7 8. Bd3 c4

The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }
9. Be2 Qa5
{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all. Chess is a concrete game! }
10. Bd2 Nf5

That said, the simple  10...Rg8  can also be investigated, with very similar ideas of finishing the queenside development and going long castle.

11... Nc6

{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all.

The queen on g4 has no purpose, now that the g7-pawn is firmly protected @@StartBracket@@Nf3-Nh4 can be met with Nxh4, Nc6-Ne7 or even simply Rg8!@@EndBracket@@.

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own.

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }

The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }
7... Qc7 8. Bd3 c4
{ The old move  8...cxd4  leads by force to an endgame after  9.Ne2  dxc3  10.Qxg7  Rg8  11.Qxh7  Qxe5  12.h4  Nd7  13.Bf4  Qf6  14.Bg5  Qh8  15.Qxh8  Rxh8  16.Nxc3  , which I believe is holdable, but again, quite one-sided with White having many options and Black constantly walking a narrow path in order to stay in the game. The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }
9. Be2 Qa5
{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all. Chess is a concrete game! }
10. Bd2 Nf5
{ The knight sits comfortably here for now, as it can be hit by neither the bishop nor the pawn.   That said, the simple  10...Rg8  can also be investigated, with very similar ideas of finishing the queenside development and going long castle.

11. h4 { Pushing the pawn to h5 is always a plan to reckon with. } 11... Qa4

Basically apart from 11.a4  @@StartBracket@@obviously@@EndBracket@@ or 11.Nh3 @@StartBracket@@because there we weren't in time to meet Nh5 with 0-0-0!@@EndBracket@@, we can always throw this move in. }
12. Bd1 { Guarding the pawn on c2. } 12... Nc6 { We develop as usual here. }
13. Ne2 Bd7 14. Ng3 Rg8
{ We react in the same way as we did to Nf3-Nh4. Here, White can go back to the Nh5 plan. The position is complex. Our next few moves are as usual, and just as usual, we will try to push f6 at an opportune moment. While if White captures on f5 instead, we will block the light squares with Be6 and prepare a h6-g5 push. }

Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. I am going to advise the respected, tested and simply put legendary sac of the g7-pawn, but there is a catch here.     Traditionally, the main way of doing that has always been 7...Qc7. That was until people discovered that White has an extra option in 8.Bd3, which turned out to be quite testing. The smart people then realized that Black can first take with 7...cxd4, but White theory nerds were not sleeping either and came up with 8.Bd3 there too. Black was put back to work and came up with 8...Qa5!? and although Negi proposed a very challenging idea for White in his book, it seemed that Black is holding the theoretical fort quite comfortably.   The debate seemed to be settled and even Magnus Carlsen played 7...cxd4 against me in Wijk aan Zee a couple of years back. Until recently, when one of my secret seconds for the 2020 Candidates brought 9.Rb1!? to my attention. I had since spent a lot of time trying to find a good antidote and in the meantime I used the powerful 9.Rb1 idea to get a winning position against Nepo himself in the online chessbrah invitational  (in a blitz match that I was lucky enough to win - some inappropriate bragging here)  . Basically, I have a solution for 9.Rb1 as well, which is the new 9...b6!N move, but the lines are so long and one-sided that I decided to take a step back and investigate the good old 7...Qc7 deeper.   The current state of my findings is that 7...Qc7 is a more practical way to play after all. 8.Bd3 remains critical, but we are getting a familiar structure with 8...c4!? and after studying the position in great detail with various engines, I came to conclusion that Black's position is quite robust and we have enough play of our own. If that conclusion is ever to change  (because these things do change sometimes!)  , ring me up and we will study the 7…cxd4 8.Bd3 Qa5 9.Rb1 stuff after all. }
7... Qc7 8. Bd3 c4
{ The old move  8...cxd4  leads by force to an endgame after  9.Ne2  dxc3  10.Qxg7  Rg8  11.Qxh7  Qxe5  12.h4  Nd7  13.Bf4  Qf6  14.Bg5  Qh8  15.Qxh8  Rxh8  16.Nxc3  , which I believe is holdable, but again, quite one-sided with White having many options and Black constantly walking a narrow path in order to stay in the game. The move I recommend is more in the spirit of this course - we shall not shy away from the complex locked position. As long as our king is safe and we know our plans, I believe we should manage! }
9. Be2 Qa5
{ When I first saw this whole sequence of going Qc7, c4 and then Qa5, I was completely puzzled, but upon closer examination it all started to make sense.  Our moves have to be seen in context: we played Qc7 to threaten cxd4, then pushed c5-c4 because White has provoked us with Bd3 and it gains us two tempi, and now we go Qa5 to misplace the c1-bishop in this structure and because Qa4 is often a good way to block the a3-pawn to stop a4 and Bc1-Ba3 once and for all. Chess is a concrete game! }
10. Bd2 Nf5
{ The knight sits comfortably here for now, as it can be hit by neither the bishop nor the pawn.   That said, the simple  10...Rg8  can also be investigated, with very similar ideas of finishing the queenside development and going long castle.  This is a pretty complex position that was also very hard to analyse and understand, but at least the pawn structure is very familiar to us by now and in that sense, this position is not that different than the ones we looked at in the previous chapters @@StartBracket@@7. Nf3, 7.a4, 7.h4@@EndBracket@@. Black will follow the same scheme of development with Nc6, Bd7 and 0-0-0, tossing in a Qa4 if possible, to stop a3-a4. White however, has a slightly different piece placement than usual - his queen is suddenly out on g4, and the knight is still on g1 and not yet on f3, which may give him some flexibility.  The queen on g4 has no purpose, now that the g7-pawn is firmly protected @@StartBracket@@Nf3-Nh4 can be met with Nxh4, Nc6-Ne7 or even simply Rg8!@@EndBracket@@. So the queen should probably move at some point to make room for g2-g4, which will come with a tempo, attacking the knight on f5. As for the knight flexibility, White has some Nh3@@StartBracket@@e2@@EndBracket@@-f4-h5 maneuvre, which as we know is not killing, but is a sensible idea, exerting some pressure on the g7- and f6-squares. }
11. Nf3
{ Let's look at this move in context of the Nh4 idea here, while it can of course transpose to 11.a4/11.h4 plans as well. }
11... Qa4
{ Nh4-xf5 is not a giant threat, but if White manages to get a4 in as well, in the long run we are facing a tough defense, as White will lock up the center with f4 and activate the c1-bishop via a3.    11...Nc6  is another possibility that you can explore.  12.Nh4  Rg8  13.Nxf5  exf5  14.Qh4  h6  15.a4!  This is not the end of the world, as Black's position is very robust and he can gamble with a timely g7-g5 push at some point, but it is obviously more favourable for Black to stop the a4, Bc1-Ba3 idea and leave White with the dumb dark-squared bishop.  Be6  16.O-O  Rb8  17.Rfb1  a6  18.Ra2  Kd7  And g5 next, which is likely a bit of a bluff, but who cares, we aren't playing the computer! }
12. Ra2 { Preparing Nh4. } 12... Nc6 13. O-O { This is met with the standard }
13... Bd7
{ With our usual ideas. The queen on g4 really doesn't do much, as we have established, because Nh4 is met with Rg8!. }

Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

13. Bf4 Qf6 14. Bg5 Qe5
{ Trading queens would lead to a worse endgame for us here, so we are fine with offering a move repetition. If you don't want to allow that, I propose some minor gambling with 12....d4!? or 12...b6!?. }
15. g4 { After Bxe7 we have the intermezzo's Rg7/Rh8. } 15... b6 16. Bf4 Qe4

Bf6 with the idea of Ng5 is met by taking on f6 and Rg4!, stopping Ng5. So instead, White should bring the a1-rook over, to threaten Re3/Rd3 and capturing the c3-pawn at the end of that line.  21.Rad1!  Hikaru went for   21.Rae1  and it worked out, as Black didn't notice the threat, but Black has  21...Re4!  to save himself. Rad1 instead seems to be even more challenging. Maybe it is possible to hold this endgame, thanks to the margin in the game of chess, but I think the solution I am proposing is more sound.  21...Ndxe5   21...b5  22.Bf6  Nxf6  23.exf6  Rg4  24.Rd3  would lead to a collapse similar as in the game.  22.Nxe5  Nxe5  23.Rhe1  and d5 will fall, thanks to the pin. }

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4
{ Here the traditional main move is 10.Ne2, but there are a couple of very interesting alternatives, in particular the trendy 10.Qd3 has posed Black quite some theoretical problems recently. }

It has stayed somewhat under the radar, until German theoretician Niclas Huschenbeth used it to beat the mighty Arkadij Naiditsch in the 2019 World Cup. Now, though, when the dust has settled and this line is taken very seriously, I think I managed to find a decent antidote and hold the honor of the Winawer here. White's main idea is to keep the flexbility of the knight and maintain the option of playing Nf3. }
10... Qxe5+ { I believe this is clearly the right direction. } 11. Ne2 dxc3 12.
Bf4 Qh8 13. Qxc3
{ Here Black can get a good version of the endgame with Nd7, but there is also a funny looking move: }

{ Keeping the queens on the board and ready to grab some control in the center with e5. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }

8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4
{ Here the traditional main move is 10.Ne2, but there are a couple of very interesting alternatives, in particular the trendy 10.Qd3 has posed Black quite some theoretical problems recently. }
10. Qd3
{ This one was brought to my attention by a non-secret second of mine a couple of years ago during a training session of the Dutch team and greatly impressed all of the team members. It has stayed somewhat under the radar, until German theoretician Niclas Huschenbeth used it to beat the mighty Arkadij Naiditsch in the 2019 World Cup. Now, though, when the dust has settled and this line is taken very seriously, I think I managed to find a decent antidote and hold the honor of the Winawer here. White's main idea is to keep the flexbility of the knight and maintain the option of playing Nf3. }
10... Qxe5+ { I believe this is clearly the right direction. } 11. Ne2 dxc3 12.
Qxc3
{ If White starts with  12.h4  , we can just go  Nbc6  and White will have to take on  c3  anyway.   The logical  12.Bf4  , however, seems to be less precise for White. }
12... Qxc3+
{ It seems quite paradoxical to me that this move could be better than  12...Nbc6  when White goes  13.Qxe5  Nxe5  anyway, but there is a rational explanation behind it. See, when the queen trade happens on e5, our knight on e5, despite looking active, is misplaced as it is in the way of the e6-e5 push. At the same time, White's knight could be better placed on e2 than on c3, because it much rather goes the other way, towards g3, where it guards the g2-pawn and can jump to h5. }
13. Nxc3 Nbc6
{ Some people have started with e5 here, but this is more flexible. } 14. h4
{ pushing the main asset immediately. Logical. } 14... e5
{ Starting with  14...Nd4  also holds as far as my analysis goes, but this is a very sensible move as well, keeping the d5-d4 push in mind.   Starting with  14...f6  however, is less precise because now after  15.Nb5  White manages to get a different version of things. After Kd7 I am not sure we needed the f6 move just yet, while after Kf7 the check on d6 is still somewhat unpleasant. }
15. Bg5
{ White's extra option if he starts with 14.h4.   15.Rb1  or  15.f3  will transpose to the lines we looked at under  14.Rb1.  See here. }
15... Bf5 16. O-O-O d4
{ This gives Black excellent play, potentially along the c-file. } *

The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Now, though, when the dust has settled and this line is taken very seriously, I think I managed to find a decent antidote and hold the honor of the Winawer here. White's main idea is to keep the flexbility of the knight and maintain the option of playing Nf3. }
10... Qxe5+ { I believe this is clearly the right direction. } 11. Ne2 dxc3 12.
Qxc3
{ If White starts with  12.h4  , we can just go  Nbc6  and White will have to take on  c3  anyway.   The logical  12.Bf4  , however, seems to be less precise for White. }
12... Qxc3+
{ It seems quite paradoxical to me that this move could be better than  12...Nbc6  when White goes  13.Qxe5  Nxe5  anyway, but there is a rational explanation behind it. See, when the queen trade happens on e5, our knight on e5, despite looking active, is misplaced as it is in the way of the e6-e5 push. At the same time, White's knight could be better placed on e2 than on c3, because it much rather goes the other way, towards g3, where it guards the g2-pawn and can jump to h5. }
13. Nxc3 Nbc6
{ Some people have started with e5 here, but this is more flexible. } 14. h4
{ pushing the main asset immediately. Logical. } 14... e5
{ Starting with  14...Nd4  also holds as far as my analysis goes, but this is a very sensible move as well, keeping the d5-d4 push in mind.   Starting with  14...f6  however, is less precise because now after  15.Nb5  White manages to get a different version of things. After Kd7 I am not sure we needed the f6 move just yet, while after Kf7 the check on d6 is still somewhat unpleasant. }
15. Bg5
{ White's extra option if he starts with 14.h4.   15.Rb1  or  15.f3  will transpose to the lines we looked at under  14.Rb1.  See here. }
15... Bf5 16. f4
{ White keeps up the energetic moves, but on the other hand this is likely to just lead to mass simplifications. }
16... d4 17. Nb5 Kd7 18. fxe5 Bxc2
{ White has got the bishop pair and some minor initiative going, but the position is basically too simplified not to be fine for us. }
19. Be2 a6 20. Rc1 axb5
{ Possibly  20...Be4  or  20...Bf5  are also ok in the end.   But not  20...d3  because of  21.Bg4+! }
21. Rxc2 Nd5 22. O-O Nxe5

Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade.

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2.

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }
7... Qc7 8. Qxg7
{ Apart from the 8.Bd3 move that we have discussed at length, there is no other major alternative to this move at this point in time. }
8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 { It's time we go look at the main move. } 10...
Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4 dxc3
{ Here too, as a kid I learned that  11...Bd7!?  is more precise. I guess it is because it would avoid 12.Nxc3, or to set up a trap and provoke White to go  12.cxd4?!  falling into  Nxd4!   It was however much later that the theoretical angle has changed, because after  11...dxc3  12.Qd3  it turned out that Black doesn't have to go 12...Bd7 but can play  12...d4!  instead and the complications after  13.Nxd4  turned out to work for him. This little revelation brought the Winawer back into fashion, but it also meant that 11...Bd7 would no longer be the go-to move order.  For this course @@StartBracket@@and for fun!@@EndBracket@@ I tried to resurrect that old Bd7 line as well in this chapter, but this chapter is about 11...dxc3 12.Nxc3. }
12. Nxc3
{ This is very principled and highly critical. In fact, at some point I considered it so critical that I had played this against Magnus Carlsen in Wijk aan Zee couple of years back. The main move 12.Qd3 will be examined later. }
12... Nd4
{ This is what Magnus Carlsen played against me and as it was tested in many correspondent games as well with ok results, so it shouldn't be bad. The point of the move is to stop Nb5 for now and try to develop the pieces without wasting time on the slow move a7-a6. Still, White can ask many questions here. }
13. Bb2
{ The main move, defending the c3-knight and preparing to castle long. } 13...
Bd7 14. O-O-O
{ Now Black again has a choice. I believe both  14...Ndf5  and  14...Qb6  are playable here. }
14... Qb6
{ This was Carlsen's choice. White now has a bunch of attempts, but Black can probably hold on. }
15. Qd3 Ndf5 16. Rd2
{ I guess I had some recollection of something, otherwise I don't know how I could come up with such a random clever move, instead of all the tempting knight jumps. }
16... Rc8
{ It was also possible to consider 0-0-0 here. The 16.g3 move order may discourage that, in order to have Nb5 ready, while here after   16...O-O-O  17.Nb5  Black would take  Bxb5  18.Qxb5  and pin the rook with  Qe3! }
17. g3 Ne3 18. Qd4
{ This safe move is also critical - White is a pawn up after all. } 18... Qxd4
19. Rxd4 N7f5 20. Rd2 Rh8
{ Black held this position in a couple of correspondence games. He's got quite some light squares for the pawn deficit. }
21. Bd3 { White gives back a pawn, forcing a forcing sequence. Forcing. } 21...
Nxg3 22. Re1 Ngf5 23. Bxf5 Nxf5 24. Nxd5
{ The point, as now exd5 is met with e6 where White is likely to end up in some rook endgame with an extra pawn which offers some winning chances. Black instead can play }
24... Ba4 25. Nf6+ Kf8
{ Black has positional compensation for the pawn, with some sort of a light squared blockade, but of course Black is fighting for a draw here. }
26. Bc3 { Forcing more action. } 26... Rxc3 27. Rd8+ Kg7 28. Rg1+ Rg3 29. Rxg3+
Nxg3 30. Rxh8 Ne2+ 31. Kd2 Kxh8 32. Kxe2 Bxc2
{ I'd continue a little more, but Black should hold. This is not a joke, I would really continue a little more, it's probably not so easy to hold it... Anyway, I am done here, my main recommendation is 12...a6 anyway. }

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2.

Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Since this is an essential line for our repertoire, we really should examine both.   12...Nxe5?  13.Nb5  Qb8  14.Be2  leads to a very bad position for Black, who forgot to develop his queenside pieces. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4
{ This is the starting position of the Winawer variation. Most cultured opponents would automatically go 4.e5 here, but there are the diehards who try to be funky with moves like 4. Qg4, 4.Nge2, 4.a3, 4.Bd2 4.Bd3 and what not. Recently I even saw 4.Qd3 passing by. And of course, there are those who have studied Harikrishna's excellent Chessable course and will attempt to French toast our Winawer with 4.exd5. }
4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

11. f4 dxc3
{ Here too, as a kid I learned that  11...Bd7!?  is more precise. I guess it is because it would avoid 12.Nxc3, or to set up a trap and provoke White to go  12.cxd4?!  falling into  Nxd4!   It was however much later that the theoretical angle has changed, because after  11...dxc3  12.Qd3  it turned out that Black doesn't have to go 12...Bd7 but can play  12...d4!  instead and the complications after  13.Nxd4  turned out to work for him. This little revelation brought the Winawer back into fashion, but it also meant that 11...Bd7 would no longer be the go-to move order.  For this course @@StartBracket@@and for fun!@@EndBracket@@ I tried to resurrect that old Bd7 line as well in this chapter, but this chapter is about 11...dxc3 12.Nxc3. }

14... Rc8
{ There are different moves, but in general it is possible to make sense of the position, which is not as random as it seems. Black is basically choosing what to do with his king and what to do with the c6-knight.   For the king there is a choice between 0-0-0 and playing Rc8 with an eventual Kf8, while for the queenside knight there are 2 scenarios. One is for it to go its own way with Na5-Nc4 and the other is to try and join the other knight via d4 or e7.   0-0-0 can only be done with the knight on c4, in view of the Qxa6 trick, so usually it is either Na5-Nc4 and 0-0-0 or Rc8, Nf5+Nce7/Ncd4 and Kf8. Simple, no? }
15. h4
{ The most challenging move. Bd2/Ne2 business will be met with Na5-Nc4 transposing to the lines discussed earlier under 13. Ne2. }
15... Nf5 16. Rh3 Nce7

Fortunately we will.  18.h6  Rg6  19.Rb4  Here our knight on d4 is vulnerable and although this line continues with either Qc5!? giving up b7, or Nc6 back, the immediate 16...Nce7 looks simpler. }
17. h5
{ In general, philosophically speaking, this push can be met in two ways. Black either blocks it with Nh6 and Nef5 or allows the pawn further with Kf8 and tries to work around it, meeting h6 with Rg6! and h7 with Kg7!. Both concepts are possible here. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

11. f4 dxc3
{ Here too, as a kid I learned that  11...Bd7!?  is more precise. I guess it is because it would avoid 12.Nxc3, or to set up a trap and provoke White to go  12.cxd4?!  falling into  Nxd4!   It was however much later that the theoretical angle has changed, because after  11...dxc3  12.Qd3  it turned out that Black doesn't have to go 12...Bd7 but can play  12...d4!  instead and the complications after  13.Nxd4  turned out to work for him. This little revelation brought the Winawer back into fashion, but it also meant that 11...Bd7 would no longer be the go-to move order.  For this course @@StartBracket@@and for fun!@@EndBracket@@ I tried to resurrect that old Bd7 line as well in this chapter, but this chapter is about 11...dxc3 12.Nxc3. }
12. Nxc3

12... a6
{ The tempting 12...Nxe5? doesn't work, but there are two ways of playing here. This move leads to positions very similar to the old 12.Qd3 Bd7 lines, which I always had a soft spot for, while 12...Nd4!? is supposed to be more independent and sort of more principled. Since this is an essential line for our repertoire, we really should examine both.   12...Nxe5?  13.Nb5  Qb8  14.Be2  leads to a very bad position for Black, who forgot to develop his queenside pieces. }
13. Qd3
{ It is natural to return the queen - this is also the most played move in this position. }
13... Bd7
{ After this obvious and good developing move, we suddenly end up in a position which has been played thousands of times, through another move order, namely 12.Qd3 Bd7 13.Nxc3 a6, though as we will later see, via this move order Black has a decent option of 13...Nf5!? as well. See here. }
14. Rb1
{ This is a useful move pretty much always and it seems better to start with it, to eliminate Black's  14...O-O-O  option, after which  15.Qxa6!!  would follow. }
14... Rc8
{ There are different moves, but in general it is possible to make sense of the position, which is not as random as it seems. Black is basically choosing what to do with his king and what to do with the c6-knight.   For the king there is a choice between 0-0-0 and playing Rc8 with an eventual Kf8, while for the queenside knight there are 2 scenarios. One is for it to go its own way with Na5-Nc4 and the other is to try and join the other knight via d4 or e7.   0-0-0 can only be done with the knight on c4, in view of the Qxa6 trick, so usually it is either Na5-Nc4 and 0-0-0 or Rc8, Nf5+Nce7/Ncd4 and Kf8. Simple, no? }
15. h4

Fortunately we will.  18.h6  Rg6  19.Rb4  Here our knight on d4 is vulnerable and although this line continues with either Qc5!? giving up b7, or Nc6 back, the immediate 16...Nce7 looks simpler. }
17. Bd2 Kf8
{ A strong novelty: we are preparing for h5, Nh6 and Rg3. Thinking two steps ahead - this is what chess about, isn't it?   17...Bc6?!  This is the main move, but it doesn't quite work, as after  18.h5  Nh6  It is still better to play Kf8! here.  19.Rg3!  Rxg3  20.Qxg3  Nef5  21.Qh3  d4  22.Nd1!

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4

Qg4, 4.Nge2, 4.a3, 4.Bd2 4.Bd3 and what not. Recently I even saw 4.Qd3 passing by. And of course, there are those who have studied Harikrishna's excellent Chessable course and will attempt to French toast our Winawer with 4.exd5. }
4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }

Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4 dxc3
{ Here too, as a kid I learned that  11...Bd7!?  is more precise. I guess it is because it would avoid 12.Nxc3, or to set up a trap and provoke White to go  12.cxd4?!  falling into  Nxd4!   It was however much later that the theoretical angle has changed, because after  11...dxc3  12.Qd3  it turned out that Black doesn't have to go 12...Bd7 but can play  12...d4!  instead and the complications after  13.Nxd4  turned out to work for him. This little revelation brought the Winawer back into fashion, but it also meant that 11...Bd7 would no longer be the go-to move order.  For this course @@StartBracket@@and for fun!@@EndBracket@@ I tried to resurrect that old Bd7 line as well in this chapter, but this chapter is about 11...dxc3 12.Nxc3. }
12. Nxc3
{ This is very principled and highly critical. In fact, at some point I considered it so critical that I had played this against Magnus Carlsen in Wijk aan Zee couple of years back. The main move 12.Qd3 will be examined later. }
12... a6
{ The tempting 12...Nxe5? doesn't work, but there are two ways of playing here. This move leads to positions very similar to the old 12.Qd3 Bd7 lines, which I always had a soft spot for, while 12...Nd4!? is supposed to be more independent and sort of more principled. Since this is an essential line for our repertoire, we really should examine both.   12...Nxe5?  13.Nb5  Qb8  14.Be2  leads to a very bad position for Black, who forgot to develop his queenside pieces. }
13. Qd3
{ It is natural to return the queen - this is also the most played move in this position. }
13... Bd7
{ After this obvious and good developing move, we suddenly end up in a position which has been played thousands of times, through another move order, namely 12.Qd3 Bd7 13.Nxc3 a6, though as we will later see, via this move order Black has a decent option of 13...Nf5!? as well. See here. }
14. Rb1
{ This is a useful move pretty much always and it seems better to start with it, to eliminate Black's  14...O-O-O  option, after which  15.Qxa6!!  would follow. }
14... Rc8
{ There are different moves, but in general it is possible to make sense of the position, which is not as random as it seems. Black is basically choosing what to do with his king and what to do with the c6-knight.   For the king there is a choice between 0-0-0 and playing Rc8 with an eventual Kf8, while for the queenside knight there are 2 scenarios. One is for it to go its own way with Na5-Nc4 and the other is to try and join the other knight via d4 or e7.   0-0-0 can only be done with the knight on c4, in view of the Qxa6 trick, so usually it is either Na5-Nc4 and 0-0-0 or Rc8, Nf5+Nce7/Ncd4 and Kf8. Simple, no? }
15. h4
{ The most challenging move. Bd2/Ne2 business will be met with Na5-Nc4 transposing to the lines discussed earlier under 13. Ne2. }
15... Nf5 16. Rh3 Nce7
{ 16...Ncd4  17.h5  Kf8  My great countryman Jan Timman lost this position in two moves once after playing a couple of natural moves:   17...Qc5?  18.Rxb7!  Nb5?  19.Ne4!  which shows how important it is here to know our stuff. Fortunately we will.  18.h6  Rg6  19.Rb4  Here our knight on d4 is vulnerable and although this line continues with either Qc5!? giving up b7, or Nc6 back, the immediate 16...Nce7 looks simpler. }
17. Bd2 Kf8
{ A strong novelty: we are preparing for h5, Nh6 and Rg3. Thinking two steps ahead - this is what chess about, isn't it?   17...Bc6?!  This is the main move, but it doesn't quite work, as after  18.h5  Nh6  It is still better to play Kf8! here.  19.Rg3!  Rxg3  20.Qxg3  Nef5  21.Qh3  d4  22.Nd1!  Qd8  23.g4  and Black didn't quite manage to stop the blockade in over 20 games that reached this position. }
18. h5 Nh6
{ Reshuffling the knights and blocking White's kingside expansion. It is crucial that he can't back up his h5-pawn with g4. }
19. Rg3 Nef5 20. Rxg8+ Kxg8 21. Qh3
{ It seems that g4 is inevitable after all, but magically things just work out for us here: }
21... Kh8 { Preparing a very naughty forced sequence. } 22. g4 d4
{ First asking White to determine where he goes with the knight. } 23. Ne4 Nxg4
{ Here it is not even a real sacrifice, as  25.Qxg4  is met with  Qxc2  when White no longer has Bd3. }
24. Nd6 Nge3 { This is the prettiest. } 25. Nxc8 Nxf1 26. Qxf1 Qxc8
{ With gorgeous compensation for the exchange. Them squares! } *

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }
7... Qc7 8. Qxg7
{ Apart from the 8.Bd3 move that we have discussed at length, there is no other major alternative to this move at this point in time. }
8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4
{ If you want to play the Bd7 line after Qd3,   11...dxc3  12.Qd3  Bd7  , the first question arises already here. We can start with the traditional 11...Bd7 already at this point. The differences are almost non-existent, though there are a couple of subtle ones. }
11... Bd7 12. Bd2
{ The only plus of the 11... Bd7 move order that I see is that we can meet   12.Qd3  dxc3  13.Nxc3  with  Nf5  besides the other move a6, while if we start 11...dxc3 12.Nxc3 we will now have to go a6.   The minus would be that it allows a very rare  12.Bb2  or  12.Bd2  option.   Actually there is one more plus - we tempt our opponent to fall for  12.cxd4  Nxd4!   12.Qd3  dxc3  and we transpose. }
12... dxc3 13. Bxc3 O-O-O 14. Qd3
{ This is an unusual version of the usual position, but I sort of like what White did. The bishop on c3 is really not bad, it is perfect against the Na5-Nc4 ideas and supports the e5-square in case of f6. The only way Black can benefit from it is by pushing d5-d4 with a tempo, but in the concrete lines arising after that, it is not easy to equalize. Better to start with 11...dxc3 guys - 12.Nxc3 a6 is covered and there is no need for extra headaches. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop.

Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }
7... Qc7 8. Qxg7
{ Apart from the 8.Bd3 move that we have discussed at length, there is no other major alternative to this move at this point in time. }
8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4
{ If you want to play the Bd7 line after Qd3,   11...dxc3  12.Qd3  Bd7  , the first question arises already here. We can start with the traditional 11...Bd7 already at this point. The differences are almost non-existent, though there are a couple of subtle ones. }
11... dxc3 12. Qd3 Bd7
{ This is how they used to play it and how I played when I was a kid, so I feel obliged to pass on all my childhood traumas to you.     On a serious note, the modern  12...d4!  works well, but it does simplify the position enormously and leads to some very concrete play where in the end we have to make a bunch of theoretical moves to hold our own.  See here.  That is of course simply business as usual at the top level of chess, but from the point of view of an ordinary chess lover who just wants to have some fun with the Winawer, I believe it is quite essential to have the traditional 12...Bd7 in our arsenal, as an alternative. }
13. Qxc3 Nf5
{ Clearly Nf5, d4 and 0-0-0 are the useful moves here, but the question is what move order is the most flexible one. This seems to be the right move order, because after   13...O-O-O  first, White can play  14.h3!?  and Nf5 will always be met with g2-g4. }
14. Rb1
{ By far the main move. Getting the rook onto the semi-open file and stopping any Qb6 business. There are alternatives, though. }
14... d4
{ Again, we want to castle and go d4, but this is the better move order, to first see where White commits his queen.   14...O-O-O  15.h3  d4  16.Qc4!  I couldn't quite find an adequate reply to this. There is  16...f6!?  with fascinating complications, but in the end the engine combined with some correspondence games convinced me that the concrete lines just don't work out. }
15. Qc4 Qa5+
{ This is one of the extra options we get, thanks to starting with 14...d4!. }
16. Bd2 Qxa3 17. Rxb7 Ne3 18. Qd3 { The best test, as far as I can see. } 18...
Qxd3 19. cxd3 a5
{ The natural  19...Nxg2+  also holds in the end, as played in some correspondence games, but I like this new move too - the forcing line that ensues is quite elegant. }
20. g3 Nxe5 21. Nxd4 Nxf1 22. fxe5
{ White can capture the other knight but then we would take on d3 and claim equality. }
22... Nxd2 23. Kxd2
{ And now there is an elegant trick to simplify everything at once. } 23... Rg4
24. Ke3 Rxd4 { Gaining control over the c6-square. } 25. Kxd4 Bc6 26. Rbb1 Bxh1
27. Rxh1 a4
{ White has no winning chances in this rook endgame with our rook behind the far advanced a-pawn. If he focuses all his mighty forces on capturing our a-pawn, he will lose one or two of his pawns after which we will easily hold the game. }

Rh2+  29.Kg1  Rxe2!  30.Rxe2  Nxc1  Now we just have to recoordinate the knights.  31.Rd2  Ke7  Getting out of the way and threatening Nxf4.  32.Kh2!  Nxf4  Taking it!  33.Rc3  Nfd3  One knight may be sacrificed for the greater good here.   33...Ncd3  also holds in a study like manner, but 33... Nfd3 is cleaner. The problem with 33...Ncd3 is that after  34.Rc7+  we can't allow a rook trade with  Kf8?  35.Rc8+  Kg7  36.Rxg8  Kxg8  37.Kg3!  Tying up our knights and capturing them with Kf3-Ke4-Rxd3.  34.Rg2   34.Rc7+  Kf8  35.Rc8+  Kg7  36.Rxg8+  Kxg8  Now that the knight is on c1 and not on f4, White can't win in the same way. The position is dynamically equal here.  Nxe5  There is no point in hanging on to the c1-knight. Two pawns is a good deal - take it!  35.Rc7+  Kd6  36.Rxc1+  Nxg4+  37.Kh3  f5  and Black will hold with a bunch of pawns for the exchange here. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

That is of course simply business as usual at the top level of chess, but from the point of view of an ordinary chess lover who just wants to have some fun with the Winawer, I believe it is quite essential to have the traditional 12...Bd7 in our arsenal, as an alternative. }
13. Qxc3 Nf5
{ Clearly Nf5, d4 and 0-0-0 are the useful moves here, but the question is what move order is the most flexible one. This seems to be the right move order, because after   13...O-O-O  first, White can play  14.h3!?  and Nf5 will always be met with g2-g4. }
14. Rb1
{ By far the main move. Getting the rook onto the semi-open file and stopping any Qb6 business. There are alternatives, though. }
14... d4
{ Again, we want to castle and go d4, but this is the better move order, to first see where White commits his queen.   14...O-O-O  15.h3  d4  16.Qc4!  I couldn't quite find an adequate reply to this. There is  16...f6!?  with fascinating complications, but in the end the engine combined with some correspondence games convinced me that the concrete lines just don't work out. }
15. Qd3
{ The most natural of the retreats and possibly the most challenging as well. }
15... O-O-O 16. Rg1
{ This move is played almost exclusively and it does seem like the best move. }
16... Na5
{ Another major theoretical move,  16...f6!?  is highly spirited, but unfortunately the math after  17.g4  Nh4  18.exf6  e5  19.Rg3!  doesn't work out for Black, whose position could objectively be lost. Still, I don't see why not to throw it out in some of your games, humans won't manage to navigate those complications. The other good news is that the main move 16...Na5 seems to work. }
17. g4 { Provoking a direct confrontation. We have come armed, though. } 17...
Ba4 18. gxf5
{ This is the most played move and I think it has to do with the deep psychology rooted in all chess players: we like capturing pieces. Not a bad move! }
18... Bxc2 19. Qb5
{ We are likely to get a rook for two pieces in some version. In general, that material balance should be somewhat in White's favour but we have a strong d-passer potentially on d3 that can be supported by a knight on c4, and that could be quite an asset. }
19... Rh8
{ Unsurprisingly, this move is rare, but the modern computers point it out right away. Black wants to keep the pair of rooks and does so without losing any time, by hitting the h2-pawn. }
20. Bd2 { Also logical, attacking the knight. } 20... Nc4 21. Rb2
{ White has to keep this rook active. } 21... Ba4
{ Alternatively,  21...Rd5  would win the queen with a very unclear position. The text move allows us to win the exchange and still keep our c4-knight. }
22. Qxa4 Nxb2 23. Qb3 Nc4
{ And Black has good play, despite a minor material deficit. } 24. Rg2 d3
{ Getting more space for our d8-rook. } 25. Ng3 Nxd2 26. Kxd2 Rd4
{ Going after White's weak f4-pawn. } 27. fxe6 fxe6 28. Ke3
{ White is also on top of things and finds a great regrouping. The king does the noble task of guarding the pawn. }
28... Rhd8 29. Rd2 Qc1
{ We are still down in material so we can't relax and have to keep harassing white's king. The line can continue with  30.Bg2  Qg1+!  31.Kf3  Now the king blocks the bishop on g2.  Qc1!  32.Qxe6+  Kb8  33.Nf1  Qxa3  We also pick up some pawns and envision a bright future for our a7-soldier.  34.f5  Qb4  with excellent counterplay. Not only against White's king, but simply pushing the a-pawn is on the agenda as well. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }
7... Qc7 8. Qxg7
{ Apart from the 8.Bd3 move that we have discussed at length, there is no other major alternative to this move at this point in time. }
8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4
{ If you want to play the Bd7 line after Qd3,   11...dxc3  12.Qd3  Bd7  , the first question arises already here. We can start with the traditional 11...Bd7 already at this point. The differences are almost non-existent, though there are a couple of subtle ones. }
11... dxc3 12. Qd3 Bd7
{ This is how they used to play it and how I played when I was a kid, so I feel obliged to pass on all my childhood traumas to you.     On a serious note, the modern  12...d4!  works well, but it does simplify the position enormously and leads to some very concrete play where in the end we have to make a bunch of theoretical moves to hold our own.  See here.  That is of course simply business as usual at the top level of chess, but from the point of view of an ordinary chess lover who just wants to have some fun with the Winawer, I believe it is quite essential to have the traditional 12...Bd7 in our arsenal, as an alternative. }
13. Qxc3 Nf5
{ Clearly Nf5, d4 and 0-0-0 are the useful moves here, but the question is what move order is the most flexible one. This seems to be the right move order, because after   13...O-O-O  first, White can play  14.h3!?  and Nf5 will always be met with g2-g4. }
14. Rb1
{ By far the main move. Getting the rook onto the semi-open file and stopping any Qb6 business. There are alternatives, though. }
14... d4
{ Again, we want to castle and go d4, but this is the better move order, to first see where White commits his queen.   14...O-O-O  15.h3  d4  16.Qc4!  I couldn't quite find an adequate reply to this. There is  16...f6!?  with fascinating complications, but in the end the engine combined with some correspondence games convinced me that the concrete lines just don't work out. }
15. Qd3
{ The most natural of the retreats and possibly the most challenging as well. }
15... O-O-O 16. Rg1
{ This move is played almost exclusively and it does seem like the best move. }
16... Na5
{ Another major theoretical move,  16...f6!?  is highly spirited, but unfortunately the math after  17.g4  Nh4  18.exf6  e5  19.Rg3!  doesn't work out for Black, whose position could objectively be lost. Still, I don't see why not to throw it out in some of your games, humans won't manage to navigate those complications. The other good news is that the main move 16...Na5 seems to work. }
17. g4 { Provoking a direct confrontation. We have come armed, though. } 17...
Ba4 18. c4
{ This looks brilliant and also just is a brilliant move, and is very testing. We can no longer ignore the elephant in the room. The elephant that is hanging on f5. I mean the horse. }
18... Ne7
{ This move has never been played, which isn't that surprising, because obviously Nh4 looks more active and strong, getting closer to the f3-square. However, in some critical lines it will be very important that we can stabilize our queenside with Nec6, reinforcing the a5-knight.   18...Nh4  19.Rg3  Qxc4   19...b6  20.c5!  This is where we would have liked our f5-knight closer to c6!  20.Rb4  Qc6  21.Kf2!  N  and while it is hard to explain what is going on, the bottom line is that the math doesn't add up. But again, that is just theory, in a practical game you can put the knight wherever you want, just don't go to h6! }
19. Rg3
{ This move is always useful. The rook has plenty of work to do on the third rank, protecting some key squares like d3 and b3. }
19... b6
{ It was also possible to consider capturing on c4 with either piece, but this b6-move with the idea of Nb7-Nc5 is quite thematic and works well here. }
20. Rb4 Be8 21. Rb2
{ This is one of the various things suggested by the engine, but our reply is particularly instructive here. }
21... Rh8 { Including Rh8 and h3 is crucial. } 22. h3 Nb7 23. Nxd4 Nc6
{ Here without including Rh8 h3, White would have Qh7!, but with this inclusion we are just picking up a piece with the pin. }
24. Be3 Nc5 25. Qd1 { Otherwise Ne4 would be a fork. } 25... Nxd4 26. Bxd4 Ba4
27. Qd2 Ne4 { And we win. } *

Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }
7. Qg4
{ This is by far the main move and understandably so. White immediately goes after our weakest spot in the position - the g7 pawn. }
7... Qc7 8. Qxg7
{ Apart from the 8.Bd3 move that we have discussed at length, there is no other major alternative to this move at this point in time. }
8... Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 Nbc6
{ Taking on c3 first is possible too. The text move is traditionally considered the most flexible, though I have seen some creative people trying out some Na6-Nc5 set-ups, which believe it or not, deserve some investigation as well.   10...dxc3  11.f4  Bd7!?  12.Qd3  Na6!?  was played by the English Grandmaster Nicholas Pert twice and is surprisingly interesting. }
11. f4
{ If you want to play the Bd7 line after Qd3,   11...dxc3  12.Qd3  Bd7  , the first question arises already here. We can start with the traditional 11...Bd7 already at this point. The differences are almost non-existent, though there are a couple of subtle ones. }
11... dxc3 12. Qd3 Bd7
{ This is how they used to play it and how I played when I was a kid, so I feel obliged to pass on all my childhood traumas to you.     On a serious note, the modern  12...d4!  works well, but it does simplify the position enormously and leads to some very concrete play where in the end we have to make a bunch of theoretical moves to hold our own.  See here.  That is of course simply business as usual at the top level of chess, but from the point of view of an ordinary chess lover who just wants to have some fun with the Winawer, I believe it is quite essential to have the traditional 12...Bd7 in our arsenal, as an alternative. }
13. Qxc3 Nf5
{ Clearly Nf5, d4 and 0-0-0 are the useful moves here, but the question is what move order is the most flexible one. This seems to be the right move order, because after   13...O-O-O  first, White can play  14.h3!?  and Nf5 will always be met with g2-g4. }
14. Rb1
{ By far the main move. Getting the rook onto the semi-open file and stopping any Qb6 business. There are alternatives, though. }
14... d4
{ Again, we want to castle and go d4, but this is the better move order, to first see where White commits his queen.   14...O-O-O  15.h3  d4  16.Qc4!  I couldn't quite find an adequate reply to this. There is  16...f6!?  with fascinating complications, but in the end the engine combined with some correspondence games convinced me that the concrete lines just don't work out. }
15. Qd3
{ The most natural of the retreats and possibly the most challenging as well. }
15... O-O-O 16. Rg1
{ This move is played almost exclusively and it does seem like the best move. }
16... Na5
{ Another major theoretical move,  16...f6!?  is highly spirited, but unfortunately the math after  17.g4  Nh4  18.exf6  e5  19.Rg3!  doesn't work out for Black, whose position could objectively be lost. Still, I don't see why not to throw it out in some of your games, humans won't manage to navigate those complications. The other good news is that the main move 16...Na5 seems to work. }
17. g4 { Provoking a direct confrontation. We have come armed, though. } 17...
Ba4 18. c4
{ This looks brilliant and also just is a brilliant move, and is very testing. We can no longer ignore the elephant in the room. The elephant that is hanging on f5. I mean the horse. }
18... Ne7
{ This move has never been played, which isn't that surprising, because obviously Nh4 looks more active and strong, getting closer to the f3-square. However, in some critical lines it will be very important that we can stabilize our queenside with Nec6, reinforcing the a5-knight.   18...Nh4  19.Rg3  Qxc4   19...b6  20.c5!  This is where we would have liked our f5-knight closer to c6!  20.Rb4  Qc6  21.Kf2!  N  and while it is hard to explain what is going on, the bottom line is that the math doesn't add up. But again, that is just theory, in a practical game you can put the knight wherever you want, just don't go to h6! }
19. Rb4 { A logical move. Defends something, attacks something. } 19... Be8
{ The bishop often finds itself a bright future in the Winawer this way. The Be8, f6! and Bg6 idea is certainly one to remember. Even if it doesn't work, it always gets you some style points! Here, it works. }
20. h3 { With the idea of Ng3-Ne4, Black resorts to an idea we already know. }
20... b6 { The knight fianchetto. } 21. c5 bxc5 22. Qa6+
{ This can be met here with } 22... Nb7
{ Black has a very solid set-up on the queenside with Kb8 and Bc6 next, cementing the defender on b7. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2.

Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play.

Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade.

4. e5 c5 5. a3
{ This is almost universally played, though I have encountered 5.Bd2 as well. The other moves are really odd, when White will struggle to keep control over the key central squares d4 and e5. }
5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

16... Na5
{ Another major theoretical move,  16...f6!?  is highly spirited, but unfortunately the math after  17.g4  Nh4  18.exf6  e5  19.Rg3!  doesn't work out for Black, whose position could objectively be lost. Still, I don't see why not to throw it out in some of your games, humans won't manage to navigate those complications. The other good news is that the main move 16...Na5 seems to work. }
17. g4 { Provoking a direct confrontation. We have come armed, though. } 17...
Ba4 18. c4
{ This looks brilliant and also just is a brilliant move, and is very testing. We can no longer ignore the elephant in the room. The elephant that is hanging on f5. I mean the horse. }
18... Ne7
{ This move has never been played, which isn't that surprising, because obviously Nh4 looks more active and strong, getting closer to the f3-square. However, in some critical lines it will be very important that we can stabilize our queenside with Nec6, reinforcing the a5-knight.   18...Nh4  19.Rg3  Qxc4   19...b6  20.c5!  This is where we would have liked our f5-knight closer to c6!  20.Rb4  Qc6  21.Kf2!  N  and while it is hard to explain what is going on, the bottom line is that the math doesn't add up. But again, that is just theory, in a practical game you can put the knight wherever you want, just don't go to h6! }
19. Rb4 { A logical move. Defends something, attacks something. } 19... Be8
{ The bishop often finds itself a bright future in the Winawer this way. The Be8, f6! and Bg6 idea is certainly one to remember. Even if it doesn't work, it always gets you some style points! Here, it works. }
20. Bd2 Nec6 21. Rb1 f6
{ Here White should at some point get too impressed with our beautiful play and collapse. But if he doesn't and plays 20 more moves like a 3500 rated engine, we will still hold. The following line is for my colleagues. }
22. exf6 Bg6 23. f5 Ne5 { Activating the knight with tempo. } 24. Qe4 exf5 25.
gxf5 Bf7 { Naxc4 is coming next against pretty much anything. } 26. Rxg8 Rxg8
27. Nf4 { The most testing move. The knight comes around to e7. } 27... Naxc4
28. Ng6 Re8 29. Ne7+ Rxe7 30. fxe7 Qxe7 31. Bg2
{ White reinforces the queen and it seems he consolidated his extra exchange. But the line continues. }
31... Nd6 32. Qc2+ Kb8
{ We have a discovered check lined up. Now the first engine line goes deep into an endgame where Black eventually holds. I will just keep it here, for the sake of completeness, but to be frank this 3600 rated stuff has very little to do with reality!   33.Kf1  Now we can win back the exchange.  33...Bc4+  34.Kg1  Bd3  35.Qd1  Bxb1  36.Qxb1  d3  We would probably like to sell our d3-pawn for one of White's bishops. Unfortunately, you can't make a deal like that in chess. The long critical line continues:  37.Bf4  Kc8!  Unpinning.  38.Kf1!  A nasty 3500 rated move. The king comes closer to the d3-pawn to be able to meet Ndc4 with Qb4!.  38...b5  39.Qe1  Ndc4  40.Qe4  Qf6!  We can allow as many checks as White wants but we can't let him trade the queens.  41.Qa8+  Kd7  42.Qxa7+  Ke8  We just respond to the checks, it is not pleasant to be tossed around like this, but there is no reason to panic here.  43.Qb8+  Ke7  44.Qb7+  Nd7  45.Qe4+  Nde5  and Black holds.  46.Bf3  d2  We got some time now, which we immediately use to get our last remaining trump one step closer.  47.Kg2  Kf8  The king finally finds some safety.  48.Be2  Nf7  And eventually we will get rid of White's last pawns and all the pieces will come off. A long variation and likely not very relevant for a regular chess lover or even a trained club player, but it gives you the taste of what the top players go through everyday, having to memorize long variations like this. In the end it is also about confidence - with us knowing that when push comes to shove, our repertoire will hold up even against the strongest computers and there is nothing they will be able to do. This is my definition of a lifetime repertoire. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7
{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

{ They say with opposite-colored bishops, it is all about who is attacking. Well, I guess that is why we can afford to be two pawns down here! The correspondence game continued with:  28.Qe2  Qb1+  We don't trade queens.  29.Be1  Rd4  The e4-bishop needed some love.  30.Rb3  Qc1!  31.c3  Ra4  32.Rb4  Rxb4  33.axb4  Bb7  34.f5  And despite White being two pawns up, the correspondence game Chazalette-Tsenkov, 2019 was drawn here. Black has a dangerous initiative thanks to the monster bishop on b7.  34...Rd8!  White should be quite careful here, the king's safety is on our side. And by the way, in case I still haven't told you, chess is all about the king's safety! }

{ This is a major tabiya of the Winawer. Traditionally, White is choosing between the main and the most principled 7.Qg4, the simple 7.Nf3 and the cunning side pawn moves 7.h4 and 7.a4. Credit to humanity, both 7.h4 and 7.a4 were in fashion long before the infamous AlphaZero shook the chess world by reintroducing this concept of pushing the sidepawns down the board.   Let's briefly discuss the merits of the theoretical moves and the general plans of both sides here.   7.Qg4 attacks the g7-pawn and forces an immediate decision from us. Against it, I recommend sacrificing the g7 pawn with Qc7. 7.Qg4 0-0 is the alternative, but as I promised, I prefer to never castle short, as White develops an initiative there far too quickly and I couldn't save Black's position there.  Besides Qg4, White's other main idea is to push h4-h5 and create a desirable pawn structure on the kingside of e5+h5 vs e6-f7-g7-h6, when a long term f4-g4-f5-f6 breakthrough is on the cards.  Black, in turn, has 2 sound positional ideas. One idea is to go b6-Ba6 and trade the light-squared bishop. Against that, White can either ignore it - as for example in the 7.h4 line - and proceed with his own kingside play. Or he can meet b6 with Bb5+ like in the 7.Nf3 line, and after Bd7 drop back to d3/e2. Or he can go a4, Bxb5 axb5 and once again focus on his kingside play with h4-h5, while Black tries to create some play on the queenside. Another idea for Black and the one we will mostly resort to is to eventually prepare 0-0-0 with Nbc6 and Bd7, Qa5/Qc7, closing the queenside with c4 and focusing on the f7-f6 break.  The lately fashionable 7.h4 is particularly interesting, because it keeps the option of Qg4 open, while for example 7.Nf3 limits White to the slow plan of h4-h5 with the long-term bind.   7.a4 in turn prepares against both our plans - as 7...b6 is now met with 8.Bb5+ disrupting our Ba6 plans, or the even more rough 8.Nh3! preparing Nf4-Nh5 after the bishop trade. And also against our 0-0-0, c4 and f6 idea, 7.a4 is quite useful as White will have the Ba3-Bd6 idea.   Anyway, enough talk, let's look at the moves. }

3... c5 4. exd5 Qxd5
{ Capturing with a pawn leads to isolated pawn positions that are quite one-sided and easy for White to play. I prefer to avoid inducing any structural damage to the children of my course, when possible. By the way, the justification behind developing the queen this early in the game is that White no longer has the option of chasing the queen with Nc3. And yes, the Scandinavian is not a good opening. }
5. dxc5
{ The extra option White has in this move order. This line is by no means dangerous, but it is popular amongst the players who want the same pawn structure as in the old main line with 5. Ngf3, but want to avoid all that theory. By now though, there is plenty of theory here too, so slowly the lazy 3.Nd2 boys are getting depressed. }
5... Nf6
{ Taking on  c5  with a bishop seemed less precise to me, as I couldn't find that perfect square for the queen after  5...Bxc5  6.Ngf3  Nf6  7.Bc4.

I will go with the second! }
6. Ngf3 Qxc5
{ While the queen is a little odd on c5, it is one move away from its ideal square - on c7. }
7. Bd3 Nbd7
{ I don't think the move order matters all too much, whether we starts with Be7 and 0-0 or Nbd7, it will all come down to the same - we just have to develop our pieces to the squares they belong to. }

{ An excellent square for the queen, where it is not in the way of any of the Black's pieces and guards the f4-square that White's bishop would have loved to get to. }
11. a5
{ White is ready for our b7-b6 push, but we can develop the c8-bishop differently now. }
11... Nc5 12. Bc4 Bd7
{ This is a little passive, but now that White has wasted two tempi on a4-a5, it is fully justified. }
13. Ne5 Rfd8 14. b4 Nce4
{ Going the other way is also possible:  14...Na6!?  15.b5  Nc5  with a very interesting position with mutual chances. The text move is just simpler. }

{ White has got the bishop pair for now, but his bishops aren't too potent, while we plan to stabilize our position and threaten some knight jumps. White also has to take care of his b4-pawn right now. }

23... Be8 24. hxg5
{ White's logic was understandable, he saw the g5-pawn would be weak and the knight would sit comfortably on g4, while Black can't yet penetrate along the h-file. This would all be true, if the king safety was not a factor, if it was for example an endgame. With the king being the number one priority, Black is able to rearrange his pieces and use the open h-file to develop a deadly attack.   24.g4 !  White can still close the kingside here with this move, as  24...gxh4  can be met with the very unpleasant  25.Bf4 ! }
24... hxg5 25. Nh2 Bd8
{ Black decides to shuffle around a little, though there were some tempting options available already.  Even more brutal was   25...Bh5 !  26.Qe1  And now the powerful:  26...e5 !  Opening up the position, while White's knights are quite passive. The b3-knight controlling d4 is quite helpful as well. }
26. Bc1

26... Qe7
{ Guarding the e6-pawn.  The engine points out the more powerful:   26...Kb8 !  27.Qxe6  Ka8 !  And then claims bad things will eventually happen on the h-file. }
27. Ne3 Rh3 { It is time to double on the h-file. } 28. Re1 Bg6 29. Nef1
{ This is too passive.   29.Bxg6  A better defense was to establish the knight on g4 after all.  29...Rxg6  30.Neg4 !  Qh7  31.Kg2  And at least White has pretty solid looking knights and it is not easy for Black to triple on the h-file. Yet, Black is the one calling the shots here:  31...Nd7 !  With various ideas, including Nf8!? and Rg8-Rh8. Quite inventive! }
29... Bxc2 30. Qxc2 Rgh8 31. Be3 Qf7 { Hinting at Qh5... } 32. Re2 Nd7
{ The knight is also planning to join the kingside attack party. } 33. Bd2

33... Rxh2 34. Nxh2 Rxh2
{ A double exchange sacrifice, though not really, as Kxh2 is met with Qh5+!. }

{ White is wasting quite a bit of time, but more importantly actually misplaces his pieces. It happens quite often in chess that one isn't sure what exactly to do, but it is then important to try and resist worsening the position and maneuvring pieces away from good squares. }
26... Nd7
{ White clearly didn't see it coming. Now our long-term plan of Nf6 comes at the perfect moment. White is not ready for it here. }
27. Nd4 Nf6 28. Bc6 Rf8
{ The Bc6 and Nd4 configuration is quite fragile and e6-e5 is a threat here. }
29. Nc2 { It is not pretty, but White had to defend against the e5-push. }
29... Ng4 { A nice trick, using the fact that the c6-bishop is vulnerable. }
30. Ba8
{ White tries avoiding giving up the bishop for the knight quite inventively. }
30... Bd7 31. Qxg4 { Allowing the trade after all. } 31... Rxa8
{ Here White is clearly regretting having pushed g3, as now the long diagonal is wide open for the bishop. Still, as White has control over the d-file and Black's pieces are not on their ideal squares just yet, White isn't doing that badly. }
32. Rd4
{ 32.Qf4 !?  This would have created a little more confusion in Black's camp. The position is around balanced. }
32... Bc6 33. Red1 Qb7
{ It is well-known that in order to checkmate the battery should be reversed, with the queen in front, but this way too, Black creates some threats. }
34. Qh3 { The queen is quite awful here. } 34... Bf3
{ 34...Rae8 !?  This would probably be my choice, getting the last piece into action before advancing the pawns, but Matthias decides to act quickly. }
35. R1d2 e5 36. Rd6
{ 36.Rd7  Qe4  And Black keeps the initiative going. Currently Bg4 is a threat. }
36... f5 37. Qf1
{ Here or on the next move White should have tried to disrupt Black's coordination. Thanks to the full control over the d-file, the position is still far from hopeless.   37.Ne1 !?  Bc6   37...Bg4  38.Qg2  e4  39.Qf1  f4  40.Qc4+  Kh7  41.gxf4  Rxf4  42.Ng2  White survives here, though there are some patterns of course to watch out for.  38.g4  Creating some chaos, which would be a good shot, given that the rooks control the d-file and the c6-bishop is not that stable. }
37... Qe4 38. Qe1
{ White had to fianchetto the knight to g2, for defensive purposes.   38.Ne1 !?  Bh5  39.Ng2  And it's not so easy for Black to actually crush through here, though of course White's position is not pretty... }
38... Qg4 { This might have been missed or underestimated... } 39. Kh2 f4
{ Black starts the offensive and importantly cuts out the c2-knight from the defense. }
40. Qxe5
{ White does win a pawn, but this is losing. The long diagonal is a serious issue. }
40... Rae8 41. Qd4 Be4 42. Qc4+ Kh8 43. Nd4
{ This loses by force to a pretty shot, but things were already not going well at all.   43.Qe2  Bf3  44.Qd3  Bb7  And White has no moves here. }
43... fxg3+ 44. fxg3 Rf3 { Gaining a key square for the queen. } 45. Nxf3 Qxf3
{ There is no stopping Qh1. White is lost. } 46. Kh3 Qh1+ 47. Kg4 Qf3+ 48. Kh3
h5

49. Rh6+ { Desperation. } 49... gxh6 50. Qd4+ Kg8 51. Qc4+ Qf7

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. Qe2
{ Here this move makes even less sense to me than in 1.e4 e6 2.Qe2, but the fact is that it is a transposition. John Nunn played an excellent game here back in the 90's - let's take a look. }
3... Nc6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O Nge7 7. c3 O-O 8. Na3 e5 9. Nc2 d5
{ This is mentioned in the theory section: once the white knight goes to c2, we hit with d5. }
10. d3
{ White keeps the tension in the center. Taking on d5 would only further highlight the bad placement of the c2-knight. }
10... h6
{ 10...b6 !?  Preparing for b4. This was even more cunning and would be my theoretical recommendation. That said, what John played in the game was very fine too.  11.b4  Ba6 }
11. b4 cxb4 12. cxb4 a6 13. Bb2 d4
{ It is not necessary to close the position just yet, but the bishop on b2 was asking for it!   13...Be6 !?  was an excellent alternative. }
14. Nd2 Re8
{ Setting up a small trick.   14...Be6  This was possible immediately too, but I guess John wanted to set a little trap on the way.  15.f4 }
15. a4
{ Mr. King cleverly avoids the trap.   15.f4  This would be excellently met with  15...exf4  16.gxf4  Nd5 !  Using the pin to get the knight into White's house. }
15... Be6 16. f4 { Now it is the moment to push. } 16... exf4 17. gxf4 Rc8
{ White is definitely very happy about his e4-f4 pawns, but with a soft b4 pawn and the open c-file, White can't fully concentrate on the kingside and so Black's position is perfectly fine here. }
18. Nf3 Qb6 19. b5
{ White decides to simplify everything, but in fact, by the end of this mass operation the pretty e4-f4 pawns turn out to be a liability. That's the thing about these type of kingside offenses - unless White goes all-in, it can easily backfire. }
19... axb5 20. axb5 Qxb5 21. Ncxd4 Nxd4 22. Bxd4 Red8 23. Bxg7 Kxg7 24. Rfb1
{ White goes for further trades, but it isn't helping. The best shot would be to try and keep the queens on the board with  24.Ne5!?  or perhaps  24.Nh4!?  with some f5-f6 tricks in mind. }
24... Qxd3 25. Qxd3 Rxd3 26. Rxb7
{ It would seem that it is almost a draw and indeed it is rather drawish, but White is the one having quite some defensive work to do! }
26... Nc6
{ The e4-f4 pawns are soft, and if Black manages to activate his c8-rook, White will start feeling uncomfortable. His knight on f3 isn't too stable and the first three ranks are quite exposed. }
27. Kf2 Rc3 28. Rb2 Rd8 29. Re1 Rdd3
{ Black got his rooks active and it is hard for White to rid himself of the pressure. }
30. Ng1
{ I would go Rbe2-Re3, trying to trade a pair of rooks, but this is also quite inventive, intending Bf1. }
30... Bg4
{ 30...Ra3 !?  This would keep the tension well.  31.Bf1  Rdc3  Keeping control of the f3-square. }
31. Bf1 Rd6 32. Be2
{ Falling for a deep trick.   32.Re3 !  This would take control over the third rank and brings White limitlessly close to the desired full equality. }
32... Rf6 { A lot of forking patterns are in the air. } 33. Bxg4 Rxf4+ 34. Bf3
Ne5 { Black is going to definitely regain some stuff with a fork. } 35. Re3
{ I am not claiming it was easy to find the defense, but it was there!  White had an incredible defense in   35.Reb1 !!  Surviving thanks to the  35...Nxf3  36.Ne2  fork. }
35... Rxf3+ { Black will win back the rook with one of the forks. } 36. Rxf3
Rxf3+ 37. Nxf3 Nd3+ 38. Ke3 Nxb2 39. h4

39... Nc4+ 40. Kf4 Kf6 41. e5+ Ke7 42. Nd4 Nb6 43. Ke4 Kd7 44. Ne2
{ 44.e6+ !  This would be a good defense, further simplifying.  44...fxe6  45.Ke5  Ke7  46.Nc6+ ! }
44... Na8 45. Nf4 Nc7 46. Ne2
{ 46.h5 !  This was a good moment to push it here.  46...g5  47.Ng2  And Black can still try stuff, but it is objectively a draw here. }
46... Ne6 47. Nc3 Kc6 48. Ne2
{ The losing move. White can't allow Kc5-Kc4 and Nc5+, when Black will surround the e5-pawn and win.   48.Nd1  This would still hold, although quite barely:  48...Kc5  49.Ne3  h5  50.Ng2  Kc4  51.Ne3+  Kc3  52.Nd5+  Kd2  53.Nf4 !  And White apparently still holds here, as the pawn endgames are drawn. }
48... Kc5 49. Ng3 Kc4 { Now Black is winning, as he wins the e5-pawn. } 50. h5
Nc5+ 51. Kf4 Kd5 52. hxg6 fxg6 53. Kg4 Kxe5

4. Ngf3 Nf6 5. c3

The immediate a5 Qe7 is simpler and likely more precise, but anyway.  10.Ne1  Qd6  11.Qc2  a5  12.Nc4  Qe7  Black eventually got this harmonious set-up.  13.Nd3  Ba7  14.Ne3  Bxe3  15.Bxe3  b6  The idea of b6 and Ba6 is always something to keep in mind in this structure when the bishop is on g2.  16.h3  Bb7  This is also sensible.  17.Rfd1  Na7 !?  The knight on c6 is misplaced, as it is dominated by the c3-pawn, so it is often rerouted somewhere. d6 is a very decent candidate square for that!  18.Ne1  Nb5 ?!  It was safer to go via c8.  19.f3 ?!  Both players missed the opportunity for c4-c5!.  19...Nd6  20.b3  Nh5 !  g3 is a soft spot and White's pieces look quite misplaced.

{ White plays the Philidor defense with two extra tempi. It is not that the Philidor defense is such a bad opening, in fact I believe it is somewhat underestimated, but it is very defensive and quite passive.
