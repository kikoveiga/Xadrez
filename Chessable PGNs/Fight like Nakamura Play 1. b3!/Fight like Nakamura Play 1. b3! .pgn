1. b3
{ The first recorded game where White plays 1. b3 goes back to 1851 when Dutch player Maarten van ‘t Kruijs played it in a tournament game in Amsterdam and won.  The late, great Latvian–Danish player and theoretician Aron Nimzowitsch  (1886–1935)  was the first to regularly  play the opening by transposition, opening with 1. Nf3 followed by 2. b3.   It was later popularized and frequently played by Bent Larsen in the 1960’s and he was very succesfull with it until the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match in Belgrade, when he played it against reigning World Champion Boris Spassky and lost in 17 moves. Larsen was also decisively defeated when playing it against Rosendo Balinas, Jr. at Manila in 1975.   Notably, this opening received interest from Bobby Fischer the same year, who employed 1.b3 on at least five occasions, winning four and drawing one, including games with GM Filip, GM Mecking  (Palma de Mallorca 1970 Interzonal)  , GM Tukmakov  (Buenos Aires 1970)  , and GM Andersson  (Siegen 1970)  .    Since then the opening became less popular but it has recently been reinvigorated by highly creative players such as  GM Richard Rapport and Baadur Jobava, who regularly employ it at top level with great success.   Top level GM Harikrishna has analyzed 1. b3 extensively as well in an article for The Informant called 'New Romantics'. And, indeed it does seem to attract many creative chess players who are simply looking for a game.   Of course, the main driving force behind the Nimzo-Larsen's new found popularity is reigning 2019 US Champion Hikaru Nakamura who plays it all the time in faster time controls, and used it to crush his Ukrainian opponent GM Olexandr Bortnyk in the final of Chess.com's Bullet Chess Championship for a final score of 28.5 - 16.5.  The Nimzo-Larsen offers White a simple but highly flexible set-up with easy to understand middle game plans, and it avoids lots of Black’s theoretical replies. This makes it an ideal candidate for use at club level, and especially fun to play in faster time controls. }

1. b3
{ After b3 Black has many options, but the most played moves are ...e5 and ...d5. }
1... e5 2. Bb2 { Attacking the e-pawn. } 2... e4
{ The first positive thing about this move is that it opens the diagonal for the b2-bishop. }
3. c4

Be6 16. Nd4 Nc5 17. O-O
{ The superiority of the d4-Knight over the e6-Bishop  (the d5-pawn is blocking its activity)  gives White an advantage.   The potential doubled a-pawns are not a terrible liabiltiy because there is no clear way for Black to take advantage of this. Also, this would open up the b-file for White to make use of!   The backward e3-pawn is much easier protected than its d5 counterpart.   I do believe that Engines will draw this game, but practically it is much more difficult to play this from Black's side! }

However, here is the main move of my refutation, and my question to Logozar is: Does White really have to protect the a2-pawn ?? Let's see what happens after 15. Nb5: White will have a long-term positional advantage thanks to the bishop pair. The d6-bishop cannot move because it has to defend the c7-pawn. The e5-pawn is under attack as well ! }

Hint: do not push your d-pawn to d4 because then Black can put his knight on e4, and that will be a strong knight. Keep the pawn on d2, and you always have the possibility of kicking the knight away with d2 - d3 if Black plays ...Ne4. Why is this position so great for White ? Because White is the only one who can improve his position, while Black can hardly do the same. }

1. b3 c5 2. Bb2 Nc6 { This is the start of the Botvinnik System. } 3. c4 e5

10. Nd5
{ One quick idea here: as you can see Black's central pawns are located on the dark squares c5-d6-e5, which means the light squares in his camp are weak. }
10... Qd7
{ Black wants to play ...Bh3 and exchange the light-squared bishops because the light squares on our kingside are weak. Again, the pawns are located on h2-g3-f2-e3 - all dark squares.    10...Bxd5?  11.cxd5!  Nb8  and now White has multiple good ways of continuing.  12.Qd2  is Stockfish's preferred move.   12.e4  is also a good option as well as   12.O-O }
11. h4
{ This prevents ...Bh3, and at some point h5 is going to be useful.   11.O-O  Bh3  is annoying to deal with, as after the trade of bishops White is left with a lot of light-square weaknesses around his king. }
11... f5 12. Qd2

{ This move is to open the a1-h8 diagonal for White's bishop. } 5... Bg7 6.
dxe5 Nd7
{ 6...dxe5 ?!  7.Qxd8+  Kxd8  and the endgame is in White's favour because he will be the first to control the open d-file. }
7. Nc3 Nxe5 8. Qd2
{ Preparing to castle long. But Jobava, isn't that risky since you have played a4, already weakening the queenside? }
8... Nf6 9. O-O-O O-O 10. h3

{ Rerouting the knight, in order to put it on c5. } 11. g4 Nc5 12. Bg2

13... b5
{ This way Black starts making use of the early a4 by White. Black wants to sacrifice a pawn in order to open the b-file against White's king. }

21. Qxa4 Rxb5+
{ Black has sacrificed a piece in order to attack White's king. } 22. Kc1 Rb4
23. Qc6 Rxf4
{ Another crazy move! The f4-knight was keeping White's position under control, and that is why Black wants to get rid of it. The material now is going to be 3 pawns for a rook! }

32. Rb2 Qxf4+ 33. Kd1 Bb5 { Black avoids exchanges. } 34. Rd2
{ 34.Qxa5 ?  Ba4+ !  And the b2-rook is lost. } 34... Qf5 35. Re1 Bd3

36. Rb2 Bb5 37. Be4 Qxh3 38. Qxa5 Qg4+ 39. Kc2 Qg5 { To protect the bishop. }
