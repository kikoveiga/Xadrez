{ Hello People! Welcome to my presidential speech 😊 or intro perhaps 😊. This is Grandmaster S.P.Sethuraman and I am back with my third Chessable course. This time I have shifted my focus to the White side. My last two repertoires were based on 1…e5 with the Black side  (Lifetime Repertoire with Archangelsk and the thrilling Jaenisch Gambit)  . So, it was high time to expand the horizon with the White pieces and what a way to start, with the best move 1.e4 as exclaimed by the genius, Robert James Fischer who called it “Best by Test“. I am pretty sure it still lives to its reputation of leading to open and aggressive positions. And the recent Candidates event which resumed in April 2021 started with 1.e4 in all four games 😊. So, we all now know why even today it is an ambitious first move. I am extremely thrilled and exuberant to be presenting Part 1 of this fabulous course which includes the Alekhine Defense, Scandinavian, Pirc, Modern Defense, Philidor, Petroff, and then the Scotch  (The crowd's favorite)  . The rest will be covered extensively in Part 2. So, are you guys ready to get enlightened? Let’s go get them all with 1.e4! 😊 }

{ I have a Fide Rating of  (2644)  and some of my illustrious achievements are that I have won the Asian Championship in the year 2016, a member of the bronze-winning Indian team at the Tromso Olympiad 2014. And in the year 2020, I was euphoric to venture into a new role as an author apart from being a professional chess player. I wrote a book on the two main Sicilians Taimanov and Najdorf from the White side for Thinkers Publishing which was a big hit. Now, my journey as an author continues in Chessable as you are now holding my third course 😊. I hope my courses and books have made a huge impact on the students to improve their understanding and get into the mind of how a Grandmaster analyses his openings. Among my fellow compatriots and peers, I have always made a huge impression on them for my opening preparation. And it was mellifluous to receive appreciation of my work from the former World Champion, my chess hero Vishy Anand who quoted me in the foreword of my book.   “I got to know Sethu more closely a few years back when we trained together a few times. I found him to be meticulous in his preparation and especially at home in complex positions" - Vishy Anand.   Thanks to having trained with the World Champion himself, it has immensely widened my analytical skills. }

{ It is impossible to cover the entire course of 1.e4 in one repertoire as it is extremely huge and that is the main reason for dividing it into two parts. So, Part 1 consists of 21 chapters.  Chapter 1 - covers 1...a6, 1...b6@@StartBracket@@Owens Defence@@EndBracket@@, and the Nimzowitsch Defence with 1...Nc6  Chapters 2-5 - covers the Alekhine Defence and I have honestly tried to refute it with some amazing ideas.  Chapters 6-9 - covers the Scandinavian. I hope it will be a nightmare to the Scandinavian players out there.  Chapter 10 - covers the Modern Philidor from the 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5 move order and here I come up with the interesting and flexible 4.Nge2?! with the plan of h3-g4.  Chapter 11 - covers the Pirc/Byrne Variation with 4.Bg5. Burning down the Pirc with the Byrne Variation :@@EndBracket@@. There are some amazing novelties in this chapter.  Chapter 12 - covers the Modern with 1.e4 g6, where I have come up with the positional setup of 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nf3 d6 4.c3  blunting the bishop on g7 followed by Bd3, O-O, h3, Be3, and Nbd2 to gain total dominance in the center.  Chapter 13 - begins the coverage of 1...e5 and mainly covers the Elephant/Latvian Gambit. I have indeed refuted these fancy options.  Chapter 14 - will deal with the Main Philidor arising after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 unlike the Modern Philidor move order. Both lead to entirely different positions and here I have explored the g3 fianchetto.  Chapters 15-17 - covers the Petroff, the rock-solid opening and I have presented the reliable classical system with 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Ne4 5.d4 where the space advantage and activity counts in numerous symmetrical positions.  Chapters 18-21 - covers the main pillar of this course, the Scotch. I have released our friend Harry as early as possible :@@EndBracket@@.  So, there are 21 chapters and of course, we have 9 model games annotated in depth with some breezy comments and entertaining stories :@@EndBracket@@.  And to start the course, we have a quickstarter guide which will help viewers gain a quick insight into the world of 1.e4. I would also like to mention to the students that there is a prominent feature of important lines marked inside the course which mainly deals with options having higher chances to occur in a tournament game. So, it is an extremely useful feature available in Chessable apart from many others like this amazing Move Trainer technology.  I have essayed this course in a cohesive and a simplified manner to avoid tons of theory where you need to memorize and play. Of course, when it demands, I have not restrained away from venturing into concrete battles. So, there will always be this mixture and hence it balances different character fights. }

{ I have always been an ardent fan of 1.e4 from my childhood days as it is one of the first openings I learned. It also shaped up my style to a greater extent. I have had some ethereal experiences and wins from the move 1.e4. So, I thought to impart some of my knowledge to you the viewers. In this process I have also enriched my understanding once again and hoping that these ideas will come in handy in my online events, instilling fear in the minds of opponents already.

So, I have cautiously prepared this course and have put in immense efforts to make 1.e4 taste like fresh fruit 😊.

[Black "Owen's Defence #1"]
[Result "*"]

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... b6
{ Owen's Defence @@StartBracket@@also known as the Queen's Fianchetto Defence or Greek Defence@@EndBracket@@. The opening is named after the English vicar and strong 19th-century amateur chess player John Owen, an early proponent of the move. Using his opening, Owen defeated Paul Morphy in a casual game in London, 1858. By playing 1...b6, Black prepares to fianchetto the queen's bishop, where it can participate in the fight for the center. The downside of this plan is that White can occupy the center with pawns and gain a spatial advantage. Also, 1...b6 does not prepare kingside castling as 1...g6 does, and it is harder for Black to augment his pressure against the center with ...f5, which weakens the kingside than it is to play the corresponding move ...c5 after 1...g6.   Owen's Defence accordingly has a dubious reputation. The move ...b6 has been played on the first or second move by grandmasters Jonathan Speelman, Pavel Blatny, Tony Miles, Edvins Kengis, and Normunds Miezis. The theory of Owen's Defence is less refined than that of other openings. This can be attractive to some players since their opponents are often unprepared for it and have to think for themselves early on. GM Christian Bauer, a proponent of this opening recently stated this point but to be honest, I don't think Black can equalize as quickly with 1... b6 as he sometimes does in standard openings. Black may simply suffer against a well-prepared opponent. Then again, the well-prepared opponent is rare for such marginal variations as 1...b6. In any case, with reasonable play, I'm sure White can't get more than a slight advantage from the opening – a risk everyone is running as Black, aren't they? }
2. d4
{ Of course, punishing Black's 1...b6 which is not fighting for the center by advancing the central pawns and gaining total control over the center. }
2... Bb7 3. Nc3
{ Supporting the pawn on  e4  .  3.Bd3  was prescribed in Wesley So's Chessable course, with slow play after 3... e6 4.Nf3  with a Qe2-c3 setup. That is also equally good and interesting which creates problems for Black, but I like the 3rd move with Nc3 as it is more active and directly prepares for the hunt. }
3... e6
{ The main move with the plan of ...Bb4. This was also seen recently in the famous game of Nepomniachttchi -Radjabov Airthing Masters Online 2020 where Radjabov was close to getting knocked out as he was trailing the min-match and a draw would mean that he is out from the championship. But with this opening, he was able to create some chances and win the game in a highly impressive manner. Not only did Radjabov stay alive in the tournament, he also won it! So let's dive into White's best options. }
4. Bd3
{ 4.Nf3  was prescribed by my compatriot Parimarjan Negi in his GM Repertoire which was released recently. I prefer 4. Bd3 more as we are flexible with our knight's position @@StartBracket@@either to f3 or e2@@EndBracket@@ depending on the situation. }
4... Bb4 { 4...Nf6  simply transposes to the3...Nf6 4.Bd3 e6 line. } 5. Ne2
{ Once again, thanks to maintaining the knight on g1 and not committing it to f3 immediately allows us to protect the knight on c3 by placing it on e2. }
5... d5
{ 5...c5  will always be met by  6.d5  blunting the b7-bishop   and  5...Ne7  will be met by  6.a3  and Black is forced to concede the bishop and he is worse. }
6. e5
{ The standard response to the ...d5 break as we would like to close the position and not allow the b7-bishop to get some play after 6...dxe4. }
6... Be7
{ 6...c5  7.a3  corners the bishop. So with the text move, Black tries to preserve the bishop and then aims for the ...c5 break. }
7. Nb1
{ A subtle maneuver with the intention of securing the center with c3 when challenged by ...c5. The b1-knight will land on d2 and then to f3. }
7... Ba6
{ Exchanging the bad bishop on b7 which is restricted by its own pawns. } 8.
Bxa6 Nxa6 9. c4 { is the key break with the threat of Qa4+. } 9... c6 10. cxd5
Qxd5
{ Once again, Black cannot take with the c6-pawn because of Qa4+ which loses the piece on a6. }
11. O-O
{ Followed by Nbc3-Be3-Rc1. White is much better as he is well developed and the pawn on e5 is a monster which simply creates more space for White and restricts Black's pieces. }

A weird move, but an effective one with the idea of ...Bg4 and ...Nf5, also leaving the c-file free for the Black pawn to march. For instance, he can play ...c6 anytime and make the pawn structure rigid. I could not see some constructive plans for White here.

1... Nf6
{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

In recent times, Grandmaster Sergei Tiviakov has played it on numerous occasions. }

1... g6
{ The Modern Defense @@StartBracket@@also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch@@EndBracket@@ is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns on d4 and e4. Black proceeds to attack and undermine the center without attempting to occupy it themself. The opening has been used extensively by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab. The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence. The primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing their knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 to attack White's pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2–c3. Black allows White to occupy the full center with their pawns and gain a space advantage, in the hopes of pressuring White’s center from afar before later striking back with …c5. This opening philosophy was popularized by the hypermodern school of thought in the early 1900s. While giving White a free hand in the center is not without its downsides, the Modern Defense remains popular to this day with players seeking an imbalanced, strategically complex game! }

{ Like I mentioned earlier, the delay of ...Nf6 attacking White's pawn on e4 gives White the extra option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2-c3. Generally, White prefers 3.Nc3 and aims for a dynamic struggle. Here Black has various options like 3...d5, 3...c5, and 3...d6, the mainline steering the game into wild territory. And by playing 3. Nf3, we give Black the signal that we are just playing against the bishop on g7 in a more positional manner which will upset the modern players and kills their hopes of getting a double-edged position.  I have played many games with the Modern defense for a win with Black. The positions after White opts for Nf3-c3, sabotage Black's ambitions of creating a double-edged game. And besides, it is very easy to play with White as we will form a setup and put our pieces on the most logical squares. }

{ The Modern Defense @@StartBracket@@also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch@@EndBracket@@ is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns on d4 and e4. Black proceeds to attack and undermine the center without attempting to occupy it themself. The opening has been used extensively by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab. The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence. The primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing their knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 to attack White's pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2–c3. Black allows White to occupy the full center with their pawns and gain a space advantage, in the hopes of pressuring White’s center from afar before later striking back with …c5. This opening philosophy was popularized by the hypermodern school of thought in the early 1900s. While giving White a free hand in the center is not without its downsides, the Modern Defense remains popular to this day with players seeking an imbalanced, strategically complex game! }

I have played many games with the Modern defense for a win with Black. The positions after White opts for Nf3-c3, sabotage Black's ambitions of creating a double-edged game. And besides, it is very easy to play with White as we will form a setup and put our pieces on the most logical squares. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

All these factors gives White a slight pull after  19...Qc7   If  19....Rad8  then  20.Qe7  Nc7  21.Re5  with the follow up of Rae1 and White is much better.  20.Qe7  Although it is close to equality according to the computers, Black's position is unpleasant and there is lot of play left. Black has to make some precise moves and make accurate moves to stay in the game. Practically, it is definitely unpleasant to play such positions .Trust me :@@EndBracket@@. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Qh4
{ Steinitz Variation. Steinitz's 4...Qh4!? almost wins a pawn by force, but White gets a lead in development and attacking chances as compensation. While this bold move may not be the most sound for Black, it definitely offers chances for interesting play. Players who like aggressive and double-edged games will feel at home in this variation. The idea is to put pressure on e4, as after White plays Nc3 to defend it, Bb4 will challenge the protection of the pawn once more. This is a variation in which White needs to be precise and know what he is doing. The main idea is to transfer a knight to b5, from where it will put pressure on the c7-pawn. Please note that the c7-pawn has been weakened by Black’s early queen escapade. But if White knows these ideas and plays them, the Steinitz Variation will lead to a solid advantage. }
5. Nc3
{ Supporting the e4-pawn and White aims for quick development in order to exploit the weird queen on h4 which has ventured out quite early. The golden principle of chess states that: 'Don't bring your queen too early.' Let's see how we can utilize this factor and take advantage of it. }
5... Bb4
{ 5...Bc5  doesn't make any sense as we have  6.Be3  holding everything together with a much better position. The text move with 5...Bb4 is the key idea to renew the pressure on the e4-pawn. }
6. Be2
{ Aiming to quickly castle and profit from a development advantage as we are giving away the e4-pawn. }
6... Qxe4
{ 6...Nf6  is met by  7.Nf5  and thanks to the fact that our bishop on e2 safeguards our king, when Black  captures on e4 with  7...Qxe4  is not a check and after  8.Nxg7  Kf8  9.Bh6  threatening discovered checks  9...Rg8  10.Ne6+  Ke7  11.Nxc7  and White is winning here. }
7. Nb5
{ is the key idea behind sacrificing the e4-pawn. Now the c7-pawn is extremely vulnerable. }
7... Bxc3+ 8. bxc3
{ Of course, we are not going to take with the b5-knight as we need it to attack the c7-pawn. }
8... Kd8
{ 8...Qxg2?  is not possible due to  9.Bf3  and the c7-pawn drops and subsequently the rook on a8 as well. }
9. O-O
{ This position is quite advantageous for White. His king is safe while Black’s king is very exposed and has lost the right to castle. White also has the bishop pair and is further developed. The only problem with White’s position are his doubled pawns. However, Black does not have a straightforward way to exploit this. }
9... Nf6 10. Bf3
{ 10.Re1  is also interesting but Black has some resources like  10...Qd5  slowing down White's attack. So we opt for 10.Bf3 to not allow even the slightest consolidation. }
10... Qc4 11. Rb1 { Holding on to the key dominating knight. } 11... Re8
{ If  11...h6  preventing Bg5 pins, then we have  12.Re1  a6  and once again, this mindblowing sacrifice with  13.Nd6  is winning after  13...cxd6  14.Be3  Ne5  15.Qxd6  and Black is busted after  15...Nxf3  16.gxf3  and he is helpless against Bb6+. }
12. Bg5 { The annoying pin :@@EndBracket@@. } 12... a6 13. Nd4

Of course, we can take on  b7  by  15.Bxb7  Bxb7  16.Rxb7  but then it frees the position and helps Black to stabilize with  16...Kc8  attacking the b7-rook and at the same time, moving away from the annoying pin along the g5-d8 diagonal. }
15. Bxf6+

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4
{ The Scotch Opening,sounds like a cocktail name :@@EndBracket@@ .The history goes like this , the name of this opening was created from a correspondence match in 1824 between Edinburgh and London. The Scotch had lost its favour among top players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black to equalise. Later legends like Garry Kasparov and Jan Timman helped to re-popularize the Scotch when it was specailly used as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analysed Ruy Lopez. And in recent modern times it still acts a suprise antidote once in a while by top players like Nepomiatchi ,Nakamura and many others though the theory has immensly developed. }
4... Qf6
{ The German chess master Adolf Andersson was one of the few Classical players who employed this way back in 1874. It is always nice to know about the classics. Of course, the general rule is that: 'Don't develop your queen out too early', but here is an exception as it is a very concrete approach to challenge the center. This was my main recommendation with the Black pieces against the Scotch in my first Chessable course that was the Lifetime Repertoire with 1...e5. This move turned out to be a hard nut to crack, but let's see what I have in store. }
5. Nf3
{ This move was popularized by Anish Giri in his game against Andreikin in 2017. The point of this shrewd move is sometimes White threatens to develop his c1-bishop with tempo to g5 in order to hit the queen on f6. }

11... a5
{ The key new move which was not played in any games in the database. Only  11...Qh6  was played before, but White got a nice position after  12.Nbd2  in the lines of Giri-Andreikin. The text move with 11..a5 secures the bishop on b6, and provides more room for it and challenges the b4-pawn. }
12. a3 { Maintaining the tension around the b4-pawn. } 12... axb4 13. cxb4 Bh3
{ 13...Nxb4  is met by  14.Bxe7  Kxe7  15.Nc3  and when Black returns with his knight, White will invade on d5 with his own knight. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }
5... Bb6
{ The right bishop retreat compared to others as it maintains pressure on the f2-pawn and the bishop obviously remains more active on b6 than on e7. }
6. Nc3 d6
{ Quite flexible keeping both the options of Nge7 and Nf6 in reserve, but the drawback is that it is bit slow. The move also does not create immediate pressure like in the case of  6...Nf6  which is the mainline. }
7. Qe2
{ White's main idea is to develop his pieces and aim for a quick long castle before Black attempts something in the center. }
7... Be6 { Black plans to castle long as well with either Qd7/Qe7. } 8. Be3

8... Nf6 9. O-O-O Qe7 { Preparing long castle. } 10. g3

10... O-O-O 11. Bxb6
{ We can as well start with  11.Bg2  but as Black has castled, it is better to double the pawns of Black on the b-file. Moreover, now after ...axb6, the a-file is not open for the rook on a8 as he has already castled. }
11... axb6 12. Bg2 { Dominating the center. } 12... Rhe8

13... Kb8 14. f4

If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }
5... Bb6
{ The right bishop retreat compared to others as it maintains pressure on the f2-pawn and the bishop obviously remains more active on b6 than on e7. }
6. Nc3 Nf6

7. Bg5
{ is the recent trend to pin the f6-knight immediately. The plus point is that the White queen can now go to either Qe2 or Qf3 to pressurize the f6-knight followed by long castle. So White by this move order has many flexible plans and rich ideas. Before  7.Qe2  was heavily played, but Black found some nice ideas here with  7...a5!  creating counterplay and preparing ...a4.   If  7...O-O?!  is not so accurate due to  8.Bg5  and if  8...a5  now White can hop on with  9.Nd5  That's the major difference of first playing ...a5 and later doing it  8.a4  O-O  White has now made a weakness with the a4-pawn push, so Black will be able to neutralize the  9.Bg5  pin after  9...Nb4  10.O-O-O  d5  with complex play.   One more key note is if  7.Qe2  a5  8.a4  O-O  9.Be3  here is not effective as Black is in time to achieve the  9...d5  break immediately.  10.Bxb6  cxb6  11.O-O-O  Re8  12.Qe3  Bd7  and Black is fine. }
7... h6 8. Bh4 d6

9. Bb5
{ 9.Qe2  is met by  9...g5  10.Bg3  Qe7  and Black is in time to stabilize his position with long castle coming. So, the text move is the critical option to meet Black's flexible 8...d6. }
9... Bd7 { and now we can place the queen on e2 to prepare long castle. } 10.

The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6
{ is known as the Schmidt Variation. This is a very natural move: Black is developing a piece while attacking White’s central pawn.

5. Nxc6
{ This is the most popular continuation for White against the move 4...Nf6. White chooses to play this intricate line over the Four Knights in order to catch Black by surprise and not allow him to go into the lines in which he is more prepared. White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }

6... Qe7
{ As you can tell, these moves are rather forced. Black plays Qd8-e7 to delay getting the knight out of the attack for one more move. With this move, Black pins the e-pawn to the king. Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square. And also the huge difference between first 6... Nd5 and 6...Qe7 followed by 7...Nd5 is that it forces White to play 7.Qe2 which blocks the f1-bishop. }

{ Coming back now that the h-file is closed and we are not able to play h5 as our bishop on  h2  is hindering the rook on  h1  . If the direct  11...b5  then  12.Nd5  was the problem as the knight on c3 is activated and wreaks havoc on Black's position. Black's h5-knight is also on the rim and is doomed when our knight arrives on d5. That is the reason Black returns his knight back to f6 to keep control over the d5-square but we have other plans here. }

{ 1...Nc6 and 2...d6 is a weird combination as the knight on c6 simply blocks the c7-pawn from challenging the centre with c7-c5. Although weird, the knight on c6 can exert pressure on our central pawn on d4 provoking us to play d5 and then break it with ...c6.

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'.

In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation.

De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.'

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening.

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }

For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }
2. e5
{ White takes full control over the center and the knight is chased upon by our pawns. }
2... Nd5 { The knight is forced to move for a second time. } 3. d4
{ Fortifying the center. } 3... d6 { Attacking the central pawn on e5. } 4. Nf3
{ The Modern Variation. This has been very popular for White as of late. White simply maintains the strong pawn on e5 and continues with development with the intention of capturing on e5 with the knight when Black takes the pawn on e5. }
4... g6 { The idea is to develop the bishop to g7. } 5. Bc4
{ The bishop stands tall on c4 and creates a nuisance for the knight on d5. Also, when the knight moves away from d5, the f7-pawn comes under pressure. }
5... Nb6 6. Bb3
{ Now the bishop on b3 has a clear vision and the f7-pawn is clearly targeted. }
6... Bg7 { The mainline. } 7. Ng5
{ Immediate action is called for by targeting the f7-pawn before Black is able to complete their development.  7.Qe2  was played in the famous immortal game of Nigel Short-Timman Tilburg 1991. If you have not witnessed the game yet, please check it to see the enthralling beauty of a king march! }

8. Qf3 { The queen joins the party. } 8... Qe7

{ Making use of the fact that Black has not played ...h6. Now we penetrate into the dark squares. If  10.dxe5  then  10...h6  stops Bg5.  11.Nf6+  Kf8  For the time being, Black's king is deprived of castling, but Black is coming next with...Nc6 attacking the center and he is in time to get counterplay. }
10... Qb4+ { Only move to gain activity. } 11. Nbd2
{ 11.c3  Qa5  12.dxe5  was an interesting novelty suggested by Parimarjan Negi in his book 1. e4 vs Minor Defenses. His analysis continued with  12...N8d7  13.Nbd2  Nxe5  14.Qg3  f5  15.O-O-O  O-O   15...fxe4?  loses to  16.Nc4  and Black is busted with his exposed king.  16.f4  and here  16...fxe4  is the powerful option which steers the game into complexity  17.fxe5  Qxe5  18.Qh4  and Black is time to roll with  18...a5  19.a4  Bd7  and Black is back in the game. Nevertheless Negi gives the resulting complications as a slight plus but I doubt the evaluation of the final position. Hence I was looking for relatively simpler ways and found this amazing novelty with 11.Nbd2 immediately trying to gain an initiative without wasting moves by employing c3. }
11... exd4 { Grabbing the second pawn!? } 12. a3

16... h5 17. Qd8+ Kg7
{ 17...Kh7  can be met by  18.Qxc7  and the f7-pawn comes under attack instantly. }
18. Qxd4+ e5 19. Qe3 Nc6 20. O-O-O
{ On a closer look, White's pieces are ideally placed and ready to strike on the kingside. Black's king is vulnerable and he has to be careful. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity.

In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City.

During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata.

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.'

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.'

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata.

Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata.

Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards.

The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915.

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.'

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

3. Nc3
{ The principled move attacking the queen and developing our pieces at the same time. }
3... Qa5
{ This is considered the 'classical' line, and is currently the most popular option. The only safe square for the queen from where is not attacked immediately. Of course after d4-Bd2, it comes under pressure, but by that time Black can build his setup with ...c6 and Qc7. }

13... Nxe5 14. dxe5 Nd5 15. h5
{ Now the bishop on g6 is in trouble and Black is forced to give up his d5-knight to save the position from drowning after }

{ Only move which protects both the rook on h1 and the pawn on c3. } 17... Be4
18. O-O-O
{ The main idea here is to trap the bishop on e4 after f3. c4 was not possible without long castle as the c3-pawn was hanging with check. }
18... h6
{ Providing some room for the bishop on h7. But now short castle becomes difficult as h6 has created a weakness. }
19. Rd4 Bd5 { If  19...Bh7  20.Qe3  planning g5 is quite strong. } 20. c4 Bg2
21. Rhd3 { With total control over the d-file. } 21... O-O 22. Bxg2 Qxg2 23.

{ Changing plans as Black has castled short. Now the g5 break is coming and Black is clearly worse here. }

Even though 4...c6 is considered more flexible, Black may wish to save a tempo in anticipation of White's plan of Qd2, followed by Bh6 by deferring ...Bg7 as long as possible, and playing for queenside activity with ...b7–b5 and ...Qa5. White's idea of Qd2 and Bh6 may give a transposition to the lines with Be3 and Qd2. But one small detail is that by placing the bishop on g5 rather than e3, the bishop does not come under ...Ng4 threats. Since the bishop is on g5, we can exert pressure on the f6-knight and we have f4-e5 ideas without blocking the dark-squared bishop. The drawback is that it can be attacked by ...h6 in some instances. }

8. Bd3 { Supporting the e4-pawn. } 8... c5

9. Nf3

Despite all this, the text move @@StartBracket@@9.Nf3@@EndBracket@@ looked to be more simple to me. }
9... cxd4
{ If  9...Bg4  then we have  10.e5  cxd4  11.Qg7  a cool intermezzo with the point that if  11...Rg8  we have the coldblooded  12.exf6  Rxg7  13.fxg7  and Black cannot stop us from making a new queen :@@EndBracket@@.   and if  11...Rf8  12.exf6  dxc3  13.b4  with a winning position. }
10. Nxd4 Nc6 11. Bb5 { The standard pin. } 11... Bd7 12. O-O-O O-O-O 13. Bxc6

Nf3, we give Black the signal that we are just playing against the bishop on g7 in a more positional manner which will upset the modern players and kills their hopes of getting a double-edged position.  I have played many games with the Modern defense for a win with Black. The positions after White opts for Nf3-c3, sabotage Black's ambitions of creating a double-edged game.

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... g6
{ The Modern Defense @@StartBracket@@also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch@@EndBracket@@ is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns on d4 and e4. Black proceeds to attack and undermine the center without attempting to occupy it themself. The opening has been used extensively by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab. The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence. The primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing their knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 to attack White's pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2–c3. Black allows White to occupy the full center with their pawns and gain a space advantage, in the hopes of pressuring White’s center from afar before later striking back with …c5. This opening philosophy was popularized by the hypermodern school of thought in the early 1900s. While giving White a free hand in the center is not without its downsides, the Modern Defense remains popular to this day with players seeking an imbalanced, strategically complex game! }

Nf3, we give Black the signal that we are just playing against the bishop on g7 in a more positional manner which will upset the modern players and kills their hopes of getting a double-edged position.  I have played many games with the Modern defense for a win with Black. The positions after White opts for Nf3-c3, sabotage Black's ambitions of creating a double-edged game. And besides, it is very easy to play with White as we will form a setup and put our pieces on the most logical squares. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears.

{ The Modern Defense @@StartBracket@@also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch@@EndBracket@@ is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns on d4 and e4. Black proceeds to attack and undermine the center without attempting to occupy it themself. The opening has been used extensively by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab. The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence. The primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing their knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 to attack White's pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2–c3. Black allows White to occupy the full center with their pawns and gain a space advantage, in the hopes of pressuring White’s center from afar before later striking back with …c5. This opening philosophy was popularized by the hypermodern school of thought in the early 1900s.

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears.

Black proceeds to attack and undermine the center without attempting to occupy it themself. The opening has been used extensively by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab. The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence. The primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing their knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 to attack White's pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2–c3. Black allows White to occupy the full center with their pawns and gain a space advantage, in the hopes of pressuring White’s center from afar before later striking back with …c5. This opening philosophy was popularized by the hypermodern school of thought in the early 1900s.

Nf3, we give Black the signal that we are just playing against the bishop on g7 in a more positional manner which will upset the modern players and kills their hopes of getting a double-edged position.  I have played many games with the Modern defense for a win with Black. The positions after White opts for Nf3-c3, sabotage Black's ambitions of creating a double-edged game. And besides, it is very easy to play with White as we will form a setup and put our pieces on the most logical squares. }
3... d6 4. c3
{ A nice subtle idea of blunting the bishop on g7. The pawns on c3 and d4 simply kill the activity of the bishop. }
4... Nf6 5. Bd3 { Supporting the e4-pawn. } 5... Nc6
{ Preparing ...e5 next to exert pressure on the d4-pawn. The position resembles the King's Indian Defense with one exception: that our pawn is on c3 and not on c4, which safeguards and strengthens the center. }
6. O-O e5

7... O-O 8. Re1
{ is one of the critical positions. White has formed his ideal setup. Black has a couple of options here. }
8... Re8
{ Looks logical to challenge the rook on e1 on the e-file. It also prevents us from forming our ideal setup with Be3-Nbd2 as the e4-pawn is hanging now. }
9. d5
{ Time for this advance in King's Indian style. The major plus point here is that now the rook on e8 is misplaced as Black requires his rook on f8 for the f5-breaks. Black would need to waste time to bring the rook back to f8. Utilizing this opportunity, we can build up our pawn storm on the queenside quickly. }
9... Ne7
{ In King's Indian style, but like I mentioned earlier, the major drawback is that Black's rook should be on f8 and not on e8 for f5-breakthroughs. }
10. c4

10... Nd7
{ Employed by Magnus against the Iranian youngster Parham Maghsoodhloo during the 2020 Chess.com Speed Chess Championship. }
11. Nc3 a5
{ Stopping us from expanding with b4 and also securing a nice spot for the d7-knight on c5. }
12. Bc2
{ Anticipating ...Nc5 and also acts as a prophylactic move against  12...f5  breaks as we can now take with  13.exf5  gxf5  14.Ng5  which is more effective now with the bishop on c2 as it is more safe from ...e4 ideas from Black. }
12... Rf8
{ Next on the agenda is ...h6 preventing Ng5 jumps and prepares for the ...f5 break. }
13. a3
{ We need to get b4 in before Black consolidates his kingside and attacks with ...f5. The plan is Bd2/Be3-b4 for White. }
13... h6 14. Be3
{ White places the bishop on e3 so that it will help in c5-breaks later. }
14... f5
{ So, Black finally get his much needed break, but we have a nice idea here and respond with }
15. exf5 gxf5
{ 15...Nxf5  16.Qd2  is much better for White as Black lacks counterplay. } 16.
Nh4
{ is the precise and subtle idea for White without which he is not better. The plan is to chip in f4 and create a total bind on the kingside restricting Black's activity. Here a series of precise moves are required to convert the position into a stable plus. }
16... Nf6 17. c5
{ Now we can witness the idea behind placing the bishop on e3 as it helps to create a thrust with c5. White is better here as Black finds it difficult to do something on the kingside as the ...f4 advance will weaken the whole range of light squares from the c2-h7 diagonal. }

FIDE Master Dennis Monokroussos even goes so far as to describe it as 'possibly the worst opening in chess'. As assessed by Paul van der Sterren in Fundamental Chess Openings, 'What is required to play the Latvian Gambit with any degree of success is a sharp eye for tactics, and a mental attitude of total contempt for whatever theory has to say about it.' This pawn sacrifice is an aggressive attempt from Black and immediately asks White about their plans for the e4-pawn. Once again, without proper development, it simply backfires which reminds me of my second Chessable course on the Jaenisch Gambit where we develop our pieces and then gambit. }

The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity as positional play became more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess by World War I. Today, the Philidor is a solid but passive choice for Black. It is rarely seen at top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence. Having said that, it is seen more often in the online rapid and blitz games. Daniil Dubov and Magnus Carlsen have employed the Philidor numerous times in 2020. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 d6
{ The opening is named after the famous 18th-century player François-André Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White's center by the pawn thrust ...f7–f5. The Philidor occurred in one of the most famous games ever played, 'The Opera Game' played in 1858 between the American chess master Paul Morphy and two strong amateurs, the German noble Duke Karl of Brunswick and the French aristocrat Count Isouard. The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity as positional play became more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess by World War I. Today, the Philidor is a solid but passive choice for Black. It is rarely seen at top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence. Having said that, it is seen more often in the online rapid and blitz games. Daniil Dubov and Magnus Carlsen have employed the Philidor numerous times in 2020. }

For instance,  6.Bf4  is extremely sharp and recommended by Wesley So in his Chessable course, but I was not so convinced with the line arising after  6...O-O  7.Qd2  The main idea behind Bf4 is for White to finish his development on the queenside with Qd2 and aim for a quick long castle.  7...d5!  is the critical option I was worried about when I probed into Wesley's course  8.Ndb5  Bb4  9.O-O-O  c6  10.Nc7  Nxe4  It's getting super crazy after  11.Qd4  Nxc3  12.bxc3  Ba3  All these moves were kind of forced and one has to rely on memory to note the difficult nuances and on top of that, the long line continues with  13.Kb1  Bg4  14.f3  Be6  15.Nxa8  Qa5  16.Bd2  Na6  17.c4  Bb4  18.cxd5  Bxd5  19.Bxb4  Nxb4  20.Bc4  Bxc4  21.Qxc4  b5  22.Qb3  Rxa8  White is obviously much better, but practically it is not that clear. Moreover, there are so many forced variations and lines to know. Hence I prefer 6.g3 which is more simple and easy to play. Also, from a conceptual point of view, the move looks more to the point as it controls the center on d5. The bishop on g2 is a lovely place to be in. }

Today, the Philidor is a solid but passive choice for Black. It is rarely seen at top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence.

2. Nf3 Nf6
{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game.

Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls.

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls.

The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls.

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level.

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

21... Qd5 22. Qxd5 cxd5 23. Nc2
{ And the knight will head to b4. White is slightly better in this endgame as the bishop is stuck on g4 and will take some time to get back into the game. On a closer look, White is a pawn down, but the Black bishops are stuck and his scattered pawns are prime targets for our knight. Hence White has more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Qh4
{ Steinitz Variation. Steinitz's 4...Qh4!? almost wins a pawn by force, but White gets a lead in development and attacking chances as compensation. While this bold move may not be the most sound for Black, it definitely offers chances for interesting play. Players who like aggressive and double-edged games will feel at home in this variation. The idea is to put pressure on e4, as after White plays Nc3 to defend it, Bb4 will challenge the protection of the pawn once more. This is a variation in which White needs to be precise and know what he is doing. The main idea is to transfer a knight to b5, from where it will put pressure on the c7-pawn. Please note that the c7-pawn has been weakened by Black’s early queen escapade. But if White knows these ideas and plays them, the Steinitz Variation will lead to a solid advantage. }
5. Nc3
{ Supporting the e4-pawn and White aims for quick development in order to exploit the weird queen on h4 which has ventured out quite early. The golden principle of chess states that: 'Don't bring your queen too early.' Let's see how we can utilize this factor and take advantage of it. }
5... Bb4
{ 5...Bc5  doesn't make any sense as we have  6.Be3  holding everything together with a much better position. The text move with 5...Bb4 is the key idea to renew the pressure on the e4-pawn. }

The only problem with White’s position are his doubled pawns. However, Black does not have a straightforward way to exploit this. }
9... Nge7 10. Re1
{ A logical move to occupy the e-file and target the queen on e4. The queen does not really have a proper hideout now. }
10... a6 11. Bd3 Qa4 12. Nd4 d6
{ 12...Nxd4  13.cxd4  Qxd4  only helps White as after  14.Rb1  15.Bb2 is coming next and Black's position is extremely dangerous with everything opened up. }

13... Nxd4 14. cxd4 Be6

The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you.

This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }

7. f4
{ Towards the centre threatening e5 next. White has interesting options like  7.Bf4  with the plan of Qd2 & O-O-O, but 7.f4 is more in the spirit of the position to utilize the passive placement of the bishop on e7. }

And  11...Be6  will be met by  12.Qe2  planning Rad1 with a much better position. }
12. a4 { Stopping ...a4. } 12... Nb4
{ This is the slight drawback of our move a4, but it is no big deal as we can occupy the d4-square which is free now thanks to the fact that Black's knight is on b4. }

And if  16...g5  trying to break the base of the pawn chain @@StartBracket@@ f4@@EndBracket@@ , it weakens his kingside drastically and is met by  17.Bh5  targeting the f7-pawn and also some ideas like e6 breaks are floating in the air  17...gxf4  18.Qg4  and the f7- pawn drops. }
17. g4 { A powerful operation on the kingside. } 17... g5 18. Nce2

For instance, if  21...Be7  safeguarding the f6-square then  22.Re1  pressurizing the e5-knight  22...f6  and  23.Ra3  with an overwhelming advantage with all the pieces crashing through Black's camp. }

10. Bxc6 { Shattering the pawn structure. } 10... bxc6 11. Qf3

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3

For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight.

7... Bb4

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }

By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3

For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight.

If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

9. Be3
{ Coming back to exchange the bishop on b6 as we have successfully provoked f6. }
9... Bxe3

10. Qxe3 f5
{ So Black has to break somewhere otherwise his position will remain passive.  10...d5?!  is not possible due to  11.O-O-O  and the pin on the d-file is annoying. }
11. O-O-O f4
{ If  11...d6  is too slow and we can already take on f5 as we have completed long castle.  12.exf5  Nxf5  13.Qd2  a5  14.Bb5  A strong move preventing ...a4.  14...Be6  15.f4  and White dominates whereas Black's attack is stopped on the queenside. }

For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight.

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5

Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5.

The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight.

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }
5... Bb6
{ The right bishop retreat compared to others as it maintains pressure on the f2-pawn and the bishop obviously remains more active on b6 than on e7. }
6. Nc3 Nf6

7. Bg5

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }

7. Bg5

So White by this move order has many flexible plans and rich ideas. Before  7.Qe2  was heavily played, but Black found some nice ideas here with  7...a5!  creating counterplay and preparing ...a4.   If  7...O-O?!  is not so accurate due to  8.Bg5  and if  8...a5  now White can hop on with  9.Nd5  That's the major difference of first playing ...a5 and later doing it  8.a4  O-O  White has now made a weakness with the a4-pawn push, so Black will be able to neutralize the  9.Bg5  pin after  9...Nb4  10.O-O-O  d5  with complex play.   One more key note is if  7.Qe2  a5  8.a4  O-O  9.Be3  here is not effective as Black is in time to achieve the  9...d5  break immediately.  10.Bxb6  cxb6  11.O-O-O  Re8  12.Qe3  Bd7  and Black is fine. }

With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }
5... Bb6
{ The right bishop retreat compared to others as it maintains pressure on the f2-pawn and the bishop obviously remains more active on b6 than on e7. }
6. Nc3 Nf6
{ The mainline which is a acid test for White arising from the classical 4...Bc5 system. With this move, Black immediately keeps an eye on our central pawn and aims for quick development with O-O and Re8. }
7. Bg5
{ is the recent trend to pin the f6-knight immediately. The plus point is that the White queen can now go to either Qe2 or Qf3 to pressurize the f6-knight followed by long castle. So White by this move order has many flexible plans and rich ideas. Before  7.Qe2  was heavily played, but Black found some nice ideas here with  7...a5!  creating counterplay and preparing ...a4.   If  7...O-O?!  is not so accurate due to  8.Bg5  and if  8...a5  now White can hop on with  9.Nd5  That's the major difference of first playing ...a5 and later doing it  8.a4  O-O  White has now made a weakness with the a4-pawn push, so Black will be able to neutralize the  9.Bg5  pin after  9...Nb4  10.O-O-O  d5  with complex play.   One more key note is if  7.Qe2  a5  8.a4  O-O  9.Be3  here is not effective as Black is in time to achieve the  9...d5  break immediately.  10.Bxb6  cxb6  11.O-O-O  Re8  12.Qe3  Bd7  and Black is fine. }
7... O-O
{ So Black completes his development in order to rush with ...Re8 to create counterplay against the e4-pawn. }
8. Qe2
{ Like I mentioned earlier,  8.Qf3  is interesting to create direct pressure on the f6-knight, but Black is in time to solve this problem by  8....Ne5  9.Qg3   9.Qf4  Ng6  9...Neg4  and the bishop on g5 is kind of stuck.   Hence we settle with  8.Qe2  and here the key difference is that Black cannot play  8...a5  like in the earlier variation on move 7 @@StartBracket@@ 7.Qe2 a5 @@EndBracket@@ due to the fact that we can meet it with  9.Nd5  which will be discussed in detail.   Key note - Obviously placing the queen on  d2  by general terms would be ideal because it will not block the f1-bishop, but the concrete problem after  8.Qd2  is  8...h6  9.Bh4  Nxe4 }
8... h6
{ is always useful to kick the bishop one step back so that Black can insert ...g5 after 9.Bh4 at the right time to get rid of the pin. And the drawback is that h6 is some sort of weakness if White happens to attack with the pawn roll by g4-h4, but it is a long way for that. }
9. Bh4 { Maintaining the pin. } 9... a5
{ The critical line provoking White to play a4 which creates some sort of weakness. }
10. a4
{ 10.Nd5?!  here is not possible because of  10...g5  also one of the advantages of including ...h6 by Black.  11.Nxb6  cxb6  12.Bg3  Nxe4  and Black is doing good.   And  10.O-O-O  also leads to  10...a4  11.Nd2  a3  and Black obtains tremendous counterplay. }
10... Nd4
{ The mainline which we discussed earlier without the inclusion of a5-a4 and now we see it with the inclusion. }
11. Qd3
{ Once again not to fall into the trap with  11.Qd2?  as  11...Nxe4  wins on the spot.   And  11.Nxd4?!  is also dubious as it only activates the bishop on b6. }
11... Nxb3 12. cxb3
{ Now one can notice the difference between the inclusion of ...a5-a4 as we are forced to capture with the c- pawn rather than the preferable a-pawn. }
12... c6 { Preparing ...d5. } 13. O-O-O d5
{ So far all logical moves from both sides. The battle is as always for the center and now White has some interesting ideas with }
14. Qc2
{ 14.exd5  was played heavily before, but I am not a big fan of releasing the tension as after  14...cxd5  15.Qc2  Be6  Black is doing totally fine in the opposite colored bishop endgame with  16.Bxf6  Qxf6  17.Nxd5  Bxd5  18.Rxd5  Qxf2 }
14... Qd6 { Threatening ...Qf4+. } 15. Kb1 d4
{ Unable to cope up with the pressure on the d5-pawn, Black releases the tension. }
16. f3 { Securing the center. } 16... Nd7
{ Rerouting the knight away from the pressure from the h4-bishop. } 17. Bc4
{ All of the pieces are entering the game. } 17... Ne5 18. Bg3
{ And White maintains a nice edge here. Next, he will place his knight back to e2 and perhaps to c1-d3 at some point. White's center is formidable @@StartBracket@@f3, e4 @@EndBracket@@ and he is positionally better. }

Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square.

{ Now you can see why committing Nd2 early on move 10 is not that great as without it, we can develop our dark- squared bishop.

{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6
{ is known as the Schmidt Variation. This is a very natural move: Black is developing a piece while attacking White’s central pawn. The fact that there is still a lot left to discover and explore about the theory in this variation has drawn many players all over the world to it. It has definitely increased in popularity lately. }
5. Nxc6
{ This is the most popular continuation for White against the move 4...Nf6. White chooses to play this intricate line over the Four Knights in order to catch Black by surprise and not allow him to go into the lines in which he is more prepared. White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }
5... bxc6 6. e5
{ The main point of exchanging the knight on c6 is to push this central pawn to e5 to disturb the knight on f6. }
6... Qe7
{ As you can tell, these moves are rather forced. Black plays Qd8-e7 to delay getting the knight out of the attack for one more move. With this move, Black pins the e-pawn to the king. Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square. And also the huge difference between first 6... Nd5 and 6...Qe7 followed by 7...Nd5 is that it forces White to play 7.Qe2 which blocks the f1-bishop. }
7. Qe2
{ Only move to support the e5-pawn, otherwise Black will utilize the pin on the e-file with d6 next. }
7... Nd5 { The main tabiya. } 8. h4
{ Our friend, Harry is marching ahead in the spirit of Ginger GM, Simon Williams. The topical trend nowadays is to push h4 early in the opening. Staying true to the times of Alpha Zero. }
8... a5
{ The idea is obvious. It is time to play ...Ba6 and moreover, ...a5 is always a useful expansion especially when White castles queenside. }
9. c4 { Kicking the knight. } 9... Nb6 10. h5
{ A rare move, just played in one game in my whole database. Generally, players preferred  10.Nd2  over 10.h5, but there Black is in time to create counterplay after  10...Qe6  with the intention of ....Bb4-Ba6. So with the text move 10.h5, we directly aim to create chaos by 11.h6 next. }
10... Qe6 { Paving a way for the f8-bishop. } 11. Be3
{ Now you can see why committing Nd2 early on move 10 is not that great as without it, we can develop our dark- squared bishop. Moreover, the advantage of placing the bishop on  e3  is that we are targeting the b6-knight and can exchange any time when the c4-pawn needs defending. And if  11.h6  here Black has an intermezzo with  11...Bb4+  followed by ...g6. }
11... Qxe5
{ Grabbing the central pawn looks obvious, but in turn opens up the e-file and White rushes to castle long after }
12. Nd2 Be7 13. O-O-O
{ Next the knight is headed to f3 to disturb the queen on e5. } 13... Bf6
{ Precise and threatening mate in one. The main point is that it provides a nice square for the queen on  e5  to  e7  . If  13...O-O  then  14.h6  g6  15.f4  forces Black's queen to go to e6 where it is not comfortable. Play might continue with  15...Qe6  but White has pressure after  16.Qf2  preparing g4 sometimes. }
14. Nf3 { Renewing communication to defend the b2-pawn. } 14... Qe7 15. Qc2 d6
{ 15...O-O?  is bad due to  16.g4  and White is winning with g5 next. } 16. Re1
Be6 17. Nd4
{ And White has a lot of play here with his active pieces for the pawn. } *

Once we stabilize, Black's defective pawn structure begins to tell.

10... f6 { Challenging the central pawn on e5 immediately. } 11. g3
{ Played in the game of Cheparinov-Predke 2019. The point is that if the direct  11.b3  Nf4  is incoming and Black will be able to take the e5-pawn with his queen as his knight is no longer hanging on d5. Hence we play 11.g3 to prevent ...Nf4 jumps.   11.Qe4  is also interesting to remove the queen from the pin and renewing the threat to attack the d5-knight. Play might continue with  11...Nb6  12.exf6  Qxe4  13.Nxe4  gxf6  14.Nxf6  White may have grabbed a pawn, but after  14...Kf7  Black's activity compensates for it and moreover, the c4-pawn is hanging now. }

{ There are always two ways to counter the c4 push. One is to pin it by ...Ba6 and the next is to return to b6 with ...Nb6. }
10. Nd2
{ Here the problem with  10.b3  is that Black has  10...g6  with the idea of Bg7 and pressurize the e5-pawn.  11.Bg5  Qb4+  12.Bd2  Qe7  and White has nothing more than a draw. So instead of 10.b3, White plans to develop his pieces quickly by 10.Nd2. }
10... f6 { Challenging the central pawn on e5 immediately. } 11. g3
{ Played in the game of Cheparinov-Predke 2019. The point is that if the direct  11.b3  Nf4  is incoming and Black will be able to take the e5-pawn with his queen as his knight is no longer hanging on d5. Hence we play 11.g3 to prevent ...Nf4 jumps.   11.Qe4  is also interesting to remove the queen from the pin and renewing the threat to attack the d5-knight. Play might continue with  11...Nb6  12.exf6  Qxe4  13.Nxe4  gxf6  14.Nxf6  White may have grabbed a pawn, but after  14...Kf7  Black's activity compensates for it and moreover, the c4-pawn is hanging now. }
11... fxe5
{ Grabbing the pawn, but the drawback is that the e-file is blocked and Black's activity along the e-file is  neutralized. }
12. b3 { Safeguarding the c4-pawn before moving the d2-knight to e4. } 12...
O-O-O 13. Bg2
{ Improvement over the aforementioned game of Cheparinov-Predke as after  13.Ne4  Nf6  14.Bh3  Black has  14...Kb8  and ... d5. }
13... Nf6
{ 13...e4  is clearly the best move here to sacrifice the pawn in order to open up the position. The move comes with the sneaky threat of ...Qe5 to trap the rook on a1.  14.Nxe4  has to be played and after  14...Nf6  Black is in time to neutralize, but play might continue after  15.Nxf6  Qxf6  16.Bb2  Bb4+  17.Kf1  Bc3  18.Bxc3  Qxc3  19.Rd1   or  19.Re1  and Black still has to solve the issue of the doubled pawns. White's king will reach h2 and once he reaches there, he will be safe and all set. }
14. O-O
{ And next White's bishop will land on b2. White has also some ideas like Qe3-Qa7 and with Black's king exposed, Black is in danger. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6

5. Nxc6
{ This is the most popular continuation for White against the move 4...Nf6. White chooses to play this intricate line over the Four Knights in order to catch Black by surprise and not allow him to go into the lines in which he is more prepared. White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }

6... Qe7
{ As you can tell, these moves are rather forced. Black plays Qd8-e7 to delay getting the knight out of the attack for one more move. With this move, Black pins the e-pawn to the king. Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square. And also the huge difference between first 6... Nd5 and 6...Qe7 followed by 7...Nd5 is that it forces White to play 7.Qe2 which blocks the f1-bishop. }

Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square.

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5.

The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game.

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6
{ is known as the Schmidt Variation. This is a very natural move: Black is developing a piece while attacking White’s central pawn. The fact that there is still a lot left to discover and explore about the theory in this variation has drawn many players all over the world to it. It has definitely increased in popularity lately. }
5. Nxc6
{ This is the most popular continuation for White against the move 4...Nf6. White chooses to play this intricate line over the Four Knights in order to catch Black by surprise and not allow him to go into the lines in which he is more prepared. White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }
5... bxc6 6. e5
{ The main point of exchanging the knight on c6 is to push this central pawn to e5 to disturb the knight on f6. }
6... Qe7
{ As you can tell, these moves are rather forced. Black plays Qd8-e7 to delay getting the knight out of the attack for one more move. With this move, Black pins the e-pawn to the king. Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square. And also the huge difference between first 6... Nd5 and 6...Qe7 followed by 7...Nd5 is that it forces White to play 7.Qe2 which blocks the f1-bishop. }
7. Qe2

7... Nd5 { The main tabiya. } 8. h4

{ Disturbing the knight which is dominating on d5. } 9... Ba6
{ A standard development of the bishop that makes use of our placement of our queen on e2 and now Black can maintain his knight on d5 for a while. }
10. Rh3
{ In many openings, the rooks don't participate until fairly deep into the middlegame. You touch on the reason in your question - the rooks have to wait until all the other pieces are out of the way in order to develop. The specific strategy for rook development will depend on the position, but generally speaking, the rooks belong on the open and half open files in the middlegame. But here by move 10, it is coming into the game via the h-file. The idea is to shift the rook to a3 and to harass the bishop on a6 which is pinning the c4-pawn. So, Black has to take concrete action to defend Ra3. }
10... fxe5 11. Bg5
{ White has sacrificed a pawn to develop his pieces with tempo. And in this position, I can see one name popping out the whole screen. Morozevich had this position numerous times in his games. }

14. Qd1
{ The Qf3-Qd1 plan was a nice provocation. Now 15.Nd2 is on the cards next to go after the e4-pawn. Moreover, the queen on d1 is headed to a4. }

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }

White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared.

After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }

Therefore, White’s best attempt is to play Qd1-e2 himself, so that the pawn is no longer pinned and the knight has to move. Black will eventually have to move the knight to the d5-square.

Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization.

{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6

5. Nxc6
{ This is the most popular continuation for White against the move 4...Nf6. White chooses to play this intricate line over the Four Knights in order to catch Black by surprise and not allow him to go into the lines in which he is more prepared. White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }

This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears.

By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4
{ The Scotch Opening. Kasparov often employed this opening as his “secret weapon” against 1...e5. He mainly used it as an alternative to the Ruy López – the most popular opening with 1.e4 e5 at the top-level. The Scotch Game is characterized by White pushing d2-d4 on his third move, instead of developing the king’s bishop, as is more common in the Spanish or the Italian. However, there is one question you must ask yourself, and it is why you should choose this opening over a different one. Why play the Scotch Game? Several reasons lead a player to choose an opening over others. One of them is particular taste and preferred style over the board. For instance, a solid and strategic player who prefers slow-paced games might opt for 1.d4. A highly creative and tactical chess player will most certainly feel inclined towards 1.e4. Black does not have the opportunity to shape the character of the game as much as White does since they move first. If you are playing with the Black pieces and face 1.e4, replying symmetrically with 1...e5 is one of the most popular options. If you have the White pieces and decide to start with 1.e4, what to play against 1...e5 is one of the most important decisions you will make. Here is why the Scotch Game may be a good option for you. White’s idea behind playing d2-d4 on move 3 is to achieve harmonious development and take control over the centre. It offers logical and natural development of the pieces and many chances to grab an advantage. The Scotch Opening does not have as much opening theory as the Ruy López or the Italian Game. It is more likely to find unprepared opponents as the Spanish and Italian are more popular. This opening is often neglected by 1...e5 players who believe they will face other openings in the majority of their games. }
3... exd4
{ This move is the only one that makes sense in this position. As mentioned in the previous section, White’s idea by playing d2-d4 is to achieve full central control from early on. If Black replies in a passive way and does not take this pawn immediately, White may have the chance to push d4-d5 or play dxe5 and establish great control of the central squares, while also gaining a lot of space. For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Nf6

5. Nxc6
{ This is the most popular continuation for White against the move 4...Nf6. White chooses to play this intricate line over the Four Knights in order to catch Black by surprise and not allow him to go into the lines in which he is more prepared. White’s idea behind taking the knight on c6 is to be able to push e4-e5. This was not a possibility right away as Black’s c6-knight was protecting the e5-square. After playing e4-e5, White wants to develop while harassing Black’s knight and gaining tempi by forcing it to move. In this variation, Black must be exceptionally prepared. The Mieses Variation requires memorization and accuracy. It leads to complications and sharp tactical lines, so only players who have carefully studied should play it in their games. }

For instance, if Black plays a move like d7-d6 – seemingly supporting the e5-pawn, White can choose between d4-d5 or dxe5 in order to claim an advantage. }
4. Nxd4 Bc5
{ Even though the move  4...Nf6  has been increasing in popularity, the classical 4...Bc5 is still the most played in the Scotch Game. Players who do not wish to transpose to the Four Knights Variation or get into the complications of the Mieses Variation or the Steinitz Variation will certainly prefer this move. This is a sensible move, as Black is developing a piece, preparing to castle, and putting pressure on White’s central knight on d4. After 4...Bc5, it is now White who is faced with a choice. How should he continue his development? There are three different approaches he can use in this position to defend his central knight: 5.Nxc6, 5.Be3, and 5.Nb3. }
5. Nb3
{ is one of the fashionable options nowadays. This is perhaps the most logical move, instead of losing a tempo, White wins one by attacking Black’s bishop and forcing it to retreat. Since Black exerts pressure on our knight on  d4  , it looks more to the point in retreating the knight with tempo. For instance, in the old mainline with  5.Be3  Qf6  There is always some added pressure on the d4-knight. Black usually replies by retreating the bishop to b6, as it is the only available square to keep pressuring the center and the f2-pawn. }
5... Bb6
{ The right bishop retreat compared to others as it maintains pressure on the f2-pawn and the bishop obviously remains more active on b6 than on e7. }
6. Nc3
{ All the opening nuances are explained in the opening section, so let's dive into the game. }
6... d6
{ Quite flexible keeping both the options of Nge7 and Nf6 in reserve, but the drawback is that it is bit slow. The move also does not create immediate pressure like in the case of  6...Nf6  which is the mainline. }
7. Qe2
{ White's main idea is to develop his pieces and aim for a quick long castle before Black attempts something in the center. }
7... Nge7
{ Employed by Russian Grandmaster Tomashevsky numerous times. Black places his knight on e7 so that his f-pawn is free and can challenge the centre with ...f5 at the right time. }
8. Be3 { Following the plan. } 8... O-O
{ Here  8...Be6?!  planning to castle long is dubious as after  9.O-O-O  Qd7  we have  10.Nc5  to obtain the bishop pair. }
9. O-O-O
{ Both sides have castled on opposite sides and now it is the battle of who is faster in creating an attack on the opposing king. }
9... f5
{ The point behind placing the knight on  e7  . If  9...Be6  then we can roll with  10.f4  and now if Black blocks with  10...d5  then  11.e5  is quite strong. Hence Black hurries up with ...f5 now before White employs the f4 push. }
10. f4
{ The logical response to Black's thrust with 9...f5. White also gains more space on the kingside. }
10... fxe4 11. g3
{ Strengthening the pawn on  f4  and providing scope for the f1-bishop to  g2  .  11.Bxb6  is the prescribed move in the opening section. For more details, you can visitChapter 20. The move played in the game is equally interesting as well. }
11... Bxe3+
{ 11...Nf5  12.Bxb6  axb6  13.Bg2  We can capture the pawn back anytime as Black cannot really hold on to it.  13...e3  14.Be4±  And next g4 is incoming without having to worry about Nh4 which was the case with the bishop on g2. White is clearly better here. }
12. Qxe3 Bg4
{ 12...a5!?  May possibly be the best option to create some counterplay with the battering a-pawn, but nevertheless after some precise moves, White maintains a slight plus.  13.a3!  in preventive spirit.   13.Qxe4  is interesting as well  13...a4  14.Nc5  a3  15.Bc4  and apparently White is still better, but its slightly more complex compared to the simple text move with 13.a3.  13...Nf5   13...a4  14.Nd2  Nf5  15.Qxe4+=  And White is better as he has prevented counterplay on the a-file.  14.Qxe4  Re8  15.Qa4  Ne3  16.Re1+=  And White maintains a slight plus. }
13. Be2
{ White has more space, better pieces, and a nice pawn majority on the kingside. }
13... Nf5
{ 13...Bxe2  14.Qxe2  Qe8  Moving away from the d-file as our rook on d1 is pretty annoying which makes   14...Qd7?!  dubious due to  15.Nc5  Black's plan is to put the queen on f7 and connect the rooks.  15.Qxe4  Qf7  16.Rhe1  Rae8  17.Qd3+=  Still Black's position is not completely solved as his knight on e7 is misplaced and his knight on c6 has no scope as it is restricted by our pawn majority. }
14. Qxe4 Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Qe8 16. Qc4+ Qf7 17. Qb5
{ A nice queen sortie and now Black's pawn on b7 is hanging. } 17... Rab8 18.
Rhe1 { Total Domination. So far, great play by Anish. } 18... a6 19. Qd3
{ Keeping an eye on the f5-knight. } 19... Rbe8 20. a3
{ Small, but an effective improving move. } 20... b5
{ Black cannot exchange all the rooks as his knight on f5 is not protected, so he tries to pounce with ...b5, but is simply met by }
21. Nd5 { The knight rules now. } 21... Rc8 22. Qc3
{ Now Anish just demonstrates a fine technique to win the game after some precise moves. }
22... Nce7 23. Nxe7+ Nxe7 24. Qa5 Nc6 25. Qxa6 Qc4 26. Nd2 Qd5 27. c4 bxc4 28.

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... Nf6
{ The Alekhine Defense. The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament. Four years later, the editors of the fourth edition of Modern Chess Openings  (MCO-4)  wrote: 'Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defense introduced by Alekhine'. Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his king's knight to be driven across the board in the early stages of the game with the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's center pawns. In addition to Alekhine, another early proponent of the defense was Ernst Grünfeld. Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship, and Korchnoi also included the defense in his repertoire, leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level.   De Firmian observes, 'The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games. Most notably, he defeated former world champion Topalov in Linares 2008 using the opening. Carlsen will occasionally play the Alekhine in his online rapid and blitz games. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn center, with plans to undermine and attack the White structure later. And of course, the drawback is that White gains superior control over the center from an early stage and is strategically better from move 2. If he builds up his center without being undermined, then he simply enjoys a pleasant edge. }
2. e5

2... Nd5 { The knight is forced to move for a second time. } 3. d4
{ Fortifying the center. } 3... d6 4. Nf3

Nfd5 28. Qe2
{ 28.Bc1  was accurate as it is clear that the bishop on b2 is misplaced as it is restricted by its own pawns on d4 and e5. In this case, the bishop has to be moved again.  28...Nf5  29.Rd3± }
28... Nf5 29. Rd3 h4 30. gxh4 b6
{ 30...f6  would have given Black some chances of hope. } 31. Be4
{ 31.cxb6  Qxb6  32.Be4±  is definitely much better than 31.Be4 as White prevents the opening up of the d-file. }
31... bxc5 32. dxc5 Qe7
{ 32...Nde7!  is also good and White's pawns are hanging everywhere. So, White has clearly misplayed his position a few moves back. After all, its rapid, so we can't complain too much. }

{ Was a big blunder. I strongly believe that both players were playing on seconds. That explains the quality from the 27th move.  38...Nd5  Blocking the queen on c4.  39.Rxf7  Qg6  40.Be3  Qxf7=  And Black is totally fine here thanks to the super strong knight on d5 acting as a barrier to prevent the queen entry. The two rooks clearly balance themselves against the queen. }
39. Rg5 Qc2+ 40. Rg2
{ And the game ended quite drastically after a crude blunder. So till 25 moves, Karjakin played a fine game by slowly outplaying the opponent and showcasing some nice positional ideas. Only later he misplayed his position in time trouble, albeit he went on to win the game by utilizing the blunder from Magnus. }

{ The Center Counter Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings, first recorded as being played between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles in Valencia in 1475 in what may be the first recorded game of modern chess, and being mentioned by Lucena in 1497. Analysis by Scandinavian masters in the late 19th century showed it is playable for Black; Ludvig Collijn played the opening with success. Although the Scandinavian Defense has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. Joseph Henry Blackburne and Jacques Mieses often played it, and heavily influenced the theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was an occasional choice at the time for top players such as Siegbert Tarrasch, Rudolph Spielmann, and Savielly Tartakower. Alexander Alekhine used it to draw against World Champion Emanuel Lasker at St. Petersburg in 1914, and future World Champion José Raúl Capablanca won twice with it at New York 1915. A regular user from the 1950s onwards was Yugoslav International Master  (IM)  Nikola Karaklajic. A lengthy period of non-support by top players occurred after and subsequently ended by the 1960s.  Former world championship finalist David Bronstein and women's world champion Nona Gaprindashvili played it occasionally. Danish Grandmaster  (GM)  Bent Larsen, a four-time world championship candidate, played it once in a while from the 1960s onwards. Larsen defeated World Champion Anatoly Karpov with it at Montreal 1979, spurring a rise in popularity. The popular name also began to switch from 'Center Counter Defense' to 'Scandinavian Defense' around this time. In 1995, the Scandinavian Defense made its first appearance in a world chess championship match, in the 14th game of the PCA final at New York City. Viswanathan Anand as Black obtained an excellent position using the opening against Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov won the game. During the sixth round of the 2014 Chess Olympiad at Tromsø, Magnus Carlsen chose the Scandinavian against Fabiano Caruana and won. Carlsen also used the opening again to draw with Caruana at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku. Carlsen again used the opening as Black in a blitz game to defeat Viswanathan Anand at the 2019 Grand Chess Tour stop in Kolkata. So from time to time, it is employed at the elite level as an element of surprise. }

{ Now we will look at one of the enterprising games played in the Pirc defense which contains a lot of fireworks. Lets dive into the game. }
1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... d6
{ is usually played with the intention of playing thePirc Defence, a hypermodern defence in which Black allows White to construct a dominant center, with the intention of subverting it later. It can also lead to theModern Defence,Pribyl System or thePhilidor Defence. }
2. d4
{ As Black has not played 1...c5 or 1...e5, it is time for us to occupy the center at once. }
2... Nf6
{ The difference between the Modern Defense and the Pirc defense is that there Black first fianchettos the bishop on  g7  by playing 2...g6. This move delays the development of the knight on f6 and here Black immediately develops the knight to attack the e4-pawn. The difference is that in the Modern defense, we do not need to place the knight on c3 and can continue with different plans of playing against the bishop on  g7  like the one I recommended @@StartBracket@@the plan with Nf3, c3, Bd3@@EndBracket@@. But here we are forced to make a decision to protect the e4-pawn, generally with 3.Nc3 as following our Modern Defense recommendation with  3.Bd3  is not that effective and I even faced this with the Black pieces against the Chinese Grandmaster Wen Yang in Asian Teams 2018 and reacted with the precise  3...e5  4.c3  d5!  a powerful move immediately clarifying matters in the center.   If you compare with the Modern Defense of  2...g6  3.Nf3  Nf6  4.Bd3  the knight is already on f3 and there is no ...e5 business immediately. That explains the overall intricacies of the Modern and Pirc and the differences between one another. }
3. Nc3
{ Supporting the pawn on  e4  . Like I mentioned before  3.Bd3  here is not effective due to  3...e5 }
3... g6
{ This is the most commonly played line after Black responds to 1.e4 with 1...d6. It has been claimed to give rise to somewhat interesting and exciting games where Black will have counterplay, but has to be cautious about playing too passively. According to Garry Kasparov, the Pirc Defence is 'hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category', as it gives White 'too many opportunities for anybody's liking'. }
4. Bg5
{ The Bryne Variation was introduced by Robert Byrne in the 1960s, after which Black has often played the natural 4...Bg7. Even though 4...c6 is considered more flexible, Black may wish to save a tempo in anticipation of White's plan of Qd2, followed by Bh6 by deferring ...Bg7 as long as possible, and playing for queenside activity with ...b7–b5 and ...Qa5. White's idea of Qd2 and Bh6 may give a transposition to the lines with Be3 and Qd2. But one small detail is that by placing the bishop on g5 rather than e3, the bishop does not come under ...Ng4 threats. Since the bishop is on g5, we can exert pressure on the f6-knight and we have f4-e5 ideas without blocking the dark-squared bishop. The drawback is that it can be attacked by ...h6 in some instances. }
4... Bg7
{ 4...c6  is another main option recommended by Grandmaster Marin in his famous book on the Pirc defence. It is of course discussed in greater depth in the opening section. }
5. Qd2
{ Preparing the Bh6 invasion which is quite typical in the Pirc to get rid of the g7-bishop to weaken the dark squares. }
5... h6
{ is the main move preventing potential Bh6 invasions. The drawback is that the h6-pawn has created a weakness in itself. }
6. Bh4
{ Maintaining the pressure on the f6-knight as well as keeping the option of f4 alive. I played a game with  6.Bf4  a few years back, but later realized that perhaps the bishop is better placed on h4. }
6... g5
{ The main move to kick the bishop on h4 and now White is forced to concede the bishop. We don't mind this advance of h6-g5 because Black has weakened his king and also some squares. }
7. Bg3 Nh5
{ Otherwise no point in playing ...g5. The whole idea of playing ...g5 is to get the bishop on g3. }
8. O-O-O
{ We are forced to concede the bishop like I mentioned earlier, but we have a huge lead in development and Black has some weaknesses created by the g5-advance. }
8... c6
{ The game deviated from the theory section on move 8 and the possibilities are given below. Black clears the a5-d8 diagonal, preparing the activation of the queen to a5. The main drawback is that a further break of the enemy center with ...c5 will be at the loss of a tempo.  8...Nc6  is seenhere.   and  8...Nd7  can also be seen in theopening section. }
9. Nce2
{ A rare move. White prevents ...Qa5 and prepares to meet ...Nxg3 with Nxg3.  9.Be2!  forcing Black to capture on g3 is a stronger option.  9...Nxg3  10.hxg3  Qa5  Black develops his queen which is the main point behind playing ...c6 and he exerts some pressure on the enemy king. He also keeps the possibility of castling long himself.   10...b5  prematurely weakens the queenside without offering any attacking chances at all and is met by  11.f4!  And White strikes on the g5-pawn.  11...b4  12.Nb1  gxf4  13.gxf4  Qb6  14.Rh5±  Sealing Black's position completely and White has an overwhelming advantage.  11.f4!  The standard idea to exploit Black's g5-pawn.  11...Be6   11...Na6  12.Kb1  Nc7  13.Rh5  The rook lift has become common by now and now Black has trouble protecting his g5-pawn and if  13...b5  14.Nxb5  Nice tactical idea which wins the pawn after  14...Qxd2  15.Nxc7+±  12.d5  cxd5   12...Bxc3  13.Qxc3  Qxc3  14.bxc3+-  And Black's pawn drops on g5 thanks to the pin on the h-file.  13.exd5  Bf5  14.fxg5  And White wins the pawn with zero counterplay from Black.  14...Nd7  15.gxh6  Bxc3  16.Qxc3  Qxc3  17.bxc3±  With two pawns up, White should be clearly better. }
9... Qb6 10. e5
{ White strikes in the center as now the d6-pawn is targeted due to the fact that the queen from d8 has moved to b6. }
10... dxe5
{ Releases the tension.  10...Be6  11.exd6  Nxg3  12.Nxg3  exd6  13.Nh5±  And now the move 9.Nce2 has been justified as it has travelled all the way to h5 to disturb Black's harmony.   10...c5!  was perhaps the best defensive idea to counter in the center.  11.dxc5  dxc5  12.Nc3  Preparing Nd5 jumps.  12...Be6  Black still has some problems to solve after  13.Na4  but definitely way better than the game continuation. }
11. Bxe5 Nf6 12. h4 { I am coming for you :@@EndBracket@@. } 12... Nbd7
{ After this move, White gains a clear advantage by force with some brilliant sacrifices. The tactical operation with  12...Ne4  13.Qe3  Nxf2  does not work out well because Black is insufficiently defended.  14.Qxf2   14.Bxg7  is possible but allows one sneaky trick after  14...Qxb2+!  15.Kd2   15.Kxb2  Nxd1+-+  is the point  Nxd1  16.Kxd1  Rh7±  Still Black is worse, but 14. Qf2 seems to be more simpler than all this drama.  14...Bxe5  15.Nf3+-  And next hxg5 is coming with total domination.   12...g4  looks like a better try, aiming to keep the position closed, but nevertheless Black is suffering after  13.Bxf6  Bxf6  14.Nf4±  And White will bring all his pieces into the game after Bc4 and Nge2 with a great advantage. }
13. hxg5 Ne4
{ 13...hxg5  14.Rxh8+  Bxh8  15.Qxg5±  Black is a pawn down and underdeveloped. }
14. Bxg7
{ A breathtaking move, sacrificing the queen, but eliminating or trapping all of Black's developed pieces. }
14... Nxd2 15. Rxd2 Rg8
{ 15...Rh7  16.gxh6  Nf8  17.Nc3  And the bishop is headed to d3 to attack the h7-rook.  17...Bf5  18.d5  O-O-O  19.Nf3+-  And Black's position is just doomed to passivity, which can be seen with the h7-rook. }
16. gxh6
{ On a closer glimpse, White has two pieces and a dangerous advanced pawn on h6 for the queen. h7 is the immediate threat and Black will have to sacrifice one more piece to capture the annoying pawn. }
16... Nf8 17. h7 Nxh7 18. Rxh7
{ White has achieved considerable material advantage and should count on winning the game. }
18... Qa5
{ 18...Bf5  19.Rh5!  Black can never take on g7 due to Rh8+.  19...Bg6  20.Rh3  Rxg7  21.Rh8++- }
19. d5
{ is slightly imprecise, but nevertheless White still maintains the advantage.  White probably overlooked that after   19.Nc3!  He would not only defend the a2-pawn, but also parry the threat of  19...Qf5  with  20.Bd3± }
19... Qxa2 20. Nc3 Qa5
{ 20...Qa1+  was the best defense, but yet the three pieces give more than enough compensation for the queen.  21.Nb1  Bf5  22.Rh5  O-O-O  23.Rxf5  Rxg7  24.Rf3!  And the rook is coming to a3 to trap the queen.  24...Qa5  25.dxc6  And now we can take on c6 as after Rxd2, we can capture the rook back with the Knight which was not possible earlier because of the pin from the queen on a1. }

1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nf6
{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }
3. Nxe5
{ The Classical system is clearly the main alternative to face the Petroff.  3.d4  the Steinitz system was covered extensively in Wesley So's opening series. }
3... d6 4. Nf3
{ The Cochrane Gambit  4.Nxf7  would be fun only if it is objectively sound :@@EndBracket@@. Unfortunately, life is not so simple and adventurous. }
4... Nxe4 5. d4
{ 5.Nc3  is also an equally popular option here, but 5.d4 remains to be the classical and traditional option to face the Petroff, which is a hard nut to crack. }
5... d5 6. Bd3
{ White will try to drive Black's advanced knight from e4 with moves like c4 and Re1. If White achieves this, then he is up two tempi since White played d2-d4 compared to Black's d7-d6-d5. }
6... Bd6
{ This is the other plan apart from the putting the bishop on e7. The bishop on d6 is more active compared to it being on e7, but the drawback is that he loses contact over the d5-pawn. }
7. O-O
{ If  7.c4  then  7...Bb4+  is a testing option. So we castle first in order to play c4 next. }
7... O-O { The logical way to meet castle from White side. } 8. c4 c6
{ The only standard way to hold the d5-pawn. } 9. Nc3
{ Challenging the active knight on  e4  and exerts pressure on the d5-pawn.  9.Qc2  used to be the critical test for Black, but later Black found this nice new direction with  9...h6  which killed the whole line and was played heavily by none other than Levon Aronian. }
9... Nxc3 10. bxc3
{ By means of this exchange, we have got rid of the annoying knight on e4 and now the d3-bishop feels free. }

{ 12.Ng5  h6  13.Qf3  Bg6  14.Ne4  Bxh2  15.Kxh2  Qh4  16.Qh3  was one of White's early tries but Black was able to equalize later without much problems. So, they started to find new directions to put pressure on the Black pieces and one such move was 12.Bg5. }
12... Qa5
{ The main move keeping a eye on the c3-pawn and here I have provided two alternatives for White. It is always useful to have many interesting tries in the Petroff which is a hard nut to crack. }
13. Nh4
{ Going for the bishop on f5 became popular after Anish Giri's win over Caruana in 2018. }
13... Be6
{ 13...Bd7  is passive and is met by  14.f4  and Black is having difficulties. }
14. Bxe6 Qxg5
{ is the key point of course. On a closer glimpse, it might look drawish because of the opposite-coloured bishops. This is not the case as our bishop is much stronger than Black's dark-squared one as it exerts pressure on the f7-pawn. White definitely has a lot of play left and one such example is the win of Anish over Fabiano in Bundesliga 2018. The game showcased an instructive example of how to play such a position and convert it to a win. }
15. Nf3 { Here Black has some retreats. } 15... Qd8
{ 15...Qa5  is one another move discussed in theopenings section which may be more to the point. Once Black gets his knight out, his rooks will be connected which is not the case with the text move. }
16. Bb3 { Maintaining the pressure along the b3-g8 diagonal. } 16... Nd7
{ So far everything looks logical and natural, but White can pretend to have some microscopic edge thanks to the bishop on b3. The bishop on b3 is better placed and has more scope than Black's bishop on d6. }
17. Re1 g6
{ Preparing ...Kg7 to move away from the bishop on b3 and place his pieces on the dark squares. }
18. g3 { Restricting the bishop on d6. } 18... Kg7 19. Qd3
{ Likewise White is placing his pieces on the light squares and the battle continues. The main point of Qd3 is to connect the rooks. }
19... Nf6 20. Rad1
{ 20.c4  is the improvement suggested in the opening section. Perhaps Anish was not too happy with  20...c5  but you guys can have a look at this direction in the opening section. }
20... Rc8
{ Caruana opts for another route to get the a8-rook to the e-file by  ...Rc8-Rc7-Re7  .  20...Qa5=  immediately brings equality with the intention of connecting the rooks and challenging the White rooks on the e- file with ...Rae8 next. }
21. h4
{ Gaining space on the kingside and this will be definitely useful in the long run to create some sort of attack on Black's king.  21.Ne5  was another way to use the initiative, but Black has no problems after  21...Qc7  22.f4  c5⇆  And he gets enough counterplay whereas White is not able to prove anything with his strong knight on e5. }
21... Rc7 22. Kg2 Re7 23. Rxe7 Qxe7 24. Re1 Qd7
{ Anish keeps a slightly more preferable position, but there is nothing serious going on. Black should be able to hold with precise play, but that's the whole point of this system to maintain some small pressure and wait for any chance. Equal or slightly more preferable is not a draw. }
25. Ne5
{ Anish seizes the chance to create some activity. Nevertheless, Black's position is solid and not easy to break. }
25... Bxe5 26. Rxe5 Re8 { Close to a draw but not yet :@@EndBracket@@. } 27.

32. g4

32... hxg4 33. fxg4 Qd8
{ 33...Kh7  Black is still not worse and after this move, he can survive the attack quite efficiently.  34.Kf3  White is only marginally better here, nothing more. }
34. Kf3 Kh7
{ 34...Qd7!  was the last chance to stop White from playing h5 and entering Black's camp. After the game continuation, the defensive task is even more difficult.  35.Qf6  Kh7  36.Kf4  All our pieces are dominating, but what's next is the lingering question.  36...b5  37.h5  gxh5  38.gxh5  Qh3⇆  The knight can not be taken because of ... Qh2+ and Black obtains sufficient counterplay thanks to his active queen. }
35. h5

35... f6 36. Qe6 { Black's king is clearly exposed now. } 36... Kg7 37. Kf4
{ Provoking ...g5+, a move that would be very bad for Black as it gives White a free ride with his protected passed pawn on h5. }
37... a5 38. a3
{ 38.Bc2!  is precise by targeting the g6-pawn and White is winning after  38...gxh5   38...Nf7  Trying to bring the queen into the game, but White has a sound advantage after  39.Bxg6  Qc7+  40.Ke3  Ng5  41.Qe8  Qg3+  42.Kd2  Nf3+  43.Kc1+-  and White is able to escape the checks by @@StartBracket@@Kb2-Bc2@@EndBracket@@.  39.gxh5  Nf7  trying some counterplay against the White king but it fails to  40.Bb3!  40...Ng5  41.Qf5  41...Qd6+  42.Kg4±  And Qg6+ is coming next. Black is in trouble here. }
38... gxh5
{ 38...a4!  This extra addition gives Black good chances to hold the position.  39.Ba2   39.Bxa4?!  Nf7⇆  Suddenly Black obtains some counterplay as the light-squared bishop is deflected and now Black can bring his knight to g5 and queen to c7.  39...gxh5  40.gxh5  Kh6  41.Bb1  Nb5⇆  A counterintuitive move and Black is fine here. }
39. gxh5 Kh6 40. Bc2 { Cornering the king. } 40... Qf8 { 40...Kxh5??  41.Qh3 }
41. Kf3

{ I must say this was a brilliant one game innovation of Nepomniachtchi which gave him the desired result as Black needs to play like a machine to hold the concrete and forcing line which will happen after this move. Of course by now if Black players have looked this game, they might have analyzed this opening to a draw. But back then, it was not the case. My point of choosing this game is to show that there are a lot of interesting one game ideas everywhere and it is very hard for Petroff players to face the arrows arising from everywhere.  15.Bh4  is the mainline and the most objective one to create some chances, analyzed extensively in theopenings section. }
15... Bh7 16. Bxh6 { The fireworks have begun. } 16... gxh6
{ 16...Bxh2+  17.Kh1  gxh6  18.Qg4+  Kh8  19.Nf5  Bxf5  20.Qxf5  and the bishop on h2 is kind of locked in.  20...Bd6  21.Qf6+  Kg8  22.Re4  Ends the story :@@EndBracket@@. }
17. Qg4+ Kh8 18. Nf5 Bxf5 19. Qxf5
{ Now comes the first pitfall. If Black takes on h2, then it transposes to 16...Bxh2 and he is worse. }
19... f6 { Only move to prevent Qf6+ invasions. } 20. Rad1
{ All the pieces are in play and here comes the second moment where Black has to play precisely. }
20... cxd5
{ Once again the only move and it is not an easy decision as Black will have to open the d-file.  20...Nd7  21.dxc6  Ne5   21...bxc6  fails miserably to  22.Rxd6!  Qxd6  23.Qg6!  A nice tactic threatening Qxh6 mate and Black cannot stop it.  22.cxb7  Rad8  23.Bd5±  and the pawn on b7 is pretty dangerous which hands over White a great deal of an advantage. }
21. Rxd5 { And now comes the third pitfall. } 21... Qxc4
{ 21...Nc6  22.Qh3!  22...Kg7  23.Re6  And everything is falling apart in Black's position. Looking at our pieces just gives an aesthetic feeling.  23...Bf4  24.Rxc6  Tactics!!  24...Qxc6  25.Rd7+  Kh8  26.Qf5+-  And Black is busted. }
22. Rxd6
{ And now the fourth one. It might be tempting to take the pawn on c3, but let's see how it loses. Even for engines like Lc0, it was not easy as it keeps screaming that Qxc3 is totally fine. }
22... Qf7
{ The only move to secure the king.  22...Qxc3  23.Rde6!  Nc6  24.Qg6  Ne5   24...Qd2  25.R6e3!  Blocking the communications and Black cannot defend the h6-pawn any more.  25...Qd7  26.Qxh6+  Qh7  27.Qf4+-  25.Qxh6+  Kg8  26.R1xe5!  Qxe5  27.Rxe5  fxe5  28.Qg5++-  and White captures all the pawns with a winning position. }
23. h4
{ A uber cool waiting move, just setting up the net for Black to make mistakes as he cannot really move the knight due to Rd7. }
23... Qh7
{ Black finally feels relieved as he is on the verge to exchange the queens to reduce the attack, but it is not yet over :@@EndBracket@@. }
24. Qxh7+ Kxh7 25. Re7+
{ And here comes the fifth pitfall and finally Black falls into this one :@@EndBracket@@. }
25... Kg6
{ White has some nice resources targeting the king after the more precise  25...Kg8!  but it is definitely a tough decision to make, to lock oneself on the eighth rank rather than to get out by   the logical  25...Kg6  26.Rxb7  White captures as many pawns as possible and he locks the knight in on b8.  26...Rf7   26...a5  27.Re6!  27...Ra6   27...Rf7  28.Re8+  Rf8  29.Ree7  was the idea behind Re6 now that Black cannot hinder the seventh rank by Rf7 and his position is dangerous now with our two rooks on the seventh rank.  28.Ree7  Computer might evaluate it as a draw, but would you calculate this far and be happy that this can be holdable. Definitely not. I would say practically that I would feel nervous when I see both the rooks on the seventh rank.  27.Rd8+  Rf8  28.Rxf8+  Kxf8  29.Rc7  Cornering the Knight.  29...a5  30.Rc8++=  And Black cannot move his knight literally. He is locked up in prison. }
26. h5+ Kg5
{ The only move.  26...Kxh5??  27.Rg7+-  Seals the fate of the king by threatening Rd3-Rh3 mate and is unavoidable. }
27. Rxb7
{ 27.Rd3!  was stronger, trying to hunt the king.  27...f5  28.Rg3+  Kf6  29.Rxb7±  Followed by Rg6+ and Black is in trouble here as he cannot coordinate his pieces by getting his knight out. }
27... a5 { Trying to free the position. } 28. g3 Ra6
{ Black gives the piece back to get some activity and cash in on it to bring equality. A nice practical decision from his side rather to die passively.  28...Na6  29.Kg2+-  and Black cannot move :@@EndBracket@@. }
29. Rxb8 Rxd6 30. Rxf8 Rd2
{ Black gets the required counterplay, but he needs to play precise moves from here in order to hold the game. }
31. a4 Ra2 32. Kg2 f5 33. Rc8 Rxa4 { So far all good. } 34. Rc5 Ra2 35. Kf3 Kf6
{ The king was well placed on  g5  to prevent the invasion of the White king. But perhaps Black was worried about g4 ideas and that explains the reason of this move. No wonder why they said rook endgames are more delicate :@@EndBracket@@.  35...a4!  36.g4  Kh4!!  was a tough move to spot in the game.  37.Rxf5  Rc2=  And Black is holding thanks to the immense activity. }
36. Ke3
{ With the idea of  f3  and Kf4 as the direct  36.Kf4?  is not possible due to  36...Rxf2 }
36... Kg5 37. f3 { Now g4 is coming. } 37... Kxh5 38. Kf4 Kg6 39. Rc6+ Kg7 40.

[Result "*"]

{ A very recent game which happened in famous Half-Candidates :@@EndBracket@@ between Nepomniachtchi and Wang Hao. The game is a great example of how to battle against the Petroff in the lines of our opening course. So, I thought it would be nice to include this game. }
1. e4
{ The King's Pawn Opening. White's assertive opening move opens lines for the queen and the king's bishop and fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. This move is popular at all levels of the game and was the favored opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer who called it 'best by test.' Openings with 1.e4 are thought of as more sharp and attacking than those with 1.d4, but this is an extreme generalization. Both players will have many more opportunities to influence the type of position that appears. With a pawn on e4, White's most common plan is to play d4 on the next move, creating a pawn mass in the center. }
1... e5
{ The acid test to 1.e4. It looks very logical to counter 1.e4 with a solid 1...e5. With 1.e4, White fights for control of the d5- and f5-squares. Likewise with 1...e5, Black does the same thing by gaining control over the d4- and f4-squares. By the way, 1...e5 was my first huge Lifetime Repertoire Chessable course and gives me pleasant memories. Now the roles have been reversed. }
2. Nf3 Nf6
{ Petrov Defence, The name itself rings a 'boring' bell to many people  (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game)  . Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularized by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. The idea: Instead of merely defending the e5 pawn, Black wants to counterattack White's e4 pawn by mirroring the position and moving the knight to f6 with the hopes for a balanced game. The Black counterattack in the center also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano  (and other lines of the Italian Game)  , and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Later the strong Chinese Grandmasters revived it once again and brought it back to fashion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Petroff Defense was known as one of the toughest nuts to crack for White, and players like Kramnik, Anand, and Gelfand used it with Black to achieve easy draws at the top level. Since then, the Petroff sadly gained a reputation of being too drawish an opening which is not suitable for many club players. However, thanks to the efforts of Super-GM Fabiano Caruana and other strong GMs, the Petroff has attracted general attention again. The opening is slowly finding its way back to the tournament halls. And of course, it was Caruana's main repertoire in his World Championship match against Magnus in London 2019. }
3. Nxe5
{ The Classical system is clearly the main alternative to face the Petroff.  3.d4  the Steinitz system was covered extensively in Wesley So's opening series. }
3... d6 4. Nf3
{ The Cochrane Gambit  4.Nxf7  would be fun only if it is objectively sound :@@EndBracket@@. Unfortunately, life is not so simple and adventurous. }
4... Nxe4 5. d4
{ 5.Nc3  is also an equally popular option here, but 5.d4 remains to be the classical and traditional option to face the Petroff, which is a hard nut to crack. }
5... d5 6. Bd3
{ White will try to drive Black's advanced knight from e4 with moves like c4 and Re1. If White achieves this, then he is up two tempi since White played d2-d4 compared to Black's d7-d6-d5. }
6... Bf5
{ This option has become exclusively popular in the last few years and mainly opted by the Chinese Grandmasters who found new ways to maintain the balance. The idea is logical, Black strengthens his knight on e4. }
7. O-O Be7
{ This position can also arise from the 6...Be7 7.O-O Bf5 move order. Here White has a couple of options to aim for a pleasant position in this symmetrical pawn structure. }
8. Re1
{ The critical reply apart from  8.Ne5  White logically develops his rook to e1 to create pressure on the e4- knight. c4 or Nbd2 will be next. }
8... O-O 9. Nbd2
{ 9.c4  is another main tabiya, but it leads to forced concrete variations and according to current theory, Black is doing fine after  9...Nc6  10.cxd5  Qxd5  11.Nc3  Nxc3 }
9... Nd6
{ The only way to reduce the pressure on the e4-knight is to retreat.  9....Nxd2?!  makes no sense as our rook is on e1 and not on f1, and we can simply capture the f5-bishop by  10.Bxf5  obtaining the bishop pair with a great advantage. }
10. Nf1
{ Though the position looks symmetrical, there is a slight difference in terms of activity of the pieces. If you look closely, our pieces are more active. Our rook is already on e1, our knight is headed to g3 whereas Black's knight is still placed on b8, and his other knight on d6 is slightly passive as well. Coming to the position of the dark-squared bishops, White has more scope for his c1-bishop where it can go to f4 whereas Black's bishop on e7 is passive. All these factors give White a pleasant edge. }
10... Bxd3 11. Qxd3
{ Once again, White is preparing Qb3 here to exert pressure on both the d5- and b7-pawns. }
11... c6 { Strengthening the d5-pawn. } 12. Bf4 Na6
{ The critical move. This is an unusual placement for the knight, but if Black plays  12...Nd7  then White's  13.Qb3  ideas are annoying. }
13. h4 { Time to march with the h-pawn to create an attack on the kingside. }
13... Nc7
{ Happened in the game ofNepomniatchtchi-Wang Hao 2020 Candidates where White won a nice game. It was later also played in the online match of the Magnus Chess Tour between So and Duda in 2020. }
14. Ng5
{ One of the key ideas behind h4 is to invade with Ng5 and provoke a weakness in Black's camp. }
14... Bxg5
{ Wang Hao tries to get rid of this annoying knight, but in turn gives away his bishop.  14...g6  is one of the main options analyzed in theopening section. }
15. Bxg5 f6 { Forced , otherwise the Re7 invasion was coming. } 16. Bf4
{ Keeping the pressure on these two knights on d6 and c7. } 16... Qd7
{ Preparing Re8 to challenge our rook on e1. } 17. Ng3
{ Now White's plan is to exchange the key defensive knight on d6 which is holding the position together and occupy the f5-square with the g3-knight. }
17... Rae8
{ 17...g6  18.h5  puts some pressure on the g6-pawn and Black is forced to play ...Kf7 which is not a good sign. }
18. Bxd6 { The key idea and now White can invade with the knight to f5. } 18...
Qxd6 19. Nf5 Qd7 20. Qh3
{ with the sneaky trick of Nh6 to try to win the queen which is unprotected on d7 and it is here where I left it in theopening section with the evaluation of +=. }
20... Kh8 { Moving way from Nh6 check. } 21. h5
{ Sealing the knight in on f5. } 21... Rxe1+ 22. Rxe1 Re8
{ Quite logical to exchange as many pieces as possible to increase the drawing tendency. }
23. Rxe8+ Nxe8
{ 23...Qxe8?  fails to  24.h6  g6   24...gxh6  25.Qxh6  Qf7  26.Nd6+-  and the b7-pawn falls apart.  25.Ng7  And White is penetrating into Black's camp. }
24. g4
{ Not so precise as it blocks the line of h3-d7 and now Black can bring his king back to defense to  g8  as there is no more Nh6+ trick.  24.Kf1  Bringing the king was a better option and White maintains the pressure. }
24... a6
{ Perhaps Black was afraid of Qa3 ideas from White and that explains this a6 advance.  24...Kg8=  would have brought Black equality as he is stabilizing his position by bringing his king closer. }
25. b3
{ Sometimes the c4 break is on the cards, so this move is useful to include. If you look at this position closely, it is just equal, but there is some small pressure thanks to the knight on f5 and the pawn on h5 and this is what gives the opponent an unpleasant position. Such factors might be small, but like you can see here, Black slowly got outplayed. }
25... Qe6 26. Ne3 { Blocking the e-file. } 26... Nd6 27. h6 g6
{ So far Black has played the best moves. } 28. c4
{ Some drastic action to induce some fire into the position. } 28... dxc4 29.
bxc4 Kg8
{ 29...Nxc4?  30.Nxc4  Qxc4  31.Qh2  and the queen enters into enemy territory and securing victory. Thanks to the pawn on h6, Black's king cannot really escape. }
30. Qh2 Kf7 31. c5 Nb5 32. Qb8 Qd7
{ This was the major blunder. Black cracks under pressure and from here, his position collapses.  32...Qe7  has to be played with the point that after  33.Qh8  Ke6  Black can run with his king to d7 and is fine which was not the case with 32...Qd7. }
33. Qh8 { Now Black is busted. } 33... Ke6 34. f4
{ I presume that Mr. Hao overlooked this trick and its consequences till 38.Qd8. }
34... Nxd4 35. Qg8+ Qf7 36. Qc8+ Qd7 37. Qg8+ Qf7 38. Qd8
{ 38.f5+  gxf5  39.gxf5+  Ke7  and Black escapes. } 38... Qd7 39. f5+
{ And now Black is forced to concede the piece. } 39... gxf5 40. gxf5+ Nxf5 41.
Qxd7+ Kxd7 42. Nxf5 Ke6 43. Ne3
{ And Black resigned here as the king cannot enter the White camp. What a fine game by Grandmaster Nepo who constantly set up some traps for Black which the opponent finally fell into. In the twitter world, this is called the cheese in the mouse trap :@@EndBracket@@. You will understand this quote better if you already follow Anish Giri on twitter :@@EndBracket@@. }

{ 6...Bd6  is the option preferred by Grandmasters like Caruana and Wang Hao which is a more direct one dealt with in the earlier games. }
7. O-O Nc6
{ is the old mainline. White's main idea here is to play c4 to pressurize the d5-pawn which is holding the active e4-knight and the point of ...Nc6 is that Black can meet  8.c4  with  8...Nb4 }
8. Nbd2
{ Challenging the active knight on  e4  . Of course  8.c4  is the old mainline which was played heavily in the games of world champions. Play might continue with  8...Nb4  9.Be2  O-O  10.Nc3  Bf5  11.a3  Nxc3  12.bxc3  Nc6  13.Re1  with some heavy theoretical discussions. Later it was discovered that the simpler 8.Nbd2 gives White a pleasant edge. It looks logical to get rid of the active knight on e4 as well.   One more point to add that here  8.Re1?!  is not effective due to  8...Bg4 }
8... Bf5
{ Black is trying to hold the knight on e4. This has been played in several top level games. }
9. Re1
{ Forcing Black to make a decision about his knight on e4 as it can no longer be protected sufficiently. }

{ Only move as here  10.Bxf5?  doesn't work due to  10...Nxf3  11.Qxf3  Nxd4 }
10... Bxd3 11. Qxd3
{ The position might look close to a draw due to the exchange of pieces, but this is not the case as White has full control over the e-file and his dark-squared bishop has more scope than the Black counterpart. Moreover, White's queen is also actively placed on d3. }
11... O-O 12. c3 { Fortifying the center. } 12... Qd7

{ And the pressure is mounting on the e-file. } 15... Bd8
{ Black places his bishop on d8 to challenge the rooks on the e-file, so that at the end of all the exchanges, he does not lose his c7-pawn. }
16. Nd2
{ 16.h4  was clearly the best move as discussed in theopening chapter, but in this game 16. Nd2 was played which was not that precise. Although, it did put some pressure on Black. Perhaps these structures are pleasant to play generally. }
16... Rxe2 17. Qxe2 { Keeping control over the e-file. } 17... a5
{ The top choice of LCO and no wonder why Fedoseev was playing his moves extremely fast. Wesley said after the game that he was thinking that a draw would most likely happen and he would have to prepare for the tiebreaks. But like I mentioned earlier, the side which is more preferable always has some chances and equal is not a draw yet :@@EndBracket@@. Coming to the point of the move  ...a5  is that after White's  18.Nb3  Black wants to play  18...b6  restricting the knight on b3. With the pawn on a6, it would not be possible as the pawn would be hanging there. Hence 17...a5 looks very logical to me. }
18. Nb3
{ 18.Nf3  f6  Once again restricting the knight and Black is fine after  19.h4  Rf7  with the idea of ...Re7 and Black has secured proper equality :@@EndBracket@@. }
18... b6 { Preventing Nc5, of course. } 19. Nc1 { Rerouting the knight to d3. }
19... f6
{ The point of this move is to bring the rook to the e-file via Rf7-Re7 and exchange the e1-rook which is controlling the e-file. }
20. a4 { 20.Qb5  Ne5=  is the nice little trick :@@EndBracket@@. } 20... Ne7
{ As Qb5 was on the cards, Black first reroutes his knight to a better square and then plans for Rf7-Re7.  20...Rf7  was the intention, but here it is not efficient due to  21.Qb5  And white has tremendous pressure on the c6-knight. }
21. Nd3 g5
{ Fedoseev after playing passive for a long time shifts his gears to solve his problems in a dynamic manner.  21...Qxa4?!  22.Bxc7  Bxc7  23.Qxe7+=  And the Knight is definitely stronger than the bishop here. Moreover, White's pieces are crashing through Black's camp.   21...Ng6  was perhaps the best option by planning for Rf7-Re7.  22.Bg3  Rf7!  followed by Re7 and Black should be fine here, but there still is slight pressure after  23.Qf3  Game is not drawn until its drawn :@@EndBracket@@. }
22. Bc1 Ng6
{ 22...Qxa4?  would be too greedy and is punished by  23.h4!  Breaking the kingside and exposing the cover of the king.  23...h6  24.hxg5  hxg5  25.f4±  And White secures an overwhelming advantage as Black can no longer safeguard the g5-pawn. }
23. b3
{ 23.f4!?  is interesting as well, but perhaps So wanted to protect his a4-pawn first. It is probably not a good idea to enter unnecessary complications in a tiebreak game where one wrong move could end the tournament. }
23... Be7
{ Looks like a natural move as Black wants to improve his position of his pieces. The bishop on  d8  was stuck and he wants to put it on  d6  . But White has a brilliant idea here, after  23...Rf7=  was required with the same idea of ...Rf7-e7 and Black is on the road to equality. }
24. h4
{ Taking advantage of the knight being overloaded on g6 as he cannot capture the h4 pawn with the Knight due to the fact that the e7-bishop is hanging. The most important moment in this game, besides the excellent technique displayed by White from now, is how he sensed the opportunity after Black's mistake. White calculated with precision and forced a clearly better endgame. It is a wonderful example of tactics and calculation supporting strategy and positional feeling. }
24... gxh4
{ 24...Rf7  supports the e7-bishop, but White's attack is stronger after  25.h5  Nf8  26.f4!  h6  27.fxg5  hxg5  28.Nf2±  Preparing Ng4 and White is just crushing. }
25. Nf4
{ The key point, deflecting the knight on g6 which is holding the bishop on e7. }
25... Rf7
{ This move arrives, but is a bit late now in this position when White is already clearly better.  25...Nxf4  26.Qxe7  Seventh rank domination!  26...Qg4  27.Bxf4  Qxf4  28.Qd7±  The Rook will arrive on e7 next and it looks very dangerous for Black. }

{ A good practical decision to exchange the key defensive piece.  26.Qh5  was equally good  26...Nxf4  27.Bxf4  And next we can capture on h4. Now that Black's pawn structure is completely broken, White enjoys a big advantage.  27...Bd6  28.Bxd6  Qxd6  29.Re8+  Rf8  30.Qg4+  Kh8  31.Re3  Rf7  32.Qxh4±  Due to numerous factors like Black's vulnerable king and his pawn structure, White secures a sound advantage. If  32...Re7  then  33.Rg3  maintains the advantage. }
26... Qxe6 27. Rxe6 Nxf4
{ 27...Nf8  28.Rc6±  And Black is unable to protect the d5-pawn. } 28. Bxf4 Bd8
{ Black's pieces are extremely passive and here comes the important breakthrough with }
29. b4
{ Black cannot take on b4 as White would get an outside a-passer. But if he doesn't, then his a5-pawn would be weak. }
29... Kg7
{ 29...axb4  30.cxb4±  30...Kg7  31.Rc6!  Now the distant passed pawn decides the game.  31...Be7  32.a5!  Bxb4  33.a6  Rf8  34.Bxc7  Ra8  35.Rxb6  Ba5  36.Rb7  Bxc7  37.Rxc7+  Kg6  38.a7+-  And it's all over. }
30. bxa5 bxa5 31. Ra6 { What fine technique by Wesley. } 31... c6 32. Rxc6
{ The material is even, but the h-pawns of Black are doubled so White maintains a huge advantage. }
32... Kg6 33. Rc5 Rd7
{ Now the slow grind begins. White has the better pawn structure, much more active rooks, active bishop, and he is clearly better. }
34. f3 Kf5 35. Bd2 Ke6
{ Supporting the d5-pawn so that the rook can move freely. } 36. Rc6+ Kf5
{ 36...Ke7  37.Be1±  Hitting the h4-pawn and White is better. } 37. Be1 Kg5 38.
Rc5
{ Exerting pressure on the d5-pawn once again as the king is very far and now the rook on d7 is tied down to defend it. }
38... f5 39. Kh2
{ covers the important possibility of an h3-break and also Black's ambition of getting his king into White's camp via Kf4-e3 is also stopped as Bd2 is a quick checkmate. }
39... Kh5 40. Bf2 Rd6 41. Be3 Bb6 42. Rb5 Bd8 43. Bf4 Rd7 44. Be5
{ White has improved his bishop's position. The journey from e1 to e5 is remarkable :@@EndBracket@@. }
44... Kg5 45. Rc5 f4
{ As Wesley said after the game, he was very happy to see his opponent pushing this pawn on to a dark square. It only meant that if the players ever went into a bishop endgame, it would be completely lost for Black.  Black should have opted for a waiting strategy, but nevertheless White was much better after   45...Kg6  46.Kg1  Kg5  47.Kf2  Kg6  48.Ke2  Followed by Kd3 and c4 at the right moment and White is dominating. }
46. Rc6 { Cutting off the king. } 46... Kf5 47. Ra6 Kg5 48. Kh3 Kf5 49. Rc6
{ Planning to shift the rook to c5. } 49... Kg5 50. Re6
{ 50.Rc5  was more precise leading to a winning position after  50...Kf5  51.Rb5  This is some kind of zugzwang for Black.  51...h5   51...Kg5  52.Bb8  Kf5  53.c4+-  52.Bb8+-  And c4 is coming next. }
50... Be7 51. Rc6 Bd8 52. Bd6 Kf5 53. Kh2
{ I can understand why So played this as he wants to gain some time in rotating his pieces. }
53... Rg7 54. Be5 Rd7 55. Rd6
{ Finally Wesley makes a big decision here on exchanging rooks. He has made sure that the ensuing bishop endgame is completely winning for him. }
55... Rxd6 56. Bxd6 Kg5 57. Kg1 Kf5 58. Kf2 Kg5 59. Kf1 Kf5 60. Ba3 Ke6 61. Ke2
Kf5 62. Bc1 Kg5 63. Kf1
{ 63.Kd3?  would have been a blunder as Black will get a breakthrough with  63...h3!  64.gxh3  Kh4  65.Bxf4  h5  66.c4  dxc4+  67.Kxc4  Kxh3=  And he is holding this to a draw. }
63... Bc7 64. Bd2 Bd8 65. Be1
{ The White king can move without any worries as after the ... h3 gxh3 break, the bishop restricts the Black king from coming to h4. }
65... Kf5 66. Ke2 Ke6 67. Kd3 Kd7 68. c4
{ White finally creates a passed pawn now. } 68... Kc6
{ The simple way to win such endgames is to overload the opponent's bishop, which is always having a difficult time protecting more than one pawn. What a fine technique by Wesley so far! Impressive. }
69. Bc3 Bb6 70. Bb2 Bd8 71. Bc1 Bc7 72. Bd2
{ Zugzwang. It's astounding to see how Wesley plays waiting moves and puts his opponent in a helpless situation. Now the bishop on c7 is overloaded to hold both the pawns on a5 and f4. }
72... h5 73. Bc3 Bb6 74. Bb2 Bc7 75. Ba3 Bd8 76. Bf8 Bg5 77. Bg7
{ Black's bishop is tied up now! } 77... Kd6
{ 77...Bd8  78.Be5  78...Bg5  79.Bb8!  Bh6   79...Kb7  80.Bd6  Kc6  81.Be5  A nice triangulation and after  81...Bh6  82.cxd5+  Kxd5  83.Bc7+-  We get to the same position and the a5-pawn falls apart!  80.cxd5+  Kxd5  81.Bc7+-  And after a series of maneuvers, White captures the a5-pawn. }
78. Be5+ { Once again, White's bishop arrives on e5 with great effect. } 78...
Kc6 { 78...Ke6  79.Bc7+- } 79. Kc3 { Zugzwang! } 79... Bh6 80. Bf6 Bf8 81. Kd3
h3 82. gxh3 Bd6 83. Be5
{ and the f4-pawn drops. A great endgame display by Wesley that showcases fine technique on completely outplaying the opponent. Such is the nature of this opening, Black is doomed to defend passively and one mistake deteriorates his position slowly and we can witness in this game as well. }
