1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 { The Taimanov. } 5. Nc3 Qc7
{ Black develops his queen without committing the kingside.   5...a6  allows  6.Nxc6  bxc6  7.Bd3  where White will have the initiative due to his lead in development. It is better to avoid  ...a6  until  Be3  is played in order to force White to commit his dark-squared bishop to a square that makes less sense in the  ...bxc6  structure. }
6. Be3
{ White develops his bishop and prepares to castle queenside after Qd2 or Qf3. }
6... a6
{ Black prepares ...b5.   6...Nf6  allows complications that favor White after  7.f4  Bb4  8.Nb5  Qa5  9.e5.  These are covered in the early sidelines chapter. }
7. Qf3
{ White prepares to castle queenside. In many variations, White plays Qg3 and either obtains a better endgame  (...Qxg3 hxg3 opens the h-file and White can obtain kingside pressure with f3 followed by g4-g5)  or targets the g7-pawn, making it difficult for Black to develop his dark-squared bishop without concessions. }
7... Nf6
{ Against sidelines, White generally will be able to obtain a favorable endgame with Qg3.   7...Bd6  is a respectable alternative that will be covered in the theory section. The summary is that after  8.O-O-O  Be5  9.g3  White will follow up with  Qe2  and  f4.  If Black exchanges twice on  d4  White has easy development and can triple major pieces down the d-file with pressure against the backward d-pawn. }
8. O-O-O
{ White continues his development plan and intends to follow up with Qg3.   8.Qg3  doesn't work due to  8...Qxg3  9.hxg3  Ng4.  As a general rule , White punishes sidelines that don't involve  ...Nf6  with  Qg3  and if White is going to play  Qg3  after  ...Nf6  he either will have something concrete prepared for  ...Ng4  or will play  Be2  before  Qg3. }
8... Ne5
{ The most critical line. Black interrupts White's endgame plans with concrete play. }
9. Qg3
{ If Black doesn't have anything concrete now, White will be able to follow up with f4 and meet ...Neg4 with Bg1 followed by e5 with a powerful initiative. }
9... b5
{ This sharp variation was recommended for Black in 'Grandmaster Repertoire - The Sicilian Taimanov' and is the main line at GM level. }
10. a3
{ White prepares to play f4 by preventing ...b4.   10.f4  Neg4  11.Bg1  b4  12.Na4  is the main line. There is a lot of theory in this line and if Black plays  8...Ne5  and  9...b5  he has most likely prepared this in detail. I prefer to avoid the counterplay with  ...b4  and attempt to get the Black player out of book , so I recommend avoiding this with  10.a3. }
10... Bb7
{ 10...b4?!  11.axb4  Bxb4?  12.Qxg7  Black needs to generate counterplay by targeting the e4-pawn and preparing to occupy the c-file with ...Rc8. For concrete reasons, 10...Bb7 is the only move that doesn't immediately give White a decisive advantage. Alternatives are refuted in the theory section. }
11. Bxb5
{ These complications objectively favor White and are covered in more detail in the theory section.   11...axb5 ?  12.Ndxb5  Qb8  13.Bb6  with  Nc7+  or  Bc7  gives White a decisive initiative. Black is forced to enter unfavorable complications with  11...Rc8  instead. }

I would have ended here, but NM William Sedlar thinks that this position is theoretically critical and doesn't trust Negi's Na4 lines as a way to fight for the advantage, so I'll go deeper on Leela's Nb1-d2-f3 suggestion.   12...c5  13.h3  Not the only move , but the most flexible , so that White can place his queen on  h2  after  ...h5-h4  as well as protecting against  ...h4  in case White doesn't want to play  Qh2.  13...Bb7  14.Nb1  Qc7  15.Qg3  h5  16.Nd2   16.Bg5!?  seemed interesting , until I realized that Black gets dangerous counterplay and equalizing chances after  16...Bxg5  17.Qxg5  Qd8  18.Qg3  h4  19.Qf4  g5  20.Qe3  Rg8  21.Nd2  g4  22.hxg4  Rxg4  23.Qh6+  Ke8  24.Nf3  d4  16...h4  17.Qe3  g6  18.Qe2  Kg7  19.Nf3  Rh5  20.Bf4  d4  21.Be4  +=   12...Bb7  13.h3  h5  14.Qf3  Kg8   14...c5?!  15.Bg6  15.Bf4  Bb4  (otherwise White will play Rad1 followed by Nb1-d2 with Qg3 and Nf3)  16.Bd2  += with  Rad1  and either  Nb1  (intending Nd2-f3)  (or Na4 with c4.) }

I could go deeper, but White's plan is more or less the same in all of the variations in this structure: finish development  (Bg2/Be2, Rhd1)  to pressure the d7-pawn, possibly increase White's space advantage with e5, secure the king with Kb1, and either play a3  (to prevent ...b4)  or meet ...b4 with Nd1-e3  (to support the c4-square)  or Na4.   While I don't think White needs to drill further , it's worth mentioning that 'The Taimanov Bible' recommends this for Black , suggesting  14...b4  15.Nd1  a5  16.Ne3  O-O  17.Bg2  Nc6  , although after  18.Rd6  (not mentioned by the book)  (Black is still under a lot of pressure)  (+0.58 - LeelaZero, depth 31)  (. @@StartBlockQuote@@'Disagree with this assessment.

This would not be as strong if Black didn't play ...h5 because Black would be able to meet Bf4 with ...Nh5.  11...d6  Forced.   11...Nfg4  12.f3   12...Bd6  13.Ndxb5  axb5  14.Nxb5  followed by  Nxd6+  wins  12.Bxb5+  White starts a tactical operation which removes the Black queen from the defense of the e5-pawn and prepares a Nc7+ fork after Qxe5.  12...axb5   12...Bd7  13.Bxd7+  White is up a pawn for no compensation.  13.Bxe5  dxe5  14.Ncxb5  Qb7   14...Qc5  15.b4  Qb6   15...h4  16.bxc5  hxg3  17.Nc6  Threatening Nc7# and Rd8#.  17...Be7  18.Nc7+  Kf8  19.hxg3   19.Nxa8  gxf2  gives Black a lot of counterplay due to White's weak pawns , although White is still better.  19...Rxh1  Otherwise White will play Nxa8.  20.Rxh1  Bd7   20...Rxa3  21.Rh8+  Ng8  22.Rxg8+  Kxg8  23.Nxe7+  Kf8  24.Nxc8  White has a winning material advantage.  21.Rh8+  Ng8  22.Rxg8+  Nxe7 followed by Nxa8 also wins.  22...Kxg8  23.Nxe7+  Kf8  24.Nxa8  White has a winning position because he is up 3 pawns.   15...Nxe4  16.Qh4  16. Qf3 also wins.  16...Qb6  17.Qxe4  White is up material for no compensation. 17... Bb7 18. Qxe5  16.Qxe5  White will win the exchange with Nc7+.   Black is unable to escape with the rook:  16...Rb8  17.Nc7+  Kd7  18.Nf5+  White has a winning attack.  15.Qxe5  White will win the exchange with Nc7+ next as Black is forced to play 15... Be7 to prevent Nc7+  (...Kd7 is met with Ndb5)  with a decisive attack.   10...Be7 ?  11.f4  Neg4   11...Bxa3  A tactical undermining which objectively doesn't work.  12.Bd2  There are other wins, but this is simplest. White secures the c3-knight and will pick up the a3-bishop or e5-knight next.  12.Bg1  White will play e5 with a winning attack unless Black plays ...e5 which also would give White a winning position due to his lead in development  (...e5 opens the position)  and the d5/f5 squares.   10...Rb8 ?  Too slow; Black fails to meet White's threat of f4.  11.f4  Neg4   11...Nc4  12.Bxc4  Qxc4   12...bxc4  13.e5  White has a decisive initiative and will follow up with Ne4 and f5. Lets continue the line to show what happens if Black tries to get counterplay against b2.  13...Ng8   13...Nd5  14.Nxd5  exd5  15.Nf5  White has a decisive initiative.   15...g6  allows the sacrifice  16.Nd6+  and Black's dark squares and king will be horribly weak.  14.Ne4   14.f5  also gives White a winning initiative.  14...Qb7  15.Nd6+  Bxd6  16.Qxg7  This thematic tactic is very important. White will win the exchange and Black's counterplay against b2 isn't enough.  16...Qxb2+   16...Bc5  17.Kd2  Simplest. Now ...Qxb2 will be met with Rb1 and White will win the exchange.  17.Kd2  Rb3  18.Nxb3  White will win a second exchange with a winning position.   18...cxb3  should be met with the simple  19.Rc1   although the concrete  19.Qxh8  Qxc2+  20.Ke1  b2  21.exd6  also wins.  13.e5  Nd5  Passive alternatives still give White a decisive initiative; f5 and Ne4 are dangerous ways for White to increase his initiative.  14.Nxd5  Qxd5   14...exd5  15.f5  15.Nf5  There are other wins here but I would like to show this line to emphisize how little counterplay Black has.  15...Qa2  Against alternatives, White would easily win due to his lead in development, safer king, and control over the dark-squares  (which can start to be exploited with Nd6+ or Nxg7+)  .  16.Nd6+  Bxd6  17.Qxg7  This tactical operation justifies 16. Nd6+.  17...Rf8  18.exd6  Black is getting crushed.  12.Bg1  or e5  12...b4  Black's only attempt to obtain counterplay. Unfortunately for him, ...b4 does not drive away White's c3-knight to target the e4-pawn like it would if White had not yet played a3.  13.axb4  Bxb4   13...Rxb4  14.e5  White will win one of the Black knights.  14.Na2  Black's only counterplay involved ...Bxc3, so White removes the target. White intends to play e5 next  (with a decisive initiative and winning the g4-knight)  , so Black is obliged to sacrifice.  14...Bd6   14...Nxe4  15.Qxg4  White is up a knight for insufficient compensation.   14...d6  Black tries to prevent e5. This fails for tactical reasons.  15.h3  The simplest solution, although e5 also wins because ...dxe5 is met with fxe5 where ...Qxe5 loses to Nc6.   15...Nxe4  16.Qxg4   15...Nh6  16.Qxg7  15.e5  Nxe5  16.fxe5  Bxe5  17.Qc3  Black's two pawns are not sufficient compensation for the sacrificed knight, especially since White is better developed and therefore is better prepared to use the open files. }
11. Bxb5
{ Note that  11.Ndxb5  axb5  12.Nxb5  Qb8  13.Bb6  isn't as strong because of  13...Nxe4 !  This resource would not be possible if White still had a knight on  c3.  14.Qe3  Bxa3 !  15.bxa3  Ng4 !  and Black has sufficient counterplay in these complications. }
11... Rc8
{ 11...axb5 ?  Tempting, but losing.  12.Ndxb5  Qb8  Black has no other square which defends his e5-knight.  13.Bb6  Nc4  White was threatening Bc7  (or Nc7+)  followed by Qxe5.  14.Bc7   14.Nc7+  also gives White a winning advantage.  14...Qc8  15.Rd4  White will play Nd6+ with a decisive initiative.   11...h5?  12.Bf4  Bd6   12...h4  13.Bxe5  hxg3  14.Bxc7  13.Nxe6  fxe6  14.Rxd6  Qxd6  15.Bxe5  Qe7  16.Bd6  Qf7  17.Bd3   11...Bxa3 ?!  Black tactically undermines the c3-knight. Objectively this move is inaccurate as the following complications favor White.  12.Bf4  Forced.   12.bxa3 ?  Qxc3  gives Black a winning initiative.   12.Bc6 ?!  holds the balance for concrete reasons , but I'd rather obtain an advantage.  12...Bd6   12...Nh5  13.Bxe5  Nxg3  14.Bxc7  Nxh1  15.Rxh1  Rc8   15...axb5 ?!  16.bxa3  White has a decisive material advantage.  16.bxa3  Rxc7  17.Kd2  axb5   17...Rxc3  18.Kxc3  is another endgame where White will be up a pawn.  18.Ncxb5  White wins the exchange back and will be up a pawn.   18...Rc5 ?  19.Nd6+  White will play  Nxb7  with a decisive material advantage.  13.Nxe6   13.Qxg7  also seems to favor White , but Black gets a lot of counterplay in the complications that follow after  13...Ke7 !  , for example  14.Nf5+  exf5  15.Bg5  Ng4  16.e5  Bxe5  17.Rxd7+  Qxd7  18.Bxd7  Rhg8  19.Bxf6+  Nxf6  20.Qh6  Kxd7  White is up material , but Black has a lot of activity.  13...fxe6  14.Rxd6  Qxd6  15.Bxe5  Qe7  16.Bd6  Qf7  17.Bd3  White has a pawn, the bishop pair, superior activity, and dark-square domination in exchange for the exchange. Black can't even castle; objective White's initiative is decisive. White has lots of ways of exploiting his advantage but it seems simplest to include the h1-rook in the game  (Re1 or Rd1)  , secure the center   f3  , and invade on the queenside  (Qe3 or Qf2 with Qb6, possibly Na4-c5)  . White also has the possibility of playing for f4 and e5. }
12. Ba4 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bxe4 14. Bf4 Qa5
{ 14...Qc4 ?!  The main line, and objectively inaccurate due to a novelty.  15.Bb3  N  !   15.Bxe5  Qxa4  would transpose into  14...Qa5 !  and would fail to punish Black's move order.   15.Bxe5 ?!  Qxa4  16.Rd2  White has transposed into 14... Qa5. I don't recommend this variation because White can get more with 14... Qa5, but for those of you who want to cut down on the number of varitions you have to learn, I'm marking this as an alternative.  15...Nd3+  □  Otherwise White would play Bxe5.  16.Kb1  Qxd4  17.cxd3  Bc6  The most resiliant move.   17...Bg6  18.Rc1  ±  Rxc1+  19.Rxc1  Qxd3+  20.Qxd3  Bxd3+  21.Ka2  Be7  22.Bc4  Bxc4+  23.Rxc4  O-O  24.Rc7   17...Bf5  18.Rc1   The slow  18.Ka2  intending  Rc1  and  Be5  gives White a significant advantage , but White wouldn't be able to get away with this against  17...Bg6  so I would rather recommend this most thematic continuation , transposing into  17...Bg6.   17...Bd5 ??  18.Be3  White wins the Black queen.   17...Bb7 ?!  18.Rc1  Due to White's control over the c-file, Black has nothing better than playing 17... Bc6 and transposing into 17... Bc6 up a tempo  (White would double rooks on the c-file followed by Be3 and f4)  .  18.Rc1  White intends to double rooks on the c-file.  18...f6   18...Qb6 ?!  This allows White to play Ba4-xc6, creating weaknesses or taking over the c-file after the exchange of rooks. 18...f6  (intending ...Kf7)  is stronger.  19.Ba4  f6   19...Bxa4  20.Rxc8+  20.Bxc6  Rxc6   20...dxc6  is a worse version because White's rook is more active than Black's rook; White can double rooks on the c-file.  21.Rxc6  dxc6   21...Qxc6  22.Rc1  gives White the c-file.  22.Bd6  ±  White has a dangerous initiative. LeelaZero at a high depth confirms that White has a significant advantage. 22... c5   22...Kf7  23.Rc1  c5  24.Bxf8  Rxf8  25.Qh4  23. Bxf8 Kxf8   23...Rxf8  24.Qh4  24. d4 ! cxd4 25. Rc1  19.Rc3  → +=  White has the initiative and will follow up with Rhc1, Be3, and f4-f5. LeelaZero at a high depth confirms that White has an advantage here  (approximately +0.3 to +0.5)  . In practice White is likely to have a bigger advantage than that, as Black has to play some accurate defensive moves to avoid a quick collapse. }
15. Bxe5 Qxa4 16. Rd2
{ White's advantage in the positions that follow is largely based on his initiative and the possibility of transposing into a favorable endgame due to his queenside pawn majority. The endgame is not favorable yet but Black will have to lose time defending against White's initiative. }
16... f6
{ Black intends to play ...Kf7. This is the recommendation given in 'Grandmaster Repertoire - The Sicilian Taimanov'.   16...h5  Black prepares to develop his rook with ...Rh6.  17.Re1  White continues development and forces Black to make a commitment with his bishop.  17...Bg6  Safest. Black secures the g7-pawn.   17...Bd5 ?  18.Bd6  White intends to play  Bxf8  where  ...Rxf8  loses a pawn to  Qxg7.   17...h4 ?!  18.Qf4  ±  White gets an improved version of the mainline because the inclusion of ...h4 and Qf4 only helped White.  18.Bd6  Qc4   The inclusion of  16...h4  and  17.Qf4  only helps White.  19.b3 !  Bxd6  20.Qxd6  Qc3  20... Qc5 leads to a typical endgame where White has the advantage due to his queenside pawn majority and active king. If Black is going to go into this endgame then he should include ...Qc3 and Kd1 because White's king wants to go to b2 in the endgame.  21.Kd1  h4   21...Qc5  22.Qxc5  Rxc5  23.b4  +=  White has a slightly better position due to his queenside pawn majroty and superior king activity. White's plan is Kc1-b2 with f4-f5.  22.Re3  Qc5  23.Qxc5  Rxc5  24.b4  Rc7  25.f4  +=  White has a slightly better endgame due to his queenside pawn majority and superior king activity. White's plan is Kc1-b2 and g4.   16...Bg6  17.Bd6  White has the initiative. }
17. Bd6 Kf7 18. Re1 Bg6
{ 18...Bd5  19.Bxf8  White will play Qd6 with a powerful initiative. The follow up will be Re3 with either f4-f5 or Nf5, both of which are easier to achieve with Black's bishop on d5 rather than f5.   18...Bb7 ?  Loses by force.  19.b3  Qa5  20.Bxf8  Rhxf8   20...Kxf8  21.Qd6+  21.Nxe6  dxe6  22.Rd7+  Ke8  23.Rxe6+  Kxd7  24.Qd6# }

{ White makes a non-committal improving move that concretely prepares b3.   19.b3 ?!  Qa5  20.Bxf8  Rhxf8  21.b4  Qb6  22.Nxe6 ??  This would win if White had already played  Ree2.  22...dxe6  23.Rd7+  Ke8  24.Rd6  Rxc2+  and Black wins. This is why White should play  Ree2. }
19... Qc4
{ 19...e5 ?!  20.b3  Qa5  21.Qh3  ±  White will follow up with b4 and Qb3+ with a significantly better endgame.   19...Be7 ?  20.b3  Qa5  21.Bxe7  Kxe7  22.Nf5+  +-  with Qd6+.   19...h5  This is a waiting move for White to show his idea behind 19. Ree2.  20.b3 !   20.Bxf8 ?!  White releases the tension too soon. This is a sample line that I concluded was best when analyzing with LeelaZero, but it's possible that there are improvements down the line that give White an objective advantage. Even if there are, I would rather White not make an exchange that helps Black's activity unless there is a concrete reasons.  20...Rhxf8  21.Qd6  Kg8  22.f4  Kh7  23.b3   23.Qb4  probably gives White a small advantage in the endgame.  23...Qa5  24.Kb2  Qc3+  25.Ka2  Rfe8  Black will play ...e5 with sufficient counterplay.  26.Nf3  Rc5  27.Qd4  Qxd4  28.Nxd4  e5  29.b4  Rd5  30.fxe5  fxe5  31.Nb3  Rxd2  32.Rxd2  ∞  20...Qa5   20...h4 ?  21.Qf3  +-  with Qb7.  21.Bxf8  Rhxf8  22.b4  Qc7   22...Qa4 ?!  23.Kb2  White makes a flexible improving move that both secures his king in the middlegame and improves his king activity for the endgame. White can follow up with f4-f5 with a powerful initiative or a superior endgame with Qb3.   23.Qb3  also gives White the advantage.   22...Qb6 ?  23.Nxe6  White shows his idea behind 19. Ree2 and concretely targets the Black queen.  23...dxe6  24.Rd7+  Ke8  25.Rd6  White has a decisive initiative.   The most accurate win for White is  25...Qb5  26.Qxg6+  Rf7  27.Rexe6+  Kf8  28.Qh7  Qg5+  29.Re3  Qh6  30.Qxh6  gxh6  31.Rxa6  23.Nb3  Qxg3   23...e5  allows  Nc5  with  Qh3  24.hxg3  d5  25.Nc5  +=  White has a slightly better endgame due to his queenside pawn majority and superior activity. Black's central majority is restrained.   25...Rc6  26.c4  White intends to meet  ...dxc4  with  Rd4  and  Rxc4.   19...Bxd6  20.Qxd6  +=  White has the initiative and intends to pawn storm on the kingside  (f4 with g4 and f5)  . }
20. b3 Qc3 21. Qxc3 Rxc3 22. Bxf8 Rxf8 23. f4
{ White has a slightly better endgame due to his queenside pawn majority  (Black's central majority is more restrained)  . White's plan is Kb2 with b4 and either Nb3-c5 or g4 and f5. LeelaZero and Stockfish at depth 38-39 both agree that White is slightly better in this endgame. }
