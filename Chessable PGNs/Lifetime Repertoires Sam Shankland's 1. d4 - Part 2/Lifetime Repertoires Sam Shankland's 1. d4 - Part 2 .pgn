{ Welcome to part 2 of my Lifetime Repertoire with 1.d4! Previously inpart 1, I covered all of Black's side attempts, from the ridiculous Saint George Defense to some serious lines like the Dutch, Benko, and Benoni. It was an important course to lay the groundwork for the mainlines covered in part 2 and 3. This one covers 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 and now Black's two main moves in e6 and g6. Much like part 1, my goal was to play principled, strategically aggressive chess. It's not unheard of to see attacking positions in this repertoire, but for the most part, I am aiming for long term static advantages such as extra space, a better pawn structure, or the bishop pair.   In general, I think preparing an opening repertoire in this manner is significantly more challenging than preparing a sharper one, as it is easier to memorize long forced lines than it is to memorize long lines based on complex strategic ideas without too many forcing moves to guide you along the way.   Still, while I believe this is a very advanced repertoire, it should be accessible to players of all levels. As usual, I have done my best to explain the key strategic themes of the relevant positions to the best of my ability, and to gather all relevant material from Black's point of view to provide antidotes to all books and online databases I could find.   Whenever you try to prepare an opening for White, the game is rigged in your opponent's favour if they play a mainline. Generally speaking, when you look deep enough, chess is a draw. Black is fine if he chooses a good opening. If the goal of a lifetime repertoire from White's point of view is to analyze a position all the way to the end, disappointment awaits. At some point, you will have to admit that Black can hold, and this happens more than once in the course. My goal is to never allow Black to reach a position he can hold easily. There are places where he can get to a worse but defensible endgame that a computer will not lose, but a human might. It's always something of a cop-out to say 'A computer will be fine here but you won't face a computer' and I only choose to exercise this option very deep down some long lines where Black has to work very hard to get there in the first place. The best way I can summarize this philosophy is that I believe this repertoire will not beat a computer and will be mostly useless for correspondence players, but it may well beat a very strong human who has spent a lot of time preparing with the computer but still has to come to the board and play on his own.   I think this is a much higher standard than what you see from clowns who recommend bad lines; those repertoires will not work against strong players who have prepared well but also have to play on their own. This one will. The repertoire itself is based on ambitious mainlines. After 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6, I have opted for 3. Nf3, which is the most demanding choice theoretically but probably the best move in a higher chess sense.   Against 2... g6, I am playing 3. Nc3, welcoming an opportunity to play against the Grunfeld Defense and not avoiding it with Anti-Grunfeld lines such as 3. f3 or 3. g3. The Russian System is White's most ambitious attempt to prove an edge as it allows him to take the whole centre without even exchanging off a pair of knights on c3, and Black is under a lot of pressure to make counterplay as soon as possible.   The only line where I chose a path that I don't believe is objectively the best way to fight for an advantage is against the King's Indian, but that is because the King's Indian is a somewhat unusual opening in its attitude. Everyone knows Black is worse, including the most devout KID players, but they hope that the deeply complex positions that arise will leave them with practical chances in human play. Most openings like this tend to lend themselves to bad results at high levels, but the King's Indian is perhaps the only major exception. Despite the objective evaluation, even in games between strong grandmasters, Black's results are entirely fine. As such, I chose a line that I only believe can fight for a smaller edge, but one where I think Black's counterplay is severely limited and is much harder for White to misplay and lose control.   All in all, I am happy with the analysis I have done, and I sincerely wish the best for anyone following this course to use it well and win a lot of games. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6
{ 2...g6  3.Nc3  Bg7   3...d5  4.Nf3  Bg7  5.Qb3  dxc4  6.Qxc4  With the Russian System, White is ready to take the entire centre next with e2-e4, and Black can't easily get c7-c5 in, plus he did not manage to exchange off a pair of knights on c3. Black has to be very direct not to end up with a wretched position.  4.e4  O-O  5.Nf3  d6  6.Be2  e5  7.Be3  The Gligoric is not a super popular line nowadays, but I think I managed to cause Black some trouble with it. }
3. Nf3 c5
{ 3...b6  4.g3  This is the mainline of the Queen's Indian, and what I have recommended for this course.   3...Bb4+  White has two options. I chose the more strategic  4.Bd2  which tends to lead to quieter games, and I think I showed White has good chances to fight for an edge. }
4. d5
{ Now Black can @@StartBracket@@and should@@EndBracket@@ transpose to the Benoni, which is covered inpart 1 of the course, but I do cover theBlumenfeld here. }

4. Bd2
{ This move is more in line with the strategic basis of the repertoire than the more dynamic  4.Nbd2  would be. }
4... c5
{ This move is actually a lot less stupid than it looks. Obviously, White can and should compromise Black's pawn structure with }
5. Bxb4 cxb4
{ But it's not that easy to prove an edge. Black has an easy plan of O-O, d7-d6, and preparing for e6-e5 at an appropriate moment to play on the dark squares. I think White should be ambitious about trying to take the whole centre. }
6. a3
{ It is important to do this right away and without wasting any time on moves like Nb1-d2 or e2-e3. I want to challenge the b4-pawn so that the knight can come to c3 and White can fight for the e2-e4 advance rather than the more sedate e2-e3.   6.e3  Playing slowly like this is possible, but it lets an opportunity pass.  6...O-O  7.Be2  a5 !  8.a3  Na6 !  Black is able to defend the b4-pawn with his knight in a healthy way since he already got a7-a5 in. I don't think White has much here, despite the machine's enthusiasm. I much prefer challenging the b4-pawn before Black can respond with the combination of a7-a5 and Nb8-a6. }
6... bxa3 7. Rxa3 O-O 8. Nc3
{ White is ready to take the entire centre with e2-e4 next. Black can and probably should prevent him from doing so with d7-d5, but this means Black will not be able to play his typical dark square plan. }

First off, White has committed to g2-g3 already, which diverges from the setups I am recommending in the proper Bogo-Indian, but also Black is committed to playing b7-b6, which I generally think is a worse way to develop the bishop than d7-d6 followed by e6-e5. Additionally, in the normal Bogo-Indian, Black can consider setups with d7-d5, when White generally is supposed to wait for b7-b6 before taking on d5. Now, b7-b6 has already been played, which limits Black's options further. }
5. Bd2 Be7
{ This move is a common theme in d4/Bg2 systems and makes some sense, aiming to transpose into some kind of Catalan. Black basically always wants to meet Bf1-g2 with c7-c6 and get a quick d7-d5 in. But White has another option. }

7. Qb1
{ A very subtle and important move. White immediately fights for control of the e4-square. Funnily enough though, it is more prophylactic than anything else. His plan against a civil move like O-O is to play Bf1-g2 and point out that Black cannot respond comfortably with c7-c6.   7.Qc2 ?!  This was Ivanchuk's choice against me once, and he won a brilliant game. Obviously, the queen looks better here than it does on b1, but during the game, I could not figure out why.  7...Nc6 !  8.e4  Nb4 !  9.Qb1  Nxe4 !  And Black is good to go.   7.Bg2  c6  I find this position unconvincing for White. After  8.e4  d5 !  9.e5  Ne4 !  Black's knight has found a good square, and one I would rather have taken away by playing Qd1-b1 first. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6
{ Not so long ago, the Queen's Indian Defence was a mainstay in elite-level chess, and it would seem unfathomable to think that just 15 years later, it would be mostly gone. In general, I think it is the defence against 1. d4 that suffered the greatest hit to its reputation at the hands of computers in recent times. I wouldn't be so bold as to say I have conclusively proved an advantage, but I think I can put Black under a lot of pressure. }
4. g3
{ Now, the two main moves are  4...Bb7  and  4...Ba6  , with the latter being the better one, but Black does have a couple of other extraneous tries. }
4... Bb7
{ For a long time, this move was almost as popular as the more direct  4...Ba6  , but nowadays, it is a rare guest in top-level play. }
5. Bg2 Be7 { This is the main move by far. } 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3
{ In recent years, White sometimes tried the tricky  7.Re1  , but I see no reason not to go for the most direct continuation. White is threatening d4-d5 and Black is forced into action right away. }
7... Ne4 8. Bd2
{ Now, Black can take on d2 if he wishes, but I think this generally is not his best plan as it will allow White to take the whole centre with e2-e4 coming in short order. In general, Black makes a waiting move such as 8... d6, 8... Bf6, or 8... f5, but I think only the latter two make any sense as they serve as important prophylaxis against the d4-d5 advance. }
8... Bf6
{ This move has become a modern mainline, and it makes a lot of sense. The bishop is quite well placed on f6 and serves as prophylaxis against moves White would like to make such as Nf3-e5 or d4-d5, as we see in some other cases. }
9. Re1
{ This new move has been making a lot of waves in recent years and has been used to great effect by Ding Liren. It looks very unassuming, but it contains more than a drop of poison. First off, it's an excellent move to have played if Black ever takes on d2, as it fits perfectly with White's plan of centralizing the rooks and taking all the space in the centre with e2-e4 next. Secondly, if Black ever takes on c3, the rook can be very helpful in pushing the e2-e4 advance through that might not have otherwise come so easily. Finally, overprotecting the e2-pawn makes Nf3-g5 a very real threat.   9.Ng5 ?  This is the tactical idea White wants to execute, but he is not ready until he plays Rf1-e1 first.  9...Nxc3  10.Qc2  Nxe2+ !  Check. Black wins. We needed Rf1-e1 first to prevent this possibility. }
9... d6 { This natural move allows White to execute his main idea. } 10. Ng5
Nxc3 11. Qc2
{ And we see the tactical point of Rf1-e1 on full display. The pawn on e2 is defended, and Black loses material. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ This transposes into a standard mainline King's Indian, but one where Black has already been forced into the subpar Nb8-a6 variation. In general, I think Black's only hope to get counter chances in this structure revolves around forcing White to play d4-d5 and then launching a kingside assault with f7-f5 etc. Because he has not put too much pressure on the d4-pawn, I don't think this will happen. }

Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }

12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... dxc4

12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Bf8
{ In recent years, this has been the main move, but I find it unconvincing and I think Nf6-h5 is a better try. Still, it has had its successes and has been recommended by Kamil Plichta here on Chessable, and certainly must be taken seriously. }
14. Kh1
{ White defends the c5-pawn tactically. Black should be careful. As we have seen in a lot of other lines, he will have a miserable position if White is allowed to execute his main plan of Qd1-d2, rooks to d1 and e1, and eventually a3 and b4 to expand on the queenside. }
14... Bd7
{ For a cultured King's Indian player, this natural-looking move might not be too easy. What exactly does the bishop do on d7? The point is that Black wants to play Ra8-c8 next to threaten to take on c5. It's not hard to deal with the threat itself but White does not really want his coordination to be disturbed. }
15. Qd2 Rc8
{ Now that Bf8xc5 is coming, like it or not, White has to take on c6. But, I think he still has good chances for an advantage. }
16. Nxc6 bxc6
{ Plichta ends his analysis here, claiming Black is fine, but I think the fun is just beginning and there is a lot of dynamism left to discuss. He does go a little deeper in his middlegame plans section but does not mention my preferred 17th move. In general, I think this structure is quite dubious for Black if White is able to get b2-b4 in without allowing any kind of a7-a5. The point is that the weakness of the d4-square and the passivity of the f6-knight and d7-bishop leaves Black largely without prospects unless he can target the c5-pawn. Should White play b2-b4 and Black accomplished a7-a5 in response, the fight will revolve around White's ability to get his knight to the b6 square. I had to bash my head against the wall in this position for a while, but ultimately came up with a move I am very happy with. }
17. a3
{ I really like this subtle move. White does want to play   17.b4  , but as soon as he does, Black will respond with  17...a5  , when White will have to play  18.a3  next in any case. Now, Black does not want to play a7-a5 yet due to Nc3-a4-b6. His best moves as prophylaxis against b2-b4 are Bf8-g7 and a7-a5, aiming to transpose back to the Plichta analysis, but both of them can be met in an alternative fashion. }
17... a5
{ When Black plays a7-a5 without waiting for b2-b4 first, he makes a clear weakness to attack as the pawn will not be exchanged. After }
18. Na4
{ The knight is on the way to b6, and Black will be hard-pressed to save the a5-pawn. }
18... Bg7 19. Nb6 { White got the knight to b6, and he is in great shape. } *

{ Now again, all it takes is one or two innocent-looking moves for Black's position to become a trainwreck after a subsequent Ra1-d1 and Rf1-e1. Black needs to make counterplay immediately.   14.g3 ?  White is not happy about making this move. He does it out of necessity, not desire, and here it was not necessary.  14...Qg5 !  The attack is very dangerous. This is in stark contrast to the mainline where White's queen is on d2, making Qd8-g5 impossible. }
14... Be5
{ Black looks to abuse the f4-square. White is not thrilled about playing g2-g3 since it weakens his kingside a little bit, but now it is not nearly as problematic as it would have been on the previous move since White has the g5-square under control. }
15. g3 Bh3
{ Funnily enough, I think this extremely natural move is a serious inaccuracy. White is not even remotely scared of getting checkmated as none of Black's other pieces are anywhere close to ready to join the attack, and it doesn't help Black try to break the blockade on the d4-knight. }

All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }
10. Bf2
{ A very important move. White gets his bishop off of the e3-square, which means his e-pawn is unpinned. }
10... d5
{ It's hard for me to imagine Black playing anything else. He has very little space, and with all four sets of minor pieces on board, he will have a wretched position if he does not execute the d6-d5 break. }
11. exd5
{ Making use of the bishop having retreated to f2. This move is now legal and does not hang a piece. }
11... cxd5
{ Now, it's very important to understand that White's plan is to play c4-c5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn and White with a queenside pawn majority, but it has to be timed correctly. Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Nh5
{ Historically, this has been the main move, and I believe it is best. Black aims to increase the pressure on the d4-knight and eyeballs the f4-square. Still, I think White should be better. }
14. Qd2
{ Now again, all it takes is one or two innocent-looking moves for Black's position to become a trainwreck after a subsequent Ra1-d1 and Rf1-e1. Black needs to make counterplay immediately.   14.g3 ?  White is not happy about making this move. He does it out of necessity, not desire, and here it was not necessary.  14...Qg5 !  The attack is very dangerous. This is in stark contrast to the mainline where White's queen is on d2, making Qd8-g5 impossible. }
14... Be5
{ Black looks to abuse the f4-square. White is not thrilled about playing g2-g3 since it weakens his kingside a little bit, but now it is not nearly as problematic as it would have been on the previous move since White has the g5-square under control. }
15. g3 Ng7
{ Now that g7 has been evacuated, Black is ready to reroute the knight to e6 to try to break the blockade on the d4 square. White also should be careful to avoid the tactical shot of exchanging everything on d4 followed by Ng7-f5-e3 at the end. }
16. Rfd1
{ Generally speaking, I am not thrilled about having to place this rook on d1 instead of the a-rook, but White does not have a choice.   16.Rfe1  This would be the ideal square, but after  16...Ne6  17.Nxe6  Bxe6  Black's d5 pawn is not hanging. His pieces are active and the blockade is broken, so I don't think White is better.   16.Rad1  This is the move I would have liked to play, but unfortunately, it loses material.  16...Bxd4  17.Bxd4  Nxd4  18.Qxd4  Nf5 !  something will drop here. }
16... Ne6 17. Nxe6 Bxe6
{ White is unable to take the d5-pawn for tactical reasons and must look for a more strategic idea. }
18. f4
{ White dislodges the active bishop and clears the f3-square for his own. }
18... Bg7 19. Bf3
{ This seems easy enough for White. His bishops exert good pressure against Black's d5-pawn. }

{ This is a very strategically complex position, and the fight mainly revolves around the d5-pawn and the a6-knight. Structurally, I believe Black should be better. The pawn on d5 feels more like a weak isolani than it does a dangerous passer, and if Black could fix his coordination, he would be good to go. We will see a game in the illustrative games section showing how exactly something like this could happen. The reason I believe the position is still better for White is that Black's knight on a6 is horribly misplaced and has no good way to join the game. White's number one priority needs to be keeping this the case at all costs. His best possible coordination is Bc1-e3 followed by Ra1-d1, and he can pull this off if Black does anything other than Rf8-e8. }
11... Bf5
{ Once upon a time, this was the main move, and in fact, it has been played more often than   11...Re8  , which is surely best according to modern theory. I think White can take advantage of Black's imprecise move order and get both of his rooks to the centre. }
12. Be3
{ This will be a fantastic square for the bishop for two reasons. First off, it blocks the e-file, which makes it a lot harder for Black to look for tactical chances, and secondly, it attacks the c5-pawn, making it harder still for Black to fix the bad knight on a6.   12.Rd1  This would likely transpose to the mainline after a subsequent  12...Re8  . I think White can do better. }
12... Re8 13. Rad1 Qb6 14. Rd2
{ White is able to parry the threat of Qb6xb2 with the generally desirable Rd1-d2, which covers the potentially weak c2 square as well as prepares to double the rooks on the d-file in some cases. Black would have been much better off playing Qd8-b6 on the previous move when Rd1-d2 was not an available defensive resource. I don't really see Black equalizing here since the weakness of the c5-pawn means the knight on a6 is there to stay. }
14... Rad8 15. a3
{ This seems simple enough. Black will never fix the bad knight, and White is ready to double rooks and push through with d5-d6. }

{ This is the main move, and for good reason. The rook obviously belongs on e8, and the bishop on c8 may want to go to either a6 or f5, depending on how White plays.

{ This is a double-edged decision, but I think it is a good one. White has conceded that Black's bad knight will have a permanent happy home on the decent b4-square but at the same time, Black's queenside pawn majority has been rendered completely ineffective, and the b5 square has been critically weakened. I think White can count on a nice edge because he will be able to land the bishop on b5. }

The passed d-pawn is monstrously powerful, Black has a lot of weaknesses on the light squares, and amusingly enough, the bad knight has found a home on b4 where it looks nice, but doesn't actually do that much.

Still, despite the esteemed players who have taken up the mantle from Black's point of view, I think White has every chance to fight for an edge. }

{ This old move was once the recommendation of Alexander Delchev in his book 'The Safest Grunfeld' as well as Boris Avrukh's recommendation in his own Grandmaster Repertoire book for Quality Chess. Both books came out in the same year, so it's not surprising they ended up recommending the same engine-approved line from the time. But, it's unsurprising that in such a sharp opening, analysis from 2011 did not hold up to more modern scrutiny, and indeed, I think White can show a healthy advantage. }
9. d5 Bxf3
{ This move was once played against me by Wang Yue. Practically speaking, it is probably Black's best shot, but I still think the position is rotten.

{ Here, I took on c6 against Wang and went on to win a nice game, but in fact, I think it is not the best move. White's plan should be to castle short, play Bc1-e3, get e4-e5 through, and dominate the open files with his rooks. The only way for Black to make some kind of counterplay is to advance e7-e5, and taking on c6 makes this a more serious possibility. }
13. Be3
{ A very important move. White avoids any hope of Nd7-c5 and is ready to execute his plan.   13.O-O ?!  cxd5  14.e5  Nc5 !  This is pretty annoying for White and is good enough reason that he should have started with 13. Be3.   13.dxc6  bxc6  14.O-O  e5  White should be better here too, but I find the position much less convincing. Black is getting a lot more counterplay than we need to allow. }

14. Rd1
{ Black still cannot take on d5 on pain of e4-e5, when his position collapses, and the machine claims he is already dead lost. This is probably a little bit too strong an evaluation in practical terms, but Black is definitely in bad shape. White is ready to castle next and a4-a5 could come sooner rather than later. }

I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame.

5... dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 Nc6
{ This active move is the favourite of many modern Grunfeld players, most notably Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. It has also been recommended in three different Grunfeld books, and should definitely be taken seriously. Still, despite the esteemed players who have taken up the mantle from Black's point of view, I think White has every chance to fight for an edge. }
8. Be2
{ Now, Black's position is totally senseless if he does not fight tooth and nail to get the e7-e5 advance in, and in fact, his only serious try is to play it right now. }
8... Bg4
{ This old move was once the recommendation of Alexander Delchev in his book 'The Safest Grunfeld' as well as Boris Avrukh's recommendation in his own Grandmaster Repertoire book for Quality Chess. Both books came out in the same year, so it's not surprising they ended up recommending the same engine-approved line from the time. But, it's unsurprising that in such a sharp opening, analysis from 2011 did not hold up to more modern scrutiny, and indeed, I think White can show a healthy advantage. }
9. d5 Na5 10. Qb4
{ The right square for the queen. If she were to go to a4 instead, as has been often seen in the past, she would be vulnerable to b7-b5 coming at an inopportune moment. Now, Black is actually forced to take on f3 to avoid losing immediately.   10.Qd3 ?  This move is only correct if Black has already taken on f3. The point is that now after  10...c6  11.b4 ?  The absence of the moves Bg4xf3 and g2xf3 mean that White's g-pawn has not been dragged to the centre, and he falls apart immediately.  11...Nxe4 !  White can resign. }
10... Bxf3 11. Bxf3
{ Now, White has the bishop pair, a big centre, and Black's knight on a5 is hanging. Black really has no choice other than c7-c6, aiming to pressure the center. }
11... c6 12. O-O Qb6
{ This is Black's most common choice by far, but he does have some other options. }
13. Qa4
{ Now and only now, the queen finds the a4-square. Because Black has put his own queen on b6, he cannot push b7-b5 through. }
13... Nd7
{ More than anything else, this is a prophylactic move. Black doesn't generally want to do anything too active with the knight next, mainly he is hoping to prevent Bc1-e3 by clearing the long diagonal. }
14. Rd1
{ 14.Be3 ?  This only would have worked if Black had left his knight on f6.  14...Qxb2  15.Qxa5  Bxc3 !  The point of Nf6-d7 is on full display. White must be careful not to lose immediately. }
14... Nc5
{ This tempting move is actually a serious mistake. The knight will only be a target on c5 and very vulnerable to a subsequent Bc1-e3. }
15. Qc2 { Now Black absolutely must prevent Bc1-e3. } 15... Nc4
{ Black's knights look active, but they will be promptly kicked back. } 16. b3
Ne5 17. Be2

{ Practice and deep analysis have shown that while this endgame is obviously unpleasant for Black, it is probably savable. In general, if Black wants to get some worse but holdable endgame as early as possible, he is going to be able to do it. Thankfully, most chess players are not so masochistic, and the ones who are... well, they can lose games too. A lot of lines end up in some rook endgame with one pawn down that Black can probably hold, but in practice, could also lose without too many mistakes. }

So, because Black's decision to take the game to less charted territories came after the second move, it was included in this course rather than the previous one. }

{ The Bogo Indian has never been wildly popular, but there are times that it is in fashion. I never thought much of it, but Black's position is very solid. I do think White can count on a slight edge, but nothing more. }
4. Bd2
{ This move is more in line with the strategic basis of the repertoire than the more dynamic  4.Nbd2  would be. }
4... Qe7
{ This is the main move by far, and the only one I think that can seriously fight for equality. Black defends his bishop by bringing out a new piece and not trying to change the pawn structure. }
5. e3
{ It is much more common for White to fianchetto the bishop, but I never really understood why. I think the bishop will be quite nice on d3. One key point that White should understand is that he would like to play Nb1-c3 to avoid the exchange of bishops at a suitable moment, but only when Black is unable to take on c3 and then play Nf6-e4 to trade off a bunch more pieces.   5.Nc3 ?!  I once played this move against Ivan Saric. The game went exactly as I would like our repertoire to go, but I think this move order was inaccurate. Ivan would have been more or less okay after  5...Bxc3 !  6.Bxc3  Ne4 !  When I think Black is exchanging off enough pieces that the little extra space in the centre won't matter that much. He is probably still a little worse, but I think White can do better. }
5... O-O 6. Bd3
{ Now that White has taken the e4-square under his control, he is ready for Nb1-c3 next to avoid the exchange of bishops. Black is forced into action. }
6... Bxd2+
{ This is definitely Black's best move, but White is also happy that Black took on d2 unprovoked and lets a new piece come out. }
7. Qxd2 d6
{ Black looks to execute his main plan of e6-e5. He will succeed, but under the circumstances, I still like White. }
8. Nc3
{ It's very important not to castle too soon.   8.O-O ?  This is poor. After  8...e5  9.Bc2  e4 !  Since White does not yet have the knight on c3, he is unable to play Nf3-g5. So his knight will be booted back to e1, Black managed to secure the pawn on e4, and I think White is already worse. }
8... e5
{ This position looks a little intimidating, but after the simple retreat } 9.
Bc2
{ Black's activity is nothing more than an illusion. He is not able to get the e5-e4 advance through, so I don't see much sense in his position. The computer proposes Nb8-a6, but this also does not equalize. }
9... Na6 10. O-O
{ Black is still unable to get e5-e4 through, which means White may well beat him to the punch with e3-e4 next. I don't see any reason that White's big centre will not promise him his typical edge. }

This is the best setup he can ever get, and generally, it is not possible to pull off because Black will break the centre with e6-e5, b7-b5, or c6-c5. But, because Black has spent a move on b7-b6 instead of something more useful, White pulls it off rather easily. }

First off, White has committed to g2-g3 already, which diverges from the setups I am recommending in the proper Bogo-Indian, but also Black is committed to playing b7-b6, which I generally think is a worse way to develop the bishop than d7-d6 followed by e6-e5. Additionally, in the normal Bogo-Indian, Black can consider setups with d7-d5, when White generally is supposed to wait for b7-b6 before taking on d5. Now, b7-b6 has already been played, which limits Black's options further. }
5. Bd2 Be7
{ This move is a common theme in d4/Bg2 systems and makes some sense, aiming to transpose into some kind of Catalan. Black basically always wants to meet Bf1-g2 with c7-c6 and get a quick d7-d5 in. But White has another option. }
6. Nc3 { 6.Bg2  c6  White cannot avoid transposing to the Catalan. } 6... Bb7
7. Qb1
{ A very subtle and important move. White immediately fights for control of the e4-square. Funnily enough though, it is more prophylactic than anything else. His plan against a civil move like O-O is to play Bf1-g2 and point out that Black cannot respond comfortably with c7-c6.   7.Qc2 ?!  This was Ivanchuk's choice against me once, and he won a brilliant game. Obviously, the queen looks better here than it does on b1, but during the game, I could not figure out why.  7...Nc6 !  8.e4  Nb4 !  9.Qb1  Nxe4 !  And Black is good to go.   7.Bg2  c6  I find this position unconvincing for White. After  8.e4  d5 !  9.e5  Ne4 !  Black's knight has found a good square, and one I would rather have taken away by playing Qd1-b1 first. }
7... d5
{ This was the choice of Michael Adams in the only game to ever reach this position. It's not a bad move, but Black should be a little worse. }
8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bg2
{ In general, this structure with c4xd5 and e6xd5 is nearly always fine for Black if his pawn is back on b7, and nearly always worse for him with the pawn on b6, as he will face problems on the c-file. This position is no exception. }

In general, I think it is the defence against 1. d4 that suffered the greatest hit to its reputation at the hands of computers in recent times.

4. g3
{ Now, the two main moves are  4...Bb7  and  4...Ba6  , with the latter being the better one, but Black does have a couple of other extraneous tries. }
4... Bb4+
{ With this move, Black is aiming to play more of a Bogo-Indian, but it's a bit different for two reasons. First off, White has committed to g2-g3 already, which diverges from the setups I am recommending in the proper Bogo-Indian, but also Black is committed to playing b7-b6, which I generally think is a worse way to develop the bishop than d7-d6 followed by e6-e5. Additionally, in the normal Bogo-Indian, Black can consider setups with d7-d5, when White generally is supposed to wait for b7-b6 before taking on d5. Now, b7-b6 has already been played, which limits Black's options further. }
5. Bd2 Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2 Bb7 7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O
{ White is pleasantly better here. Black does not have a great way to challenge Whites centre since he has not put his pieces in a great place to get the d7-d6 followed by e6-e5 plan through, and d7-d5 tends to leave him with a bad structure. }
8... d5
{ This is Black's second most common option and might even be the best move, but he is definitely not equalizing. After }
9. cxd5 Nxd5
{ As a good rule of thumb, Black should basically never meet the move c4xd5 with Nf6xd5 in any d4 opening if White's knight is not on c3. There are some exceptions, but this is not one of them. }
10. Re1
{ White is ready for e2-e4 next with Nb1-c3 to follow. Since the knight is not yet on c3, Black will be unable to exchange off his d5-knight and will lose a lot of time. White is clearly better, and the machine is already saying that Black needs to butcher his own structure with c7-c5 right now to avoid suffocating under the central pawn mass. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6
{ Not so long ago, the Queen's Indian Defence was a mainstay in elite-level chess, and it would seem unfathomable to think that just 15 years later, it would be mostly gone. In general, I think it is the defence against 1. d4 that suffered the greatest hit to its reputation at the hands of computers in recent times. I wouldn't be so bold as to say I have conclusively proved an advantage, but I think I can put Black under a lot of pressure. }
4. g3
{ Now, the two main moves are  4...Bb7  and  4...Ba6  , with the latter being the better one, but Black does have a couple of other extraneous tries. }
4... Bb7
{ For a long time, this move was almost as popular as the more direct  4...Ba6  , but nowadays, it is a rare guest in top-level play. }
5. Bg2 Be7 { This is the main move by far. } 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3
{ In recent years, White sometimes tried the tricky  7.Re1  , but I see no reason not to go for the most direct continuation. White is threatening d4-d5 and Black is forced into action right away. }
7... Ne4 8. Bd2
{ Now, Black can take on d2 if he wishes, but I think this generally is not his best plan as it will allow White to take the whole centre with e2-e4 coming in short order. In general, Black makes a waiting move such as 8... d6, 8... Bf6, or 8... f5, but I think only the latter two make any sense as they serve as important prophylaxis against the d4-d5 advance. }
8... Bf6
{ This move has become a modern mainline, and it makes a lot of sense. The bishop is quite well placed on f6 and serves as prophylaxis against moves White would like to make such as Nf3-e5 or d4-d5, as we see in some other cases. }
9. Re1
{ This new move has been making a lot of waves in recent years and has been used to great effect by Ding Liren. It looks very unassuming, but it contains more than a drop of poison. First off, it's an excellent move to have played if Black ever takes on d2, as it fits perfectly with White's plan of centralizing the rooks and taking all the space in the centre with e2-e4 next. Secondly, if Black ever takes on c3, the rook can be very helpful in pushing the e2-e4 advance through that might not have otherwise come so easily. Finally, overprotecting the e2-pawn makes Nf3-g5 a very real threat.   9.Ng5 ?  This is the tactical idea White wants to execute, but he is not ready until he plays Rf1-e1 first.  9...Nxc3  10.Qc2  Nxe2+ !  Check. Black wins. We needed Rf1-e1 first to prevent this possibility. }
9... c5
{ According to the machine, this is Black's best option. But I am not convinced. After }
10. d5
{ White need not be as concerned about the doubled pawns on the c-file as he would have to be if Black's pawn was back on c7. }
10... Bxc3 11. Bxc3 Nxc3 12. bxc3
{ A structure like this one with the pawn back on c7 would be quite acceptable for Black, as it would be much more solid and he could easily fix his one bad piece with Nb8-a6-c5. As is, neither of the previous statements hold true, and it is very hard to find anything for the knight to do. White is much better. }
12... d6 13. dxe6 fxe6 14. Qd2
{ We see yet another point of c7-c5 being detrimental- with the pawn back on c7, Black's position would be perfectly solid. Now, he will have massive problems defending the weak d6 pawn. }

5. b3
{ The most ambitious move. White bolsters the c4-pawn and tries to argue that the bishop on a6 will prove to be misplaced. Black runs the risk of ending up in a horrendous position if he does not get d7-d5 through, and as I've said many times throughout this course, I believe the structures do not favour him if he cannot take back with the c-pawn. }

{ A very important move. Black should provoke White's bishop to d2 so that a knight cannot sit there instead. }

{ I find this position fascinating. According to Stockfish, it is absolutely equal, and according to Leela, White is clearly better! I think they are both wrong, and that the truth lies somewhere in between. The only real imbalance is that Black's pawns are fixed on the same colour square as his bishop, but this is a much bigger deal than it might appear at first glance. Bishop endgames have the potential to be absolutely wretched for Black if White's king runs up to a square like b5. In principle, I believe Black should be able to hold on, but he will be under unpleasant pressure for quite some time. He certainly has no direct route to equality, and he has to get here in the first place. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

Black's normal lead in development is not present, and he is not able to make any serious threats against the centre. I came up with a strong move over the board the only time I ever faced this line, as long as 10 years ago, and nothing since then has led me to change my mind. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

But, I found a rare but strong-looking move that I think secures White a nice edge. }
9. h3
{ This point is extremely obvious. White does not want to allow Ng4, and without it, I see absolutely no counterplay for Black. All he can do is try to argue that ignoring the threat to the e4-pawn was unwise, but I don't believe that White can be punished. }
9... exd4 10. Bxd4
{ Black cannot get away with taking the e4-pawn here, and otherwise, I don't see a great way to challenge White's ideal coordination. }
10... b6 11. Re1 Bb7 12. Bd3
{ White's knight on f3 is a little awkward, but I certainly don't think this is enough for Black to be equalizing. He can't put much pressure on the centre and White looks better with a pleasant space advantage. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

In the meanwhile, his pawns are coming under fire and he doesn't really want to play c7-c6 either as this makes yet another weakness on d6. And... Black has absolutely no counterplay. }

The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay.

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ Obviously, when White plays Bc1-e3, he is sort of daring Black to respond with Nf6-g4, questioning the bishop's stability and getting out of the way of the f7-f5 break. For a long time, this was the most common move by far, though, in my opinion, Black has better chances to fight for equality with 7...exd4 instead. }
8. Bg5 { Black's queen is hit and the complications begin. } 8... f6
{ This is the main move by far. Black has other options in some other positions with Nf6-g4, but not in this one. }
9. Bc1
{ White also has the option of putting the bishop on h4, but despite the machine's enthusiasm, I really do not care for voluntarily pacifying one of my own pieces like that. It looks a little weird to have played Bc1-e3-g5-c1 on the last three moves, but I actually think that forcing Black to play Nf6-g4 and f7-f6 harms his position quite a bit. }
9... Nc6 10. O-O
{ The point of White's play is on full display. Since Black was forced to play ...f7-f6, the move ...Nb8-c6 does not actually force White to play d4-d5. As a result, Black cannot force the kind of closed central structure he wants in order to get ...f6-f5 through under good circumstances. }
10... f5
{ Of course, we should be ready to meet the natural advance f6-f5. This is the King's Indian after all, and it is Black's main idea, and in this position, I believe it is his best move. Still, I think White should have a nice position if he knows how to continue. }
11. dxe5 { White should be looking to open the centre rather than close it. }
11... dxe5
{ Most King's Indian players know to take back on e5 with the pawn first and ask questions later since the structures tend to favour White if he takes back with a piece. Indeed, I do believe this is his best move, but after }
12. exf5 gxf5
{ It's hard for me to imagine Black playing anything else. Now, Black is quite fine strategically and he can look to push e5-e4 and fight for control of the d4 and e5 squares for his knights, leaving him with a lot of activity. Luckily, I think I can punish him directly. }

I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay.

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }
4. e4 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 exd4
{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }
10. Bf2
{ A very important move. White gets his bishop off of the e3-square, which means his e-pawn is unpinned. }
10... d5
{ It's hard for me to imagine Black playing anything else. He has very little space, and with all four sets of minor pieces on board, he will have a wretched position if he does not execute the d6-d5 break. }
11. exd5
{ Making use of the bishop having retreated to f2. This move is now legal and does not hang a piece. }
11... cxd5
{ Now, it's very important to understand that White's plan is to play c4-c5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn and White with a queenside pawn majority, but it has to be timed correctly. Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... dxc4
{ This would be Black's attempt to 'punish' White for not playing c4-c5 yet. After all, now he can't do it at all anymore! But, it comes at a heavy price as now Black faces concrete problems. }
13. Bxc4
{ White is ready for Ndb5 next, with massive threats on d6 and c7. Black should be careful not to lose immediately. }
13... Nbd7 { Ignoring the threat cannot be recommended either. } 14. Ndb5 Ne5
{ Otherwise Nd6 would have been immediately decisive. } 15. Qxd8
{ Exchanging the queens critically weakens the c7 square. } 15... Rxd8 16. Bb3
{ Now, Black's a7-pawn is hanging, but there is an even more pressing threat of Nb5-c7, winning the rook since Ra8-b8 would be met with Bf2xa7. }
16... Nd3 17. Nc7 { Black loses material. } *

17. Rad1 Ba6 18. Bh4
{ Despite the equal material, my computer thinks White is nearly winning. Black's position is under endless pressure from all angles, barely any of his pieces can move, and he will be hard-pressed to deal with a simple plan of Rf1-e1 with threats of either Nb5-c7 or Nb5-d6 coming next. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }
10. Bf2
{ A very important move. White gets his bishop off of the e3-square, which means his e-pawn is unpinned. }
10... d5
{ It's hard for me to imagine Black playing anything else. He has very little space, and with all four sets of minor pieces on board, he will have a wretched position if he does not execute the d6-d5 break. }
11. exd5
{ Making use of the bishop having retreated to f2. This move is now legal and does not hang a piece. }
11... cxd5
{ Now, it's very important to understand that White's plan is to play c4-c5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn and White with a queenside pawn majority, but it has to be timed correctly. Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Bf8
{ In recent years, this has been the main move, but I find it unconvincing and I think Nf6-h5 is a better try. Still, it has had its successes and has been recommended by Kamil Plichta here on Chessable, and certainly must be taken seriously. }
14. Kh1
{ White defends the c5-pawn tactically. Black should be careful. As we have seen in a lot of other lines, he will have a miserable position if White is allowed to execute his main plan of Qd1-d2, rooks to d1 and e1, and eventually a3 and b4 to expand on the queenside. }
14... Bd7
{ For a cultured King's Indian player, this natural-looking move might not be too easy. What exactly does the bishop do on d7? The point is that Black wants to play Ra8-c8 next to threaten to take on c5. It's not hard to deal with the threat itself but White does not really want his coordination to be disturbed. }
15. Qd2 Rc8
{ Now that Bf8xc5 is coming, like it or not, White has to take on c6. But, I think he still has good chances for an advantage. }
16. Nxc6 bxc6
{ Plichta ends his analysis here, claiming Black is fine, but I think the fun is just beginning and there is a lot of dynamism left to discuss. He does go a little deeper in his middlegame plans section but does not mention my preferred 17th move. In general, I think this structure is quite dubious for Black if White is able to get b2-b4 in without allowing any kind of a7-a5. The point is that the weakness of the d4-square and the passivity of the f6-knight and d7-bishop leaves Black largely without prospects unless he can target the c5-pawn. Should White play b2-b4 and Black accomplished a7-a5 in response, the fight will revolve around White's ability to get his knight to the b6 square. I had to bash my head against the wall in this position for a while, but ultimately came up with a move I am very happy with. }
17. b4
{ This has been the main move in the past, but I am not convinced. After }
17... a5 18. a3 Bg7
{ Black looks more or less okay to me. He will take on b4 at the right moment and then the backwards b-pawn could be enough of a problem for White that he can't count on an edge. The biggest reason is that I don't see a great way to get Na4-b6 in without allowing heavy counterplay. This is definitely worth a try and I think Black still has some problems to solve, but I prefer my move. }
19. Na4 axb4 20. axb4 Ra8
{ White cannot play Na4-b6, and he already looks worse to me. Tactics are in the air. }

The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }
4. e4 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 exd4
{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }
10. Bf2
{ A very important move. White gets his bishop off of the e3-square, which means his e-pawn is unpinned. }
10... d5
{ It's hard for me to imagine Black playing anything else. He has very little space, and with all four sets of minor pieces on board, he will have a wretched position if he does not execute the d6-d5 break. }
11. exd5
{ Making use of the bishop having retreated to f2. This move is now legal and does not hang a piece. }
11... cxd5
{ Now, it's very important to understand that White's plan is to play c4-c5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn and White with a queenside pawn majority, but it has to be timed correctly. Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Bf8
{ In recent years, this has been the main move, but I find it unconvincing and I think Nf6-h5 is a better try. Still, it has had its successes and has been recommended by Kamil Plichta here on Chessable, and certainly must be taken seriously. }
14. Kh1
{ White defends the c5-pawn tactically. Black should be careful. As we have seen in a lot of other lines, he will have a miserable position if White is allowed to execute his main plan of Qd1-d2, rooks to d1 and e1, and eventually a3 and b4 to expand on the queenside. }
14... Bd7
{ For a cultured King's Indian player, this natural-looking move might not be too easy. What exactly does the bishop do on d7? The point is that Black wants to play Ra8-c8 next to threaten to take on c5. It's not hard to deal with the threat itself but White does not really want his coordination to be disturbed. }
15. Qd2 Rc8
{ Now that Bf8xc5 is coming, like it or not, White has to take on c6. But, I think he still has good chances for an advantage. }
16. Nxc6 bxc6
{ Plichta ends his analysis here, claiming Black is fine, but I think the fun is just beginning and there is a lot of dynamism left to discuss. He does go a little deeper in his middlegame plans section but does not mention my preferred 17th move. In general, I think this structure is quite dubious for Black if White is able to get b2-b4 in without allowing any kind of a7-a5. The point is that the weakness of the d4-square and the passivity of the f6-knight and d7-bishop leaves Black largely without prospects unless he can target the c5-pawn. Should White play b2-b4 and Black accomplished a7-a5 in response, the fight will revolve around White's ability to get his knight to the b6 square. I had to bash my head against the wall in this position for a while, but ultimately came up with a move I am very happy with. }
17. a3
{ I really like this subtle move. White does want to play  17.b4  , but as soon as he does, Black will respond with  17...a5  , when White will have to play  18.a3  next in any case.  Now, Black does not want to play a7-a5 yet due to Nc3-a4-b6. His best moves as prophylaxis against b2-b4 are Bf8-g7 and a7-a5, aiming to transpose back to the Plichta analysis, but both of them can be met in an alternative fashion. }
17... Bg7
{ Now, if white were to push b2-b4, Black should be fine after a7-a5. But, I think we can prevent the latter from happening. }
18. Ba6 { 18.b4  a5  would only transpose to the less convincing17. b4-line. }
18... Rb8 19. b4
{ Black is unable to play a7-a5, and he looks a bit worse to me due to the aforementioned bad pieces on d7 and f6. It's not ideal that he was able to force us to take on c6 and allow him to recapture with the pawn, but all the same, White looks a little better to me. He can look to follow up with Rae1 and Nc3-e2 and possibly d4, and most importantly, I don't see much counterplay for Black. }

I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6

12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Re5
{ If Black is hell-bent on avoiding the main moves Nf6-h5 and Bg7-f8, this has been his most common choice, but the move makes no sense to me at all. The rook on e5 does not threaten anything or do much to stop White from completing his development in the prescribed manner. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }
10. Bf2

10... d5

{ Making use of the bishop having retreated to f2. This move is now legal and does not hang a piece. }
11... cxd5
{ Now, it's very important to understand that White's plan is to play c4-c5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn and White with a queenside pawn majority, but it has to be timed correctly. Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Nh5
{ Historically, this has been the main move, and I believe it is best. Black aims to increase the pressure on the d4-knight and eyeballs the f4-square. Still, I think White should be better. }
14. Qd2
{ Now again, all it takes is one or two innocent-looking moves for Black's position to become a trainwreck after a subsequent Ra1-d1 and Rf1-e1. Black needs to make counterplay immediately.   14.g3 ?  White is not happy about making this move. He does it out of necessity, not desire, and here it was not necessary.  14...Qg5 !  The attack is very dangerous. This is in stark contrast to the mainline where White's queen is on d2, making Qd8-g5 impossible. }
14... Be5
{ Black looks to abuse the f4-square. White is not thrilled about playing g2-g3 since it weakens his kingside a little bit, but now it is not nearly as problematic as it would have been on the previous move since White has the g5-square under control. }

Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Nh5
{ Historically, this has been the main move, and I believe it is best. Black aims to increase the pressure on the d4-knight and eyeballs the f4-square. Still, I think White should be better. }
14. Qd2
{ Now again, all it takes is one or two innocent-looking moves for Black's position to become a trainwreck after a subsequent Ra1-d1 and Rf1-e1. Black needs to make counterplay immediately.   14.g3 ?  White is not happy about making this move. He does it out of necessity, not desire, and here it was not necessary.  14...Qg5 !  The attack is very dangerous. This is in stark contrast to the mainline where White's queen is on d2, making Qd8-g5 impossible. }
14... Be5
{ Black looks to abuse the f4-square. White is not thrilled about playing g2-g3 since it weakens his kingside a little bit, but now it is not nearly as problematic as it would have been on the previous move since White has the g5-square under control. }
15. g3 Bh3
{ Funnily enough, I think this extremely natural move is a serious inaccuracy. White is not even remotely scared of getting checkmated as none of Black's other pieces are anywhere close to ready to join the attack, and it doesn't help Black try to break the blockade on the d4-knight. }
16. Rfe1 { The rook wanted to go here anyway. } 16... a6
{ Black prepares for Qd8-d7 next, making sure to avoid any Be2-b5 issues. But he is still worse. }
17. a3 Qd7 18. b4
{ White is pleasantly better and can complete his development with Rad1 next. In some cases, the a6-pawn can prove to be a liability when White takes on c6, since if the a8-rook has left to go to a square like d8, the pawn will fall. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file.

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6

Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }

{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }

{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }

Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4.

15. g3 Ng7
{ Now that g7 has been evacuated, Black is ready to reroute the knight to e6 to try to break the blockade on the d4 square. White also should be careful to avoid the tactical shot of exchanging everything on d4 followed by Ng7-f5-e3 at the end. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ The King's Indian is, unfortunately, less popular now than it was some years back. Generally speaking, White is better. Everyone knows White is better, including guys who play the King's Indian themselves! I'm sure that Radjabov, Nakamura, and Ding Liren would tell you the same thing. But, the mainlines can be so strategically complex and next to impossible to play, even with computer help, that oftentimes the practical chances Black gets to prove to be more important. The numbers in human encounters certainly support this point of view. I believe that objectively, the Gligoric is not White's best chance to fight for the maximum advantage he can get- it might not be among his top 5 options. But I do think that from a practical point of view, it is a very attractive option. It takes Black out of his comfort zone of looking for counterplay and aggressive play even if he is objectively worse and makes him play more into the style I want in the repertoire- clean, positional chess where Black is under pressure. I found a lot of new ideas to cause him a lot of trouble, and could not find full equality. The best I could do for Black was to memorize some very, very long lines with lots of side variations along the way to reach a slightly worse endgame that he will probably be able to hold with best play. Almost nobody can do this, and even those who can might choose not to. They play the King's Indian for a reason, and will likely voluntarily enter a worse position to try to get more counterplay. If they wanted to memorize a lot of lines to suffer for a draw... well, they could have a much easier time doing it in another opening. }
4. e4 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 exd4
{ While once upon a time this move was considered a bit out of the box, modern engines are mostly concurring that it may well be best. Black foregoes any hope of trying to play some kind of strategic locked King's Indian position and instead places his efforts on breaking down White's central control at the source. Once the moves Rf8-e8 and f2-f3 are included, White will not be able to prevent the freeing d6-d5 thanks to the pin on the e-file. All the same, with accurate play, I believe White can fight for an edge. }
8. Nxd4 Re8 { I can't even imagine Black playing any other move. } 9. f3 c6
{ Black is ready for d6-d5 to come next. If he can successfully break down White's centre without anything bad happening to him, he will be absolutely fine. But, I think White can still fight for an edge. }
10. Bf2
{ A very important move. White gets his bishop off of the e3-square, which means his e-pawn is unpinned. }
10... d5
{ It's hard for me to imagine Black playing anything else. He has very little space, and with all four sets of minor pieces on board, he will have a wretched position if he does not execute the d6-d5 break. }
11. exd5
{ Making use of the bishop having retreated to f2. This move is now legal and does not hang a piece. }
11... cxd5
{ Now, it's very important to understand that White's plan is to play c4-c5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn and White with a queenside pawn majority, but it has to be timed correctly. Black is a little bit ahead on development and if he can target the c5-pawn, White will struggle to defend it. So, we should wait until Black has committed his knight to c6. }
12. O-O { White is not ready for c4-c5 next. } 12... Nc6
{ This is the main move by far, and for good reason. Black develops a new piece to put pressure on the centre. Now, if White does something nonchalantly, Black can take on d4, take on c4, and play Bc8-e6, neutralizing the powerful c4-bishop, equalizing easily. White is forced into action, and he is ready to fix the pawn structure. }
13. c5
{ Strategically speaking, Black is in quite a bit of danger here. If White is allowed to simply develop his pieces with something like Qd1-d2, Ra1-d1, Rf1-e1 etc, he will be clearly better due to the pleasant structure, the weakness of the d6-square, and the possibility of expanding on the queenside with a2-a3 followed by b2-b4. Black should be very direct. }
13... Nh5
{ Historically, this has been the main move, and I believe it is best. Black aims to increase the pressure on the d4-knight and eyeballs the f4-square. Still, I think White should be better. }
14. Qd2
{ Now again, all it takes is one or two innocent-looking moves for Black's position to become a trainwreck after a subsequent Ra1-d1 and Rf1-e1. Black needs to make counterplay immediately.   14.g3 ?  White is not happy about making this move. He does it out of necessity, not desire, and here it was not necessary.  14...Qg5 !  The attack is very dangerous. This is in stark contrast to the mainline where White's queen is on d2, making Qd8-g5 impossible. }
14... Be5
{ Black looks to abuse the f4-square. White is not thrilled about playing g2-g3 since it weakens his kingside a little bit, but now it is not nearly as problematic as it would have been on the previous move since White has the g5-square under control. }
15. g3 Ng7
{ Now that g7 has been evacuated, Black is ready to reroute the knight to e6 to try to break the blockade on the d4 square. White also should be careful to avoid the tactical shot of exchanging everything on d4 followed by Ng7-f5-e3 at the end. }
16. Rfd1
{ Generally speaking, I am not thrilled about having to place this rook on d1 instead of the a-rook, but White does not have a choice.   16.Rfe1  This would be the ideal square, but after  16...Ne6  17.Nxe6  Bxe6  Black's d5 pawn is not hanging.

{ Generally speaking, I am not thrilled about having to place this rook on d1 instead of the a-rook, but White does not have a choice.   16.Rfe1  This would be the ideal square, but after  16...Ne6  17.Nxe6  Bxe6  Black's d5 pawn is not hanging. His pieces are active and the blockade is broken, so I don't think White is better.   16.Rad1  This is the move I would have liked to play, but unfortunately, it loses material.  16...Bxd4  17.Bxd4  Nxd4  18.Qxd4  Nf5 !  something will drop here. }
16... Bf5
{ This computer move has become the favourite of strong King's Indian players in recent years. Black's point is that he wants to play Be5xd4 followed by Ng7-e6, breaking the blockade and forcing d5-d4 through at a moment when White will not be able to respond with Nc3-e4. }
17. Rac1 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Ne6 19. Bf2 d4 20. Nb5 Qd5 21. g4
{ Black now has to play extremely precisely to reach a somewhat unpleasant endgame. }
21... Bxg4 22. fxg4 Ng5 23. Rc3
{ Guarding against all checks on the third rank. } 23... Qe5 24. Nxd4 Nxd4 25.
Bxd4 Qxe2 26. Qxe2 Rxe2
{ If Black has gone for Grischuk's Bc8-f5 and is reasonably well prepared, he will probably reach this point without a ton of trouble. But this endgame is far from trivial for Black to hold. I do think it can be done, but a lot more precision is needed. }
27. Re3 Rc2
{ This strikes me as an absurdly difficult move for a human to make. The rook doesn't do much on c2, and now White will be able to take both open files with his own rooks. Now, the only game to ever reach this position was a correspondence one from 2014. Black just barely held, but I have an idea to try to exert more pressure. }
28. Bf6
{ White hits the knight immediately and is ready for Rd7 next.   28.Bc3  This was the choice in the aforementioned machine vs machine game. Much like my preferred 28. Bf6, Black should hold with  (very!)  precise play, but I like my move more, if for no other reason that it will deviate from the known game.  28...Ne6  29.Re5  Nf4  30.Rd2  Rxd2  31.Bxd2  Ne6  32.Rd5  Rd8  33.Rxd8+  Nxd8  Apparently, this position is a draw, though it would not be totally obvious to me. }
28... Ne6 29. Rd7 Nxc5 30. Rde7
{ At very high depths, both Stockfish and Leela settle on a 0.1-0.2 advantage for White. I have to believe the position is holdable, but it will not be fun for Black. He will face a lot of threats to his pawns along the seventh rank and to his king along the eighth, and in practice, it seems like a very hard position for a human to defend. If someone makes it through these 30 moves of preparation and then successfully defends this position for another 20, they have earned their draw. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }
5... c6

{ This is a somewhat unusual square to develop the bishop to in an Exchange Slav - normally, it would go to f4. But, here I think it makes more sense on g5 as it will force Black to lose a tempo on ...e7-e6. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }
5... dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4
{ At this point, I believe that  7...a6  is the best move, though there is something to be said for  7...Na6  and  7...Nc6  as well. Black has some sidelines available to him as well, but they are not particularly challenging. }
7... Bg4
{ This move is the close cousin of Nf6-d7, but I think a much stronger version thanks to being a bit more flexible. In my opinion, it is an underrated option and Black's second-best move apart from the mainline with 7...a6. Still, I think I managed to put it under some pressure. }

{ It looks like White is losing control to some degree, as his centre is coming under fire and his queen could prove to be unstable after a subsequent ...b7-b5. But, he has everything under control and can consolidate his position with a couple of accurate moves. }
12. Rd1 Qc7
{ Black is now threatening b7-b5 for real, and while that would not be the end of the world, it would give him a lot more counterplay than I am comfortable allowing. White has a couple of ways to try to stop this from happening, but I like the following one. }
13. Qa3
{ White pre-emptively gets his queen off of the vulnerable a4 square. She is much better placed on a3, and even does a fine job of preventing ...Nf6-d7 by pressuring the e7-pawn. Black is in big trouble. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ At this point, I believe that  7...a6  is the best move, though there is something to be said for  7...Na6  and  7...Nc6  as well. Black has some sidelines available to him as well, but they are not particularly challenging. }
7... Bg4
{ This move is the close cousin of Nf6-d7, but I think a much stronger version thanks to being a bit more flexible. In my opinion, it is an underrated option and Black's second-best move apart from the mainline with 7...a6. Still, I think I managed to put it under some pressure. }

8... Nfd7 9. Rd1
{ Now, Black can certainly play Nd7-b6, but this will transpose to the7...Nd7-line. His other option is to play Nb8-c6 instead. }
9... Nc6

10. Qb5
{ According to my database, this extremely powerful move was only played once in human practice, as long ago as 1986! I think this has more to do with the line falling out of fashion for Black, as modern engines give it as clearly best.   10.Qb3 ?!  White should take care not to be too desperate to transpose to the 7...Nfd7 line, as here Black can show why his flexibility is helpful.  10...e5  ⇆  Black has good counterplay.  11.dxe5  Ncxe5  White cannot take on e5 here, and Black is fine.

8. Be2 c5 9. d5 e6 10. O-O exd5 11. exd5
{ This is a very strategically complex position, and the fight mainly revolves around the d5-pawn and the a6-knight. Structurally, I believe Black should be better. The pawn on d5 feels more like a weak isolani than it does a dangerous passer, and if Black could fix his coordination, he would be good to go. We will see a game in the illustrative games section showing how exactly something like this could happen. The reason I believe the position is still better for White is that Black's knight on a6 is horribly misplaced and has no good way to join the game. White's number one priority needs to be keeping this the case at all costs. His best possible coordination is Bc1-e3 followed by Ra1-d1, and he can pull this off if Black does anything other than Rf8-e8. }

{ White is able to parry the threat of Qb6xb2 with the generally desirable Rd1-d2, which covers the potentially weak c2 square as well as prepares to double the rooks on the d-file in some cases. Black would have been much better off playing Qd8-b6 on the previous move when Rd1-d2 was not an available defensive resource. I don't really see Black equalizing here since the weakness of the c5-pawn means the knight on a6 is there to stay. }

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ This is a very strategically complex position, and the fight mainly revolves around the d5-pawn and the a6-knight. Structurally, I believe Black should be better. The pawn on d5 feels more like a weak isolani than it does a dangerous passer, and if Black could fix his coordination, he would be good to go. We will see a game in the illustrative games section showing how exactly something like this could happen. The reason I believe the position is still better for White is that Black's knight on a6 is horribly misplaced and has no good way to join the game. White's number one priority needs to be keeping this the case at all costs. His best possible coordination is Bc1-e3 followed by Ra1-d1, and he can pull this off if Black does anything other than Rf8-e8. }

12. Be3
{ This will be a fantastic square for the bishop for two reasons.

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

8. Be2 c5 9. d5 e6 10. O-O exd5 11. exd5
{ This is a very strategically complex position, and the fight mainly revolves around the d5-pawn and the a6-knight. Structurally, I believe Black should be better. The pawn on d5 feels more like a weak isolani than it does a dangerous passer, and if Black could fix his coordination, he would be good to go. We will see a game in the illustrative games section showing how exactly something like this could happen. The reason I believe the position is still better for White is that Black's knight on a6 is horribly misplaced and has no good way to join the game. White's number one priority needs to be keeping this the case at all costs. His best possible coordination is Bc1-e3 followed by Ra1-d1, and he can pull this off if Black does anything other than Rf8-e8. }

8. Be2 c5 9. d5 e6 10. O-O exd5 11. exd5
{ This is a very strategically complex position, and the fight mainly revolves around the d5-pawn and the a6-knight. Structurally, I believe Black should be better. The pawn on d5 feels more like a weak isolani than it does a dangerous passer, and if Black could fix his coordination, he would be good to go. We will see a game in the illustrative games section showing how exactly something like this could happen. The reason I believe the position is still better for White is that Black's knight on a6 is horribly misplaced and has no good way to join the game. White's number one priority needs to be keeping this the case at all costs. His best possible coordination is Bc1-e3 followed by Ra1-d1, and he can pull this off if Black does anything other than Rf8-e8. }
11... Re8
{ This is the main move, and for good reason. The rook obviously belongs on e8, and the bishop on c8 may want to go to either a6 or f5, depending on how White plays. By moving the rook first, Black maintains his flexibility, and in doing so, prevents White from reaching optimal coordination with his rooks on d1 and e1. }
12. Be3
{ As usual, I like this move to try to reach the best possible coordination with Ra1-d1 coming next. White does have to memorize some key lines though as Black is not without ideas. According to my database, this move was last played in 2017, with Rf1-d1 and Bc1-f4 being much more popular, but I believe those coordinations are less effective.   12.Rd1  In practice, this has been the most common move, but I am not convinced. The rook on a1 can become both passive and a target, and after the main continuation  12...Bf5  13.d6  h6  I find White's position to be unconvincing. Black is ready for Nf6-d7 and he will be able to fix the bad knight with Na6-b4 next. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

By moving the rook first, Black maintains his flexibility, and in doing so, prevents White from reaching optimal coordination with his rooks on d1 and e1. }
12. Be3
{ As usual, I like this move to try to reach the best possible coordination with Ra1-d1 coming next. White does have to memorize some key lines though as Black is not without ideas. According to my database, this move was last played in 2017, with Rf1-d1 and Bc1-f4 being much more popular, but I believe those coordinations are less effective.   12.Rd1  In practice, this has been the most common move, but I am not convinced. The rook on a1 can become both passive and a target, and after the main continuation  12...Bf5  13.d6  h6  I find White's position to be unconvincing. Black is ready for Nf6-d7 and he will be able to fix the bad knight with Na6-b4 next. }

15. Ne1
{ White overprotects the c2 square in a way that does not allow Re8xe3 to ruin his day. Despite only being a few moves after the main tabiya, this position is extremely rare, with only two human games and one correspondence game contested. Black has to be very direct to avoid instantly losing to a2-a3, when his knight will be trapped.   15.Rd2 ?  The natural move gets hit hard.  15...Rxe3 !  16.fxe3  Bh6 !  White's position is already collapsing. }
15... Bg4
{ This was Black's choice in one of the three games to reach this position, but I find it unsatisfying for the second player. In general, I think White is pretty happy to exchange off light-squared bishops as it will make it easier to control the key c2 and d3-squares that Black's knight on b4 desperately desires to reach. }
16. Bxg4 Nxg4 17. Bf4

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }
5... dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 Na6
{ A long time ago, this was considered to be the main move, and it was the favourite of Garry Kasparov for most of his career. While it has somewhat fallen out of favour in recent years, I think it's actually undervalued by the more recent generation. It took a lot of effort, but I do think I showed an advantage for White. }
8. Be2 c5 9. d5 e6 10. O-O exd5 11. exd5
{ This is a very strategically complex position, and the fight mainly revolves around the d5-pawn and the a6-knight. Structurally, I believe Black should be better. The pawn on d5 feels more like a weak isolani than it does a dangerous passer, and if Black could fix his coordination, he would be good to go. We will see a game in the illustrative games section showing how exactly something like this could happen. The reason I believe the position is still better for White is that Black's knight on a6 is horribly misplaced and has no good way to join the game. White's number one priority needs to be keeping this the case at all costs. His best possible coordination is Bc1-e3 followed by Ra1-d1, and he can pull this off if Black does anything other than Rf8-e8. }

15... Ng4 16. Bxg4 Bxg4 17. Rd2
{ I think White should be better here. Essentially, he is about to play a2-a3 to kick the b4-knight back to a6, and then h2-h3 to boot the bishop away as well. Eventually, he can look for Ne1-f3 and Rf1-d1 to make the d-pawn as dangerous as possible, and once Black's active looking pieces are pushed back, I can't really imagine him equalizing. }

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay.

10... Bxf3 11. Bxf3
{ Now, White has the bishop pair, a big centre, and Black's knight on a5 is hanging. Black really has no choice other than c7-c6, aiming to pressure the center. }
11... c6 12. O-O Qb6
{ This is Black's most common choice by far, but he does have some other options. }
13. Qa4
{ Now and only now, the queen finds the a4-square. Because Black has put his own queen on b6, he cannot push b7-b5 through. }
13... Nd7
{ More than anything else, this is a prophylactic move. Black doesn't generally want to do anything too active with the knight next, mainly he is hoping to prevent Bc1-e3 by clearing the long diagonal. }
14. Rd1
{ 14.Be3 ?  This only would have worked if Black had left his knight on f6.  14...Qxb2  15.Qxa5  Bxc3 !  The point of Nf6-d7 is on full display. White must be careful not to lose immediately. }
14... Rfd8
{ Up to here, we are following Delchev's analysis, and he believed Black was fine here. The point is that White has a very hard time completing his queenside development, as he cannot move the c1-bishop without hanging the b2-pawn, and Qa4-c2 will be met with Na5-c4, increasing the pressure. But White does have a route to an edge, first demonstrated by Anish Giri many years ago. }
15. g3
{ This waiting move is very powerful for a few reasons. First off, it puts the ball back in Black's court, and it is not easy to find a move for the second player since the natural Ra8-c8 will always be met with Bf3-g4. Secondly, clearing the g2 square for the bishop will be extremely helpful because Black will be unable to prepare for the desirable Ra8-c8 by securing the g4-square. Finally, White's plan is ultimately to play Bc1-e3 and meet Qb6xb2 with Rd1-c1. This will provoke a tactical encounter that will only work out well for White if he secures his back rank first. }
15... h5
{ This counter-waiting move is the computer's top choice, and a very natural one for a human as well. By securing the g4-square, Black is ready to play Ra8-c8 next. Now we see why g2-g3 was so important. }
16. Bg2 { White is once again able to prevent Ra8-c8 from coming. } 16... Rac8

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ This active move is the favourite of many modern Grunfeld players, most notably Maxime Vachier-Lagrave.

Still, despite the esteemed players who have taken up the mantle from Black's point of view, I think White has every chance to fight for an edge. }

{ Now, Black's position is totally senseless if he does not fight tooth and nail to get the e7-e5 advance in, and in fact, his only serious try is to play it right now. }
8... Bg4
{ This old move was once the recommendation of Alexander Delchev in his book 'The Safest Grunfeld' as well as Boris Avrukh's recommendation in his own Grandmaster Repertoire book for Quality Chess. Both books came out in the same year, so it's not surprising they ended up recommending the same engine-approved line from the time. But, it's unsurprising that in such a sharp opening, analysis from 2011 did not hold up to more modern scrutiny, and indeed, I think White can show a healthy advantage. }

In general, if Black wants to get some worse but holdable endgame as early as possible, he is going to be able to do it. Thankfully, most chess players are not so masochistic, and the ones who are... well, they can lose games too. A lot of lines end up in some rook endgame with one pawn down that Black can probably hold, but in practice, could also lose without too many mistakes. }

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay.

{ At high depths, Stockfish only gives white a tiny advantage, and I'm sure a computer would save Black's position without much trouble. But in human play, Black faces an unpleasant defence. Having fewer pawns around his king in a position with lots of heavy pieces means that mating threats can materialize out of nowhere, and Black also does not really want to trade pieces as endgames will be very ugly for him if white's king gets to d3 and the d4-pawn can become a serious target. It is hard to get the d4-d3 advance in, so the bishop will remain passive. While I certainly believe the position should be defensible, I would be really uncomfortable playing this position from the black side. }

{ In general, I am quite happy to play a structure like this one, and we saw some similar ones in the Gligoric King's Indian. White can centralize his rooks and aim to pressure the d4-pawn, and Black's position feels very suspect. I wouldn't be surprised if he could equalize with some very precise moves, but in practice, this feels like a tall order and I would expect White to have very real chances to fight for an edge in human play. In general when you have a position where one side can maintain equality with only moves and the other is fine after more or less anything they decide to play, 'objectively' equal positions can turn south really fast. I think this is one of those positions. }

Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ This is much better than taking the rook in the corner. } 17... Qc4 18. Nd5
{ Black currently has three pawns in addition to his queen to play against the 3 pieces, but the pawns are going to rapidly start falling. In general, the reason a queen is stronger than other pieces is her ability to attack multiple weaknesses at once, and in this position, White doesn't have any weaknesses to attack. Conversely, the strength of more small pieces is that they can zero in on a single weakness and put more force upon it than the defender can meet. Here, White has very real chances to make something like that happen. Despite Stockfish's insistence that the position is equal, Leela gives White a big advantage and he has scored very heavily in both over the board and correspondence chess. A good rule of thumb for handling the White side of this position is to really try to avoid rook exchanges. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }
5... dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 a6
{ In my opinion, this is objectively Black's best move against the Russian system. His point is to push the queen away with b7-b5, forcing her to vacate the c4 square and allow for the favourable c7-c5 advance to come and start to put White's centre under pressure. Unsurprisingly, I was unable to bust this move, and it was the spot that caused me the most grief in this entire course, but I believe I have put together a strong practical repertoire that should still favour White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }
5... dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 a6
{ In my opinion, this is objectively Black's best move against the Russian system. His point is to push the queen away with b7-b5, forcing her to vacate the c4 square and allow for the favourable c7-c5 advance to come and start to put White's centre under pressure. Unsurprisingly, I was unable to bust this move, and it was the spot that caused me the most grief in this entire course, but I believe I have put together a strong practical repertoire that should still favour White. }

13. O-O Qc7
{ This is definitely the best move. Black is maintaining flexibility and would often rather take on c5 than e5. Correspondence chess sees draws in nearly every game from this position, but in human play, Black has been suffering. }
14. Rad1 Nxc5

I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame.

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }

{ White should be a bit better thanks to his bishop pair, extra space, and somewhat overextended Black queenside. He will be able to overprotect the d5-pawn with Rf1-d1, potentially invade with Qd3-b5 at an inopportune moment, or even boot Black's queen around with Be3-f4. In computer vs computer encounters, Black has held all four times, but I find it unsurprising that no human has ever tried playing this way with Black. It looks very difficult to me. }

{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3
{ Strategically speaking, I believe the Russian System is White's most ambitious try against the Grunfeld. Most lines either involve an exchange on d5 and c3, or no exchange at all. With the Russian system, White compels Black to take on c4 instead, and after a subsequent Qb3xc4, he is ready to play e2-e4 to take the whole centre with his pawns without allowing Black to exchange any pieces, and the queen on c4 conveniently stops Black from playing c4-c5 as well. Black can get an absolutely horrendous position very fast if he is not careful, and has to be super direct to make some kind of counterplay. I think I have made a very challenging repertoire for a human to face, where the best he can do is prepare VERY deeply to reach a somewhat unpleasant but holdable endgame. This happens in a few different variations, it cannot be avoided, and I am quite happy with the work I have done. }
5... dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 a6
{ In my opinion, this is objectively Black's best move against the Russian system. His point is to push the queen away with b7-b5, forcing her to vacate the c4 square and allow for the favourable c7-c5 advance to come and start to put White's centre under pressure. Unsurprisingly, I was unable to bust this move, and it was the spot that caused me the most grief in this entire course, but I believe I have put together a strong practical repertoire that should still favour White. }
8. Be2 b5 9. Qb3 c5
{ This is definitely Black's best move and most critical try, but he does have one other option. }
10. dxc5 Be6 { This is the big mainline nowadays. } 11. Qc2 Nbd7
{ Nothing else makes any sense. } 12. Be3 Rc8 13. Rd1
{ Now, the main move by far is  13...b4  , which you will almost certainly see, but there is a new trend in correspondence chess of playing  13...Qa5  here as well. }
13... b4 14. Nd5 Bxd5 15. exd5
{ Now, if White was able to get c5-c6 in, he would be absolutely winning. Black will not allow this to happen. }
15... Nxc5
{ The tactics work out in Black's favour and the knight is immune to capture, but White responds with the simple }
16. O-O
{ And now we reach the main tabiya of the Russian System. If Black is unable to make some kind of counterplay, White's bishop pair and extra space can potentially become very powerful. His ideal setup is Bc4, Qe2, Rfe1, Bd4, and he should be better if he can pull this off. In both over the board and computer chess, Black is looking for direct solutions. }
16... Nce4
{ This is the main move in both human and correspondence play. It is rather forcing in its nature and Black quickly gets an unpleasant, but probably holdable, endgame. }
17. Qd3 Qd6 { Almost an only move. } 18. g3 Rfd8 19. Bf4 Qxd5 20. Qxa6 Qa8 21.
Qxa8 Rxa8 22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 23. Rd1
{ This position is a lot tougher for Black than it looks, and a player as strong as Nepomnitachi lost it in a classical game. He has to be very careful not to get into trouble as the potential for an outside passed pawn, or the potential for b4 to become a targetable weakness is very real. }
23... Rxd1+ 24. Bxd1 Ng4
{ This is the choice of the computer world, though it has so far not been seen in human practice. It's probably the best move, but I think White can still put Black under some pressure. }
25. Bc2 Nexf2 26. Kg2 { Black is about to lose a piece if he is not careful. }
26... e5 27. Nxe5 Nxe5 28. Kxf2 Ng4+ 29. Ke2 Bxb2 30. h3 Ne5 31. Bd2 Ba3 32.
Bh6 Bb2
{ Two ICCF games reached this far, and both times White made a draw by repeating moves. I really think that computer vs computer chess lacks a lot of charm and any imagination. }
33. Be4
{ Of course White should keep playing. Black's king is forever shut out of the game, and he cannot comfortably move the f-pawn to help him join the action because then White's bishop will land on d5. In the meantime, White is ready to bring the king to b3. Stockfish claims Black holds here. I'm sure it is right in a higher chess sense, but to any human opponent: good luck. }

{ This new move has been making a lot of waves in recent years and has been used to great effect by Ding Liren. It looks very unassuming, but it contains more than a drop of poison. First off, it's an excellent move to have played if Black ever takes on d2, as it fits perfectly with White's plan of centralizing the rooks and taking all the space in the centre with e2-e4 next. Secondly, if Black ever takes on c3, the rook can be very helpful in pushing the e2-e4 advance through that might not have otherwise come so easily. Finally, overprotecting the e2-pawn makes Nf3-g5 a very real threat.   9.Ng5 ?

{ I like this simple move the best. Normally, I would be hesitant to exchange off a bunch of pieces with a space advantage, but here, the move ...f7-f5 has convinced me to do so. First off, once Black makes this advance, he is taking a bit more space himself, but more importantly, the position more resembles a Dutch now. As anyone who studied the part 1 course knows, White's best plan against the Dutch is to get e2-e4 through, and getting rid of the knight on e4 and the bishop on b7 is an excellent way to make this a reality.   9.d5  This is the move White would make in an ideal world, but now he point of f7-f5 is revealed.

{ Black resigned before waiting for a move, or perhaps lost on time as his final move registered before time control. Either way, the game is very much over. }

{ All the way up to here. White is following my repertoire. ICCF can hold this position, but look what happened to even a strong and well-prepared human. }
22... Ne7 { 22...Rxd6 ?  23.cxd6  Qxd6  24.Nc4  +-  White wins a piece. } 23.
Nd7 Nf5
{ A natural, but wrong move.   23...Rbc8  This had to be played. After something like  24.Rb1  Bxf3  25.Rxb2  Black's position looks incredibly dangerous with all the weak dark squares around his king, but the computer claims he is alive. }
24. Nxb8 { The tactics will favor White. } 24... Nxe3 25. Rb1 Rxb8
{ 25...Rxd6 !  26.cxd6  Qxd6  Would have offered Black some drawing chances, but White is still for choice after  27.Rxb2  Qc5 !  An incredibly difficult move.  28.Nc6  Qc1+  29.Kf2  Qxb2+  30.Kxe3  Qc1+  31.Kf2  Bxc6  32.Bxc6  +=  Black might hold, and he might not. }
26. Rxb2 Bxf3 27. Qd4
{ A final touch seals a great game. Black is facing a disaster on the back rank.   27.Rxb8+ ?  The immediate capture on b8 is much less convincing.  27...Qxb8  28.gxf3  Qb1+  29.Kf2  Nf5  =∞  White's king will never find happiness. The knight on f5 is really good. }
27... Nd5 { 27...Rxb2  28.Rd8+  Qxd8  29.Qxd8+  Kg7  30.Qd4+  White wins. } 28.
Rxb8+ Qxb8 29. gxf3
{ As nice as Black's knight looks on d5, it's actually doing remarkably little, and White's king will always have a clear route to g3. The knight needed to go to f5, which Tomashevsky expertly prevented. Now the c-pawn cruises through. }

{ Up to here, Vidit has followed the repertoire. } 14. O-O
{ As long as White can secure his kingside, he should easily win the game on the queenside and in the center. Black is basically playing without a piece.   14.Kf1  I thought it was a little more natural to put the king on g2, but there is nothing wrong with Vidit's move. }

{ 28.Rd3  This looked more natural to me, but Vidit's move doesn't spoil anything.  28...Ba8  29.Qxe7  +-  Nice queen on g7. And White is a clean pawn up, with a second to follow on a7. }
