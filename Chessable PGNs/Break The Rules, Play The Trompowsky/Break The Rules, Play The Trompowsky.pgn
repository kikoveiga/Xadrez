{ There are two choices that you need to make if you want to be a successful 1.d4 player.   The biggest decision for you to make is which line to choose against the Grünfeld, Nimzo-Indian, Benoni and the King's-Indian defences, not to mention the Benko/Volga Gambit, Budapest, Tango etc.  Or maybe there is another option of getting lively positions allowing you to play aggressively for the full point?   That's what this repertoire is about. My name is Kamil Plichta, I am a FIDE Master from Poland and I invite you to study my repertoire. I've worked hard studying chess openings for more than four years and I have been a 1. d4 player myself for over 15 years.   The realisation I had after all that time is that players have better repertoires with Black than White.  The reason for this is that it's more likely to land in a difficult position playing Black, because White has the first move so he will guide us what type of game he wants. So everyone is prepared against 1. e4 or 1. d4, forcing us to break their well-built defences.  So I would suggest not being so cooperative and striking as soon as on move 2!  There are a few reasons why 2. Bg5, The Trompowsky, is no worse than 2. c4:  - Objectively there is no advantage for White in the Nimzo-Indian or Grünfeld. In my opinion, the same statement can be made with regard to the King's Indian. That means that 2. c4 doesn't guarantee that even if you play the best moves you will have any advantage whatsoever.  - 2. Bg5 is a pretty rare guest  (much more popular alternatives are the London)   2.Bf4   or  2.Nf3  lines in over the board play. This means your opponents will less often be prepared to face such an aggressive move as  2.Bg5   - Throughout the whole repertoire I worked with Stockfish. All lines that I offer are backed up by analysis with the strongest engine.  - You avoid tons of theory and save yourself a huge amount of time to spend on different chess-related stuff and areas of study, which is a big bonus!  Don't get me wrong: objectively speaking there is no advantage in The Trompowsky! However, what I can guarantee you is that you will get many positions with attacking chances, where the only side who will have a lot of fun is White.  I would never state that The Trompowsky is a move that forces Black to abandon  1...Nf6.  It's simply not true. With correct play Black will be able to reach positions which are close to being equal, but definitely no more than that.  And the path to a playable position is pretty narrow for our opponent. If you don't want to study novelties on move 20-25 trying to remember all the theory of the main lines  (not to mention hundreds of hours to do that)  (, then we probably speak the same language.  The same thinking process came to one of the greatest chess minds. My compatriot and one of the best polish players in history - Jan-Krzysztof Duda played The Trompowsky in every possible game during the World Blitz Championship 2018 and he took 2nd place)  (only half a point behind Carlsen and 2 points ahead of Nakamura!)  (. He has scored many crushing victories with The Trompowsky, even against 2700+ players    So, I wish you all as much fun learning my Trompowsky repertoire as I had making it.  Welcome to the Trompowsky World! You will not regret it.  FM Kamil Plichta, Koszalin 2019) }

{ My friendship with Kamil Plichta began many years ago. We had a lot of mutual friends and we spent a lot of time together at parties or playing soccer.  Back then I knew that he was a chess player on around the 2200 level.  But there was something intriguing about him, he was extremely passionate about chess. I noticed that he had a lot of chess books mainly focused on the theory. It was quite surprising for me that he was so passionate about chess.  When I had to face him over the board it was always a little bit unpleasant for me because I knew that he had an extensive base of theoretical knowledge and I had problems avoiding his preparation.  Fortunately, only a couple of our games are listed in the databases and the overall score is 2-1 for me. However, in reality there were many more games and some of them finished with very quick knockouts right out of the opening.  A few years ago Kamil started creating opening files. He sent a lot of those files to me and I started using them. If I had to use one word to describe them it would be definitely... sharp. A lot of those lines create problems for the opponent at the very beginning.  Of course, we have to remember that if your opponent is well prepared we are not going to get much in openings like the Trompowsky. But developments in theory have shown that even in main lines objectively Black is able to equalize.  The Trompowsky can be used as a very dangerous weapon to surprise the opponent. The lines given in this course are mostly very clear with simple instructions on what we have to do.  I would like to recommend this repertoire to all the players willing to extend their opening knowledge. I am sure many readers will benefit significantly as I did.

Instead of occupying the centre with pawns, we want to develop as fast as possible and start attacking Black's position. This weapon was championed by such players as Hodgson, Wells or Miladinovic. }
2... Ne4
{ We should consider this as a main move, because it is played most often. By playing 2... Ne4, Black avoids his pawns being doubled after the immediate 3. Bxf6 and asks us 'What are we going to do with the attacked Bishop ?' }
3. h4
{ And now the fun begins. This variation has the coolest name in chess - THE RAPTOR! After only three moves we have a very strange position. Both sides broke the basic chess rules - Black moved his Knight twice  (and he will move it a 3rd time for sure)  and White developed the Bishop before the Knights and also played a flank move with his h-pawn. However, this situation can be hugely advantageous for us, because many players on the Black side won't be familiar with many subtleties. You would think that by playing like this your opponent could use an engine to prepare against you and surely punish you for breaking the basic strategic rules. This is simply not the case. I checked all of my analysis with the modern engines, and none of them give an advantage for Black. You can be sure, that this is not a typical 'Play X and win' book with a lot of holes in the analysis. }
3... c5 { A critical try. The alternatives will be analysed later. } 4. d5
{ Of course we don't miss a chance to seize some space and offer a pawn or two for an attack.  4.dxc5  would be a very anti-positional continuation which we won't look at. }

We will retreat our Bishop to f4 and then proceed in a similar manner to positions without ... h7 - h6 included. Note that this kind of pawn move - ... h7 - h6 - can be a long term problem for Black, because he weakened his kingside. Remember: pawns can't move backwards and these small pawn moves are very often the reason why Kings get checkmated. Imagine Black's pawns on f7-g7-h7 and you can see that it is hard to come up with a quick answer which of the pawns will be a target in the future. With a pawn on h6, it is clear that it will be prone to attacks in the future and trust me, Black doesn't want to castle queenside. }
6. Bf4 Nxd2 7. Bxd2 Qxb2 8. e3
{ 8.e4  here is too loose because now Black will be able to play  8...Qf6  because the g5-square is now protected by the h-pawn.  Without the pawn on h6 we would be happy to play Bg5 or a combination of Bb5 followed by Ng5 at some point. Here we best continue to develop quickly before we proceed with central expansion. So, e3 is the preferred move because it lets our light squared bishop out. }
8... Qf6 9. Ne2
{ With Bc3 to come and once again a typical compensation. Note that the engines very often give 0.00 in these positions, but it only confirms, that White has full compensation for the b-pawn. In practice handling Black's position is extremely difficult and I would expect to see many mistakes here. }

It is obvious that  f2  is the correct answer, because our monarch is nicely covered by the wall of pawns.  Also  13.Kf2  is going to help with following of one of the basic middle game rules, which is to try to connect Rooks. We can see that Rooks are very often quite powerful in endgames and the reason for this is that when pieces have been traded they have more lines to work with. You probably know that Rooks are exceptionally powerful when both of them can reach the 7th 2nd for Black rank. The reason for this is that when they are connected, they will create multiple threats - especially against the opponent's King. }

Black can't easily castle while we have some decent plans at our disposal:   Firstly, we can think about Qa4 followed by Rb1 to provoke some weaknesses on the queenside.  Secondly, since there is no way to play Ng3 - e4 now, there is no point in keeping the Rook on the c-file. That means that Rb1 might also be a good option for White. }

He can never play ... d7 - d6, because the light squares will be weak - especially e6. Where are the queenside pieces going then ? Also our play is more than easy - go Ngf3 / Rb1 - b3 and develop the light-squared Bishop somewhere - then start creating threats. }

2... Ne4

3. h4
{ And now the fun begins. This variation has the coolest name in chess - THE RAPTOR! After only three moves we have a very strange position. Both sides broke the basic chess rules - Black moved his Knight twice  (and he will move it a 3rd time for sure)  and White developed the Bishop before the Knights and also played a flank move with his h-pawn. However, this situation can be hugely advantageous for us, because many players on the Black side won't be familiar with many subtleties. You would think that by playing like this your opponent could use an engine to prepare against you and surely punish you for breaking the basic strategic rules. This is simply not the case. I checked all of my analysis with the modern engines, and none of them give an advantage for Black. You can be sure, that this is not a typical 'Play X and win' book with a lot of holes in the analysis. }

However, this situation can be hugely advantageous for us, because many players on the Black side won't be familiar with many subtleties. You would think that by playing like this your opponent could use an engine to prepare against you and surely punish you for breaking the basic strategic rules. This is simply not the case.

7. Bf4 Bh7 8. e3 e6 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3
{ We can see that this position is close to equal, but when we think about it deeper, Black will face an unpleasant middlegame. We have a clear plan of castling long, and then we will launch a pawn storm on the kingside. }
10... c5 11. Ne2
{ I have found some discoveries in this line.   The first is that White can play  11.dxc5  Bxc5  12.Bxb8  and it looks like White wins a piece. In fact, the position ends in a perpetual after  12...Qa5+  13.c3  Rxb8  14.b4  and here Black saves himself with  14...Qb6  15.bxc5  Qb2  16.Qd1  Qxg2  17.Qa4+  Ke7  18.Qf4  Qxh1  19.Qd6+  Kf6  20.Qf4+  and Black has to accept the draw because after  20...Kg6  White has  21.Qg3+  Kh7  22.O-O-O  and the Black Queen is going to be trapped.   Also,  11...c4  has never been played which indicates that it may be an inaccuracy. I've checked the whole line with Stockfish and it gives the evaluation close to equal. I think it means that in practice White should be on top with possibilities of the kingside expansion. I'd play just  12.Qd2  Nc6  and now  13.g4  gaining space immediately. This position looks innocent but it may get very sharp due to the fact that both Kings don't have a safe shelter.  Summary: I'd say that 11. dxc5 is a nice try in rapid or blitz games but I think that 11...c4 shouldn't be feared and White has a good game. }
11... Nc6 12. Qb3 Qd7 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. O-O-O
{ With ideas such as e3 - e4 or g2 - g4 and an attack on the kingside. Note that if Black castles kingside our attack will be faster - especially because of the h6-weakness. }

4. Nd2 Bf5 5. Nxe4 Bxe4 6. f3 h6
{ Otherwise Black will be simply worse. If the Bishop goes to f5 or g6, it will be vulnerable to the g2 - g4 or h4 - h5 strikes, which will allow us to gain a tempo. }
7. Bf4 Bh7 8. e3 e6 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3
{ We can see that this position is close to equal, but when we think about it deeper, Black will face an unpleasant middlegame. We have a clear plan of castling long, and then we will launch a pawn storm on the kingside. }
10... c5 11. dxc5
{ I recommend taking a look at this line, because it is a great weapon for blitz or rapid games. It ends with a draw by repetition, but I still think it is interesting. In fact, we are playing without any risks of losing a game, and our opponent must avoid many pitfalls. }
11... Bxc5 12. Bxb8
{ Trap nr 1 - If Black captures on b8, we have Qb5+ winning. } 12... Qa5+

{ Black should take a draw, since the following move loses on the spot. } 20...
Kg6 { 20...Ke7  21.Qc7+  with a draw. } 21. Qg3+

8... h6 9. Bf4 c5 10. e4
{ A very powerful move. White opens up the centre and will castle long next. Black has to act very carefully to survive into the middlegame. }
10... dxe4

{ Definitely the main and the most solid alternative. Black fights for the centre striving for a calm and 'normal' position. }
4. Nd2 Nxg5 5. hxg5
{ We should stop here to understand what is going on. White's score from this position is huge  (almost 70% - that means that from every 100 games played, White got 70 points and Black got 30 points)  . So in practice it is much easier to play for White. We have a strong pawn on g5 which makes ... h7 - g6 / h5 almost impossible. And if Black castles kingside, we have a Rook on the open h-file. On the other hand our structure is slightly crippled and Black has a pair of bishops. That's the kind of imbalance I like to strive for from the beginning of the game to create as much complications as possible. }

4... g6
{ This is one of the moves that I've missed when creating the repertoire. Black doesn't want to enter sharp territories and tries to develop his pieces without any bigger ambitions. }
5. Nd2
{ An interesting option for White is  5.Bc1!?  which looks ridiculous,  but White wants to play h5 next and it is not so easy for Black to stop that.  After  5...h5  we might even play  6.Qd3!?  Nf6  7.Nc3  with a nice, attacking position.   5.Bc1  Nf6  stops our h-pawn march, but allows  6.Nc3  with good attacking potential. }

6. hxg5 Bg7 { 6...d6  7.c3  Bg7  just transposes. } 7. c3 d6 8. e4 h6
{ After moves such as 8... Nd7 or 8..a6 our plan remains the same.   If Black plays  8...Nd7  then we play  9...Ngf3  and Black sooner or later will need to move the h-pawn. kind of transposing to the main line   After  8...a6  we play  9.a4  which is our usual response to Black's ...b5 plan. }
9. Ngf3
{ Taking on h6 doesn't make any sense because we only ease Black's task. Here, if Black wants to release the tension he will be forced to activate our Knight with tempo. }
9... Nd7
{ This is the only move played in this position. It was played three times when this position has been reached. }
10. a4
{ I really like this move. Black doesn't have an easy way of completing the development so we just make a useful move. A2-a4 guarantees that Black won't be able to push ...b5 and also it wins the c4-square for our Knight. }
10... hxg5
{ This looks like the only sensible way for Black to try to finish development. }
11. Rxh8+ Bxh8 12. Nxg5 e6
{ 12... e5 leads to the same thing after 13. dxe6   while after  12...Bf6  we can bring our Queen closer to the kingside with  13.Qg4.  Note that  13...Ne5  isn't dangerous due to  14.Qg3  followed by f2-f4 with better chances for White. }
13. dxe6 Qxg5 14. exd7+ Bxd7 15. Nc4
{ and Black loses the d-pawn. Things are not completely clear so let's look at one possible scenario. }
15... Qe7 { After  15...Bc6  White can play either  16.Qxd6  or  16.Nxd6 } 16.
Qxd6
{ After  16.Nxd6+  Kf8  17.Bc4  Be8  18.Nxe8  Qxe4+  19.Qe2  Rxe8  20.Bb5  Qxe2+  21.Bxe2  it looks very equal but I think that White has winning chances.  Our Bishop will be better than Black's due to the b2-c3 barrier and we have a plan of putting our Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal followed by a well-timed a4-a5. Still, a draw would be the most probable result. }
16... Qxe4+ 17. Ne3 Qe5 18. Qxe5+ Bxe5 19. g3
{ We restrict Black's dark-squared Bishop even further. Note that if White is able to exchange light-squared Bishops then the Knight will be better than the Black Bishop. Still, White can't be better here but it is easier to play with White because we will just go Bb5 next. To sum up things in this variation I think that Black equalizes but he needs to find some difficult moves - 12... e6 and 15... Qe7. I think that both 16. Qxd6 and 16. Nxd6+ are interesting tries of equal value. Also, as usual, don't worry that you will ever reach this position in your games because it has never happened - at least my database 'says' so. }

{ This is the 4th most popular option, but I consider it to be the most aggressive. Black ignores an attack on the f6-knight and immediately counterattacks in the centre. It was also a recommendation of WGM/ IM Yelena Dembo in her great book 'Fighting Anti King's-Indians'. When I bought that book I immediately started playing all of the lines from it. Unfortunately, that book is from 2008 and in 2008 we didn't have Stockfish. White has some possibilities here, but I like to clarify the situation in the centre immediately. }
3. d5

If you want to look for an alternative to 3. d5 to broaden your repertoire, then 3. Bxf6 would be my suggestion. I also have huge experience in the 3. Nc3 line.

{ Rb1 followed by Nb5 was threatened so this is the only move. Black wasted 3 moves with his Queen to grab the b2-pawn. We have a very simple plan - push the central pawns as far as possible. We will probably win another tempo on Blacks Queen. Also our lead in development and space advantage will give us a long lasting initiative for a mere pawn. }
6. e4

{ This is the 4th most popular option, but I consider it to be the most aggressive. Black ignores an attack on the f6-knight and immediately counterattacks in the centre. It was also a recommendation of WGM/ IM Yelena Dembo in her great book 'Fighting Anti King's-Indians'. When I bought that book I immediately started playing all of the lines from it. Unfortunately, that book is from 2008 and in 2008 we didn't have Stockfish. White has some possibilities here, but I like to clarify the situation in the centre immediately. }
3. d5
{ I will just briefly mention the interesting alternatives to move 3. d5.3. Bxf6 is also a strong move and it was analysed by GM Kryakvin. If you want to look for an alternative to 3. d5 to broaden your repertoire, then 3. Bxf6 would be my suggestion. I also have huge experience in the 3. Nc3 line. However, that move leads nowhere after Black's strongest response 3... d5 as proposed by GM Boris Avrukh. }
3... Qb6
{ The most topical continuation. Black attacks the b2-pawn and we are obliged to sacrifice it  (If you thought about Bc1 for a second - shame on you !) }
4. Nc3 { This is called the Vaganian Gambit. } 4... Qxb2 5. Bd2 Qb6
{ Rb1 followed by Nb5 was threatened so this is the only move. Black wasted 3 moves with his Queen to grab the b2-pawn. We have a very simple plan - push the central pawns as far as possible. We will probably win another tempo on Blacks Queen. Also our lead in development and space advantage will give us a long lasting initiative for a mere pawn. }
6. e4
{ Now Black has two choices - he will either go 6... d6 or 6... e5. The current theory gives 6... d6 as dangerous for Black, while 6... e5 is known to be quite solid. I disagree. Black will have big problems after either move. }
6... e5 7. g4
{ I hesitated if to move the old lines - after both 7. f4 d6 8. f5 and 8. fxe5, but I find the text move to be so exceptionally strong, that it makes no sense to play anything else! We will use the lines from the 7. f4 d6 8. f5 variation, but without allowing 8... h5! here are the links to the old lines:  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3
  Line 4
  Line 5
  Line 6
  Line 7
  Line 8
  Going back to the text move, White plans to push g5 and f4 leaving Black no more than 2 ranks of space.   I will repeat that  7.f4  d6  8.f5  allowed  8...h5! }
7... g6
{ Before we analyse Black's only move 7... h6, I will show you how to punish this continuation. }
8. g5 Nh5 9. Be2 Nf4
{ 9...Ng7  10.h4  with h5 and Rb1 to come next and Black should be positionally busted. }
10. Rb1 { Only this move secures White a large advantage! } 10... Qd8
{ ... Qc7, ... Qd6 or ... Qa5 allowed Nb5 with Bxf4 to come next. } 11. Bxf4
exf4 12. d6
{ We managed to split Black's position in half. We don't have to do anything extraordinary in this position - just Nf3 and Qd2 and if Black plays ... Bg7, then Nd5. Objectively, Black is toast. }

{ A year ago, I hesitated if this position is better than the one where we took on e5. Nowadays, I think that this line with f5 is at least 10 times better than fxe5. Black has no space, and our position plays by itself - just go h4 and prepare g5 to gain even more space! }
9... g6
{ Firstly, we will analyse Black's options other than 9... Be7.   9...g5  10.Nh3!  White's plan is like this - play Nf2, a4, regroup the c3-Knight to c4 via d1 and e3, put the Rook on b1 and when everything is ready - play h4. }
10. h4

10. h4
{ Simple and strong. White needs to prepare g5, and our usual way of doing this is by playing Qf3 to defend the h1-Rook. }
10... Qd8
{ 10...h5  11.Rb1  leads to the game Prie - Tripoteau   10...Na6  11.Rb1  followed by Qf3 and g5.   10...a6  10.a4  Qd8  11.Qf3  in both cases with a great position for White. }
11. Qf3 Nh7
{ Played in all games that reached this position.   11...Nfd7  is interesting but has never been played. I think that it is fair to keep this line as the clickable variation. I suggest playing  12.g5!  hxg5  13.hxg5  Rxh1  14.Qxh1  Bxg5  15.Qh8+  Nf8  16.Qxg7  with a big advantage for White. }

13. Nf3 f6 { This move makes sure that Black won't be able to move anything. }
14. Be2
{ White should now abandon plans connected with g5, because it would exchange too much material. We can play Nh2 - f1 - e3 - c4 followed by a4, Rb1 and if Black doesn't play ... a6 - Nb5. Then everything will be ready for g5. If Black plays ... a6, we will push the a-pawn to a5 and put pressure on the b-file. In my opinion, White is winning. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 e6
{ This is the 2nd most popular move after 2... Ne4. Black wants to play 3... h6 forcing us to take on f6 - since the e4-pawn will not be defended after we play 3. e4 -  Black will recapture on f6 with the Queen gaining the Bishop pair without having a crippled pawn structure. On the other hand, we gain a lead in development which we should make use of as fast as possible. }
3. e4
{ White has some decent alternatives, but this move is in the spirit of the Trompowsky. We get a big centre and will try to squeeze Black. White can try two moves here: First one is 3. Nd2 which leads to more calm and steady positions. White will not be forced to take on f6 with his Bishop and can develop smoothly. Usually we want to go for e2 - e4 if Black gives us a chance. It would be interesting to have this move as a backup line. The second option here is to go 3. Nf3 which transposes to the Torre Attack. }

d6 8. a4
{ I believe that this is the most precise move order stopping the b7 - b5 pawn thrust.   Richard Pert, in his 'Attacking Repertoire: Playing the Trompokwsky' proposes  8.e5  , even giving this move two exclamation marks. It is a decent option, but in my opinion, it unnecessarily complicates matters. White is much better anyway, but let's see White's point here.  8...dxe5  9.Qe2  is Pert's idea  preparing O-O-O and g3, Bg2.  9...g6!  is a move that has never been played, but it is the strongest of Black's options.  10.Nxe5  Bg7  11.Nc4  O-O  12.Nb6  exd5!  13.Nxa8  Qd8.  Although White is objectively slightly better, this line unnecessarily complicates matters. }

{ This is the 3rd most popular move, but I consider it to be the most problematic for us. What do I mean by 'problematic'? It means that if we want to continue in the Trompowsky spirit, then we have to take on f6 at some point and after Black recaptures with ...gxf6 he will have a fair share of chances. The database games I found confirm this, with around 50% winning for either White and Black. On the other hand we will get positions that we should understand better than our opponent. The reason for this is simple - the position after Bxf6 will appear once every 150-200 games for our opponent, while for us it will be like once every 10-15 games. This should give us a nice practical advantage over our rivals. Also for a lot of people playing with a crippled structure from move 3 on is not ideal. }
3. Bxf6
{ 3. e3 sometimes transposes to the main lines, but I prefer the text move to limit Black's options. 3. Nf3 transposes to the Torre Attack and 3. Nc3 leads to the Veresov Opening.

{ This is the 3rd most popular move, but I consider it to be the most problematic for us. What do I mean by 'problematic'? It means that if we want to continue in the Trompowsky spirit, then we have to take on f6 at some point and after Black recaptures with ...gxf6 he will have a fair share of chances. The database games I found confirm this, with around 50% winning for either White and Black. On the other hand we will get positions that we should understand better than our opponent. The reason for this is simple - the position after Bxf6 will appear once every 150-200 games for our opponent, while for us it will be like once every 10-15 games. This should give us a nice practical advantage over our rivals. Also for a lot of people playing with a crippled structure from move 3 on is not ideal. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 d5 3. e3
{ I want to share a word or two about the alternative move order. White is not forced to play 3. Bxf6, although it should be our main option. However, if you like to keep your game as flexible as possible, here are some points of the 3. e3 move order. Firstly, PROS:  1. We avoid the 3... exf6 line. The reason for that is that 3. Bxf6 exf6 is a perfectly playable option - and for some people might be annoying.   If we start with  3.e3  and our opponent replies with  3...c5  , then we play  4.Bxf6  and here,  4...gxf6  is the best move for Black.  The reason for that can be seen in this line. Taking with the e-pawn combines pretty badly with ... d5, because the d5-pawn is left isolated.  2. We might provoke our opponent to play something passive like 3... Nbd7, and we will get a great Torre-like position after 4. Bd3.  Now CONS:  1. First, and the most important one is that after 3. e3 Black might play 3... Ne4 and after 4. h4 we are tricked from our Raptor move order - we play 2... Ne4 3. h4 d5 4. Nd2 - here, instead of Nd2 we have e3 played. However, things are still quite bright for us, because after 3. e3 Ne4, we might play 4. Bf4 and we avoided the ... c5 lines - the position after 4. Bf4 is considered to be good for White.  2. If Black avoids 3... c5, he might play 3... e6 and we are kicked from our repertoire vs 2... e6.  The choice is yours! I use both of these lines depending on my mood and I very often adjust to a certain opponent. }

1... hxg3
{ It looks like Black's attack on the kingside will be pretty dangerous, but we have a very efficient way of regrouping our pieces. The King will go to g2 and Rook to h1 with a better pawn structure for us. Please note that this plan is very efficient with Black's Queen on g5 or / and Black's Knight on g4. The reason for that is that Black's g6-pawn is blocked and can't move forward to g5 - g4 trapping our Bishop. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5
{ This move was popularized by the Brazilian chess player Octavio Trompowsky. White doesn't play 2. c4, but has other aggressive intentions. Instead of occupying the centre with pawns, we want to develop as fast as possible and start attacking the Black's position. This weapon was championed by such players as Hodgson, Wells or Miladinovic. }
2... Ne4
{ We should consider this as a main move, because it is played most often. By playing 2... Ne4, Black avoids his pawns being doubled after the immediate 3. Bxf6 and asks us 'What are we going to do with the attacked Bishop ?' }
3. h4
{ And now the fun begins. This variation has the coolest name in chess - THE RAPTOR! After only three moves we have a very strange position. Both sides broke the basic chess rules - Black moved his Knight twice  (and he will move it a 3rd time for sure)  and White developed the Bishop before the Knights and also played a flank move with his h-pawn. However, this situation can be hugely advantageous for us, because many players on the Black side won't be familiar with many subtleties. You would think that by playing like this your opponent could use an engine to prepare against you and surely punish you for breaking the basic strategic rules. This is simply not the case. I checked all of my analysis with the modern engines, and none of them give an advantage for Black. You can be sure, that this is not a typical 'Play X and win' book with a lot of holes in the analysis. }
3... c5 { A critical try. The alternatives will be analysed later. } 4. d5
{ Of course we don't miss a chance to seize some space and offer a pawn or two for an attack. 4. dxc5 would be a very anti-positional continuation which we won't look at. }
4... Qb6 5. Nd2

5... Nxg5 { A move which I always welcome with an internal smile. } 6. hxg5
Qxb2
{ Other moves don't make any sense. It is better to suffer with at least a full stomach. }
7. g6
{ Don't let engines fool you with any other suggestions. This move is the core of the 3. h4 line and should be played. Now we enter territory where Black really needs to know how to avoid getting decapitated. }
7... Qf6
{ This move is probably stronger than the text move and was also a suggestion of Alexei Kornev in his King's Indian and Pirc series of books. The reason why I give it as a side line is that it is played less often, so we will meet it less often than 7... fxg6. }
8. gxf7+
{ Of course not  8.Rxh7 ?  Rxh7  9.gxh7  Qh6  and Black is much better. He will remain a sound pawn up with a safe position. }
8... Qxf7 9. e4 e5
{ Actually closing the centre is not so bad for us. Taking into consideration that the 3rd rank is free from pawns, allowing us to play Ra1 - b1 - b3 before we decide where on the kingside to put the rook. }
10. Ngf3 d6 11. Bb5+ Bd7 12. Ng5
{ Usually when we manage to get our Knight to e6 we will have an amazing position. It will stay there forever, because Black's pawns can't disturb it. }
12... Qg6 13. Bxd7+ Nxd7 14. Ne6 Qxg2 15. Ke2
{ 15.Rf1  gives us an advantage, but the text move is even stronger. } 15...
Qg4+ 16. f3 Qg2+ 17. Kd3
{ Black gave us a few checks, but our King is quite safe on d3. We can't say the same for Black. His King is disturbed by the e6-Knight. }
17... Rb8 18. a4
{ We will follow up with Nc4 and it is hard to suggest a plan for Black. Our compensation for two pawns is beyond evident which the strong engines confirm. }

3. h4
{ And now the fun begins. This variation has the coolest name in chess - THE RAPTOR! After only three moves we have a very strange position. Both sides broke the basic chess rules - Black moved his Knight twice  (and he will move it a 3rd time for sure)  and White developed the Bishop before the Knights and also played a flank move with his h-pawn. However, this situation can be hugely advantageous for us, because many players on the Black side won't be familiar with many subtleties. You would think that by playing like this your opponent could use an engine to prepare against you and surely punish you for breaking the basic strategic rules. This is simply not the case. I checked all of my analysis with the modern engines, and none of them give an advantage for Black. You can be sure, that this is not a typical 'Play X and win' book with a lot of holes in the analysis. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 c5
{ This is the 4th most popular option, but I consider it to be the most aggressive. Black ignores an attack on the f6-knight and immediately counterattacks in the centre. It was also a recommendation of WGM/ IM Yelena Dembo in her great book 'Fighting Anti King's-Indians'. When I bought that book I immediately started playing all of the lines from it. Unfortunately, that book is from 2008 and in 2008 we didn't have Stockfish. White has some possibilities here, but I like to clarify the situation in the centre immediately. }
3. d5
{ I will just briefly mention the interesting alternatives to move 3. d5.3. Bxf6 is also a strong move and it was analysed by GM Kryakvin. If you want to look for an alternative to 3. d5 to broaden your repertoire, then 3. Bxf6 would be my suggestion. I also have huge experience in the 3. Nc3 line. However, that move leads nowhere after Black's strongest response 3... d5 as proposed by GM Boris Avrukh. }
3... Qb6
{ The most topical continuation. Black attacks the b2-pawn and we are obliged to sacrifice it  (If you thought about Bc1 for a second - shame on you !) }
4. Nc3 { This is called the Vaganian Gambit. } 4... Qxb2 5. Bd2 Qb6
{ Rb1 followed by Nb5 was threatened so this is the only move. Black wasted 3 moves with his Queen to grab the b2-pawn. We have a very simple plan - push the central pawns as far as possible. We will probably win another tempo on Blacks Queen. Also our lead in development and space advantage will give us a long lasting initiative for a mere pawn. }
6. e4
{ Now Black has two choices - he will either go 6... d6 or 6... e5. The current theory gives 6... d6 as dangerous for Black, while 6... e5 is known to be quite solid. I disagree. Black will have big problems after either move. }

31... Kf8 32. Re5 g6 33. Rxf5 gxf5 34. Nd7+
{ We win Blacks Rook and after that we will win the game. I would suggest not being intimidated by long lines like this one. You should never ever try to memorize all 34 moves of the line. I give such a long line to show you how good White's position is and my purpose is to help you build confidence playing this line. The most important thing is to try to understand all of the moves in the analysis I provided and try to remember only the most important parts of the theory. Ideas trump the memorization of variations - at least in the beginning of your adventure with a new opening. }

{ White has great compensation. Black lacks squares for his pieces. We should slowly prepare an assault on the whole board, but especially on the kingside. Our King is perfectly safe in the centre and the moves I would consider are Rg1 followed by a pawn storm on the kingside. If Black ever castles, his King won't be safe neither on the queenside nor on the kingside. Remember that the 3rd rank is available for our a1-Rook to transfer itself to the kingside. If we want to play for a longterm compensation, then we can just castle kingside, put the Knight on c4 and triple our heavy pieces on the queenside. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 e6
{ This is the 2nd most popular move after 2... Ne4. Black wants to play 3... h6 forcing us to take on f6 - since the e4-pawn will not be defended after we play 3. e4 - Black will recapture on f6 with the Queen gaining the bishop pair without having a crippled pawn structure. On the other hand , we gain a lead in development which we should make use of as fast as possible. }
3. e4
{ White has some decent alternatives, but this move is in the spirit of the Trompowsky. We get a big centre and will try to squeeze Black. White can try two moves here: First one is 3. Nd2 which leads to more calm and steady positions. White will not be forced to take on f6 with his Bishop and can develop smoothly. Usually we want to go for e2 - e4 if Black gives us a chance. It would be interesting to have this move as a backup line. The second option here is to go 3. Nf3 which transposes to the Torre Attack. }
3... h6 4. Bxf6
{ After any other move we wouuld lose the e4-pawn, but no worries - we will gain a huge lead in the development by giving up a the Bishop pair. }
4... Qxf6 5. c3
{ I like this modern move the most. We solidify the centre preparing to develop our Bishop to c4, Knight to e2 and then castle kingside with f2 - f4 to come. }
5... d6
{ This move is most popular. Black wants to play e6 - e5, g7 - g6 followed by Bg7 / O-O and Qe7 having a wonderful coordination of his forces. }
6. Bc4
{ The only move to pose any problems.  6.Bd3  was considered as good for White for a long time, but I think that after a forced sequence of moves we won't get anything  6...e5  7.Ne2  g6  8.O-O  Bg7  9.f4  Qe7  10.f5  O-O  11.Qb3  Kh7  12.fxg6+  fxg6  13.Rxf8  Bxf8  14.Na3  Nd7  15.Rf1  Richard Pert suggested that White has an edge here, but after the simple  15...Nf6  followed by  ...Bg7  we have no targets to hit and Black has the advantage of the Bishop pair. There is no way we are better and in fact we need to fight for an equality. }
6... Qg6
{ The most critical try. Black sees two weak spots in our position and attacks them. }
7. Qf3
{ The only decent move to defend both pawns. For the moment our coordination is not perfect, but in a few moves everything will be clear. }
7... e5 8. Ne2 Nd7 9. O-O Nf6 10. Nd2 Be7 11. Ng3 O-O 12. Rae1
{ An important resource. We need to use the queenside-Rook, because we will force f2 - f4 and we need the f-Rook where it is now. }
12... Bg4 { The only move to stop Qd1 stepping away from the attacks. } 13. Qd3
Nh5 14. Nxh5 Qxh5 15. f3
{ This is my improvement over the Kryakvin's analysis. We expel Blacks bishop first and only then will we strike with f4. }
15... Bd7 16. f4
{ We get a very promising position. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to Grandmaster Dmitry Kryakvin for his discovery - 6. Bc4 - and also to Grandmaster Loek Van Wely for their games in this line. This is the only situation where I used lines from another author - with my own commentary and some corrections of course. There is one simple reason for this - GM Kryakvin's line is practically the only try for an advantage in the 3. e4 variation and I'm glad that this line is playable for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 d5
{ This is the 3rd most popular move, but I consider it to be the most problematic for us. What do I mean by 'problematic'? It means that if we want to continue in the Trompowsky spirit, then we have to take on f6 at some point and after Black recaptures with ...gxf6 he will have a fair share of chances. The database games I found confirm this, with around 50% winning for either White and Black. On the other hand we will get positions that we should understand better than our opponent. The reason for this is simple - the position after Bxf6 will appear once every 150-200 games for our opponent, while for us it will be like once every 10-15 games. This should give us a nice practical advantage over our rivals. Also for a lot of people playing with a crippled structure from move 3 on is not ideal. }
3. Bxf6
{ 3. e3 sometimes transposes to the main lines, but I prefer the text move to limit Black's options. 3. Nf3 transposes to the Torre Attack and 3. Nc3 leads to the Veresov Opening. If you - dear reader - feel comfortable playing any of these openings, then it is always good to have those as backup lines. However, if we want to stay in Trompowsky territory, then taking on f6 is obligatory. }
3... gxf6
{ One of the basic chess rules tells us to capture towards the centre to increase our control over it. }
4. e3
{ This should give us more options of fighting for an advantage than 4. c4, which leads to quite dull and equal positions with one exception. There is one specific line after 4. c4 that is very interesting and I will give it to you as a secondary option. }
4... Bf5 5. c4 { Here it is logical to attack enemy's centre immediately. }
5... c6 6. Nc3 e6 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. Qxd3
{ Black doesn't have the Bishop pair anymore and our pawn structure is still better so it should guarantee an edge. If Black would be left with the Bishop pair, then he would have compensation for his structural weaknesses. }

One of the chess rules says that White/Black needs at least three pieces to proceed with a successful attack on the opponent's King. Also I'd like to mention that in the positions with the material imbalances, the Queen is often better than the Rook + the minor piece when it has many targets to hit. Here, there are too many weaknesses in Black's position to defend successfully. }

{ This is a quite an unclear and murky position. White has good knights and a better pawn structure + Black's pawn on f5 is weak, but on the other hand Black has the bishop pair. }
