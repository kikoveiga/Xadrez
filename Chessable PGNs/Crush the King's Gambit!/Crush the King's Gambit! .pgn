1. e4 e5 2. f4
{ The King's Gambit. White sacrifices a pawn, hoping to achieve more control of the center with d4 in the near future, as well as using the half open f-file to start an attack. If Black is not careful, after playing d4 and castling, White can frequently win the f4 pawn back, when he will likely have a very pleasant middlegame with his strong pawn center. So anyone who plays 1. e4 e5 as Black must take the King's Gambit seriously. Nevertheless, there are several drawbacks with 2. f4   1  White gave up a pawn. This is obvious but it needs to be said. If he fails to get it back and Black is able to consolidate, he will be worse the entire game. White might have a slight initiative due to having the first move, but if he cannot achieve anything tangible with it, giving up this pawn can easily backfire.   2  Weakening the a7-g1 and e1-h4 diagonals. This is also incredibly important. White is at risk of ...Qh4+ or other moves taking advantage of the exposed White king. In fact, there are many lines in this course with ...Qh4+, particularly when White doesn't bother playing 3. Nf3, in which ...Qh4+ is employed to prevent White from castling.   3  Black can use the extra pawn effectively in many cases. After taking the pawn, f4 is a weakness, but also a strength. If Black can play g5, then when White castles kingside Black can start a pawn storm over there. We will aim to do this at many points in this repertoire. Many of the lines presented here have barely been covered before and are unexplored territory. This will be a practical weapon when employing these lines. In many positions, White will only have one move that keeps him in the game, while plenty of other natural ones will lose. Not only can we be confident with having a better game, but White needs to be careful just to reach a playable position. }
2... exf4
{ Black accepts the gambit, and immediately the threat is to play ...Qh4+, which restricts White's options. White has generally continued with 3. Nf3, preventing ...Qh4+, however, 3. Bc4 and a couple other moves allowing ...Qh4+ have also been tried. The sidelines we will be analyzed in the theory section. }
3. Nf3
{ This is officially called the King's Knight Gambit, as opposed to the King's Bishop Gambit and appears to be the most logical attempt by White to play this. He prevents Qh4 and prepares to play d4 and Bxf4. The main line runs 3... g5 and Black should be able to keep his pawn and the advantage. However, I prefer to avoid theory, so I am going to recommend a lesser known and safer line for Black. }
3... Nf6
{ At first sight the move might strike as a little odd. However, should White chose to advance with 4. e5 then 4....Nh5 will keep the kingside under control. And defending the pawn with 4. Nc3 will be met with ...d5. In both cases Black will aim to develop quickly and open the position for his pieces. The positions are different from standard King's Gambit positions where White can build up his position while Black is clueless what to do. Previously Black generally played 3... ...g5 to keep the pawn, but I believe that playing this so early is too committing. It can be weakening and White has been shown to have plenty of compensation there after 4. h4. }
4. e5
{ By far the most popular, played about twice as often as 4. Nc3. This is the natural move for a King's Gambit player, who wants to use his pawn on e5 to limit Black's active piece potential and start his own attack. Other 4th moves will be covered in the theory section and allow Black to play ...d5 with excellent center control and White will be fighting to win back the sacrificed pawn. }
4... Nh5
{ The knight defends f4, and is not in the way of Black's other pieces. It might also be supported by ...g6. This will be analyzed in more detail in the theory section. }

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4
{ This move allows White to vacate the king to f1 should Black play ♕h4+. The king on f1 is relatively safe and White would kick the queen with tempo with ♘f3 on the next move. This line is known as the King's Bishop Gambit, and is statistically White's best approach against the King's Gambit accepted, scoring a respectable 52.9%. In the spirit of remaining flexible, I'm going to recommend 3... ♘c6, which develops a piece and avoids committing Black's kingside too early  (he might play ...g5, the knight could go to f6 or e7, so it is the most flexible)  . It should be noted that 3...♕h4+, the move that White wants Black to play, still might Black an objective advantage, though he has struggled to prove it in practice as White will always get a significant lead in development. 3...♘c6 is an extremely rare sideline as well, which makes it a practical and objectively strong weapon. }
3... Nc6
{ 3... ♘c6 is the most flexible move, not yet committing to ...g5 or ...d5. 3... d5 is an easy equalizer, giving back the pawn, but Black is playing for more. The point is to provoke ♘f3 before playing ...g5 as White won't be able to play ♕h5 and Black will often have the idea of playing ...g4 with tempo. If White plays ♘f3, Black will follow up with ...g5. If White delays ♘f3, then Black will play in the center with ...♘f6 and ...d5. There will be more detailed analysis in the theory section. }

{ This is the simple option to a much better endgame. For those hoping for a more dynamic middlegame, 6... Qh4+ is just as strong and also gives Black a great game. In this queenless middlegame, White will win the f4 pawn back, but Black will target the weak e5, and it seems really hard for White to defend that in the long term. White has no compensation for his weak pawn on e5 and will likely be stuck a pawn down in a few moves. }

{ Otherwise White should just be down a pawn. White will be able to take on e4 and equalize the material count, but his position has suffered from doing this. The Qe2 blocks development, and following castling and a future Re8 the queen and the king being lined up on the e-file has to hurt White. }

{ Perhaps this aims for an attack on the h5 knight after moving the Nf3, but White more likely just wants to castle quickly and then start thinking about the middlegame. }
6... g5
{ Black is fine giving back his pawn if he gets a better position and can take the initiative. In addition,.White must be on the lookout for g4 and Rg8, whenh his own king could easily fall under attack. }
7. O-O
{ Castling into an attack, but there wasn't really another good choice. 7. c4 transposes to the 6. c4 g5 7. Be2 line. }
7... Rg8
{ Taking on g5 can now never be played. Black is behind in development but it doesn't seem like much fun playing White. White's king is just asking to be attacked. }
8. c4
{ This is pretty natural, trying to take advantage of Black's lack of development, but White isn't able to coordinate his pieces quickly enough to threaten Black.  Other moves would allow Black to do virtually anything as they would put no pressure on him. }
8... dxc4
{ While this move allows White to active his bishop, it clears the d file for Black so that when he plays ...Nc6 he will be threatening to play ...g4, attacking a defender of d4. }
9. Bxc4
{ Not taking would not help White, for instance   9.Ne1  Ng7  10.Bxc4  Nc6  Or   9.Nc3  g4  10.Ne1  Nc6 }
9... Nc6
{ With the tactical idea that   10.d5  g4  would be losing on the spot for White. Now White needs to deal with  the serious threat of ...g4, winning the d4 pawn. }
10. Bb5

10... a6 { Black encourages the trade. } 11. Bxc6+ bxc6
{ Now all Black has to do is find a way to castle queenside safely  (perhaps with Be6 or f5 followed by moving the queen)  . White can't create threats quickly enough to counter this. Rg6 is also a standard move that Black should play soon. The knight on h5 can be relocated through g7 to f5. A possible line of play would be:   12.Nc3  Be6  13.Ne4  Be7  14.Kh1  g4 !  15.Ng1  f3 !  16.gxf3  Qd7 }

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Nc6
{ 3... Nc6 is the most flexible move, not yet committing to ...g5 or ...d5. 3... d5 is an easy equalizer, giving back the pawn, but Black is playing for more. The point is to provoke Nf3 before playing ...g5 as White won't be able to play Qh5 and Black will often have the idea of playing ...g4 with tempo. }
4. d4
{ The engine is in favor of this approach, which attacks f4 immediately and forces Black to do something about it, lest he lose the pawn back and leave White with a strong pawn center. }
4... Nf6
{ Black attacks the e4-pawn and both ways of defending the pawn have problems for White. }
5. e5
{ This must be the more concerning move for people when facing this. However, it should be recognized as a general pattern with the position of White's bishop, d5 is strong. }
5... d5
{ This gains a move, and in addition to this accelerates Black's development. Black already seems to me to be a lot better, though White will win the f4 pawn back, Black will be more actively played in the middlegame. }
6. Be2
{ This might look odd but White is threatening Bxf4 and the bishop on e2 helps defend. }
6... Ne4 { Black centralizes and threatens ...Qh4+. } 7. Bxf4
{ White regains the sacrificed pawn, but White isn't the one with the initiative. Black is the one with the initiative due to the weakened e1-h4 diagonal, one of the main consequences of White having played 2. f4. White's one advantage in this position is his strong e5 pawn, but even this will disappear after Black plays ...f6. }
7... f6
{ It should be noted that playing more boring with 7... Bf5 and then castling either side is also totally acceptable, though I like this direct approach more. }
8. Nf3 { White tries to take on e5 with pieces. } 8... fxe5 9. Nxe5
{ 9.dxe5  Bc5  would be pretty disastrous.  As would   9.Bxe5  Nxe5 } 9... Nxe5
10. Bxe5
{ White might hope that his Be5 prevents Black from developing his dark squared bishop, but he is wrong.   10.dxe5  Bc5  again exploits the weak a7-g1 diagonal. }
10... Bb4+ { An important move, preparing the following sequence. } 11. c3 O-O
{ The point ! This might be defensible for White, but Black will be pushing and White will be the one that needs to be cautious. For now, the immediate threats of Nf2 and Qh4 do not allow White to take the Bb4. }
12. Bf3
{ The only move to avoid losing. White blocks the f file and hopes to be able to castle.   12.cxb4 ?  Nf2 }
12... Qh4+
{ Black is the one with the initiative in this line, not settling for a slight advantage after the alternative 12... Bd6. }
13. g3 Qh3
{ Black has a huge initiative. White is forced to accept the piece sacrifice, but even then he faces a difficult defense. }
14. cxb4

{ Black again pins the knight and threatens to win it, in addition to Qg2 ideas. White can try to defend with 17. Rf1 or 17. Qb3. }
17. Qb3
{ This is a clever defense. By attacking d5 White forces Black to take a move to defend it, giving time for him to play Rf1 and escape the pin. }
17... c6
{ 17...Bxf3  18.Qxd5+  would still favor Black, but is not winning  Now by defending f3 the knight is threatened once again. }
18. Rf1
{ The only move.   18.Bf4  Rxf4  19.gxf4  Bxf3  gives Black two minor pieces for the rook }
18... Rxf3 19. Rxf3 Qg2
{ Black is currently down a rook and an exchange, but he will win all of the material back. }
20. O-O-O Bxf3
{ White is up an exchange for the moment, but he has no way of saving his rook on d1, and the resulting endgames will favour Black due to the better pawn structure and better minor piece.   21.Rd3 ?  Qf1+  wins.   21.Re1 ?  Qd2+ }

6. Ne2
{ A very tricky move. It appears that Black can take e4, and indeed he can, but after 6... Nxe4 7. O-O White has compensation and a huge lead in development. Instead, Black should give back his extra pawn favorably and blast open the center. }
6... f3
{ Black was going to lose the f4-pawn anyways, so he gives it up to damage White's pawn structure. The Chessable course 'The Systematic Kings Gambit' recommends that White go for this variation and fails to give a drillable recommendation in response to 6...f3 because the author decided that ...f3 wasn't common enough to merit a drillable variation, despite admitting that Black is objectively better.    6...g5 ?!  is passive and White will have a sufficient initiative for the sacrificed pawn after  7.a3  , though Black won't be able to support the f4-pawn after  7.h4  , so the idea behind  ...g5  doesn't work. }
7. gxf3
{ White has no other choice. He must accept his fate, or the King's Gambit's fate, which are essentially one and the same. }
7... d5
{ Structurally, White really doesn't want to take this, as f3-pawn will be isolated and won't make sense as it will no longer be supporting the center. However, White doesn't really have another choice. Thus we force White to be miserable, even if equal in material. }
8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O
{ White unpins his Nc3 and gets ready play Ne4 perhaps. But White's kingside is horribly weak and the lack of a g-pawn just asks for him to be attacked. }
9... Nxc3 10. bxc3 Bd6 11. Ng3 O-O
{ In addition to an engine advantage of around half a pawn, Black has scored 70% from this position and has lost no games. Qh4 is probably Black's next move, just being as annoying as possible. The absence of White's g pawn will cause him trouble in this middlegame. }

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g5
{ This game was played between Patrick Bensch  (2190)  and Tanguy Ringoir  (2507)  in 2015. }
5. d4
{ 5.O-O  is the move covered in our repertoire. Generally White gains nothing from playing  d4  early so a transposition almost always occurs after White castles in the next few moves. }
5... Bg7 6. c3
{ White is afraid of Black playing ...g4 and if the Nf3 moves, Black will be attacking the d4 pawn. However, he should ignore this threat for now.   6.h4  h6  7.c3  d6  This is a direct transposition to the main line with 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nf3 g5. }
6... d6
{ Black is following the general plan in this position: Play ...Bg7, ...d6, and ...h6, after which he will have fully consolidated his extra pawn and can think about how to develop his remaining pieces and what side to castle on. }
7. O-O { White does not have any way of gaining anything from delaying this. }
7... h6
{ Following this we transpose back to the reperotire, where 8. h4, 8. g3, and 8. Qa4 are covered. }
8. g3
{ This is probably the weakest of the three options listed above. White voluntarily weakens his own king, just in the hopes of opening the f- file for an attack on f7. If he is unsucessful with his ideas, his king will lose its pawn cover for no compensation and Black will be able to attack it with both pieces and pawn storms. In addition to this, the immediate issue, is that White gives up control of h3, which Black can immediately exploit. }
8... Bh3
{ Black generally has trouble deciding where to develop this bishop, but with White's last move he made it very easy for Black. White's light squares around his king are extremely weak and he has obtained nothing for it. }
9. Rf2
{ 9. Re1 and 9. gxf4 are both covered in the 3. Bc4 theory section. This move appears to be less challenging, as White does not have any threats and the rook on f2 can be attacked if a knight gets to e4 or g4. }
9... Nf6
{ Black develops his last minor piece and immediately eyes e4 and g4. White is down a pawn, has a weaker king, and is behind in development. Thus his position goes down in flames quickly. }
10. Qd3
{ White had to defend e4, as Black was threatening to play ...Nxe4 and defend the knight with either ...d5 or ...f5.   10.gxf4  This move, voluntarily giving up the e4 pawn, has been played in the majority of the games here, but White doesn't manage to get any real pressure on the pinned knight.  Nxe4  11.Re2  White pins the knight. However, this undefends the f3 knight, which could easily be a tactical problem if Black can get a queen or bishop to g4.   11.Qe1  This might be a better way of pinning the knight, but White still will not be able to win it.  d5  12.Nbd2  White tries to be tricky.   12.Bd3  Qe7  As oppossed to 12. Nbd2, White has given up control of d5 so Black can move his queen to end the pin. White is hopelessly lost as after Black castles queenside his king will fall under a crushing attack thanks to his weakening moves.  12...f5  In Stonewall fashion, Black keeps his strong knight on e4. Now after playing ...Qd6 or ...Qd7 and castling queenside Black will unleash a pawn storm and play for a crushing attack on White's king. White cannot do much about this since he is less developed and has less space. }
10... Qd7
{ Black still maintains a big advantage after this move, but he could have gotten a winning position with 10... fxg3.   10...fxg3  Black simply opens up the position of White's king more.  11.hxg3  Black can aim for ..h5-h4 in the long term, and all he needs to do before that is castle.  Qe7  With ...O-O-O and a direct attack. Black is winning. }
11. d5
{ White blunders in return. To have a chance to stay in the game, he had to exploit Black's error in not taking on g3 and play 11. gxf4.   11.gxf4 !  This is certainly not a move one wants to play, opening their king, but White's pawn shield was going to be ruined, and at least he wins a pawn this way. Nevertheless, White is still miles behind in development and is still close to lose.  O-O-O  12.d5  With e5 covered, unlike in the game, Black will be forced to retreat.  Nb8  13.Kh1  White prevents a potential ...Qg4 from being with tempo.  Rde8  Black's lead in development and better pieces give him a borderline winning position. He can continue with ...gxf4  (opening the g file and makign White's king position more dangerous)  , Nh5  (activating both the knight and the g7 bishop)  and bring his pieces to the kingside. }
11... Ne5
{ 11. d5 ? gave up the critical e5 square, and Black is happy to trade off one of White's few defenders of his king. }
12. Nxe5 dxe5 13. Nd2
{ White tries to quickly develop before it is too late, and rush another knight to f3 to defend his king. }
13... O-O
{ Castling queenside also worked.   13...O-O-O  This was another good alternative, either way Black will have a winning attack. }
14. Nf3 fxg3 15. hxg3 Qg4
{ At this point Black has many alternative wins. White's position is so passive that Black can play in practically any way he wishes, and still have a winning position.   15...Ng4  16.Re2  Qd6  This, preparing ... f5, was another strong way of proceeding. }
16. Nxe5 { White defends g3 by taking this pawn. } 16... Qxe4
{ Black still remains up a pawn and his pieces are much more active. White cannot even exchange on e4 at the moment as that would lose even more material. White's queenside is still out of play at the moment. }
17. Re2 Qxd3 18. Nxd3 Rfd8
{ Black will win the d5 pawn and White cannot do anything about it. The rest of the game is just a mop up by Ringoir, who easily converts his winning advantage. }
19. Nf2 Bf5 20. Re7 Nxd5 21. Bxd5 Rxd5 22. Rxc7 b6 23. Be3 Re8 24. c4 Rd7 25.
Rxd7 Bxd7 26. Rd1 Ba4

6. Bb5
{ 6.exf6 ?  White cannot allow Black to take his light squared bishop.  dxc4  Black attacks d4 and f6. Black is likely to win another pawn and his much better pawn strucuture gives him a safer king. White's king is already a target.  7.d5   7.Qe2+  White checks and tries to pin down one of Black's pieces. The queen can also come to defense in case of a future ...Qh4+.  Be6  Black is not bothered by putting his bishop here. He is ready to move his queen and castle queenside, and attack White's weak king.  8.fxg7  Bxg7  9.c3  White is hoping to take on f4 and hold everything together, however, Black will not allow White to do that.  Bxd4 !  A shot from the blue. Black takes White's seemingly defended pawn and White will be at least one pawn down in the ensuing middlegame, in addition to having the more vulnerable king.  10.cxd4  Against other moves Black can play Bb6 and White's king will never leave the center.  Nxd4  Black has 3 pawns for the piece, so he is not even behind in material, but he is going for higher stakes. White's king remains in the center and none of his pieces are developed. This should not survive according to standard chess principles.  11.Qf2  White has to defend c2 as well as prevent Qh4+ from being deadly. Only Qf2 and Qe4 do this.   11.Qe4  This centralizes White's queen but also makes it more vulnerable to attack.  Qf6  Black is ready to castle queenside and attack with all of his pieces.  12.Bxf4   12.Qxf4  This undefends c2 so Black can win with  Nc2+  Followed by either trading queens or Qg6, and taking the rook on a1.   12.Qxb7  White grabs a pawn, at the expense of development and his king.  Qe5+  Black will play ... Bd5 next, defending his rook and all his pieces will be attack and White is busted.  12...O-O-O  Black has ideas of Nc2+, Rhe8, and so forth. He is down a piece but White's pieces aren't really do anything so it is not something to be afraid of. The only critical line is  13.Be5  But Black can deflect the queen from the bishop's defense.  Nc2+  14.Qxc2   14.Ke2  Qg5  And White cannot take the rook on h8.  14...Qxe5+  White still cannot get his king to safety.  15.Ne2  Rhg8  -+  Black's initiative is winning as White cannot find a way to get his king to safety. His king is way too open. }

12. Ndf3 { Otherwise h4 would be much stronger. } 12... h4
{ In the theory section I suggest 12... Bg4 as a slight improvment. However, Black is winning with this as well.   12...Bg4  -+ }
13. Bf4
{ Taking the pawn would make it more difficult to trap the queen.   13.Bxh4  Bg4  Black forces a queen trade after taking on f3 next turn, as the bishop on h4 is hanging and White must retreat it.   13.Nxh4  Rxh4  14.Bxh4  Qxh2+  Black wins the bishop on h4. }
13... h3 { Black threatens to liberate the queen with Qg2+. } 14. Bf1

{ White defends against Bh4+ by making it possible to take the bishop on h4. }
15... Rh5
{ Not necessary, but Black was so winning that even this is fine. He wants to push the g pawn down the board immediately.   15...Bf5  Followed by ...O-O-O and Be4 was more direct. }
16. e6
{ White gives up the e6 pawn for no good reason, however, he was completely lost anyways. }
