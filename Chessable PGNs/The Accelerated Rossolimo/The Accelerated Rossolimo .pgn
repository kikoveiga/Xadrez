{[%evp 0,3,16,28,46,12]} 1. e4 c5 2. f4 {Before you dive deep in this work, I
think you would be interested and would benefit a lot from reading some
background information about this variation, as well as the reasons why I
chose exactly this line as my suggestion against the Sicilian for White.
Obviously, it is not possible to find an advantage in any Sicilian, including
the Open Sicilian. Sure, some lines such as the Sveshnikov and the Najdorf are
more sound for Black, while some, such as the Dragon and the Paulsen, are less
sound. However, even in those less sound variations, it will take you hundreds
of hours of work to find any advantage, and you will need to memorize a lot.So,
if the main lines don't give an edge, does it make sense to even study them ?
In a way, yes, because they teach us to play chess the right way. What I did
not want to do in this course at all was to provide you with some tricky line,
full of traps, which would be unsound objectively. We do want to play chess
the right way !Therefore, I was looking at a line to recommend that would have
a healthy mix of the right, objectively sound way of playing chess as well as
a decent, adequate amount of variations to look at. After all, you've also got
to work on the middlegame, solve tactics, study masters' games and brush up on
your endgame technique. Remember, please, the opening is not the only thing
out there !Many variations crossed my mind. Alapin ? Maybe. But it felt like
there are too many lines. Also, playing only the positions with an isolated
pawn will result in a loss of some creativity: you need to be exposed to more
typical positions.The next thought I had for a long time was the Grand Prix,
but I was not specifically happy about a few lines, where the knight,
developed on move 2 with 2. Nc3, gets attacked. The move 2. f4, on the other
hand, grabs a lot of space in the center and on the kingside and prepares the
development of our pieces. The only reason why people don't use it more
frequently is 2... d5, but I have found a very interesting setup there, which
leads to complex positional play as opposed to those main variations where
Black is sacrificing a pawn to have a lot of fun. I have mentioned those as an
alternative in the corresponding chapter, though.I believe that the move f4
has a lot of logic behind it, and one significant advantage we get compared
with the Grand Prix is the fact that 1 our knight can go elsewhere, besides c3;
and 2 we can place our pawn on c3 in many cases ! I hope that this variation,
which has a great balance of tactical traps and sharp lines as well as
positionally complex and intriguing positions, will not only serve you well
but also will make you a better player overall !I would also like to mention
that I have consulted several reputable sources and either extended a lot the
analysis of those authors or refuted them completely. For example, such
sources include the book of Kotronias, GM repertoire 6A - Anti-Sicilians 
(Quality Chess, 2015) . He does not consider our strong move on move 8 at all,
and the arising positions are super sharp ! Another source would be Alex
Colovic's Chessable repertoire on the Anti-Sicilians (Chessable, 2020) , and
he's got 6 moves covered only, while Black needs to know at least 15! Besides
that, I have also consulted the MegaBase, the Correspondence Base, have used
Stockfish, Lc0 and some other powerful engines, my chess understanding, as
well as some improvements that came from practicing those lines against my
friends, mostly GMs. I would also like to say a few words about the way I have
used visual cues, namely arrows and circles, in this course. I have mostly
utilized the green colour for good things in the position - such as good
pieces, outposts we can use, etc. Instead, the red colour symbolizes problems:
weak pawns, pieces that lack good squares or are stuck on the first rank, and
so on. The blue arrows demonstrate our plans and intentions, while the yellow
ones usually show some alternative plans. 2.Nc3 I would like to demonstrate
where the c3-knight proves misplaced. 2...e6 ! 2...g6 ! This is another
problem. Here White wishes his pawn could go to c3, restricting the beast on
g7 over the long diagonal. Unfortunately, he has already committed his knight,
so his options are limited. 3.f4 d5 4.Nf3 And now several moves give Black a
great position, 4...dxe4 ! being the simplest one. Our move order, instead,
allows for a more useful move than 4. Nc3, and we get a lovely position in the
corresponding chapters - check them out yourself !} d5 {This precise dynamic
move is the reason why 2. f4 is not as popular as some other sidelines in the
Sicilian. Obviously, we gain a lot with 2. f4 compared with 2. Nc3 - the Grand
Prix Attack - namely, we save a tempo by keeping the knight on b1, and often
we get additional ideas, such as to play c2-c3 or to develop the knight to
other squares. However, everything has its price, and the price we are paying
is insufficient control over the d5-square. Thus, it is very logical for Black
to counterattack us in the center. Fortunately, I don't think that most club
players, and even most untitled opponents of yours will go for this move,
especially because it involves a pawn sacrifice: after 3. exd5 Black should go
3... Nf6 !, offering White to hold on to this extra pawn. I believe that there
are ideas for White in the lines where he tries to hold on to the pawn, but I
think that it makes even more sense to rather aim for a complicated equal
position that we reach with a different move.} (2... e6 3. Nf3 {Now the very
main move we are discussing in several chapters is ...d7-d5, but the logical
question appears: what if Black stops this idea of Bb5+ with ... a7-a6 ? Well,
now we know the answer - just study this chapter carefully !} d5 {Black tries
to counter-attack in the center, which makes sense and goes along with the old
classic piece of advice, which recommends to meet flank actions with
counterplay in the center.} (3... Nc6 {Just as ...Nc6 on move 4, this move
invites White to go Bb5 and take on c6. Of course, we thankfully accept the
invitation. Let us see what kind of defenses and ideas Black has at his
disposal.} 4. Bb5 a6 {This makes no sense as it simply lets us execute our
threat. Besides that, Black also loses a tempo.} (4... Nge7 {This is the most
popular answer and for a good reason - Black stops our positional threat.
However, now it is not easy for him to develop the kingside pieces, so let's
see how we will benefit from this slightly inconvenient position of his pieces.
This is the most popular answer and for a good reason - Black stops our

at a crossroads - Black normally either chases the bishop away with ...a7-a6,
or goes 5... g6 to fianchetto his bishop and castle as quickly as he can.} g6 (
5... a6 6. Be2 {At this point, it makes no sense to take on c6, so we just
retreat. While it may look as though we lost time, our bishop maneuvre from f1
to b5 and back to e2 actually forced Black to develop his knight to e7, which
is not something he would want to do, normally.} d5 {Black could also play 6...
g6, but it's very similar to 5... g6 - please, study the annotations to that
move.} 7. d3 g6 8. c3 {It may look as if our setup was modest, but things are
not as simple. However, we have stabilized the situation in the center and now
we are ready to shift our effort towards the kingside - Be3, Nbd2, Qe1-h4 are
all very natural and strong moves we will follow up with.} Bg7 9. Be3 d4 10.

time-consuming, as after} (11. Nbd2 {Fortunately, we have a tactical
justification for this move - the c3-pawn is not hanging !} dxc3 (11... e5 12.

14. Nf3 Bg7 15. cxd4 cxd4 16. Qd2 {I cannot say that White has a huge
advantage or anything; objectively, the position should remain balanced.
However, I feel that it should be easier to have White here because of a few
factors: 1 the d4-pawn is somewhat weak, it cannot be protected by other pawns;
2 the g7-bishop is rather passive; 3 there is no clear plan. Black should
simply develop, so will we. For example, a few reasonable maneuvres are Bd1-b3
to improve the light-squared bishop; Rc1 to double up on the open c-file;
possibly, it could make sense to go a2-a3 and b2-b4 to grab some space on the
queenside. Obviously, we need to be honest with ourselves - we cannot always
be better, especially if we don't go for the main lines. However, the arising
position is very rich and interesting, and Black hasn't ever arrived here yet,
so apparently his path and play are not that straightforward. 2...e6,B-4...

d3-d4. Another good plan could be to go Nc4 in order to use the weak squares
on b6 and d6 - as you can imagine, if the White knight ever comes to either of
those squares, Black would have very little fun ! 2...e6,B-4...Nge7 with a7-a6}

deal with this conflict. 2...e6,B-4...Nge7 with a7-a6}) 6. c3 {Of course, if
we have a chance to get the center, we will do that.} Bg7 7. d4 {Be attentive,
as this is a pawn sacrifice !} cxd4 {In the only game that reached this
position this move was played, however, I believe that Black does not gain
anything from taking on d4 early. Instead, he allows for additional
possibilities such as Nc3, which was not possible when the pawn was on c3. In

the c3-square is out of reach, so we develop the knight elsewhere. The threat
is Nc4 !, breaking the pin over the g1-a7 diagonal, so Black has to take.} cxd4
9. Nc4 {Black cannot take the b5-bishop because of the fork Nd6.} Qc7 10. e5 {
Again, this powerful move shapes our advantage. Obviously, Black cannot allow
Nd6+, so he has no time to take on c3 - castling is a must.} O-O 11. cxd4 a6 {
At least, Black is forcing us to trade the bishop.} 12. Bxc6 {Other captures
by Black lead to the same kind of problems.} Qxc6 13. Nd6 {The knight on d6 is
incredibly strong. Our next moves are very simple, too - Bd2 and Rc1, putting
even more pressure on the queenside. I feel that the White d6-knight is
cutting the position into two halves, and White is able to choose where to
play - whether to concentrate on the queenside play with moves like Qd1-b3,
a2-a4 etc, or to go Qd1-e1-h4, Nf3-g5, g2-g4 with the initiative on the
kingside. Either way, we are firmly in the driver's seat, while Black is
struggling. 2...e6,B-4...Nge7 with g7-g6}) 8. cxd4 Qb6 9. Nc3 Nxd4 10. Be3

times, which accelerated our development a lot. Now, he has to make a choice
where to go.} Qd8 (11... Qa5 {This is not an obvious move, my instinct would
rather be to go to c7 or d8, hiding 'back at home'. However, those moves are

out, our next moves will be Rad1, Rd3, Ne4, Nd6 and so on - the rope around
Black's neck is getting rather tight. 2...e6,B-4...Nge7 with g7-g6}) 12. f5 {

coordinate his pieces and castle. 2...e6,B-4...Nge7 with g7-g6}) 14. Qxd8+ Kxd8

Grand Prix and Closed Sicilian or whatever. But, I think, there is a piece of
good news for us to compensate for the fact that this position is not similar
to what we are normally getting in other variations in this repertoire. Namely,
Black wasted a move on ...a7-a6 ! I know you might say this move supported ...
b7-b5, but I don't think it's a good plan, especially when the White knight is
not on c3. Just to draw a comparison: there is a variation 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 a6
3. g3 b5, which is considered risky, but decent. However, in that variation,
White already committed his knight to the c3-square, making it possible for
Black to attack it with ... b5-b4 at some point and losing the plan of c2-c3
at some point, or the idea to develop the knight to d2. So, it's clear that
with this move order, we have benefited a lot. Surprisingly, we have reached
another new position - no games in there ! So, I will just give you a sample
line to show how we develop.} dxe4 {These endgames are discussed via 3... d5

attack on the kingside. I believe that the fact that the Black knights are
both far away for the kingside is something extremely alarming for Black: who
is going to protect this king ? One cool idea to keep in mind for White,
besides obvious attacking moves like Bg5/Ng5, is to play Bg2-h3 !, attacking
the weak e6-pawn. Sometimes, it might make sense to first play h2-h4 and
Bg2-h3 later to gain more space on the kingside and get the g5-square under
our firm control.} Be7 10. fxe6 fxe6 11. Bh3 {I don't even see a good defense.

4. d3, are interesting, but I don't like them as much.} (4. d3 {This could be
an alternative if Black were forced to play the endgame, but I think he can
just maintain the tension and be fine. However, what I want to inform you
about is that these positions are really rich, so feel free to toy around with
such possibilities, even if they don't promise any advantage.}) (4. Nc3 {

take on c6 at some point.} 5. Bxc6+ {I will not go into too much detail about
this move as I think Black can reach a rather safe position if he plays
precisely. However, I want to assure you that unless he finds all these moves,
he will end up in at least some amount of trouble, so feel free to research
and dig deeper yourself !} (5. Qe2 {I think this is the best continuation -
White keeps the tension. As we just saw, 5. Bxc6 immediately does not offer
much, so we will prefer a different path. Now Black has tried several moves,
even though the arising position is already extremely rare. The most frequent
one is 5... Be7, followed by such possibilities as ...Nf6, ...a6, ...Nge7 etc.
I think that only one move, namely ...Nge7, gves Black a chance to equalize,
while after other continuations White gets some very comfortable pressure.}

not because it is exceptionally strong or difficult to find, but because it is
not some we typically do. Normally we take on c6 and try to keep things closed,

you pay attention to this idea. Now, the opponent has two possibilities.} Qxd5

sides have castled, and it's time to discuss the arising position in detail.
As we can see, the key particularity of the position on the board is the fact
that the kings are on the opposite flanks. Usually opposite castlings promise
some very interesting fighting game with attacks and sacrifices, and this
position should be no exception. Our first and foremost goal would be to
generate an attack as rapidly as possibly. For that, we will use our kingside
pawns as well as the pieces. One powerful idea I can suggest on the spot is
g2-g4-g5 and Rhg1. This rook will be x-raying the opponent's king; it will
enable such tactical ideas as Nf6+ !, which can often turn out deadly. Our
other knight can go to e5, opening up the path to h5 for our queen. Black, in
my opinion, should go ... b7-b5 and ...Bc8-b7 in the first place and then
react to what we do.} 13. g4 Bb7 14. g5 c4 {Stockfish loves this move and

course, should try to attack himself as well. This is an incredibly fresh
position, which is rich in possibilities for both sides. I could easily devote
a hundred pages of a book to it, but I won't, as the likelihood of it is very
low. Let us just take a look at some reasonable moves by both sides.} 17. Qf2 {

the a6-bishop in, as it is heavily restricted by the c4 and c6-pawns. At some
point, unless Black wants to consider his bishop a big pawn, he would need to
sac a pawn with ...c4-c3 or ...c6-c5, then we will get our pawn back and keep

go Bd2, Qf3, Rae1. I cannot say that this position is anything special, but
White has some strategic advantages and aspirations - for example, he has a
nice spatial advantage thanks to the f5-pawn. Besides that, he might put some
pressure on the d5-pawn and if Black ever pushes ...d5-d4, our knight will get
a nice outpost on e4. And, remember that 6... Qd6 is a very rare continuation,

extremely happy to trade as the horrible pawn structure can be best exploited
in an endgame, or in a calm position where the opponent lacks any counterplay.}

definitely undesirable. We will go Qf3, castle, go d2-d3 and Bc1-e3. Another
plan could be to go b2-b3 and Bc1-Ba3, if we want to hunt the c5-pawn. Black
goes e6-d5,t-6...Qd8 with 7...Qxd5}) 6. d3 {Of course, we maintain the tension
and count on our space advantage. Here is an interesting point: normally, you
don't want to trade pieces when you have more space, but it was barely
possible to find any good use for the White light-squared bishop, so it's nice
to get rid of it. Now it is a very important moment as Black needs to decide
what setup to go for. He can take on e4; he can go ...Nf6 and ...Be7; he can
put the bishop on d6 and the knight on e7; he can play ...Ne7 intending ...
g7-g6 and ...Bg7. This position is not about forcing lines, not at all -
instead, it is about understanding our typical ideas and the setups we want to
reach.} Ne7 {This is the second most popular move. I feel that if Black gets
to develop with ...Nc6 or with ...g7-g6 and ...Bf8-g7, he will be perfectly
fine, so we need to do our best to stop his plan.} (6... dxe4 {Now let's see
what happens if Black is hasty to release the tension in the center.} 7. dxe4

reached this position saw 10. a3, but we can let Black keep his knight there,
as it is not doing us any harm. We will develop with Be3, Qe2, Rd1, O-O. I
would say that while we are not winning yet, the opponent's position is nearly
lost strategically. Black can only count on tricks or hope that we would not
find a way to make decisive progress. Black goes e6-d5,t-6...dxe4}) (6... Bd6 {
This is the most popular plan. Now, however, we can fight for a serious space
advantage by means of the following idea. We can actually play c2-c4 right now,

sense to first castle and not to define our plans yet.} Ne7 8. c4 {This is the
right setup. We are ensuring ourselves of a great control of the center, and
we are asking Black to go ...d5-d4, which will give us full control over the
position and all the time in the world to build the kingside attack. Now,
Black mostly chooses to keep the tension in the center, but we need to
investigate other moves as well - what happens if he takes on e4 or goes ...
d5-d4.} d4 {In my opinion, this is a bad positional mistake. White would be
better even if he was just developing with Nd2, or Na3-c2, but it makes sense
to grab even more space and get ourselves a nice square on e4 for the knight.}

it is worth noting that 10. Nc3 was played only once, while 10. e5 was chosen
in most cases. I think, however, that it makes sense to keep the tension,
there is no need to go e4-e5 yet. Now, interestingly, I cannot really think of
a good plan/move for Black. He can play ...d5-d4, getting a more closed
position; he can take on e4. Perhaps the right way of handling this position
with Black is trying to be flexible with some move ... Rc8 or something like
that, asking White to show his hand.} d4 (10... dxe4 11. dxe4 {Now White just

play too slow and ineffective. He should rather take on d4, but then we just
get a nice advantage because of the structure and extra space.} c4 (12... cxd4

(3. d4 {This is a White full repertoire, so my first and foremost task is to
provide you with a clear understanding of how to react to the opponent's
different move orders. As you can see, I have divided this repertoire into
several chapters, based on whether Black plays with the knight on c6 or
without it, as well as based on the specific second move he makes. In this
case, I think we should go 3. d4 as 3. Nf3 will lead to a position where the
opponent has too many choices, so we cannot cover it completely. I explain
some of the nuances and subtleties in my comments to 3. Nf3, please take a
look. Now, speaking of the move 3. d4 and the ideas behind it. We are clearly
planning to develop our queen to the center, which is normally not a good idea
in the opening, but here it would make tons of sense as Black just weakened
the long diagonal with ...g7-g6. Now he has a choice between 3... cxd4, which
will lead to a rather Sicilian position, and 3... Bg7, which leads to some
Benoni-type positions, not typical of 1. e4 at all. The good news is that we
keep a clear advantage after 3... Bg7, so there is no reason to shy away from
those positions - after all, a chess player should be all-round, knowing how
to handle various positions. Warning - 3... cxd4 leads to some really messy
variations, you might need to learn some of them by heart ! If you are looking
for a calm, stress-free life, go 3. Nf3 - however, then you need to study a
lot of calm typical positions with setups like Be2, d2-d3, c2-c3, which are
unambitious, but playable. In our repertoire, however, we go for the kill !}
Bg7 {Now we have two safe ways to get an advantage. 4.c3 is another safe move.
It promises less but results in a position more typical of 1. e4, so you might
want to investigate this as an alternative.} (3... cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nf6 {Obviously,
this move was forced - we would not consider such horrible alternatives as 4...

Black can get interesting counterplay with his key 8th move, please check it} (
5. e5 {We keep attacking Black as well as insisting on having a very concrete,
tense fight. However, I think that you should definitely explore the
alternatives as well - if not for the repertoire, then just for fun. Moves
like 5. Bd3 or 5. Nc3 don't press the issue and are also very interesting.} Nc6

interestingly, most players did not manage to ! Just for your information, out

the other games Black immediately went wrong. Looks like we already have a
good chance to succeed !} Ng8 {This was played in most games, but this move is
not good at all - just think about it by using common sense - is Black setting
his pieces up for the next game ?!} (6... Ng4 {This move does not lose on the
spot, but after the obvious} 7. h3 Nh6 8. g4 {Black will obviously regret
putting his knight on the edge - I don't see how the knight will ever return

people are afraid to make this move as the knight often ends up trapped on the
edge. For example, if Black's bishop was on g7, g2-g4 ! would have trapped the
knight. Fortunately for our opponent, we cannot win this knight now, and it
will cause us some headache.} 7. Be2 {This is a moment when Black, unless he
is prepared extremely well (which should not happen, we have only 8 games in
the database after 7 moves !) , should get scared. Indeed, Bxh5 seems to be a
positional threat that leads to a horrible structure for Black. I think that's
another reason why Black does not play 6... Nh5 that frequently.} Ng7 {Somehow
Black's position is not falling apart after this move, but I feel very
suspicious about it. We have seized the center and are about to develop
quickly, while Black keeps jumping around with his knight.} (7... d6 8. Nc3 {

pawn, so he wants to lure our queen on c5 to win a tempo. If I were you, I

about it ? Black has the bishop pair and the open e-file. Also, he can try to

engine thinks this position is alright for Black, I cannot look at it without
feeling that something is really wrong. Black king's shelter is totally ruined,
we have an outpost on d5, the d6-pawn is weak, Black has no targets at all.
How can this work ? If we wouldn't win in the middlegame because of Black's
weak king, we would be quite happy with some endgame after, say, we trade the
knights on d4 and the queens somewhere - we will enjoy the outpost on d5 and
pressure on the d6-pawn. I think that no human will ever enjoy being Black

13.Ne4 Now our plan would involve Bd2-c3, activating the bishop. Then, the
a1-rook would come to e1. It's also important to keep in mind that the f4-pawn
might hang if the bishop leaves the c1-f4 diagonal, so we might want to play
g2-g3. At this point, Black's compensation for the pawn still exists, but
already starts disappearing and looking problematic.} 13. f5 {This is a very
important point, I believe. Since Black's pieces are ready to start creating
threats in a wide-open position, White should be doing his best to keep the
position closed, even if this involves returning his extra pawn. However,
White has some advantages besides the extra pawn which he is about to lose -
the fantastic e4-square for the knight, as well as the one on d5. One idea
could be to go Bg5, trade off the f6-knight and later occupy one of those two
squares with our c3-knight.} Qxf5 {Kasparov makes the natural move, picking
the undefended pawn immediately. 13...Nd4 This is the most popular move. 14.

defending the e4 and d5-squares. Nh5 At this point, White has several

f5-knight. Nf4 17.Nxf5 Rxf5 18.Ne4 Bc7 White has a weakness on d3, but his
minor pieces are a lot better. The c7-bishop is rather passive and useless,
for instance. 19.Kh1 Ref8 20.Bxf4 exf4 21.Qf3 White's idea now is to re-route
the knight to d5 via c3 and to base his play on this fantastic minor piece. b6

get sufficient counterplay, which is why our main recommendation will be

prepare Be3 and avoid Ng4) , Be3, Nbd2, c2-c3, a2-a4. Black, on the other hand,

suggested improvement. The point is simple - we are preventing Black from
castling long. Now it seems natural to go ...Be7 and ...Rd8, or ... Be7

short, his king would be too far from the d-file.} Be7 15. a4 {It is always
useful to grab space on the queenside, now we intend a4-a5, Bc1-e3. Then,
Black would never be able to go ...b7-b6 because the rook would be hanging on

than on g8, but Black will still have problems if he lets us go Rd7.} (15...

to castle or to put the king on f7 in order to connect the rooks. Castling is
a faster way of connecting the rooks, but it worsens Black's king, while ...
f7-f6 takes longer but keeps the king more active. To be honest, both
continuations will result in more or less the same thing, so let us rather
discuss our ideas.} f6 17. Rd5 {Thanks to the e4-pawn, as well as to the fact
that Black played 1... c7-c5, we have an outpost on d5 which we gladly use to
double on the d-file. Of course, it is extremely undesirable for him to
capture on d5 as we will get a protected passed pawn after exd5 followed by
c2-c4.} Kf7 18. g3 {I like this move as it enables us to move the bishop at
some point - for example, it prepares Bxc5, although this capture still isn't
possible. The reason why it's an important move is because we prevent any ...

move is ...Nf8-e6.} 19. Rad1 Nf8 20. Nd2 {Our knight is coming to c4, then we
can grab space with g3-g4, h2-h4, Kf3, a4-a5. White enjoys a strong strategic
initiative, as all of our pieces are better than the Black ones and because we
have a clear plan of how to improve our position, where Black has to sit and

As I said, it is positionally dangerous to castle.} 16. Rd7 b6 17. a5 {White
is firmly in the driver's seat. Now we will continue with Bc1-e3, getting the
last piece in the game. Importantly, the a1-rook is already developed, despite
the fact that we haven't ever moved it. One possible threat Black needs to
take into consideration is axb6 axb6 Rxa8 Rxa8 Rb7, which will threaten the
b6-pawn and nearly win it. 2.f4 d5! - Black's best reply-3.Bb5! Bd7 - the

the same way.} Ke6 19. Rb7 {Again, White is keeping a powerful initiative.

attacking his bishop. Now the most natural move Ke7 does not work out well.}

take either the bishop or the knight, whatever he chooses. Also, this move
improves White's structure. However, this is the right way of handling the
position, as Black manages to develop easily.} 15. gxf3 O-O-O (15... Bxh2 {
Actually, this risky-looking move is possible. We would not win Black's bishop,

all the time in the world to improve the position of our pieces. Now we are

Black's position is not easy to handle at all, for example} O-O 20. Kf3 {
Black has no way of challenging us for the d-file; his bishop remains out of
play. The engine thinks the position is almost equal, but I personally would
be extremely scared to have Black here, as the extra pawn does not help at all,
while all the other factors favor White to an extreme degree. By the way, if
you are afraid of being a pawn down, you can always get the pawn back with Bf2
and Rh1, which would force Black to go ...Bg3, returning the pawn. However, I
would strongly prefer to just keep the pressure, as Black has no way out of
this bind. 2.f4 d5! - Black's best reply-3.Bb5! Bd7 - the endgame}) 16. f4 {
I think White is better thanks to the extra pawn in the center, to his extra
space and to the d5-outpost. We will go Kf3, Be3, c2-c4 !, Rd5, Rad1 etc. We
can use the h4-pawn to later attack Black's kingside with h2-h4-h5 - this
would make most sense if our rook is on the g-file. This is by no means a
winning position, but it's definitely a very enjoyable one. 2.f4 d5! - Black's

activating the knight. The a4-pawn prevents ...b7-b5 and ensures the c4-knight
of being secure. If Black ever goes ...a7-a6, we can and should answer a4-a5 !,
preventing ...b7-b5 and getting an outpost on b6.} b6 {Otherwise we can push
a4-a5, grabbing even more space.} 13. Re1 Rfd8 14. Nc4 Kf8 {These were all
logical moves, and now it's time to increase our advantage. How do we do that
? It would be nice to develop the bishop, but I don't like the Ng4-ideas that
much, so let us stop that. Also, the e4-pawn is hanging, so we cannot go Be3,
yet. However, if the Black knight ever goes elsewhere from f6, this will
become possible.} 15. h3 {Now we are ready to push g2-g4 !, taking all the
space on the kingside.} h5 {Black totally has to stop this expansion.} 16. Bd2

endgame with minor pieces and with a huge spacial advantage. Another thing we
can do is Ne5, trading a pair of knights in order to later invade on c6 as

position, while Black is doomed to passive defense. 2.f4 d5! - Black's best

castling is just a blunder of a pawn.} (9... d4 {This is a novelty. Black
immediately closes the center, preventing any possible pressure on the c5-pawn
and restricting both sides' options quite a bit, making the type of position
more distinctive. In my opinion, this move is somewhat suspicious
strategically. The reason why I think so is that we have traded the
light-squared bishops and now Black is setting his central pawns on the dark
squares, which means he might have a problem with the dark-squared bishop in
the future. It's also rather crucial to mention that White's pawns on e4 and
f4 provide him with a lovely space advantage in the center and on the kingside.

almost lost position from the strategic perspective.} Bc7 14. axb6 axb6 15. Nb5

position is brand-new, the novelty took place many moves ago, so it's
difficult to predict how exactly Black will continue, but one logical option
seems to be the rook trade.} Rxa1 16. Rxa1 Bb8 {At this point, we need to see
another key idea/plan for White.} 17. c4 {This either ensures us of a large
space advantage if Black does not take en passant, or after} dxc3 18. bxc3 {

he try to advance his queenside pawns, or should he take on e4, or should he

optional: it would make our advantage potentially less big than with more
pieces on the board, but on the other hand, it would suppress any counterplay
Black could get by activating his knight. It might not be easy to win this

{ Now that we have stopped ...Nc6, this seems to be the only way for Black to develop his kingside. }
8. Nc3 d4
{ Black has to close the center or he wouldn't be able to develop his kingside and castle. }
9. Nd1
{ Now White has a large advantage on the kingside. We will try to generate an attack on the kingside or get an initiative in the center by playing e4-e5, Nf2-e4 etc. Black's only idea is to do something on the queenside, say ... b7-b5, ...c5-c4, etc. Let us see whose strategy will prove more successful ! }
9... e5
{ This is my novelty, the point is to prevent e4-e5. I don't think that Black's position in this line is better than the one in the main line, but at least this is an interesting principled strategic attempt that we should analyze. }
10. fxe5 Nc6 11. e6
{ We could try to hold on to the pawn, but this is the easiest way to get an advantage. We return the pawn to develop quickly. It is worth noting that now the f-file opens up, which is especially important because Black just retreated with his knight from f6. }
11... fxe6 12. O-O
{ Now if it was White's turn, Ng5 ! would win the game, as threats like Nf7 or Nxe6 would turn out unstoppable. }
12... h6 { Black has to stop our threat. } 13. e5 Bg7 14. Qe4
{ We are losing the e5-pawn, but will capture the g6-pawn in return. } 14...
O-O 15. Qxg6 Qe8 16. Qxe8
{ It was also possible to retreat, but I believe that this is the cleanest path to the obvious positional advantage. Black will win the e5-pawn, to end up with a worse bishop and with a weakness on the e-file. We have an amazing outpost on e4 for our knight and an extra kingside pawn. It is crucial to understand the Black's extra e-pawn, on the other hand, is absolutely useless. }

{ Of course, we maintain the tension and count on our space advantage. Here is an interesting point: normally, you don't want to trade pieces when you have more space, but it was barely possible to find any good use for the White light-squared bishop, so it's nice to get rid of it. Now it is a very important moment as Black needs to decide what setup to go for. He can take on e4; he can go ...Nf6 and ...Be7; he can put the bishop on d6 and the knight on e7; he can play ...Ne7 intending ... g7-g6 and ...Bg7. This position is not about forcing lines, not at all - instead, it is about understanding our typical ideas and the setups we want to reach. }

18. Rfb1 b6 19. g3 a6 20. a4
{ White has a clear advantage thanks to his extra space, nice outposts and the potential to play on every part of the board.  Black managed to somewhat challenge our huge space advantage by removing the e5-pawn. However, he could not and would never be able to remove the f4 and d4-pawns, which also provide us with a lot of space and central control.  Black's knight on d5 looks nice, but it is not attacking anything, it is serving solely defensive purposes.   Importantly, Black has one nice square - on d5 - but two knights! This means the other horsey is out of a job, unable to find a good spot.  Another important point to mention is that the g7-bishop is rather passive, as White's central pawns are doing an amazing job restricting it.  White will keep improving his position and playing wherever he chooses to: the situation is extremely convenient for us. }

{ Other moves, such as 4. Nc3 or 4. d3, are interesting, but I don't like them as much. }
4... Bd7 5. Bxd7+
{ To me it looks like the queen recapture is more natural. However, the practice does not support my intuition, as 280 games saw the knight recapture, while the queen recapture was tried only in 105 games. The knight recapture is considered more precise by current theory, but I think differently, and as we will see, White has a very nice setup as a response. }
5... Nxd7 6. d3
{ Of course, we maintain the tension and count on our space advantage. Here is an interesting point: normally, you don't want to trade pieces when you have more space, but it was barely possible to find any good use for the White light-squared bishop, so it's nice to get rid of it. Now it is a very important moment as Black needs to decide what setup to go for. He can take on e4; he can go ...Nf6 and ...Be7; he can put the bishop on d6 and the knight on e7; he can play ...Ne7 intending ... g7-g6 and ...Bg7. This position is not about forcing lines, not at all - instead, it is about understanding our typical ideas and the setups we want to reach. }

10. Nc3
{ The only game that reached this position saw 10. a3, but we can let Black keep his knight there, as it is not doing us any harm. We will develop with Be3, Qe2, Rd1, O-O. I would say that while we are not winning yet, the opponent's position is nearly lost strategically. Black can only count on tricks or hope that we would not find a way to make decisive progress. }

4... Bd7 5. Bxd7+
{ To me it looks like the queen recapture is more natural. However, the practice does not support my intuition, as 280 games saw the knight recapture, while the queen recapture was tried only in 105 games. The knight recapture is considered more precise by current theory, but I think differently, and as we will see, White has a very nice setup as a response. }
5... Nxd7 6. d3
{ Of course, we maintain the tension and count on our space advantage. Here is an interesting point: normally, you don't want to trade pieces when you have more space, but it was barely possible to find any good use for the White light-squared bishop, so it's nice to get rid of it. Now it is a very important moment as Black needs to decide what setup to go for. He can take on e4; he can go ...Nf6 and ...Be7; he can put the bishop on d6 and the knight on e7; he can play ...Ne7 intending ... g7-g6 and ...Bg7. This position is not about forcing lines, not at all - instead, it is about understanding our typical ideas and the setups we want to reach. }
6... Bd6
{ This is the most popular plan. Now, however, we can fight for a serious space advantage by means of the following idea. We can actually play c2-c4 right now, or we can postpone it and do it one move later. }
7. O-O
{ I think it makes sense to first castle and not to define our plans yet. }
7... Ne7 8. c4
{ This is the right setup. We are ensuring ourselves of a great control of the center, and we are asking Black to go ...d5-d4, which will give us full control over the position and all the time in the world to build the kingside attack. Now, Black mostly chooses to keep the tension in the center, but we need to investigate other moves as well - what happens if he takes on e4 or goes ...d5-d4. }
8... O-O 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Nc3
{ This is a rare interesting position - it is worth noting that 10. Nc3 was played only once, while 10. e5 was chosen in most cases. I think, however, that it makes sense to keep the tension, there is no need to go e4-e5 yet. Now, interestingly, I cannot really think of a good plan/move for Black. He can play ...d5-d4, getting a more closed position; he can take on e4. Perhaps the right way of handling this position with Black is trying to be flexible with some move ... Rc8 or something like that, asking White to show his hand. }
10... Rc8 11. e5 Bc7 12. d4
{ This structure is pretty new to us in this variation. While we had other options, I like the idea of defining the situation in the center. Now if Black chooses to play ...c5-c4, followed by ...b7-b5-b4 etc, he will find his play too slow and ineffective. He should rather take on d4, but then we just get a nice advantage because of the structure and extra space. }
12... cxd4 13. Nxd4
{ This position was reached in one correspondence game, let us see what happened. }
13... Nc5 14. Be3 Ne4 15. Kh1
{ White does not really care about Black's possibility to take on c3, as the pawn on c3 would be hard to attack and this trade will give White all the possibilities on the kingside. }
15... Nxc3 16. bxc3
{ If Black were to try things like ...Ba5, attacking the c3-pawn, then the e5-pawn would not be under attack anymore and f4-f5-f6 would crush Black's position quickly. }
16... Qd7 17. Rb1 Bb6 18. Qd3 g6
{ All these moves were logical and good, which is not surprising at all as this was a correspondence game. Now White trades the bishops and tries to pursue something on the kingside. }
19. Nb5
{ White is offering a knight trade, so that his knight will be potentially able to come to d6 in the future.  Most importantly, he is making sure Black never has ...Bxd4 ideas at his disposal. }
19... Bxe3 20. Qxe3 b6 21. Qd2 Rc5 22. Nd4
{ Now that the bishops got traded, the White knight returns to this lovely central spot.   The idea is simple - we want to push f4-f5 and kill Black's king! }
22... Nf5 23. g4
{ Of course, this advance is too tempting to resist.  If the knight retreats, f4-f5! would look decisive. }
23... Nxd4 24. cxd4 Rc6 25. f5
{ Now that the knights are traded, White's structure got fixed. His kingside attack is unstoppable, while Black had not created a single threat during the previous 25 moves. No wonder that soon White won. 1-0  (42)  Tsukanov,I  (2084)  -Vrana,L  (2216)  ICCF email 2017 }

{ The threats are too strong. For example, Nd6+ is coming, some Qd5 ideas are available, too. Black's position is simply falling apart.  I think this shouldn't come as a surprise considering we are twelve moves in the game, and Black had spent one-third of these moves shuffling his queen around!  White, on the other hand, developed all of his pieces extremely rapidly and precisely, without wasting any time. }

{ We will now go Re4, Rfe1. Then we will try to improve our king by bringing it to d2, maybe to e2. Later, we can try to swap one pair of rooks. Once we do that, we can try to manoeuvre around the 4th rank with our remaining rook. It is also important to understand that our king can go to e3, then to e4, putting more pressure on Black's position. I have no doubt that the computer can hold this position, but from a human perspective it is going to be a long-suffering without any chances to win - I call such situations an opening success ! }

24... Kf7 25. Bxe5 Rxe5 26. Rc7+ Ke8 27. Rxe5 fxe5 28. h3
{ Our next step would be picking all the pawns on the 7th rank, Black is screwed.  Please note that even though we are attacking and Black should generally be extremely happy to swap the queens, in this case even the trade would not help him too much. If that ever happens, White will just have a technically winning  (or nearly so)  rook endgame thanks to the tremendous activity of our rook, as opposed to Black's terrible rook as well as his king, which is cut off on the last rank.  But, you might also consider keeping the queens on the board as it might make Black's life even more difficult. }

{ I cannot say that White has a huge advantage or anything; objectively, the position should remain balanced. However, I feel that it should be easier to have White here because of a few factors: 1  the d4-pawn is somewhat weak, it cannot be protected by other pawns; 2  the g7-bishop is rather passive; 3  there is no clear plan. Black should simply develop, so will we. For example, a few reasonable maneuvres are Bd1-b3 to improve the light-squared bishop; Rc1 to double up on the open c-file; possibly, it could make sense to go a2-a3 and b2-b4 to grab some space on the queenside. Obviously, we need to be honest with ourselves - we cannot always be better, especially if we don't go for the main lines. However, the arising position is very rich and interesting, and Black hasn't ever arrived here yet, so apparently his path and play are not that straightforward. }

Otherwise we will go b3-b4 !, kind of locking the a6-bishop in, as it is heavily restricted by the c4 and c6-pawns. At some point, unless Black wants to consider his bishop a big pawn, he would need to sac a pawn with ...c4-c3 or ...c6-c5, then we will get our pawn back and keep a slight pressure. However, I think that to win such a position is not an easy task, it requires a lot of patience and a very high endgame technique. Thus, my main recommendation will be something else. }

{ While this move is reasonable objectively, I am quite suspicious of it, as it opens up the e-file and puts Black in a situation where he is behind in development in a rather open position. Obviously, it will take him a lot of time to develop his kingside pieces and castle, so we will try to make use of the extra time that we possess. }

{ As you have noticed, I have been obsessed with the idea of spoiling Black's structure whenever possible throughout the entire chapter. This is something we will do here, too. Even though Black's knight is on e7, he cannot use this knight to recapture back because of the pin. Besides the doubled pawns that Black is getting, he will still be experiencing some issues with the development. }
8. b3
{ I think that the bishop will find its best place on b2, as it is restricted by the f4-pawn over the other diagonal. Now the big question is how Black should develop. I can think of one plan only - ...f7-f6 followed by ...Kf7, but this is far from obvious. }
8... Be6 9. O-O
{ Importantly, Black cannot make this move. Technically, this move itself is fine, but the idea of unpinning the knight over the e-file to later move it and develop the kingside is wrong because of obvious tactical reasons: White will push f4-f5. }

13. Na4 Bxf4
{ Now the c5-pawn is doomed, however the opponent can take on f4. Let's see what the consequences would look like. }
14. Bxc5
{ White's pieces are either on good spots, or are ready to occupy them - for example, once we kick the Black knight out, our knight will happily go to d4. Black's army, on the other hand, seems to be rather disorganized - just look at the queen on a5, at the bishop on f4, at the king on f7. A few pieces on the last rank, which haven't ever moved, don't improve the impression, either. Of course, White has a large advantage - both thanks to his better pieces and to the pawn structure - he has less pawn islands and none of his pawns are weak, none have advanced too far to create weak squares. }

5. Qe2
{ I think this is the best continuation - White keeps the tension. As we just saw, 5. Bxc6 immediately does not offer much, so we will prefer a different path. Now Black has tried several moves, even though the arising position is already extremely rare. The most frequent one is 5... Be7, followed by such possibilities as ...Nf6, ...a6, ...Nge7 etc. I think that only one move, namely ...Nge7, gves Black a chance to equalize, while after other continuations White gets some very comfortable pressure. }
5... Ne7 6. exd5
{ This seems to be the best move, because it stops White's idea of doubling the opponent's c-pawns. }
6... Qxd5 7. Nc3
{ While it might not be the most natural idea to capture with the queen, it makes a lot of sense as it stops Bxc6, unlike the pawn recapture. Now, of course, we need to try to make use of the position of the opponent's queen, as it might be vulnerable in the center. Attention - this move and the following variations will lead to some extremely complicated positions ! }
7... Qd8 8. Ne4 a6
{ We are immediately attacking the c5-pawn, as defending it is not an easy task for Black. Now if he moves the e7-knight anywhere, we will happily double his pawns. The right move is 8... a6, while 8... b6 ? turns out to be a huge mistake. Funnily, while there are no games after 6... Qxd5, this move 8. Ne4 tranposes to a pretty well-known position that was featured in about 35 games. }
9. Bxc6+ Nxc6
{ Now, unfortunately, we have to give up our bishop pair, while not getting to spoil opponent's structure. However, our rapid development will compensate for a slight positional concession. }
10. b3 Be7
{ This was the point - our remaining bishop will prove extremely useful over the long diagonal. Black doesn't really have much of a choice besides castling short, and if he does castle short, the bishop will be an instrumental piece in our kingside attack. }
11. Bb2 O-O 12. O-O-O b5
{ Now both sides have castled, and it's time to discuss the arising position in detail. As we can see, the key particularity of the position on the board is the fact that the kings are on the opposite flanks. Usually opposite castlings promise some very interesting fighting game with attacks and sacrifices, and this position should be no exception. Our first and foremost goal would be to generate an attack as rapidly as possibly. For that, we will use our kingside pawns as well as the pieces. One powerful idea I can suggest on the spot is g2-g4-g5 and Rhg1. This rook will be x-raying the opponent's king; it will enable such tactical ideas as Nf6+ !, which can often turn out deadly. Our other knight can go to e5, opening up the path to h5 for our queen. Black, in my opinion, should go ... b7-b5 and ...Bc8-b7 in the first place and then react to what we do. }

15. Rhg1 cxb3 16. axb3 Nb4

17. Nf6+ Kh8 { This cold-blooded reply seems the day for Black. } 18. Nxh7 Kxh7

{ I award this move with an exclamation mark not because it is exceptionally strong or difficult to find, but because it is not some we typically do. Normally we take on c6 and try to keep things closed, while here we are opening the position up a bit first, so I want to make sure you pay attention to this idea. Now, the opponent has two possibilities. }
6... Nxd5 7. Bxc6+ { Now we would again happily spoil his structure. } 7...
bxc6 8. d3
{ Again, we reach this type of positions. It is by no means a winning position, just a very nice one. We will castle, then our knight will travel to the lovely c4-outpost by means of Nb1-a3-c4. Later, we can install the other knight on e5, develop the bishop to d2 and the a-rook to e1. Once we have done all this, we should be in full control, then we will launch a kingside attack with g2-g4, and so on. }

3... d6
{ It looks like Black is not showing his intentions yet - he keeps several options open. However, if we take a more attentive look at the position, we will see that this is not exactly the case. The reason is simple: there are not so many ways how he can develop his pieces ! If he goes . ..g7-g6, this will be extremely similar to the positions after 3... g6, while .. .e7-e6 combined with ...d7-d6 would be rather passive. I think that the only point of this move, in fact, is to be able to meet Bb5 with ...Bd7 and to later develop with ...g7-g6, while not getting the spoiled structure - however, this is a very important point, so 3... d6 is a rather good move, which should lead to roughly balanced interesting situations. }

That is why it could make sense to keep the light-squared bishops on the board, so we are preparing Bc2, followed by such play as a2-a3, Rb1, b2-b4. Now Black needs to either allow for it or play Nd4, offering some trades. }

{ This has been Black's most popular move. Indeed, it is a very natural one - he just wants to develop the bishop to the long diagonal, get the knight in the game to castle. }
4. Bb5
{ However, I am not sure how much I like this position for Black. The reason is rather simple. Let us use our opening erudition and compare this position with a very trendy one that arises in the so-called Rossolimo variation after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5. Here the main move is 3... g6, and we basically get the same situation, but our pawn is on f4, not on f2. Why is this advantageous for White ? Well, even in that variation mentioned above he often moves his knight to push f2-f4 and then return to f3 with the knight ! Here, instead, we have already achieved the f2-f4 push. As a result, we guarantee ourselves a large spatial advantage in the center and on the kingside, which is nice. The main move is 4... Bg7, but we should also look at the structure which arises after 4... Nd4 as well as at an attempt to avoid the doubled pawns - 4... Qb6. }

Obviously, this takes a lot of time, but the strategic benefits of having the pawn on f4 are so large that White is willing to spend that time. Of course, since we have saved a lot of time here, as our pawn is already on f4, our position should be a lot better. }
8... b6
{ Black can try to keep his bishop on c8. So far, he solidifies his positions in the center by protecting the c5-pawn. }
9. Qe1
{ Of course, we do not need to wait - we are directly aiming our pieces at the opponent's king. We are about to play Qh4, f4-f5, Bc1-h6, Ng5 - if that happens, Black king's will not last for too long. }
9... Ne8 10. Qh4 Nc7 11. f5 gxf5 12. Bh6
{ Now the threat is Qg5 ! with checkmate on the next move. } 12... f6 13. Bxg7
Kxg7 14. e5
{ White is a pawn down, but he is totally dominating the board. We will play Rae1, Nc3-e2-f4. Then the knight can come to h5 and the rook can join the attack via e3-g3. Black's extra pawn, just as his queenside pieces, are of no help whatsoever, so we are nearly winning - who will be stopping our simple yet deadly plan ? }

One possible setup I would suggest is Bb2, followed Qf2, h2-h4-h5. Then our queen can return to h4 and we'll get a powerful initiative over the h-file: once it opens up, even ideas like Kf2 followed by Rh1 would make a ton of sense. }

1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5
{ This precise dynamic move is the reason why 2. f4 is not as popular as some other sidelines in the Sicilian. Obviously, we gain a lot with 2. f4 compared with 2. Nc3 - the Grand Prix Attack - namely, we save a tempo by keeping the knight on b1, and often we get additional ideas, such as to play c2-c3 or to develop the knight to other squares. However, everything has its price, and the price we are paying is insufficient control over the d5-square. Thus, it is very logical for Black to counterattack us in the center. Fortunately, I don't think that most club players, and even most untitled opponents of yours will go for this move, especially because it involves a pawn sacrifice: after 3. exd5 Black should go 3... Nf6 !, offering White to hold on to this extra pawn. I believe that there are ideas for White in the lines where he tries to hold on to the pawn, but I think that it makes even more sense to rather aim for a complicated equal position that we reach with a different move. }
3. exd5
{ I will just show the main line, which still contains some ideas for White, but seems rather too well-researched and "empty" from the theoretical standpoint. }

4. Bb5+ Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Qxd7 6. c4 e6 7. Qe2

9. dxe6 fxe6 10. Nf3 Nc6 11. O-O Rae8
{ Black is bringing his last inactive piece in the game. } 12. Nc3 e5
{ Black has mobilized all of his forces, so he totally has to open up the position, or else White would consolidate and keep his extra pawn.   12...b6 ?!  Let's make some random move to see how White will be improving his position if Black is acting indecisively.  13.Ne4  Now our plan would involve Bd2-c3, activating the bishop. Then, the a1-rook would come to e1. It's also important to keep in mind that the f4-pawn might hang if the bishop leaves the c1-f4 diagonal, so we might want to play g2-g3. At this point, Black's compensation for the pawn still exists, but already starts disappearing and looking problematic. }
13. f5
{ This is a very important point, I believe. Since Black's pieces are ready to start creating threats in a wide-open position, White should be doing his best to keep the position closed, even if this involves returning his extra pawn. However, White has some advantages besides the extra pawn which he is about to lose - the fantastic e4-square for the knight, as well as the one on d5. One idea could be to go Bg5, trade off the f6-knight and later occupy one of those two squares with our c3-knight. }
13... Qxf5
{ Kasparov makes the natural move, picking the undefended pawn immediately.   13...Nd4  This is the most popular move.  14.Qd1  Nxf5  15.Bg5  As planned, White is trying to trade the f6-knight, which is defending the e4 and d5-squares.  Nh5  At this point, White has several interesting continuations. For example,  16.Nh4  is offering the trade of the f5-knight.  Nf4  17.Nxf5  Rxf5  18.Ne4  Bc7  White has a weakness on d3, but his minor pieces are a lot better. The c7-bishop is rather passive and useless, for instance.  19.Kh1  Ref8  20.Bxf4  exf4  21.Qf3  White's idea now is to re-route the knight to d5 via c3 and to base his play on this fantastic minor piece.  b6  22.Nc3  Be5  23.Rae1  ∞  With an interesting complicated position. }
14. Bg5
{ If White gets to take on f6 and play Ne4, Black might start experiencing serious strategic problems. So, Garry is trying to open up the game. }

{ White improved his position tremendously. Black is not able to tolerate this pressure anymore, so he gave up a pawn, but White just went on to convert his material advantage shortly after. I believe this game should provide a decent idea about these typical situations - White is often happy to return the pawn to try and use the weakened central squares. Black, however, should be able to get sufficient counterplay, which is why our main recommendation will be different, but you can use this as an interesting playable alternative, as not every single Black player will be ready to sacrifice the pawn ! }

1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5
{ This precise dynamic move is the reason why 2. f4 is not as popular as some other sidelines in the Sicilian. Obviously, we gain a lot with 2. f4 compared with 2. Nc3 - the Grand Prix Attack - namely, we save a tempo by keeping the knight on b1, and often we get additional ideas, such as to play c2-c3 or to develop the knight to other squares. However, everything has its price, and the price we are paying is insufficient control over the d5-square. Thus, it is very logical for Black to counterattack us in the center. Fortunately, I don't think that most club players, and even most untitled opponents of yours will go for this move, especially because it involves a pawn sacrifice: after 3. exd5 Black should go 3... Nf6 !, offering White to hold on to this extra pawn. I believe that there are ideas for White in the lines where he tries to hold on to the pawn, but I think that it makes even more sense to rather aim for a complicated equal position that we reach with a different move. }
3. exd5
{ I will just show the main line, which still contains some ideas for White, but seems rather too well-researched and "empty" from the theoretical standpoint. }
3... Nf6
{ Black has to sacrifice this pawn. 3... Qxd5 leads to a clear advantage, feel free to investigate this yourself. }
4. Bb5+ Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Qxd7 6. c4 e6 7. dxe6
{ It's rather principled to go to an endgame with an extra pawn, making Black show his compensation. }
7... Qxe6+ 8. Qe2
{ Now Black has to take on e2 himself, which is quite counterintuitive as it accelerates our development. Instead, if he goes 8... Nc6 ?!, he is worse as we trade on e6 and worsen his structure. Many strong GMs, such as Sutovsky and Neiksans, went wrong here, so you can definitely count on opponent's mistakes. But, I think that 3. Bb5 leads to the more exciting positions, let us rather study this move in this repertoire. }

{ This is a novelty. Black immediately closes the center, preventing any possible pressure on the c5-pawn and restricting both sides' options quite a bit, making the type of position more distinctive.  In my opinion, this move is somewhat suspicious strategically. The reason why I think so is that we have traded the light-squared bishops and now Black is setting his central pawns on the dark squares, which means he might have a problem with the dark-squared bishop in the future.  It's also rather crucial to mention that White's pawns on e4 and f4 provide him with a lovely space advantage in the center and on the kingside. }

1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5
{ This precise dynamic move is the reason why 2. f4 is not as popular as some other sidelines in the Sicilian. Obviously, we gain a lot with 2. f4 compared with 2. Nc3 - the Grand Prix Attack - namely, we save a tempo by keeping the knight on b1, and often we get additional ideas, such as to play c2-c3 or to develop the knight to other squares. However, everything has its price, and the price we are paying is insufficient control over the d5-square. Thus, it is very logical for Black to counterattack us in the center. Fortunately, I don't think that most club players, and even most untitled opponents of yours will go for this move, especially because it involves a pawn sacrifice: after 3. exd5 Black should go 3... Nf6 !, offering White to hold on to this extra pawn. I believe that there are ideas for White in the lines where he tries to hold on to the pawn, but I think that it makes even more sense to rather aim for a complicated equal position that we reach with a different move. }
3. Bb5+
{ I like this rare move. First of all, even if Black knows that 2... d5 is the right way to go, he will surely have no clue what to do after this check. Think about it: more than 2500 games were played with 3. exd5, while less than 200 saw 3. Bb5 ! Now, Black already has to make a choice, how to deal with our check. }

The position is balanced, but our next moves are pretty obvious: we will go Nc2, g2-g3, Rad1, maybe we'll make a few more improving moves. On the other hand, what should Black's plan be ? Should he try to advance his queenside pawns, or should he take on e4, or should he try to push ...d5-d4 ? While the position remains within the frames of equality, I prefer White simply because our moves are natural, while the opponent has to make many uneasy decisions. }

{ What seems to be a natural move turns out a positional inaccuracy, I believe. }
12. e5 fxe5 13. fxe5 Nxe5 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 15. Bxc5 Bc7
{ I think White is better as he has the better pawn structure - Black has an extra pawn island. If we manage to take on e7 and play d3-d4, we will fix the e6-pawn as a weakness. Actually, taking on e7 is optional: it would make our advantage potentially less big than with more pieces on the board, but on the other hand, it would suppress any counterplay Black could get by activating his knight. It might not be easy to win this e6-weakness and this position overall, but Black will clearly suffer. }

16... Rxf1+
{ We fix the weakness on e6. It was also possible to take on e7, but it also makes sense to keep more pieces on the board. }
17. Rxf1 Nc6 18. Nc2
{ White's advantage is by no means large, but it is clear and stable. Black has a slight weakness on e6, and we keep some kingside ideas, such as Ne3-g4 followed by Qe3-g5, for example - if we arrange our pieces in this way, the opponent would need to be rather careful. The computer might be claiming it's nearly equal, but any strong player would pick White, there is no doubt about that. I think we should be quite glad about the opening outcome ! }

[Result "*"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5
{ This precise dynamic move is the reason why 2. f4 is not as popular as some other sidelines in the Sicilian. Obviously, we gain a lot with 2. f4 compared with 2. Nc3 - the Grand Prix Attack - namely, we save a tempo by keeping the knight on b1, and often we get additional ideas, such as to play c2-c3 or to develop the knight to other squares. However, everything has its price, and the price we are paying is insufficient control over the d5-square. Thus, it is very logical for Black to counterattack us in the center. Fortunately, I don't think that most club players, and even most untitled opponents of yours will go for this move, especially because it involves a pawn sacrifice: after 3. exd5 Black should go 3... Nf6 !, offering White to hold on to this extra pawn. I believe that there are ideas for White in the lines where he tries to hold on to the pawn, but I think that it makes even more sense to rather aim for a complicated equal position that we reach with a different move. }
3. Bb5+
{ I like this rare move. First of all, even if Black knows that 2... d5 is the right way to go, he will surely have no clue what to do after this check. Think about it: more than 2500 games were played with 3. exd5, while less than 200 saw 3. Bb5 ! Now, Black already has to make a choice, how to deal with our check. }
3... Bd7 { Of course, this most natural defense is the best one. } 4. Bxd7+
Qxd7 5. d3
{ We are inviting Black to trade on e4 and on d1 - this endgame might look equal and toothless at first, but in reality, White has all the chances to fight for the pleasant edge. Instead, Black can keep the tension, which is also a valid possibility. However, most players - in 28 cases out of 44 - preferred to capture on e4, so let us consider this move the main possibility. }
5... dxe4 6. dxe4 Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1
{ Let us take a look at this position. White's king is not able to castle anymore, how important is this factor ? Well, we have an endgame on the board, and as we know, in the endgame the king activity is one of the crucial factors ! That is why we will happily keep our king either on e2, or on c2, after c2-c3 - it is much better off on those squares rather than somewhere on g1. White has more space, and his plan is simple: to develop with Nf3, h2-h3  (to prepare Be3 and avoid Ng4)  , Be3, Nbd2, c2-c3, a2-a4. Black, on the other hand, can make a few natural developing moves, but then he is likely to find himself in a situation where it is not so easy to come up with a plan. Importantly, this position is not about forcing lines, it is about understanding the general picture and how to use our advantages. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the main move - Black just develops a knight. Apparently, players are afraid to go 7... Nf6 because of 8. e5 - at least, this is how I explain the overwhelming popularity of 7... Nc6. }
8. Nf3 Nf6 9. Nbd2
{ While 9. e5 makes sense, I think it makes sense to keep the tension, as 9. e5 allows Black to use the d5-square for the knight. }
9... e5
{ GM Pavlovic was the only one to find this powerful equalizer, connected with a temporary pawn sacrifice. }
10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. fxe5 Ng4 12. Ke2 Nxe5 13. Nf3
{ As a result, we have an isolated pawn, which does not look like a good thing. However, White is better prepared to develop his pieces - the bishop and the rooks will come in the game fast. }
13... Bd6
{ This would be a reasonable way of handling the position with Black - he plans to go ...Ke7 to connect the rooks in this way. }
14. Rd1
{ Again, we are preventing Black from castling while attacking his bishop. Now the most natural move Ke7 does not work out well. }
14... Ke7 15. Rd5 f6 16. Bf4
{ We are threatening to win the pawn by capturing everything on e5. Black's position is already falling apart, for example }
16... Nc4 { This might be the most stubborn path, but it still loses a pawn. }
17. Bxd6+ Nxd6 18. Rxc5 Nxe4 19. Rc7+
{ White is just picking up the pawn and Black's king isn't safe either - we can play Rd1-Rd7 followed by Nd4, which might be nearly a checkmate. }

This is by no means a winning position, but it's definitely a very enjoyable one. }

{ Black has no way of challenging us for the d-file; his bishop remains out of play. The engine thinks the position is almost equal, but I personally would be extremely scared to have Black here, as the extra pawn does not help at all, while all the other factors favor White to an extreme degree. By the way, if you are afraid of being a pawn down, you can always get the pawn back with Bf2 and Rh1, which would force Black to go ...Bg3, returning the pawn. However, I would strongly prefer to just keep the pressure, as Black has no way out of this bind. }

Nc3 - the Grand Prix Attack - namely, we save a tempo by keeping the knight on b1, and often we get additional ideas, such as to play c2-c3 or to develop the knight to other squares. However, everything has its price, and the price we are paying is insufficient control over the d5-square. Thus, it is very logical for Black to counterattack us in the center. Fortunately, I don't think that most club players, and even most untitled opponents of yours will go for this move, especially because it involves a pawn sacrifice: after 3. exd5 Black should go 3... Nf6 !, offering White to hold on to this extra pawn. I believe that there are ideas for White in the lines where he tries to hold on to the pawn, but I think that it makes even more sense to rather aim for a complicated equal position that we reach with a different move. }
3. Bb5+
{ I like this rare move. First of all, even if Black knows that 2... d5 is the right way to go, he will surely have no clue what to do after this check. Think about it: more than 2500 games were played with 3. exd5, while less than 200 saw 3. Bb5 ! Now, Black already has to make a choice, how to deal with our check. }
3... Bd7 { Of course, this most natural defense is the best one. } 4. Bxd7+
Qxd7 5. d3
{ We are inviting Black to trade on e4 and on d1 - this endgame might look equal and toothless at first, but in reality, White has all the chances to fight for the pleasant edge. Instead, Black can keep the tension, which is also a valid possibility. However, most players - in 28 cases out of 44 - preferred to capture on e4, so let us consider this move the main possibility. }
5... dxe4 6. dxe4 Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1
{ Let us take a look at this position. White's king is not able to castle anymore, how important is this factor ? Well, we have an endgame on the board, and as we know, in the endgame the king activity is one of the crucial factors ! That is why we will happily keep our king either on e2, or on c2, after c2-c3 - it is much better off on those squares rather than somewhere on g1. White has more space, and his plan is simple: to develop with Nf3, h2-h3  (to prepare Be3 and avoid Ng4)  , Be3, Nbd2, c2-c3, a2-a4. Black, on the other hand, can make a few natural developing moves, but then he is likely to find himself in a situation where it is not so easy to come up with a plan. Importantly, this position is not about forcing lines, it is about understanding the general picture and how to use our advantages. }
7... Nc6
{ This is the main move - Black just develops a knight. Apparently, players are afraid to go 7... Nf6 because of 8. e5 - at least, this is how I explain the overwhelming popularity of 7... Nc6. }
8. Nf3 Nf6 9. Nbd2
{ While 9. e5 makes sense, I think it makes sense to keep the tension, as 9. e5 allows Black to use the d5-square for the knight. }
9... e5
{ GM Pavlovic was the only one to find this powerful equalizer, connected with a temporary pawn sacrifice. }
10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. fxe5 Ng4 12. Ke2 Nxe5 13. Nf3
{ As a result, we have an isolated pawn, which does not look like a good thing. However, White is better prepared to develop his pieces - the bishop and the rooks will come in the game fast. }
13... Ng6 { Now White is able to seize the initiatve. } 14. Rd1
{ This would be my suggested improvement. The point is simple - we are preventing Black from castling long. Now it seems natural to go ...Be7 and ...Rd8, or ... Be7 followed by castling. However, you need to bear in mind that if Black castles short, his king would be too far from the d-file. }
14... Be7 15. a4
{ It is always useful to grab space on the queenside, now we intend a4-a5, Bc1-e3. Then, Black would never be able to go ...b7-b6 because the rook would be hanging on a8 after axb6. }
15... Rd8 { Black should fight for the only open file ! } 16. Be3
{ Now, Black is ready to castle or to put the king on f7 in order to connect the rooks. Castling is a faster way of connecting the rooks, but it worsens Black's king, while ...f7-f6 takes longer but keeps the king more active. To be honest, both continuations will result in more or less the same thing, so let us rather discuss our ideas. }
16... f6 17. Rd5
{ Thanks to the e4-pawn, as well as to the fact that Black played 1... c7-c5, we have an outpost on d5 which we gladly use to double on the d-file.  Of course, it is extremely undesirable for him to capture on d5 as we will get a protected passed pawn after exd5 followed by c2-c4. }
17... Kf7 18. g3
{ I like this move as it enables us to move the bishop at some point - for example, it prepares Bxc5, although this capture still isn't possible. The reason why it's an important move is because we prevent any ...Nf4 ideas. }
18... Rhe8
{ One interesting defensive idea that Black prepares with this move is ...Nf8-e6. }
19. Rad1 Nf8 20. Nd2
{ Our knight is coming to c4, then we can grab space with g3-g4, h2-h4, Kf3, a4-a5. White enjoys a strong strategic initiative, as all of our pieces are better than the Black ones and because we have a clear plan of how to improve our position, where Black has to sit and wait. }

1. e4 c5 2. f4 g6 3. d4
{ This is a White full repertoire, so my first and foremost task is to provide you with a clear understanding of how to react to the opponent's different move orders. As you can see, I have divided this repertoire into several chapters, based on whether Black plays with the knight on c6 or without it, as well as based on the specific second move he makes. In this case, I think we should go 3. d4 as 3. Nf3 will lead to a position where the opponent has too many choices, so we cannot cover it completely. I explain some of the nuances and subtleties in my comments to 3. Nf3, please take a look. Now, speaking of the move 3. d4 and the ideas behind it. We are clearly planning to develop our queen to the center, which is normally not a good idea in the opening, but here it would make tons of sense as Black just weakened the long diagonal with ...g7-g6. Now he has a choice between 3... cxd4, which will lead to a rather Sicilian position, and 3... Bg7, which leads to some Benoni-type positions, not typical of 1. e4 at all. The good news is that we keep a clear advantage after 3... Bg7, so there is no reason to shy away from those positions - after all, a chess player should be all-round, knowing how to handle various positions. Warning - 3... cxd4 leads to some really messy variations, you might need to learn some of them by heart ! If you are looking for a calm, stress-free life, go 3.

His b8-knight will have a hard time finding a good spot, just as the d7-bishop. The g7-bishop was supposed to be active, but right now it's clearly not. Importantly, it would always be a horrible idea to trade on b5, as after axb5 White will get a semi-open a-file and pressure on the a7-pawn. Black's position is simply disgusting at this point. }

{ This is a White full repertoire, so my first and foremost task is to provide you with a clear understanding of how to react to the opponent's different move orders. As you can see, I have divided this repertoire into several chapters, based on whether Black plays with the knight on c6 or without it, as well as based on the specific second move he makes. In this case, I think we should go 3. d4 as 3. Nf3 will lead to a position where the opponent has too many choices, so we cannot cover it completely. I explain some of the nuances and subtleties in my comments to 3. Nf3, please take a look. Now, speaking of the move 3. d4 and the ideas behind it. We are clearly planning to develop our queen to the center, which is normally not a good idea in the opening, but here it would make tons of sense as Black just weakened the long diagonal with ...g7-g6. Now he has a choice between 3... cxd4, which will lead to a rather Sicilian position, and 3... Bg7, which leads to some Benoni-type positions, not typical of 1. e4 at all. The good news is that we keep a clear advantage after 3... Bg7, so there is no reason to shy away from those positions - after all, a chess player should be all-round, knowing how to handle various positions. Warning - 3... cxd4 leads to some really messy variations, you might need to learn some of them by heart ! If you are looking for a calm, stress-free life, go 3. Nf3 - however, then you need to study a lot of calm typical positions with setups like Be2, d2-d3, c2-c3, which are unambitious, but playable. In our repertoire, however, we go for the kill ! }

1. e4 c5 2. f4 g6 3. d4
{ This is a White full repertoire, so my first and foremost task is to provide you with a clear understanding of how to react to the opponent's different move orders. As you can see, I have divided this repertoire into several chapters, based on whether Black plays with the knight on c6 or without it, as well as based on the specific second move he makes. In this case, I think we should go 3. d4 as 3. Nf3 will lead to a position where the opponent has too many choices, so we cannot cover it completely. I explain some of the nuances and subtleties in my comments to 3. Nf3, please take a look. Now, speaking of the move 3. d4 and the ideas behind it. We are clearly planning to develop our queen to the center, which is normally not a good idea in the opening, but here it would make tons of sense as Black just weakened the long diagonal with ...g7-g6. Now he has a choice between 3... cxd4, which will lead to a rather Sicilian position, and 3... Bg7, which leads to some Benoni-type positions, not typical of 1. e4 at all. The good news is that we keep a clear advantage after 3... Bg7, so there is no reason to shy away from those positions - after all, a chess player should be all-round, knowing how to handle various positions. Warning - 3... cxd4 leads to some really messy variations, you might need to learn some of them by heart ! If you are looking for a calm, stress-free life, go 3. Nf3 - however, then you need to study a lot of calm typical positions with setups like Be2, d2-d3, c2-c3, which are unambitious, but playable. In our repertoire, however, we go for the kill ! }

{ Obviously, this move was forced - we would not consider such horrible alternatives as 4... f6 ?. }
5. e5
{ We keep attacking Black as well as insisting on having a very concrete, tense fight. However, I think that you should definitely explore the alternatives as well - if not for the repertoire, then just for fun. Moves like 5. Bd3 or 5. Nc3 don't press the issue and are also very interesting. }
5... Nc6 6. Qd3
{ This is the big moment, where Black needs to find the only good move - interestingly, most players did not manage to ! Just for your information, out of 32 games that saw this position only 11 featured the right move, while in the other games Black immediately went wrong. Looks like we already have a good chance to succeed ! }
6... Nh5
{ My guess is that people are afraid to make this move as the knight often ends up trapped on the edge. For example, if Black's bishop was on g7, g2-g4 ! would have trapped the knight. Fortunately for our opponent, we cannot win this knight now, and it will cause us some headache. }
7. Be2
{ This is a moment when Black, unless he is prepared extremely well  (which should not happen, we have only 8 games in the database after 7 moves !)  , should get scared. Indeed, Bxh5 seems to be a positional threat that leads to a horrible structure for Black. I think that's another reason why Black does not play 6... Nh5 that frequently. }

{ White just wants to castle long - if he manages to do so, Black will nearly have to resign - just look at his development ! }
11... Bxc2 { If Black is to suffer, at least he will suffer for a pawn. } 12.
Rc1 Bf5 13. Rd1
{ We chased the bishop away, now our rook comes to the most appropriate file - it will be x-raying the opponent's queen. I simply cannot see a single move for Black ! How is he supposed to develop ? For instance, one logical idea is ...Ne6 followed by ...Bg7 and ... O-O. However, this attempt nearly loses. }
13... Ne6 14. exd6 exd6 15. Ne5 Nxe5 16. fxe5

1. e4 c5 2. f4 g6 3. d4
{ This is a White full repertoire, so my first and foremost task is to provide you with a clear understanding of how to react to the opponent's different move orders. As you can see, I have divided this repertoire into several chapters, based on whether Black plays with the knight on c6 or without it, as well as based on the specific second move he makes. In this case, I think we should go 3. d4 as 3. Nf3 will lead to a position where the opponent has too many choices, so we cannot cover it completely. I explain some of the nuances and subtleties in my comments to 3. Nf3, please take a look. Now, speaking of the move 3. d4 and the ideas behind it. We are clearly planning to develop our queen to the center, which is normally not a good idea in the opening, but here it would make tons of sense as Black just weakened the long diagonal with ...g7-g6. Now he has a choice between 3... cxd4, which will lead to a rather Sicilian position, and 3... Bg7, which leads to some Benoni-type positions, not typical of 1. e4 at all. The good news is that we keep a clear advantage after 3... Bg7, so there is no reason to shy away from those positions - after all, a chess player should be all-round, knowing how to handle various positions. Warning - 3... cxd4 leads to some really messy variations, you might need to learn some of them by heart ! If you are looking for a calm, stress-free life, go 3. Nf3 - however, then you need to study a lot of calm typical positions with setups like Be2, d2-d3, c2-c3, which are unambitious, but playable. In our repertoire, however, we go for the kill ! }
3... cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nf6
{ Obviously, this move was forced - we would not consider such horrible alternatives as 4... f6 ?. }
5. e5
{ We keep attacking Black as well as insisting on having a very concrete, tense fight. However, I think that you should definitely explore the alternatives as well - if not for the repertoire, then just for fun. Moves like 5. Bd3 or 5. Nc3 don't press the issue and are also very interesting. }
5... Nc6 6. Qd3
{ This is the big moment, where Black needs to find the only good move - interestingly, most players did not manage to ! Just for your information, out of 32 games that saw this position only 11 featured the right move, while in the other games Black immediately went wrong. Looks like we already have a good chance to succeed ! }
6... Nh5
{ My guess is that people are afraid to make this move as the knight often ends up trapped on the edge. For example, if Black's bishop was on g7, g2-g4 ! would have trapped the knight. Fortunately for our opponent, we cannot win this knight now, and it will cause us some headache. }
7. Be2
{ This is a moment when Black, unless he is prepared extremely well  (which should not happen, we have only 8 games in the database after 7 moves !)  , should get scared. Indeed, Bxh5 seems to be a positional threat that leads to a horrible structure for Black. I think that's another reason why Black does not play 6... Nh5 that frequently. }
7... d6 8. Nc3
{ We need our bishop, so we don't take on h5. Moreover, we are offering a pawn sacrifice ! Two games reached this position and both saw 8... Bf5 !, which is the right move. We will analyze this continuation, as well as what happens if Black accepts the sacrifice. }
8... dxe5
{ The consequences of this greedy move are not so obvious - we need to understand, why White's initiative is so strong. First, we just trade and develop the remaining pieces. }
9. Qxd8+ Kxd8 10. fxe5 Nxe5 11. Nf3
{ We don't mind trades, as long as they accelerate our development. If Black takes, our bishop will get to the long diagonal. }
11... Bg7 { Of course, Black should not be helping us develop. } 12. Bd2
{ Now we are about to castle. Black's main problem is obvious - his king is on d8. The board is still full of pieces, so White can easily generate a powerful attack. On the other hand, if Black tries to evacuate his king somewhere to b8 or g8, he will need to spend too much time - meanwhile, White will create multiple threats like Nb5, Nd5, etc. }
12... Bd7 13. O-O-O
{ At this point, Black has several choices. Let us discuss all of them - for example, ...Rc8, ...Nxf3 and ...Ke8 all seem to be quite logical moves. }
13... Rc8 14. Rhe1
{ White happily brings his last piece in the game. At this point, we reach a perfect harmony - all of our pieces are developed, and what's funny, they are developed in the same way on both flanks ! }
14... Nc4
{ Black tries to trade some pieces, and White has to do that, or else ideas like Nxb2 ! would become possible. }
15. Bxc4 Rxc4 16. Nd5 e6 17. b3 { We are kicking the active rook out. } 17...
Rc8 18. Ne3
{ Now that Black had weakened several squares, such as d6, we are regrouping. The knight is coming to c4 - later, it can go to d6 or to e5. Black has to way of coordinating his pieces, it is especially hard to get the h8-rook in the endgame. }
18... Ke7 19. Bb4+ Ke8 20. Nc4
{ And the attack is ripping its benefits, as Nd6+ is unstoppable. } *

11. O-O-O O-O 12. Nf3
{ If Black plays like this, he does not lose by force or anything, but we clearly keep him in a very uncomfortable and tight bind. The central pawns on e5 and f4 make all of his pieces passive and ensure us of a large spacial advantage - we are just clearly better. I think that the next good moves will be Rd2 and Rad1, increasing the pressure over the d-file. }

{ We reach some very atypical messy position. What shall we say about it ? Black has the bishop pair and the open e-file. Also, he can try to use the c-file, as our king is on the queenside. However, even though the engine thinks this position is alright for Black, I cannot look at it without feeling that something is really wrong. Black king's shelter is totally ruined, we have an outpost on d5, the d6-pawn is weak, Black has no targets at all. How can this work ? If we wouldn't win in the middlegame because of Black's weak king, we would be quite happy with some endgame after, say, we trade the knights on d4 and the queens somewhere - we will enjoy the outpost on d5 and pressure on the d6-pawn. I think that no human will ever enjoy being Black here, and if someone will, the chances of reaching this position are nearly non-existent. }

{ Of course, this should not really be a good move for obvious reasons, but it could be slightly challenging for our repertoire purposes as it's now impossible to develop the bishop to b5. Let's make a logical move and see where it takes us, to begin with. }

{ Now, Black can continue in several ways. The logical moves are ...d7-d5, ... e7-e6 followed by ...d7-d5 and ...b7-b5. }

{ White just gets the type of positions he is normally getting after 2. f4 g6 3. d4, just with an extra tempo - and those positions are rather sharp, so White should be clearly better. We'll leave it here. }

{ We are now playing some weird mix of Grand Prix and Closed Sicilian or whatever. But, I think, there is a piece of good news for us to compensate for the fact that this position is not similar to what we are normally getting in other variations in this repertoire. Namely, Black wasted a move on ...a7-a6 ! I know you might say this move supported ...b7-b5, but I don't think it's a good plan, especially when the White knight is not on c3. Just to draw a comparison: there is a variation 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 a6 3. g3 b5, which is considered risky, but decent. However, in that variation, White already committed his knight to the c3-square, making it possible for Black to attack it with ... b5-b4 at some point and losing the plan of c2-c3 at some point, or the idea to develop the knight to d2. So, it's clear that with this move order, we have benefited a lot. Surprisingly, we have reached another new position - no games in there ! So, I will just give you a sample line to show how we develop. }

5... b5 6. Bg2 Bb7 7. Qe2 Nf6 8. e5 Nfd7 9. f5
{ White is going to open up the f-file and attack on the kingside. I believe that the fact that the Black knights are both far away for the kingside is something extremely alarming for Black: who is going to protect this king ? One cool idea to keep in mind for White, besides obvious attacking moves like Bg5/Ng5, is to play Bg2-h3 !, attacking the weak e6-pawn. Sometimes, it might make sense to first play h2-h4 and Bg2-h3 later to gain more space on the kingside and get the g5-square under our firm control. }
9... Be7 10. fxe6 fxe6 11. Bh3
{ I don't even see a good defense. What should Black do here ? This looks extremely risky for the second player, I think. Again, it was possible to handle this position slightly differently with Black, but you get the idea why this looks extremely dangerous to me. }

{ White plans to continue with c2-c3, Be3, Nbd2, Kc2, a2-a4, Nc4 etc. This position is extremely enjoyable for us, I believe, thanks to the spatial advantage ensured by the e4 and f4-pawns. Please note that the move ...a7-a6 not only proved a waste of time, but also it weakened the b6-square which will turn out extremely significant in the endgame. For example, we can play a4-a5 followed by Nbd2-c4-b6. I would strongly encourage you to study the endgames arising in the 2. f4 d5 variations to get a better feel for this type of positions. }
