{ The Sicilian Najdorf is a one of a kind. It is the sharpest of all the sound openings and the soundest of all the sharp ones, and the Sicilian Najdorf has been played by many great uncompromising players throughout chess history.   Serving as the main weapon for Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov against 1. e4 throughout their career, the Najdorf has accumulated a massive following by players of all levels. These days it is by far the most popular Sicilian and is played regularly by many top players, serving as the main repertoire for the Candidates: MVL, Nepo and myself.   Others, including Magnus Carlsen himself, are also regularly using it when they are looking for a fighting weapon that doesn't require burning bridges and taking unnecessary gambles. I personally had started studying the Najdorf long before I started playing it. Fascinated by the games of Kasparov, Topalov and Vishy Anand around the 2000's, I started analysing the sharpest variations of the Najdorf and continued building the repertoire, while still for some reason not daring to try it out in my games all too often.   At some point around the year 2015, after years of analysing it, I decided to try it out and immediately the results started pouring it. Both myself and my trainer at the time were surprised at how well the positions suited me, despite that I actually didn't have that much experience playing it. It turned out that all the analytical work and the nature of the positions played to my advantage and I had kept the Najdorf as part of my repertoire ever since. For a while, I was using it mainly as a weapon for special occasions, but as I had started growing more into it and started spending more and more time working on it, it had gradually become my main repertoire.   The defining moment for me was when I was in a must-not-lose situation of my match against Magnus Carlsen during the MCI tournament leading 2-1 and Magnus played 1.e4. I lashed out the Najdorf   while  1...e5  and the solid Berlin endgame is also part of my repertoire  and controlled the game from the beginning to the end. Later, I used the Najdorf against Magnus again, in the Chessable Masters, this time to win on-demand as well.   This is where I am in my personal journey with the Najdorf, and I am sure that this course and my experience can help you, no matter where you are in yours. }
1. e4 { Best by test, they say! } 1... c5
{ This move defines the Sicilian, known as the sharpest and the most reliable way to fight against 1. e4!. It is literally the most popular move. Black fights for the centre, but avoids the symmetry, showing aggressive intentions from move one. }
2. Nf3
{ White has some sidelines if he chooses not to go for the main Sicilians -  2.c3  and  2.Nc3  being the most notable of those - and of course, they are all thoroughly covered in the course. }
2... d6
{ Taking the e5-square under control and preparing to develop the g8-knight to f6. }
3. d4
{ The Open Sicilian. The alternatives are covered in the course as well, and there are plenty here, most notably the  3.Bb5+  variation, which is one of the biggest chapters of the whole course. I personally consider  3.Bb5+  as a part of the Najdorf. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 { Developing the knight, as planned! } 5. Nc3 a6
{ And it is this move that defines the Najdorf. The idea is not immediately obvious, but it is not too hidden either. Black wants to push the d4-knight away with e5, but  5...e5  would be met by  6.Bb5+!  followed by Nf5, when the knight on f5 is not only very disturbing, putting pressure on the d6-pawn, but can also reroute itself to the weakened d5-square via e3.   At the same time, besides just threatening  6...e5  , Black also keeps the option of  6...e6  open, as the immediate  5...e6  , runs into the so-called Keres-Attack with  6.g4!   Compared to the 5...Nc6 system, which is the Classical Sicilian, Black keeps the flexibility of the b8-knight and may want to develop it to d7, which makes the 6.Bg5-system somewhat less dangerous against the Najdorf than it is against the Classical Sicilian.  Finally, besides protecting the b5-square from Bb5+, the pawn on a6 is also useful in the long run, when Black will start the queenside play with b5.   White has a huge amount of options on the 6th move and perhaps that is one thing that might take an inexperienced player aback. The amount of theory seems to be infinite, but while that is partly true, against most of the systems, Black's pieces follow a familiar development scheme and while it is possible to take us out of book, it will be hard to pose us with a problem that we wouldn't be equipped to solve, after having studied the standard development patterns, typical ideas and motives.     The three most popular moves after  5...a6  by far are  6.Bg5  ,  6.Be3  and  6.Be2.  Then follow  6.Bc4  ,  6.h3  ,  6.f4  ,  6.g3  and  6.a4  and finally there come to a lot of moves that re-appeared on the horizon only recently,  6.Bd3  ,  6.Rg1  ,  6.Nb3  ,  6.Qf3  ,  6.Qe2  ,  6.Qd3  ,  6.a3  ,  6.h4  and even  6.Bd2  as White had realized that almost every move on move 6 has some point.  Against each move I give a full overview of options and explain my choices, against some I offer more than one solution and for the two biggest moves, 6. Bg5 and 6. Be3, I have a separate introduction chapter where I go into more detail about what options and move orders Black has and why I chose my particular recommendations.   I am sure this will be useful for players of absolutely all levels, for the old and new fans of the Najdorf and I am sure those looking for a weapon against the Najdorf as well, will find my guidelines and instructions helpful. }

Instead, with the knight on g3 and not where it usually is in such structures, on b3, the plan with Rb8 and b5 seems very decent.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5
{ The system with 6. Bg5 is definitely the most theoretical, testing, and challenging for us, Najdorf players. White does have to be ready for a very sharp fight and know @@StartBracket@@plus remember!@@EndBracket@@ a ton of theory, but if he does, then the life of an unprepared Najdorf player will be tough. Fortunately, though, for the children of this course, being unprepared is not going to be an issue.   I am going to recommend an older system that I had revitalized and made into a perfect bulletproof lifetime weapon, but in this chapter, I would first like to give a full overview of the options Black has. I will not have a separate chapter for all the lines, but I think the move 6. Bg5 is one of the few that deserve such thorough treatment! }
6... e6
{ The main move, but not the only one. In general, one can divide Black's options against 6. Bg5 into three groups:  1@@EndBracket@@ Gamble variations, where Black is risking to get a bad position but White needs to know exactly how to punish Black.   Includes the Polugaevsky variation  6...e6  7.f4  b5   Gothenburg  6...e6  7.f4  h6  8.Bh4  Be7  9.Qf3  g5   6...e6  7.f4  Nc6  system, and few others.   2@@EndBracket@@ The poisoned pawn  6...e6  7.f4  Qb6  including:  7...h6!?  8.Bh4  Qb6  The most principled and the main-choice of top-players and correspondence players but needs a huge amount of move-by-move memorization.   3@@EndBracket@@ Reliable variations focussing on piece development  6...Nbd7  ,  6...e6  7.f4  Nbd7   and  6...e6  7.f4  Be7  8.Qf3  Qc7  9.O-O-O  Nbd7   The last one is what I will be recommending here.  6...Nbd7  is a very trendy system, that has been popularized a lot around a decade ago by my Dutch friends. It was considered to be a perfect surprise slash must-win weapon for a while, but by now the theory has grown so much here, that it is no longer so fresh and exciting as it once used to be. Still, it was one of the variations I seriously considered recommending for this course, until I stumbled into a more attractive option.  7.Qe2  is a very critical modern response, keeping f2-f4 in reserve.   7.f4  is the naive response, but now Black's point is that he has delayed the move e7-e6.  7...Qc7  followed by an eventual e7-e5 in one go, or even g7-g6 sometimes, going for the Dragon structure.   @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.Bc4  was considered to be the main issue but after  7...Qb6  keeping an eye on the d4 knight and also the b2 pawn, the complications seem to be OK for Black. Very messy and lots of theory, obviously.  7...h6  8.Bh4  g6  is the main-line when after  9.f4  e5  10.fxe5  dxe5  White has a bunch of options when often Black has to walk a narrow path to survive. By now, in this, once upon a time fresh position, there are 400 games already.   6...Nc6  is actually a potential transposition to the Rauzer variation of the Classical Sicilian.  7.Qd2  Bd7  8.O-O-O  e6  surely there will be a separate Chessable course on this one... }
7. f4 Be7
{ 7...b5 ?!  Is the famous Polugayevsky variation. There is a book about it, called The Birth of the Variation. Beautiful story and a very remarkable line, but unfortunately it seems to crack under the pressure of the modern engines.  8.e5  dxe5  9.fxe5  Qc7  10.exf6  Qe5+  11.Be2  Qxg5  12.O-O  Ra7  This romantic move is what this line was based upon, but the modern engines aren't optimistic for Black here.  13.Qd3  Rd7  14.Ne4  and there are many attempts that Black can undertake to make this work, but at the end of the day, lagging in development so much, it is quite hard.   7...Qc7  Is a peculiar move order, but it allows the Rauzer-type structures  8.Bxf6  gxf6  that as Najdorf players we usually avoid.   7...Nbd7  Is a huge variation, called the Gelfand variation. Similar to 5...Nbd7 can sometimes transpose, but usually, it actually does not. White has a few challenging lines,  8.Qf3  being the old main-line, but lately  8.Qe2  is considered to be the most testing.  8.Bc4  is there as well.  8.Qe2   8.Qf3  Qc7  9.O-O-O  b5  Is somewhat similar to the three-piece system, but not the same. Against  10.Bd3  Black can transpose to similar lines, but with this move order, he has avoided  10.g4  systems. There are however some other things he allowed, like  10.Bxf6  or  10.e5  10.Bd3   10.e5  leads to a typical line for the 6.Bg5 system, full of sacrifices and some sort of a draw in the end, if both sides know their stuff.  10...Bb7  11.Qh3  dxe5  12.Nxe6  fxe6  13.Qxe6+  Be7  14.Bxb5  and the line goes far beyond this.   8.Bc4  here b5 and Qb6 are both possible, with a lot of theory.  Qc7  9.O-O-O  b5  10.a3  is a major battleground. Not so long ago I had added my own two cents in here, out preparing a Turkish player with  10...Be7  11.g4  h6  12.Bh4  Rb8  followed by b4 and a very sharp game. Definitely another line I was considering to serve us as the lifetime repertoire, but for now, I feel the line I go with is somewhat more compact, reliable, and has a bigger surprise value.   7...Qb6  the Poisoned Pawn variation!  8.Qd2   8.Qd3  is a serious sideline as well.  Qxb2   8...Nc6  is an attempt to play it safe. Once again, the Rauzer vibes are there after  9.Bxf6  gxf6  10.Nb3  Bd7  11.O-O-O  O-O-O  quite playable for Black, but not a very Najdorf-authentic solution.  9.Rb1  Qa3  and here White has a lot of challenging options, two main moves being f5 and e5. The variations are forced and often go into a deep endgame all the way to move 40. As theory stands right now @@StartBracket@@and I am sure will always stand@@EndBracket@@, Black is holding his own by force here and while I am ready to bring all of that with me to my top-tournaments, I felt it would be unfair to unload all of this onto the children of my course, who want to have a fun time playing the Najdorf Sicilian and not have to be ready to pass some serious memory-test on demand.  10.e5   10.f5   7...h6  8.Bh4  Qb6  Is usually played by the Poisoned Pawn fans, who want to avoid some sidelines, yet allow some others. Most notably  9.a3  Be7  10.Bf2  Qc7  11.Qf3  where a lot of theoretical battles took place on the highest level with me and Fabiano on the White side and MVL and Nakamura on the Black side of this.   7...Nc6 ?!  was briefly popular, trying to play a hybrid between the Najdorf and the Rauzer, but there is punishment here-  8.Nxc6  bxc6  9.e5  h6  10.Bh4  g5  11.fxg5  Nd5  12.Ne4  Qb6  Black entered these complications for a while, but once the strong move  13.c3 !  was found, stopping Qb4+, the theory died out here, as Black's position was deemed unacceptable, with g5-g6 incoming. }
8. Qf3
{ We will discuss all the sidelines and the mainlines in a separate chapter, but for now this is the main move, by far.   8.Qe2 ?!  Is really not a valid setup in this move order, which is one of the main reasons why I recommend the three-piece system starting with the move 7...Be7.  8...h6  9.Bh4  and now the point  9...Nxe4 ! }
8... Qc7 9. O-O-O
{ Again, sidelines are going to be dealt with, but this is the main. } 9...
Nbd7
{ The so-called three-piece system. Black has developed the bishop, queen, and a knight and is ready for the standard Sicilian push b7-b5, now that e5 push can be met with Bb7!. This used to be the main-line until some problems have started appearing and the focus shifted back to the poisoned-pawn variation. However, about a decade ago new ways started appearing here for Black   I speak about  10.g4  b5  11.Bxf6  Nxf6  12.g5  Nd7  13.f5  O-O!  and this line remains playable ever since.   I have given it one more modern twist, revitalizing the move  10.g4  followed by  10...h6!?  and now I feel confident that this is an excellent lifetime repertoire recommendation.   The sidelines will obviously be covered and against the main-line  10.g4  I will give two options, both the theoretical  10...b5  line, but also my brand-new way of handling the  10...h6!?  variation.  See you in the next chapter! }

7. Qf3
{ This slightly awkward looking move, placing the queen in front of the f2 pawn before pushing f2-f4, is not too bad and was brought onto the limelight again when Nepo used it to win a game in a Russian Championship a few years back. The idea is to castle long as quickly as possible and, as you will see, sometimes even sac some light piece for the rapid initiative. }

15. Nxd6 Ke7 16. Nxc8+ Raxc8 { Slightly more accurate. } 17. Ne2 g5
{ What's likely to happen is that we will get a strong outpost on e5 for the knight, White will regroup the knight to d3 eventually and trade down into opposite-coloured bishop endgame with an extra pawn.   It should be very drawish, but I offer a more forcing solution, in case some people don't feel comfortable playing a pawn down. }

The good news is, I don't imagine you are likely to face an opponent that will make it this far.

15... Bd7

{ This is a very rare instance when actually recapturing with the pawn is more precise. If we take with the rook after h5 it will be hard to push g6, as our king will get too exposed in the center, compared to other positions when it already would be on c8/b8. }
21... gxh6 22. e5
{ White's last attempt to try and scare us by opening some files while we haven't yet developed our c8 bishop. However White doesn't have active enough pieces to get an edge this way. }

{ The move 6. Be3, nowadays mainly connected with the idea of the English Attack @@StartBracket@@ f3 Qd2 O-O-O setup@@EndBracket@@ is an almost eternal main-line in many Sicilians and the Najdorf is not an exception.   This line is probably the one line that has one way or the other remained in fashion for the past couple of decades. The 6th move trends in the Najdorf comes and goes, but the English Attack enjoys a steady following amongst players of all levels so it is important to be ready to face it.   In this chapter I would like to give an overview of Black's options, before going into details on my recommendation, which I can already assure you is epic. }
6... e5
{ 6...e6  Is the Scheveningen setup, which used to be a favourite of Garry Kasparov for a major period in his career. It leads to crazy variations, though at the top-level a lot of initial Kasparov-romanticism is gone, as the theory has advanced so far that many of the lines go into deep forced endgames and require precise memorization more than creativity and imagination which used to be the case when Kasparov started exploring this territory.   I could have recommended the Scheveningen setups against everything, but for the initial launch of my course, I am convinced it is a better idea to study the fascinating  6...e5  structures first.   6...Ng4  For starters let me explain what this  6...Ng4  is about.  7.Bc1  now Black has to go back to f6, there really is no good alternative. 7.Bg5 is the main move, leading to a big line that is in a fine theoretical shape. One thing, however, is that White can also go back to c1.  7...Nf6  and here there are two issues. First of all if White again plays  8.Be3  and we go  8...Ng4  it is up to him whether to take the draw or play for a win, while we have no way to continue the fight!   Moreover, the English Attack fans can start here with the move @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.f3  and here Black does have to decide to go for  6...e5  or  6...e6  after all.   Now, if you are a fan of the Scheveningen setup against the English attack with  6...e6  the addition of @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  Ng4  to your repertoire is definitely worth it, as  6.Be3  e6  gives White a ton of dangerous sidelines including  7.g4!?  ,  7.f4  and  7.Be2  and whatnot.   However, if you anyway plan on going  6.f3  e5  then what it basically comes down to, is that all 6.Be3 Ng4 achieves is avoiding some lines like @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  e5  7.Nf3   Now we can zoom out further and see the bigger picture. Suppose you play  6.Be2  e6  you allow  7.Be3  which is the position after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  e6  7.Be2   Also if you want to avoid @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  e5  7.Nb3  Be6  8.h3  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.h3  e5  7.Nb3  Be6  8.Be3  which is the same thing, you may want to go @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  Ng4  and another 6th move against the 6.h3-system. Very confusing.   Basically, though, in this course I want to recommend the  6...e5  setup whenever possible, which was the favourite setup of Bobby Fischer and the structure I myself find quite fascinating.  So we will play e5 against @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  ,  6.f3  ,  6.Be2  and  6.h3  as well and if or when some of them will inter-transpose, we will happily embrace it. This way we don't need 6.Be3 Ng4 in our repertoire. }
7. Nb3
{ In this chapter I will mostly mention the main possibilities against the English Attack, but the another retreat  7.Nf3  is a serious line that we will also have a good look at. Already here Black has a choice to make. I will recommend starting with  7...Be7  because of the sidelines, but against the English Attack setup with  8.f3  it does not matter much how to start and actually, Be6 allows Black even more options, as it delays the development of the f8 bishop. Essentially there are two types of setups, the ones with h7-h5 push stopping g4 push for now and the ones where Black just develops and allows the kingside expansion with g2-g4  @@StartBracket@@and later g4-g5@@EndBracket@@. }
7... Be7
{ 7...Be6  This move has quite some independent value, as there are popular setups with h5 where later the f8 bishop gets developed to g7.  8.f3  This is the English Attack. Lines that have to do with ideas of going f2-f4 instead or h3 instead of f3 are also venomous and we will have a good look at them.  This position can also be reached after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@   6.f3  e5  7.Nb3  Be6  8.Be3  Which is common among those who don't want to allow  6.Be3  Ng4.   8...h5  Similar setup to the one I recommend, but in this move order, White has not yet committed to Qd2, while Black has the flexibility to develop the f8 bishop to g7 later on. There are also setups with 8...Nbd7 without h5 as well, postponing the development of the e7 bishop, but they haven't quite caught on.  9.Nd5   9.Qd2  Is usually met with  9...Nbd7  and if White goes for the O-O-O setup, Black should eventually develop the bishop to e7 and that position will actually also be a part of our repertoire.  9...Bxd5  10.exd5  Nbd7  11.Qd2  g6  Now there are two major setups Be2 O-O and O-O-O. The latter one more fashionable these days.  12.O-O-O  Here another choice for Black. He can go after the d5 pawn with Nb6 or play the somewhat less popular move Bg7, just trying to finish the development. I have played both.  12...Nb6  13.Kb1  Is a pawn sacrifice that became a thing around ten years ago and it remains topical to this day. Black is certainly very fine and there are a lot of games, both over the board and correspondence that one can study here. A very respectable system, but I wanted to offer something fresh and less analyzed for my course, so I went for something slightly different. }
8. f3 Be6 9. Qd2 { Note that g2-g4 is not good here yet because of d5!. } 9...
h5
{ The idea of pushing this pawn only after including Be7 and Qd2 is that after  10.Nd5  Nxd5  11.exd5  Bf5  the move White would want to make,  12.Bd3  is less attractive for White as after  12...Bxd3  13.Qxd3  he had wasted a move on Qd2.   9...O-O  The old and formidable main-line.  10.O-O-O  Nbd7  The alternative 10...a5 used to be popular at some point in time, with the idea that after White goes a4, Black will install a knight on b4 and then break with d6-d5 and crush. However, White has figured out the right move orders there to stop that from happening and the positional weakness of the b5 square on the queenside proved to be a larger factor.  11.g4  b5  12.g5  Here the old main-line is  12...b4  and there is a masterpiece by Vishy Anand against Sergey Karjakin there, perhaps one of the most inspiring Najdorf games of all time, played in 2006. Ever since, White has found some other tries there, though, that is a lot less risky. Nowadays more trendy is the simpler move  12...Nh5  and theory here is growing. This is definitely a fine and reliable line and one that I played myself once, against Peter Leko, who I consider to be one of the greatest English Attack specialists. But again, for practical reasons, I chose to recommend the h5 complex. }
10. Nd5
{ The main and the most principled move. Here I will recommend  10...Nxd5  but I also want to offer an alternative in  10...Bxd5!?  with a very creative but a somewhat dubious idea that I wanted to play against Levon Aronian in a blitz game, which can serve you as a fun surprise weapon for one or two games.   10.O-O-O  White can always play this setup, also against the Be6 h5 system without Be7. We will examine it carefully.   10.Be2  Is a clever idea to stay flexible, that we will also study in great detail. }

The counterplay can be on the kingside with the eventual f7-f5 push, or on the queenside, as the knight gets to c4 one day supported by the rook on c8 and sometimes the queenside pawns start advancing.

The e5 pawn is always weak. All in all enough compensation for White's dominance on the d4 square, especially as the wrong piece is dominating it the bishop and not the knight. }

8... Be6 9. Qd2 h5
{ A trendy and a fresh system, that I am happy to be recommending here. I played it myself a few times already, but also many other top players did, most notably it was the choice of Magnus Carlsen himself, who adopted it after encountering it against Ding Liren.  Now White is mostly choosing between three different setups  10.O-O-O  ,  10.Be2  and  10.Nd5 }
10. O-O-O
{ Obviously a very serious move. White just proceeds with his plan of castling long. It will be hard for White to start a kingside offensive, now that Black slowed it down immensely with the h5 push, but first of all, White can keep on trying, and secondly, White still got the Nd5 idea. }
10... Nbd7 11. Kb1
{ The most flexible move. White can of course start with some other, but he will eventually always need this useful move. Here Black has a choice between three very logical options. Black should definitely postpone  11...O-O  for now  12.Rg1  followed by the g4! sac is very dangerous, but the question is in which order to start the counterplay on the queenside  11...b5  ,  11...Rc8  , or  11...Qc7  first.   The important thing to realize is that White has a few ideas, against which we should be prepared. The main ones are the  11.Nd5  jump, switch to the f4 plan and finally waiting for us to castle and then blasting the kingside open with g4! Preparing g4 slowly, with g3 h3 and g4 seems too slow. }
11... Rc8
{ A very flexible move, though I can't say it is necessarily better than the alternatives. In some positions it is fine to play without Rc8, especially against the f4 setups that White does, when Black could just proceed with Qc7 b5 Nb6, keeping the rook on a8. So basically it is a matter of choice, but for now 11...Rc8 is the chosen one here, as to make Nd5 less attractive and be ready for the Bg5 h4 idea as well. }
12. Nd5 Bxd5 13. exd5 Nb6
{ Is a valid way to play. White can sac here the d5 pawn, but Black has a good version of a similar theoretical line, not having wasted a tempo on g6 here. }

10. O-O-O
{ Obviously a very serious move. White just proceeds with his plan of castling long. It will be hard for White to start a kingside offensive, now that Black slowed it down immensely with the h5 push, but first of all, White can keep on trying, and secondly, White still got the Nd5 idea. }

The important thing to realize is that White has a few ideas, against which we should be prepared.

10. Be2

12. exd5 Qc7
{ It is by no means the only move, but a very clever one for sure.

One other point behind playing Qc7 now and not after including short castles is that sometimes Black may want to go h4 Nh5 postponing short castle. }

13... O-O
{ Unlike after 13.c4 here the  13...a5  push is unattractive and it will be met by  14.a4!  and Bb5! so our options are to castle or start with 13...h4!? followed by Nh5, which is a serious alternative. }

16. Nc2 Qd8
{ Sudden change of plans, though with the knight coming to b5 anyway, the queen had to sooner or later move from c7 anyway. Now Black wants to trade the dark-squared bishops and push his kingside majority forward. }
17. Na3 Bg5 18. Nb5 Nc5 19. O-O f5
{ With a typical position for the Najdorf English Attack with h7-h5. White will somehow try to get the queenside majority going slowly, While Black will have some play on the kingside and the center. Our ideas include pushing the h-pawn further, and after trading the bishop, mobilizing all of our pieces and hitting in the center with f4 and e4. Should be fun. }

Now it is better to go for kingside play instead and so there is no need to push the White b3 knight with a4 to a1 where it wants to go anyway, as part of its journey to b5 via a1-c2-a3. }

Now White is mostly choosing between three different setups  10.O-O-O  ,  10.Be2  and  10.Nd5 }
10. Nd5
{ The main advantage of starting with this move is that White gets to see how Black will capture and then decide on his setup @@StartBracket@@Be2 O-O or O-O-O@@EndBracket@@ accordingly. }
10... Nxd5
{ This is definitely my main recommendation here, but I would like to give one spectacular new idea with  10...Bxd5  as an alternative. I am sure it will be a good surprise weapon to have on the side. }
11. exd5 Bf5
{ Now that White's queen has already moved to d2, the idea of trading Black's active light-squared bishop with Bd3 is not that attractive, as White will have to move his queen again after the capture and Black will then have an easy play after trading the dark-squared bishop as well with Bg5. White's main move here is Be2, intending O-O, but the immediate Na5!? is also possible, trying to get some grip on the queenside. }
12. Be2 { A very important tabia for this line. } 12... a5
{ Carlsen has played here the typical  12...Bh4+  , which would also be my choice if not for White's plans involving a long castle.   At the same time, just finishing the development with  12...O-O  and  13.--  Nd7  is not good either, as White will get a grip on the queenside with  14.Na5!  and push c4 b4 and so on, with the eventual c4-c5 breakthrough.  Instead of that, I propose a very new idea, that at the moment of writing these words still hasn't been seen in high level over the board games and that is to start with this side-pawn push. The idea is simple, as a5-a4 is an unpleasant threat, White has to stop the advance with a2-a4. Then we rob him of his Na5 idea and can finish our development with O-O and Nd7 without being subjected to the usual bind. }
13. a4 O-O 14. O-O
{ Castling long is not an option here for White, he will get crushed after Na6-Nb4. }
14... Nd7
{ An important position for our English Attack repertoire. Here there have been a couple of dozen correspondence games and they have chosen one of the two options, to play  15.Bb5  followed by c4 or, change the tune altogether and go for a concrete play on the kingside with  15.f4!? }
15. f4
{ A very critical move. The h5-pawn can sometimes turn out to be a target, and the trade of the e5 and f4 pawns allows White to gain control of the d4 square. However, upon some deeper analysis, it appears that Black has enough counterplay, as the d5 pawn is weak. He does have to be precise though. }
15... exf4
{ Black has a few alternatives here, that I believe also work out in the end, but I have decided to go with the most direct and straightforward approach. }
16. Bxf4
{ White has a few ideas at the moment, most notably Bxh5 and Nd4, so it seems logical to play Bg6 here, dodging both, which is also how almost all correspondence games so far continued. However, I propose a more direct approach going after the d5 pawn and at times giving up the h5 pawn for active piece play. }
16... Rc8
{ Is actually a novelty at this point and an important one too. It seems the concrete variations work out for Black and the nature of the game in the lines I am about to propose is completely different than in the correspondence games that were played here after the slow  16...Bg6  Currently, the c2 pawn is under attack. }
17. c3 Nf6
{ Intending Be4 and going after the d5 pawn immediately, without any Bg6 type retreats. White has a lot of ways to play here, let's examine them one by one. }
18. Rae1 { This mobilizing move is also pretty challenging. } 18... Be4
{ The usual recipe; going after the d5 pawn. Now  19.Nd4  transposes to a position we look at inthe 18.Nd4 move order, but White has another critical move and that is, to simply protect the d5 pawn. }
19. c4
{ While this was bad earlier, on move 17, here it is a lot better, as the bishop on e4 is now misplaced, having no purpose once the d5 pawn is defended and the move Rae1 is a huge tempo for White. }
19... Qb6+ 20. Nd4 Bg6
{ We have to retreat, the bishop was doing nothing on e4 any longer. } 21. Bf3
{ Both protecting the e4 square and attacking the e7 bishop. Now a forced line ensues. }
21... Rxc4 22. Rxe7 Rxd4 23. Rxb7 { White has to see this shot in advance. }
23... Qxb7 24. Qxd4
{ White has got bishop pair and currently attacks the d6 pawn, but we will have our play as well- }
24... Qa6
{ A very elegant way to protect the d6 pawn. The queen can also be useful, on a6, ready to jump to d3 or e2 in the near future. Currently, we want to activate our rook with Re8 or Rc8 and White can't stop both. }
25. Re1 Rc8 26. Be2 { Critical, chasing our queen away. } 26... Qb7 27. Bxd6
{ Now if we were to take on d5 with a queen the endgame would be quite dangerous for us, but there is a finesse here, that solves all of Black's problems at once. }
27... Rd8
{ Regaining the d5 pawn with the rook and keeping the queens on the board. With the pawn structure on the kingside, Black tends to have a safer king than White and so keeping the queens on the board is in Black's favor. }

22. g3 Nxd5 23. Nxd5 Be6
{ It is important to stay engaged with the d5 knight. The point here is that White will have a very hard time maintaining control of both, his open king and the d5 square. Black will slowly but surely grab control over the a-file and at the right moment capture the knight. White should probably be careful and try to simplify into an equal endgame with Qa7-Qc7 before it is too late. }

{ The most popular move and a logical one too, White wants to push the pawn to g4 and then relocate the knight to g3. }
7... h5
{ By far the main move and understandably so. Stopping g2-g4 is a huge deal, not just to stop g4 in itself, but much more important not to allow White to employ the e2 knight harmoniously to g3. Previously there have been just two theoretical moves here,  8.g3   and  8.Bg5  but by now more moves started popping up here. }
8. Bg5 Be6
{ Intending Nbd7.   8...Be7  would be met with  9.Ng3!  with Nf5 looming and  9...g6  is then met with  10.Bc4!  when White takes firm control over the d5 square. }
9. Bxf6
{ The main move, White gives up the bishop and installs a complete dominance over the d5 square. There are a few alternatives here. }
9... Qxf6 10. Nd5 Qd8
{ Black had to waste some time moving the queen back and forth, but the bishop pair was worth it. Now White has two plans, the simple Nec3-Bc4 development scheme and a system that has briefly been very trendy- the ambitious Qd3 O-O-O setup. }
11. Qd3
{ This was very popular at some point, in particular, thanks to the efforts of Vishy Anand. I can understand the allure of having that strong knight on d5. Still, I appreciate our bishop pair and the attacking potential against the White king that will castle long. }
11... Nd7
{ Black's setup is to fianchetto the f8 bishop and then start the queenside play. The knight will develop to c5, gaining a tempo on the d3 queen. }
12. O-O-O g6 13. Kb1 Nc5 14. Qf3 Bg7 15. Nec3 b5
{ This was a topical position at the highest of levels, not surprisingly, as White was clearly attracted by the strong knight on d5. At the same time, Black has the bishop pair and has some clear potential to start the play against the White king on the queenside. It is quite hard for White to get anything going on the kingside, without his dark-squared bishop, and often, even if he gets to push g2-g4, there is no clear follow-up. }
16. Ne3
{ The most frequently played move, but it doesn't seem very theoretically challenging. The idea is to regroup the knights and send the other knight to d5. Also, Rg1 g4 followed by an Nf5 sacrifice is in theory attractive. In reality, though, Black has many ways of getting good counterplay, after Black castles, there are some quick f7-f5 ideas, opening the long diagonal, but also the simple idea of Bh6 Kg7 is pretty good, taking control of the key dark squares. }

19. Nf5 { Is an empty shot } 19... Bg5

{ This used to be one of the main tabias at the high level and it is still regularly played. I have also come across this line a lot in my online games- I think it is quite popular at various levels. Here Black has an abundance of options. There is of course the usual development scheme with Be7 Be6 Nbd7, when White goes a2-a4 at some point, and getting b7-b5 push will be a challenge. There are also lines where Black pushes b5 early on, either now immediately or after first playing Be6 or Be7, both of which I had employed myself. Finally, there is a setup with Nbd7 first, with or without including Be7 Bg2, when White usually responds with a4 stopping b5, and then Black has to develop the c8 bishop with a more modest- b7-b6 move.   I think pretty much all of these systems are very playable, but I will go with  8...Be7  9.Bg2  b5  setup, something I have played myself in the last tournament game I had so far here, against Nepo. }

18. O-O-O Bxe2 19. Qxe2 Rxh4
{ And the position is very unclear. White has some compensation for the pawn, as our king is somewhat uncertain of its future, but without the knight, I don't think he has that much dynamic potential here. }

{ The most popular move and a logical one too, White wants to push the pawn to g4 and then relocate the knight to g3. }
7... h5
{ By far the main move and understandably so. Stopping g2-g4 is a huge deal, not just to stop g4 in itself, but much more important not to allow White to employ the e2 knight harmoniously to g3. Previously there have been just two theoretical moves here,  8.g3   and  8.Bg5  but by now more moves started popping up here. }
8. g3
{ This used to be one of the main tabias at the high level and it is still regularly played. I have also come across this line a lot in my online games- I think it is quite popular at various levels. Here Black has an abundance of options. There is of course the usual development scheme with Be7 Be6 Nbd7, when White goes a2-a4 at some point, and getting b7-b5 push will be a challenge. There are also lines where Black pushes b5 early on, either now immediately or after first playing Be6 or Be7, both of which I had employed myself. Finally, there is a setup with Nbd7 first, with or without including Be7 Bg2, when White usually responds with a4 stopping b5, and then Black has to develop the c8 bishop with a more modest- b7-b6 move.   I think pretty much all of these systems are very playable, but I will go with  8...Be7  9.Bg2  b5  setup, something I have played myself in the last tournament game I had so far here, against Nepo. }
8... Be7 9. Bg2 b5
{ The good thing about systems with b5 is that at least we got b5 in, already. }
10. Nd5
{ This is the cultured move, otherwise Black will have a very comfortable game, having pushed b5 already and with White still not solving his issues of the e2 knight. }
10... Nxd5
{ The other line  10...Nbd7  is also very serious, but I chose this one. Black loses some time on the awkward move  11.--  11...Ra7  but White's queen on d5 is misplaced and he will have to spend a couple of tempi to regroup. }

12... Rb7
{ This is a very smart move. It is a lot more tempting to play Be6 with a tempo and then choose Rb7 or Rd7, but the point is, White most likely wants to drop the queen back anyway, while for Black it is better to keep the flexibility, as he often wants to develop Nd7-Nf6 first and keep the bishop on c8 for the time being. White's most obvious idea here is to regroup with Qd2 Nc3-Nd5, but there are also other ways to play, such as castling long and trying to push the kingside pawns, which is a lot riskier. }
13. Qd2
{ There are a lot of transpositions here, but most of the games featured one of the two obvious plans, either to castle long or to go for O-O Qd2 Nc3 setup in some order or the other. }
13... Nd7 14. b3

{ The most popular move and a logical one too, White wants to push the pawn to g4 and then relocate the knight to g3. }
7... h5
{ By far the main move and understandably so. Stopping g2-g4 is a huge deal, not just to stop g4 in itself, but much more important not to allow White to employ the e2 knight harmoniously to g3. Previously there have been just two theoretical moves here,  8.g3   and  8.Bg5  but by now more moves started popping up here. }
8. g3
{ This used to be one of the main tabias at the high level and it is still regularly played. I have also come across this line a lot in my online games- I think it is quite popular at various levels. Here Black has an abundance of options. There is of course the usual development scheme with Be7 Be6 Nbd7, when White goes a2-a4 at some point, and getting b7-b5 push will be a challenge. There are also lines where Black pushes b5 early on, either now immediately or after first playing Be6 or Be7, both of which I had employed myself. Finally, there is a setup with Nbd7 first, with or without including Be7 Bg2, when White usually responds with a4 stopping b5, and then Black has to develop the c8 bishop with a more modest- b7-b6 move.   I think pretty much all of these systems are very playable, but I will go with  8...Be7  9.Bg2  b5  setup, something I have played myself in the last tournament game I had so far here, against Nepo. }
8... Be7 9. Bg2 b5
{ The good thing about systems with b5 is that at least we got b5 in, already. }
10. Nd5
{ This is the cultured move, otherwise Black will have a very comfortable game, having pushed b5 already and with White still not solving his issues of the e2 knight. }
10... Nxd5
{ The other line  10...Nbd7  is also very serious, but I chose this one. Black loses some time on the awkward move  11.--  11...Ra7  but White's queen on d5 is misplaced and he will have to spend a couple of tempi to regroup. }
11. Qxd5 Ra7 12. Be3
{ There are alternatives, but this move is by far the most natural, developing the bishop with a tempo. }
12... Rb7
{ This is a very smart move. It is a lot more tempting to play Be6 with a tempo and then choose Rb7 or Rd7, but the point is, White most likely wants to drop the queen back anyway, while for Black it is better to keep the flexibility, as he often wants to develop Nd7-Nf6 first and keep the bishop on c8 for the time being. White's most obvious idea here is to regroup with Qd2 Nc3-Nd5, but there are also other ways to play, such as castling long and trying to push the kingside pawns, which is a lot riskier. }
13. Qd2
{ There are a lot of transpositions here, but most of the games featured one of the two obvious plans, either to castle long or to go for O-O Qd2 Nc3 setup in some order or the other. }
13... Nd7 14. Nc3 Nf6 15. a3 O-O
{ It is possible to try and postpone this move and start with Be6 or a5, but I don't think Black should really be scared of White's 16.g4 idea. }

17. Bf3 { Preparing Rg1 and getting ready to create threats along the g-file. }
17... a5 18. Rg1
{ White is trying to scare us here and at the same time keeps both the options- gxh5 and g5 as well. }
18... b4 19. axb4 axb4
{ Black can also take with the rook, but then after b3 Black has to deal with the threat of g5. }
20. Nd5 Bxd5
{ Taking with the knight is also possible, but I like keeping the knight. } 21.
exd5 e4 22. Bd1
{ Very similar is  22.Be2  but as White anyway doesn't want to castle long with the a-file open, this move seems a tad more precise. }
22... Nd7
{ The knight regroups itself to e5, while   23.gxh5  is not the end of the world, as Black will stabilize his kingside with his bishop after  Bf6!.  The position is very complicated and Black has trumps of his own. }

{ This modest system throughout the times has remained one of the most commonly played systems on all levels. White is focussing on the kingside development, wants to modestly develop his  f1  bishop, get the king out of the centre, and see how to proceed later.  Here there are @@StartBracket@@as so often!@@EndBracket@@ two conceptually different ways to play with Black, but those who have been through the previous chapters already know that I will recommend the Fischer-style  6...e5  push as opposed to the  6...e6  Scheveningen setup.  The Scheveningen setup is very playable here, obviously, but beware, if you want to play it, you not only have to deal with  7.O-O  but also with plans involving the long castle after  7.Be3 }
6... e5
{ Here White has almost exclusively played  7.Nb3  at the highest level and  7.Nf3  was considered a rookie mistake until it has been reintroduced to the highest level a few years ago by Magnus Carlsen and it caught in popularity.   The thing is, the knight seemed to be blocking the f2 pawn, but in fact in the position after  7.Nf3  Be7  8.Bg5  Be6  9.Bxf6  Bxf6  the knight stands at the very least as well on f3 as it does on b3.   And although from the stats I had done, at the club and amateur level I would still expect you to face  7.Nb3  almost ten times more often than  7.Nf3  , I think it is important to know what we are aiming for here as well. }

10. Qd3 Be7 11. Nd5 Nd7 12. O-O-O
{ It is interesting to play the same structure with White having castled long, but while White has more freedom now when it comes to pushing his pawns on the kingside, our potential play on the queenside will be even more unpleasant to face, now that the White king is there. }
12... Bxd5 13. Qxd5 Qc7
{ Most people so far have played this move here, but it is also possible to play  13...Qb6  , with the same idea of guarding the b7 pawn. }
14. Qc4
{ Is the subtle inclusion suggested by the engines, but understandably as it looks artificial it is played a lot less often. Here Black has a choice, he can go back to d8, or b8, but also Qb6 is possible, pointing at the f2 pawn. }
14... Qb6
{ Honestly, a random pick. The two alternatives are equally valid. That said, going for an endgame seems less good here, now that White's king is on the queenside and can take part in fighting for some queenside squares later on, as the endgame progresses. }

{ A rook belongs on the semi-open c-file in the Najdorf! } 17. Qd3 Rc7
{ Stepping out of Bg4. We don't want to allow the trade of White's bishop for our knight here, as it would weaken our control over the d5 square. }
18. c3 Rb8
{ I like this subtle flexible move. Black sets his rook up in advance and wants to choose where to move the queen and push b5. Our play is easy- we play against the king! }

21. f5 { Stops our Nh6 idea. } 21... Nxe3 22. Qxe3 Bf6
{ Blocking the f5 pawn and placing the bishop on the long diagonal. White's knight on a5 is odd and his position is very uncoordinated. Black is much better here, fully mobilized and intending to come after the weak f5 and c4 pawns. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bc4
{ 6.Bc4 in the Najdorf is a dangerous weapon that Fischer used to employ and it remains popular at the amateur and club level. Contrary to the Fischer-Sozin Attack in the Classical Sicilian where the knight is already on c6 and the pawn is still on a7, Black has a lot more flexibility in his queenside development.   This variation is not seen too much at the high level anymore, but Black should know his move orders not to get into trouble. White's bishop is aimed at the e6 pawn, which is good on one hand, but on the other, as long as the e6 pawn is well defended, the bishop could end up being a bad piece. }
6... e6
{ Here White has a lot of different plans. First of all, there are a few ways of dealing with the c4 bishop situation. White can play simply  7.Bb3  or try  7.a4  or  7.a3  ideas to drop the bishop to a2.  White also has a big choice in terms of what to do with his king. The old main-line is to castle short and develop with Qf3, while in the latest high-level games White would more often try to go for English Attack type ideas with Be3 Qe2/Qd2 and O-O-O. }
7. Bg5
{ I don't think I can make sense of this move here. White plays both Bg5 and Bc4 systems in one. If White wants to castle long, then Be3 is a move preferred setup, as the bishop is in the way of the g-pawn.  7.Bb3  b5  8.Bg5  makes a little more sense and will be studiedhere. }

White can play simply  7.Bb3  or try  7.a4  or  7.a3  ideas to drop the bishop to a2.  White also has a big choice in terms of what to do with his king. The old main-line is to castle short and develop with Qf3, while in the latest high-level games White would more often try to go for English Attack type ideas with Be3 Qe2/Qd2 and O-O-O. }
7. Bb3 b5
{ Not  7...Be7  which would be a very natural mix up, because of  8.g4!   After  7...b5  White has a choice, whether to castle short or prepare the long castle, while  8.g4?!  can be met with  8...b4! }
8. Be3 Be7
{ This is the most universal move. We are yet to decide whether we want to develop the c8 bishop to b7 or d7. }
9. Qe2
{ Both Dubov and Kramnik started with this move and it makes sense. The move f2-f3 may be unnecessary if White gets g4 quickly and prevent b4 with a3. }
9... O-O 10. a3 Bb7
{ Also possible to play is  10...Qc7  and Nc6 next, but I like this natural development here. Black gains a tempo on forcing f2-f3, which White otherwise would have avoided @@StartBracket@@which is why here  10...Bd7  would be not a good idea@@EndBracket@@. }
11. f3 Nc6 12. O-O-O Na5
{ Another idea is to prepare the b5-b4 push with  12...Qb8  or  12...Rb8  , but I like this a lot too. The queen on e2, as compared to the queen on d2 is not protecting the c3 knight, which is a fun fact that we are going to exploit here. }
13. g4 Rc8 14. Kb1 Nd7
{ We can sacrifice right away, but this move is more flexible. } 15. h4
{ If White tries avoiding the sacrifice with a move like  15.Bd2  we will send the second knight to c4 with  15...Ne5 }
15... Rxc3 16. bxc3 Nb6
{ Black has excellent compensation for the exchange here. Usually, White's b3 bishop would keep the queenside together in such cases, but here we have both knights heading towards the c4 square, which is more than one bishop can handle. White's kingside play meanwhile is quite slow. }

7. Nb3

Alternatively  16...f6  is very interesting, giving that f7 square for the bishop. But I like this modest h6 move, we are preparing to meet f5 with capturing on b3 and Bg5! }
17. f5 Bxb3 18. cxb3 Bg5

{ This is a very positional system, that is really not very ambitious, yet very solid for White. He shows that he doesn't intend to castle long in this game, making both the Scheveningen setups with  6...e6  and the Dragon with  6...g6  more attractive.  Yet, he wants to restrain our queenside play and get a decent version of 6.Be2 e5 7.Nf3/6.Be3 e5 7.Nf3 lines.  I still think  6...e5  is perfectly fine here and I stay true to the philosophy of this course: whenever I can recommend  6...e5  I will recommend it.  We have to rely on this pawn structure in the Najdorf. Needless to say, if you are into Scheveningen or the Dragon structures,  6. a4 is probably one of the best lines to do so against. }
6... e5 7. Nf3

It is also possible to do some clever stuff like  7...h6  , avoiding  8.Bg5  , but I like the simple approach to develop quickly. }

8... Be6
{ We can also castle first, it mostly doesn't matter, but I like clarifying things first. Now White has a few options  9.Bb3  ,  9.Ba2  and  9.Qe2  , the differences are not too big, but in all cases, mainly we just have to be careful about Bxe6 Ng5 and develop accurately. }
9. Qe2
{ The most popular move, not yet determining where to place the bishop and waiting for Black to attack the c4 bishop one more time before deciding. }
9... Qc8
{ I like this funky idea here. In case White goes for  10.Ba2  we will go for  10...Nc6  and Nb4 and the queen will be better placed on c8, ready to go to e6 and support the d5 push, just like in the9.Ba2-line.   As for the  10.Bb3  retreat, we will anyway go for  10...Nbd7  and Nc5 and the queen will go towards c6 if needed. }
10. Ba2
{ Each bishop retreat has its own disadvantages. This one gets hit by Nc6-Nb4. }
10... Nc6
{ Heading towards b4. Starting with  10...h6  is also possible, but we have a good response in case of 11.Bg5. }
11. Bg5
{ Principled. Now we shouldn't allow White to trade our f6 knight for the bishop and establish control over the d5 square. }
11... Nb4
{ A good tempo move, as  12.Bxf6  is now met with  12...Nxa2!  intermezzo. }
12. Bb3 Bxb3
{ The direct  12...Nh5  is also possible, but trading the bishops first gives more clarity. }
13. cxb3 Nh5

14. g3
{ Guarding the f4 square, as the direct  14.Bxe7  would be met by  14...Nf4!  with a tempo. }
14... Bxg5
{ We are always happy to trade the bishops, as long as we keep our knight. }
15. Nxg5 Nf6
{ And the d5 square is well controlled and there is nothing to worry about in this position. We don't at all mind to have traded all the bishops, as these trades don't affect our control over the d5 square negatively at all. }

{ This is the point of the system. Of course White can play Nf3 or Nb3, but then he just has a strange version of the 6. Be2 e5 lines, as the bishop on d3 is not any better placed than on e2.   Black's play there is standard, we go Be7 O-O and then develop our queenside with Be6 Nbd7 Rc8 and so on. That's the good thing about this pawn structure, no matter what weird moves White throws at us, we have our familiar harmonious development scheme. }
7... Be7
{ There already are alternatives here, with Black coming up with subtle ideas like  7...Nc6!?  or  7...Be6!?  in order to be very subtle. Definitely possible to look into it, but I will try to keep things simple here. }
8. O-O Be6
{ This order has been played by many strong players as well, including one of the biggest Najdorf experts- Lenier Dominguez. The idea is to meet  9.Ng3  with  9...Nc6  when White doesn't have  10.Nd5  move because after we take twice, Bxh7 discovery doesn't come with a check. }
9. f4 { Here pushing is very logical. } 9... exf4
{ We can go for this position. The structure is quite standard and White has a pretty fine version with a knight on f4, but the position remains very decent for Black, thanks to our dark square control and the e5 outpost. }
10. Nxf4 Nc6 { We want to plan this knight on e5 as fast as possible. } 11. Be3
{ The bishop belongs on the diagonal. } 11... Ne5
{ It's better to start with this move, as Nxe6 Bc4 followed by Na4 tricks were there when we castle first. }
12. a4
{ White has a lot of options from now on and this position is hard to exhaust in one chapter. I will just look at what I find the most principled looking. The a4-a5 grip certainly makes sense, not allowing Black to expand on the queenside. }
12... O-O
{ The good thing, Black has a clear plan, which is Nfd7 Bg5 with or without Rc8 depending on White's move order. }
13. Bd4
{ Is a reasonable move order, getting out of the g5-e3 pin much in advance. }
13... Nfd7
{ I don't think we should spend a move on  13...Rc8  here just yet. } 14. Ncd5
Bg5
{ We are happy to have activated the bishop. Now we can capture the d3 bishop, or d5 or f4 knight at any moment and White has to reckon with that on every move. }

14... Bg5 15. Bd4
{ After  15.c3  we can use the X-ray of the g5 and e3 bishops to our advantage and trade them with  15...Bxd5!?  16.Nxd5  Bxe3  17.Nxe3  with approximate equality, thanks to our powerful e5 knight. Next we can trade on d3 and Ne5 or the more interesting  17...b6!?  fighting for the dark squares on the queenside. }
15... Nc5
{ The extra option here, that we have gained by delaying Rc8. Now we don't allow White to hide his bishop on c2 with c3 Bc2 idea and it is harder for White to come up with a next move. We, in our turn, want to play Rc8 and we are always ready to simplify with Ncxd3 and Bxf4 and so on. At the end of the day, the e5 knight remains the pride of our position. }

Black's play there is standard, we go Be7 O-O and then develop our queenside with Be6 Nbd7 Rc8 and so on. That's the good thing about this pawn structure, no matter what weird moves White throws at us, we have our familiar harmonious development scheme. }

9... Be6

Black players also tried being clever here and I once tried  9...Bg4!?  here against Sergey Karjakin, trying to confuse White's pieces before going back to e6, while Alireza Firouzja tried  9...Re8  here, which is a semi-waiting move, also against Karjakin and went on to win a nice game. These two options deserve further investigation, but I will stick to the main-line here. }

12. a4

12... Nbd7 13. a5 Nxd5
{ Also possible is to play  13...b5!?  as was played in the game or  13...h5!?  intending to push away the knight from g3. Both are a lot more complex than this simple capture. }
14. Bh6 { Useful to toss this one in. } 14... Re8 15. Be4
{ Also winning back the pawn was  15.Bxg6  , but then Black would have easy play after  15...hxg6  16.Qxd5  Qc7  followed by Qc6, having an extra central pawn. }
15... Nc7
{ The knight is quite well placed here, guarding the a6 pawn and ready to jump to e6 later on. }
16. Bxb7 Rb8 17. Bc6 { White is trying to tie us down. } 17... Ne6
{ Getting the knight back into the game and intending Qc7, kicking away the unpleasant c6 bishop. }
18. Ne4 { Bringing the knight to the centre. } 18... Qc7
{ Hitting the bishop. } 19. Bd5 Nf6 { Getting rid of the strong e4 knight. }
20. Nxf6+ Bxf6
{ For now b2 is hanging, but we also want to Rb5 putting pressure on the a5 pawn and Nf4/Nd4 are potential ideas. }
21. b3 { Is quite testing, having Bc4 in mind. } 21... Nd4
{ Attacking c2, but also fighting for the d5 square. } 22. Bc4 Qb7
{ Preparing the d5 push. } 23. c3 d5
{ And we broke through the light square grip and the arising complications lead to equality after we trade the knight for the bishop. }

That is why I once tried  6...Nbd7!?  first and only after  7.O-O  did I go  7...g6!?

Black's play there is standard, we go Be7 O-O and then develop our queenside with Be6 Nbd7 Rc8 and so on. That's the good thing about this pawn structure, no matter what weird moves White throws at us, we have our familiar harmonious development scheme. }

Unlike the systems with the knight on b3, I don't think the plans related to Ne8 Bg5 and f5 are working all too well.

The dragon setups used to be very popular here, with  6...g6  and it still remains one of the main ways of playing, but at some point, White had discovered that he can still go for the f3 Be3 Qd2 O-O-O plan, which turned out to be quite poisonous.   That is why I once tried  6...Nbd7!?  first and only after  7.O-O  did I go  7...g6!?   Anyway, all these are playable, but I stay true to my philosophy in this course, of recommending the e5 structure whenever possible. }
6... e5 { This remains the main move here. } 7. Nde2
{ This is the point of the system. Of course White can play Nf3 or Nb3, but then he just has a strange version of the 6. Be2 e5 lines, as the bishop on d3 is not any better placed than on e2.   Black's play there is standard, we go Be7 O-O and then develop our queenside with Be6 Nbd7 Rc8 and so on. That's the good thing about this pawn structure, no matter what weird moves White throws at us, we have our familiar harmonious development scheme. }
7... Be7
{ There already are alternatives here, with Black coming up with subtle ideas like  7...Nc6!?  or  7...Be6!?  in order to be very subtle. Definitely possible to look into it, but I will try to keep things simple here. }
8. O-O O-O
{ Here too, there is definitely a point in starting with  8...Be6.  The idea is to meet  9.Ng3  with  9...Nc6  and then there is no  10.Nd5  jump because after  10...Nxd5  11.exd5  Bxd5  there is no Bxh7+. The bishop on e6, however, is exposed to the f4 push, so there are some downsides there as well. I will show both options. }
9. Ng3
{ The main move, but there are also alternatives. Pushing f4 when the bishop is not on e6 is @@StartBracket@@as usual@@EndBracket@@ somewhat premature, but a waiting move like  9.h3!?  makes sense. }
9... Be6
{ The most natural and healthy move, but it does allow the 10.Nd5 resource. Black players also tried being clever here and I once tried  9...Bg4!?  here against Sergey Karjakin, trying to confuse White's pieces before going back to e6, while Alireza Firouzja tried  9...Re8  here, which is a semi-waiting move, also against Karjakin and went on to win a nice game. These two options deserve further investigation, but I will stick to the main-line here. }
10. Nd5
{ The only really critical continuation. If White makes an empty move, we will happily develop with Nbd7 or even Nc6. }
10... Bxd5
{ This is the main move and leads to one of the typical double edged Najdorf structures. Alternatively, I discovered that Black can also 'fall' for it and capture on d5 twice. }
11. exd5 g6
{ Stopping Nf5 first and intending to follow up with the development of the b8 knight with Nbd7. }
12. c4
{ The main-move, reinforcing the d5 pawn and trying to get the majority going. White can also include  12.Bh6  Re8  , it will transpose to 12.c4 anyway after  13.c4  Nbd7 }
12... Nbd7
{ Finishing the development. This is a fascinating tabia, similar to some variations of the @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be2  e5  7.Nb3  or @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6@@EndFEN@@  6.Be3  e5  7.Nb3  systems, with the nuance, that the knight which is usually badly placed on b3 is now placed less badly on g3.   This gives White a lot easier play than in the aforementioned systems, but it seems Black still has enough counterplay here and I like the dark-squared potential we have here. Unlike the systems with the knight on b3, I don't think the plans related to Ne8 Bg5 and f5 are working all too well. After Ne8 White plays Bh6 Ng7 Qd2 and f5 is met with f3 when f4 gives up the e4 square for the g3 knight.    At the same time, White will get to push the queenside quite quickly with b4. Instead, what Black usually aims for in this particular position is the b5!? counterplay, opening the files on the queenside and undermining the d5 pawn. And that makes sense, as because the White knight is not on b3 and thus not close to the c6 square, the plan of b7-b5 is particularly justified here. }
13. Bh6
{ The most often played move so far, but by no means necessary or best. } 13...
Re8
{ I am not sure Black minds to get this move for free and also we may now win a tempo on the h6 bishop with Bf8 next. }
14. Rc1
{ This has been played in 5 games. White wants to get ready for Black's queenside play and meet  14...Bf8  with  15.Bg5  h6  16.Be3  or Bd2  16...e4  17.Bb1!  when the rook on c1 and the bishop on b1 are ideally placed to meet the b5 break in the end of this line.  Still, at the end of the line, we can play b5 and having done some analysis on this too, it seems to me that Black can play this way as well. }
14... Nc5
{ The solution that Wojtaszek showed against Nepo in FIDE GP Moscow 2019. The variation mentioned with  14...Bf8  is also interesting, but this is more direct, Black wants to kick away White's bishop and prepare b5 push later. }
15. Bb1 a5
{ Just like in  15.Bc2  a5  , we want Nfd7 Bg5, but we also have Rb8-b5 idea if necessary. }
16. b3 { Intending a3-b4. } 16... Rb8
{ White's idea of a3 can now be met by b5!. } 17. f4
{ So far following Nepo - Wojtaszek. I repeat myself, but again, opening the f-file comes at a cost. White weakens his dark squares and we get the knight on e5 potentially. }
17... Bf8 { Is also complex, though it might be easier. } 18. Bg5 exf4
{ Otherwise f5 was a threat already, when we wouldn't have our e5 square. } 19.
Rxf4 Ncd7 { We need to go all out to defend the f6 knight. } 20. Qf3 Bg7 21.
Rf1
{ Now it seems as though we collapse under the tremendous pressure along the f-file, but it is not the case. }
21... Qb6+ 22. Kh1 Ne5 { And we get to regroup. } 23. Qd1 Nfd7
{ The position remains complex, but Black is fine here. Next, we want to start counterplay with a4! White has the spectacular  24.Nh5  but it is only enough for a draw after  24...gxh5  25.Qxh5  Nf8  26.Rxf7  Nxf7  27.Qxf7  Kh8  28.Bf6  Bxf6  29.Qxf6+  with a perpetual on the f6-f7 squares.   Also the simple  24...Bh8  is there. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bd3
{ This is a very old system that has not really been a thing for a long time until it became very popular at the highest level a few years ago when White discovered some new ideas here and there.  I still don't expect you to come across it all too often, but who knows your opponent's favourite player and/or streamer may have successfully employed a bunch of times and he may want to try it out too!  Jokes aside, Hikaru Nakamura has been very successful with it, but also other top players have tried it. The idea is to develop the bishop to d3 and keep the e2 square free for the knight.  The dragon setups used to be very popular here, with  6...g6  and it still remains one of the main ways of playing, but at some point, White had discovered that he can still go for the f3 Be3 Qd2 O-O-O plan, which turned out to be quite poisonous.   That is why I once tried  6...Nbd7!?  first and only after  7.O-O  did I go  7...g6!?   Anyway, all these are playable, but I stay true to my philosophy in this course, of recommending the e5 structure whenever possible. }
6... e5 { This remains the main move here. } 7. Nde2
{ This is the point of the system. Of course White can play Nf3 or Nb3, but then he just has a strange version of the 6. Be2 e5 lines, as the bishop on d3 is not any better placed than on e2.   Black's play there is standard, we go Be7 O-O and then develop our queenside with Be6 Nbd7 Rc8 and so on. That's the good thing about this pawn structure, no matter what weird moves White throws at us, we have our familiar harmonious development scheme. }
7... Be7
{ There already are alternatives here, with Black coming up with subtle ideas like  7...Nc6!?  or  7...Be6!?  in order to be very subtle. Definitely possible to look into it, but I will try to keep things simple here. }
8. O-O O-O
{ Here too, there is definitely a point in starting with  8...Be6.  The idea is to meet  9.Ng3  with  9...Nc6  and then there is no  10.Nd5  jump because after  10...Nxd5  11.exd5  Bxd5  there is no Bxh7+. The bishop on e6, however, is exposed to the f4 push, so there are some downsides there as well. I will show both options. }
9. Ng3
{ The main move, but there are also alternatives. Pushing f4 when the bishop is not on e6 is @@StartBracket@@as usual@@EndBracket@@ somewhat premature, but a waiting move like  9.h3!?  makes sense. }
9... Be6
{ The most natural and healthy move, but it does allow the 10.Nd5 resource. Black players also tried being clever here and I once tried  9...Bg4!?  here against Sergey Karjakin, trying to confuse White's pieces before going back to e6, while Alireza Firouzja tried  9...Re8  here, which is a semi-waiting move, also against Karjakin and went on to win a nice game. These two options deserve further investigation, but I will stick to the main-line here. }
10. Nd5
{ The only really critical continuation. If White makes an empty move, we will happily develop with Nbd7 or even Nc6. }
10... Bxd5
{ This is the main move and leads to one of the typical double edged Najdorf structures. Alternatively, I discovered that Black can also 'fall' for it and capture on d5 twice. }

12. c4

This gives White a lot easier play than in the aforementioned systems, but it seems Black still has enough counterplay here and I like the dark-squared potential we have here. Unlike the systems with the knight on b3, I don't think the plans related to Ne8 Bg5 and f5 are working all too well. After Ne8 White plays Bh6 Ng7 Qd2 and f5 is met with f3 when f4 gives up the e4 square for the g3 knight.    At the same time, White will get to push the queenside quite quickly with b4. Instead, what Black usually aims for in this particular position is the b5!? counterplay, opening the files on the queenside and undermining the d5 pawn. And that makes sense, as because the White knight is not on b3 and thus not close to the c6 square, the plan of b7-b5 is particularly justified here. }

Re8
{ I am not sure Black minds to get this move for free and also we may now win a tempo on the h6 bishop with Bf8 next. }
14. Rc1

Still, at the end of the line, we can play b5 and having done some analysis on this too, it seems to me that Black can play this way as well. }
14... Nc5
{ The solution that Wojtaszek showed against Nepo in FIDE GP Moscow 2019. The variation mentioned with  14...Bf8  is also interesting, but this is more direct, Black wants to kick away White's bishop and prepare b5 push later. }

10. Qd3
{ The second most popular move and a very common idea in this position, White frees the d4 square for the knight. }
10... Qa5
{ A strong idea, as this move is anyway useful, developing the queen and connecting the rooks, but now it also gives us an extra tempo, as White needs to do something about the g5 bishop, in order to proceed with the Nd4 idea. }
11. h4
{ A typical idea, White protects the bishop, but also wants to expand on the kingside. }
11... h6 { Forcing a decision from White. } 12. Bd2 Qa6
{ The key resource in this system. The endgame is roughly equal, as Black has excellent position overall, to compensate for the doubled a-pawns. }
13. Qxa6 bxa6 14. Rhe1 Rc8
{ Our c6 bishop is very powerful and White can't really exploit our damaged queenside. }

It is not that dangerous, in particular for players who aren't that experienced and want to improve their game, I would recommend, as White, to stay away from such slightly disharmonious systems.

{ This system used to be played mainly with the idea to pin the knight on c6 and then take it, develop with Nc3 Bg5 and castle long. Nowadays, some top players started playing it with different ideas, like dropping the queen back to e3 and simply finishing the development.   It is not that dangerous, in particular for players who aren't that experienced and want to improve their game, I would recommend, as White, to stay away from such slightly disharmonious systems. That said, as Najdorf players, we are always happy to face these systems, so let's see how to react. }
4... Nc6
{ I had played the  4...Nf6  move order against Carlsen and there are some subtle points there, but it is a lot easier to go for  4...Nc6  , with more clarity and much fewer transpositions.  Now White is choosing from 2 different concepts, the traditional  5.Bb5  and the rare  5.Qe3  which is a very odd-looking setup that has been played a lot at the highest level recently. }
5. Bb5
{ The old way of doing it, White pins the knight and doesn't want to waste time moving the queen again.   I expect this still to be the most common of the two on amateur and club level, despite that a lot of top players are trying these hypermodern Qe3 setups. }
5... Bd7
{ Here again White has a choice. The traditional way to go is to grab the knight and go for the quick long castle with Nc3 Bg5, while the more modern attempts are connected with the Maroczy bind. }

6... g6 { Just as good is to start with  6...Nf6 } 7. c4
{ Now the move order does not really matter much for us. White needs to play c4 Nc3 O-O and we go Bg7 Nf6 O-O. Not going for Maroczy bind at all is not a great idea for White at this point, as he will have less control over the centre. }

13... Nd7 { Setting up a trade on d4. } 14. Qe3
{ This is the most ambitious, trying to avoid forced lines. However, in order to avoid simplifications White had to discoordinate his pieces quite a bit. }
14... Rfe8
{ Setting up the e6-d5 break, and also Nf8-Ne6 becomes a possibility. } 15. b3
{ White needs to develop his c1 bishop somehow, so he goes for the fianchetto plan here. }
15... e6
{ This seems to equalize by force, but the less rough idea of  15...Nf8  and Ne6 is also playable and leads to a decent version of the Maroczy bind as White has fianchettoed his c1 bishop, which normally is better placed on e3. }
16. Bb2 d5 { Leads to a lot of trades. } 17. cxd5 exd5 18. Nxc6
{ White has to allow the queen trade. } 18... Qxe3
{ Trading queens first is the precise way to equalize. } 19. fxe3 bxc6 20. exd5

{ Is the point, trading the d7 knight for the c3 knight. } 22. Rxd7 Bxc3 23.
Bxc3 Rxc3
{ And the endgame is equal because  24.Rf1  Rf8  25.Rf6  can be met by  25...Rc2  26.Rxa6  Re8  , entering the second rank with both rooks with enough counterplay to maintain the balance. In rook endgame: activity first! }

In case you can't afford to allow a move repetition, which this move does, you can look into  13...Rg8!?  or even the direct  13...a6  , which leads to a complex endgame with White having a superior pawn structure, but us having the two bishops. }

15. Nf6+

Not long after that, I managed to win a nice game against Harikrishna with Black and redeemed the honor of the Najdorf Sicilian.   Amongst club players and amateurs too, this system keeps popping up every now and again, as White players try to surprise their opponents.   The idea is to keep the knight on b1 for now and get the Maroczy bind with c4. Chess, however, is a game of tempi and it is now Black to move. }
5... e5 { The most principled move. } 6. Nb3
{ The main move. Besides  6.Bb5+  there is also  6.Nb5  that is played sometimes, but it is really pointless after  6...a6  7.N5c3  Be6  , when it is not clear what that knight pirouette was about. }

From the various other options than  6...d5  , I would like to single out  6...a5!?  , which contains a remarkable trap I learnt about just a few days ago when watching some random tournament commentary. Apparently  7.c4?  is bad there because of  7...Nxe4!!  8.fxe4  Qh4+  and the point is that after  9.Kd2  suddenly the b3 knight is trapped after  9...a4!

{ This used to be a safe sideline for White, that has always been around at club and amateur level. Who doesn't like to give a check and castle as fast as possible?   But it wasn't until around a decade ago when it was picked up by the leading players, including Magnus Carlsen, that it suddenly became one of the most testing systems against the Najdorf. At first, it brought Black players a lot of problems, but by now slowly the solutions started crystallizing and the Najdorf fans have found various ways to deal with it. }
3... Nd7
{ I am going to recommend  3...Nd7.  To be honest, I think  3...Bd7  is a lot easier and would also take up a lot less space on the course, but I feel that it would be unfair to those who play Najdorf as a fighting weapon and want to get as complicated positions as possible.  3...Nd7  is more in the spirit!   After  3...Bd7  the main-line is  4.Bxd7  when Black again has a choice,  4...Qxd7  is the old main-line when White has two plans the one with c3-d4  5.O-O  Nf6  6.Re1  Nc6  7.c3  e6  8.d4   And the more critical c4 aiming for the Maroczy bind  5.c4  Nf6  6.Nc3  g6  7.d4  etc.   By now Black had figured out various ways of equalizing against it, I would recommend those interested to study the latest games at the highest level.  Another option is  4...Nxd7!?  which had become very popular at the high level recently. There too, White can either go for the centre with the c3-d4 idea or try for a Maroczy bind of sorts. And again, according to the latest high-level games Black holds his own. I for one used the  3...Bd7  4.Bxd7  Nxd7  line twice in a very important blitz tournament and scored 1½ out of 2 by drawing Magnus Carlsen and beating Maxime Vachier Lagrave with it.

4. d4
{ Another major move that has been around for a long time. White goes for some sort of an open Sicilian after all. }
4... cxd4 5. Qxd4
{ This is the point.  5.Nxd4  would just be a bad version of an open Sicilian Najdorf, when White would have an awkward bishop on b5. Here White centralizes the queen, using the fact that there is no longer the move Nc6 hitting the queen. }
5... a6 6. Be2
{ A fashionable sideline. White keeps the bishop, claims to have misplaced Black's b8 knight and hopes to get a Maroczy bind with c2-c4. }
6... Ngf6 7. O-O e5
{ Against the fianchetto with  7...g6  there is an idea of a quick 10.e5! after  8.Nc3  Bg7  9.Rd1  O-O  10.e5!  Instead, I propose we go for the Najdorf-like e5 setup here. }
8. Qe3 Nc5
{ It is also possible to go for  8...Ng4!?  and 9...Ngf6 back repetition. Black's idea is basically to stop White from getting c4 and Nc3 bind without having to retreat with Nfd2. }
9. Nfd2
{ Idea played by Carlsen. White wants to go for the bind after all, but this is clearly too artificial. }
9... Be7 { There are different ideas, but I propose the most simple setup. }
10. c4
{ White's point, now he has a bind, but he does lag behind in development. }
10... O-O 11. Nc3
{ Hammer tried the ultra subtle  11.h3?!  against Tari in European Club Cup in Antalya in 2017 and got thematically punished with  11...b5!  12.cxb5  d5!  when Black blasts the centre open and starts exploiting White's underdeveloped position and vulnerable queen on e3. }
11... Ng4 { It is not for nothing that Hammer wanted to prevent this with h3. }
12. Bxg4
{ Alternatively  12.Qf3  is met with  12...f5!   While  12.Qg3  is met with  12...Bh4  first.   In case of  12.Qh3  Black has  12...Nh6  back followed by f5 as well. }
12... Bxg4
{ White doesn't have a good way to unwind and keep control over both the b5 and the f5 break. I will give a sample line. }
13. Nb3 Nd7
{ Keeping the knights on the board and the e6 square for the bishop. } 14. Qd3
Be6 15. Be3 { White has just developed harmoniously, but now we hit him. }
15... f5
{ It is important to fight for the control over the e4-d5 squares and currently we want to start a King's Indian style attack with f4 Rf6 and so on. }
16. exf5 Bxf5 17. Qd5+ { Picking up the b7 pawn, but it will not be for free. }
17... Kh8 18. Qxb7 Bd3 { Winning our pawn back. } 19. Rfd1 Bxc4
{ Black has destroyed both of White's pawns that controlled the centre, the e4 and the c4 pawns and can face the future with confidence. }

{ This used to be a safe sideline for White, that has always been around at club and amateur level. Who doesn't like to give a check and castle as fast as possible?   But it wasn't until around a decade ago when it was picked up by the leading players, including Magnus Carlsen, that it suddenly became one of the most testing systems against the Najdorf. At first, it brought Black players a lot of problems, but by now slowly the solutions started crystallizing and the Najdorf fans have found various ways to deal with it. }
3... Nd7
{ I am going to recommend  3...Nd7.  To be honest, I think  3...Bd7  is a lot easier and would also take up a lot less space on the course, but I feel that it would be unfair to those who play Najdorf as a fighting weapon and want to get as complicated positions as possible.  3...Nd7  is more in the spirit!   After  3...Bd7  the main-line is  4.Bxd7  when Black again has a choice,  4...Qxd7  is the old main-line when White has two plans the one with c3-d4  5.O-O  Nf6  6.Re1  Nc6  7.c3  e6  8.d4   And the more critical c4 aiming for the Maroczy bind  5.c4  Nf6  6.Nc3  g6  7.d4  etc.   By now Black had figured out various ways of equalizing against it, I would recommend those interested to study the latest games at the highest level.  Another option is  4...Nxd7!?  which had become very popular at the high level recently. There too, White can either go for the centre with the c3-d4 idea or try for a Maroczy bind of sorts. And again, according to the latest high-level games Black holds his own. I for one used the  3...Bd7  4.Bxd7  Nxd7  line twice in a very important blitz tournament and scored 1½ out of 2 by drawing Magnus Carlsen and beating Maxime Vachier Lagrave with it.   Back to  3...Nd7  , White now has a lot of different options. }
4. d4
{ Another major move that has been around for a long time. White goes for some sort of an open Sicilian after all. }
4... cxd4 5. Qxd4
{ This is the point.  5.Nxd4  would just be a bad version of an open Sicilian Najdorf, when White would have an awkward bishop on b5. Here White centralizes the queen, using the fact that there is no longer the move Nc6 hitting the queen. }
5... a6 6. Bxd7+
{ Traditionally the main-move. White parts with his bishop, but gains time. }
6... Bxd7
{ Actually even  6...Qxd7!?  is not unplayable, as the queen later moves onwards to c6, but the natural bishop capture is more sound and easier. }
7. Nc3
{ Clever idea keeping the option of O-O-O, which is relevant in case we go for the Nf6 e6 plan @@StartBracket@@which we will not@@EndBracket@@. }
7... e5 8. Qd3 Rc8
{ The most universal option. Developing the knight prematurely with Nf6 allows the Bg5 pin, which is quite unpleasant here. }
9. O-O h6
{ It is possible to try and avoid playing h6, by making further useful moves like  9...Be6  and Qc7, but there is no need to be subtle, as this simple plan of h6 Nf6 works just fine. }
10. Nd2
{ Actually, there are many moves, but they usually just come down to the same thing. This makes sense before developing the f1 rook, as White threatens Nc4 first, when he may get to e3 without even having to play Re1/Rd1.  Against both  10.a4  and  10.Rd1  Black will just play  10...Nf6  and then Be7 Be6 O-O, the usual plan. }
10... Qc7
{ Also possible is to start with  10...Be6  , but then there is an option of  11.Nd5  Our move stops Nc4 and Nd5 and in general, is a useful move that can be part of our plan. }
11. Rd1 Bg4
{ This was a strong idea that I had employed against Michael Adams in London 2016. Black is trying to provoke the f2-f3 push. Which may appear useful in general, but there is concrete reasoning that later down the line White will have the d5! push and after Bc5 the knight on e3 will be pinned. }
12. f3 { Obviously the most critical. } 12... Be6 13. Nf1
{ White sends the knight to e3. } 13... Nf6 14. Be3
{ With the idea to move the bishop to f2 and bring the knight to e3 later fails to the direct central push. }
14... d5 15. Nxd5
{ Alternatively,  15.exd5  is met with  15...Rd8!  when Black regains the d5 pawn with an excellent position thanks to the bishop pair. }
15... Bxd5 16. exd5 Qxc2
{ And having got rid of the weak d6 pawn Black is looking forward to a pleasant endgame. }
17. Rac1 { Doesn't bring White much... } 17... Qxd3 18. Rxc8+
{ Intermezzo, but we had it anticipated. } 18... Kd7
{ Picking up the rook on the next move. } 19. Rxd3 Kxc8
{ With a comfortable endgame as the d5 pawn is a potential weakness. } *

{ This used to be a safe sideline for White, that has always been around at club and amateur level. Who doesn't like to give a check and castle as fast as possible?   But it wasn't until around a decade ago when it was picked up by the leading players, including Magnus Carlsen, that it suddenly became one of the most testing systems against the Najdorf. At first, it brought Black players a lot of problems, but by now slowly the solutions started crystallizing and the Najdorf fans have found various ways to deal with it. }
3... Nd7
{ I am going to recommend  3...Nd7.  To be honest, I think  3...Bd7  is a lot easier and would also take up a lot less space on the course, but I feel that it would be unfair to those who play Najdorf as a fighting weapon and want to get as complicated positions as possible.  3...Nd7  is more in the spirit!   After  3...Bd7  the main-line is  4.Bxd7  when Black again has a choice,  4...Qxd7  is the old main-line when White has two plans the one with c3-d4  5.O-O  Nf6  6.Re1  Nc6  7.c3  e6  8.d4   And the more critical c4 aiming for the Maroczy bind  5.c4  Nf6  6.Nc3  g6  7.d4  etc.   By now Black had figured out various ways of equalizing against it, I would recommend those interested to study the latest games at the highest level.  Another option is  4...Nxd7!?  which had become very popular at the high level recently. There too, White can either go for the centre with the c3-d4 idea or try for a Maroczy bind of sorts. And again, according to the latest high-level games Black holds his own. I for one used the  3...Bd7  4.Bxd7  Nxd7  line twice in a very important blitz tournament and scored 1½ out of 2 by drawing Magnus Carlsen and beating Maxime Vachier Lagrave with it.

14... Qa5 15. a3

15... Be7 { Improving on the game of Matlakov, Where he played  15...Rg8. } 16.
O-O-O O-O
{ Not fearing any ghosts on the kingside and keeping the option of doubling on the c-file or pushing for b5-b4. White doesn't have a clear way to use our far advanced g-pawn if he pushes his f-pawn with  17.f4  it will be met with  17...Rc6!  when Rfc8-Rxc3 is a serious threat that is hard to stop. }

4. a4
{ This is a playable line and I had introduced it into high level in a game against Vachier-Lagrave. There are many different setups Black can go for, but I managed to win an on-demand game here against Carlsen with a fianchetto setup, so I am afraid I will have to recommend that one.   Fortunately it is pretty decent as well. The idea of a4 is to slow down Black's queenside expansion with a6-b5 and after a6 to just drop the bishop back to e2 and then go for d4 or a5 grabbing space on the queenside and breaking the fluidity of Black's queenside pawn structure. }
4... Nf6 5. Nc3 g6
{ As promised, I am going with the fianchetto, which is what I did against Carlsen. Also possible is to play  5...a6  first and meet  6.Be2  with  6...b6.  White will then play  7.d4  and Black takes  7...cxd4  8.Qxd4  and then chooses whether to go for  8...e5  or  8...e6.  Both of which are playable. }
6. a5
{ Starting with  6.O-O  isn't going to change much, a5 is part of White's plan anyway. }
6... Bg7 7. O-O a6
{ I pushed a6 before allowing White to regroup with Re1 Bf1, though I don't think that is such a big deal. }
8. Be2
{ White can give up the bishop, but then we will happily take it  8.Bxd7  Nxd7  and follow up with the eventual b5! break, similar to the game. The same story happens after  8.Bc4  , when after  8...O-O  9.d3  b5  10.axb6  Nxb6  the bishop outside the d3-e4 pawn chain appears more active but is in fact a target for Black and is already attacked. }
8... O-O 9. Re1
{ The choice of Magnus. I believe White can start with  9.d3  as well, but the play is similar, as Black will blast the queenside open with  9...b5! }
9... b5 10. axb6 Bb7 { There is absolutely no rush in picking up the b6 pawn. }
11. d3 a5
{ Grischuk slightly fine-tuned my play with this cunning move. I like it, keeping both the options of Nxb6 as well as Qxb6.  11...Nxb6  was alright too and I will definitely add this game in the model games chapter.  Black's idea in this position is to slowly but surely push the a5 pawn towards a4 and start turning the tables on the queenside. It may soon be White's b2 pawn that is weak, not the Black isolated a-pawn. White in his turn slightly lacks active ideas here, although there is nothing wrong with his position and he is by no means worse at this point. }

{ This used to be a safe sideline for White, that has always been around at club and amateur level. Who doesn't like to give a check and castle as fast as possible?   But it wasn't until around a decade ago when it was picked up by the leading players, including Magnus Carlsen, that it suddenly became one of the most testing systems against the Najdorf. At first, it brought Black players a lot of problems, but by now slowly the solutions started crystallizing and the Najdorf fans have found various ways to deal with it. }
3... Nd7
{ I am going to recommend  3...Nd7.  To be honest, I think  3...Bd7  is a lot easier and would also take up a lot less space on the course, but I feel that it would be unfair to those who play Najdorf as a fighting weapon and want to get as complicated positions as possible.  3...Nd7  is more in the spirit!   After  3...Bd7  the main-line is  4.Bxd7  when Black again has a choice,  4...Qxd7  is the old main-line when White has two plans the one with c3-d4  5.O-O  Nf6  6.Re1  Nc6  7.c3  e6  8.d4   And the more critical c4 aiming for the Maroczy bind  5.c4  Nf6  6.Nc3  g6  7.d4  etc.   By now Black had figured out various ways of equalizing against it, I would recommend those interested to study the latest games at the highest level.  Another option is  4...Nxd7!?  which had become very popular at the high level recently. There too, White can either go for the centre with the c3-d4 idea or try for a Maroczy bind of sorts. And again, according to the latest high-level games Black holds his own. I for one used the  3...Bd7  4.Bxd7  Nxd7  line twice in a very important blitz tournament and scored 1½ out of 2 by drawing Magnus Carlsen and beating Maxime Vachier Lagrave with it.   Back to  3...Nd7  , White now has a lot of different options. }
4. c3
{ An old system that remains principled. White is going for the pawn centre with c3-d4 right away. In this line, White gets the pawn centre and we have to deal with it!   The play will often resemble a closed Spanish, but usually a good version for Black, as we are up a few tempi here, compared to the closed Spanish where Black spends a bunch of moves regrouping to get the ideal setup. }
4... Nf6 5. Bd3
{ The modern approach, but here Black can exploit the fact that he didn't need to push a6 and sometimes get b5 in one go, like I did in my game against Nepo which will end up in the model games chapter as well. }
5... g6
{ I propose we go for the fianchetto here. In general in the Spanish positions @@StartBracket@@with Black pawns e5 d6 vs White e4 d5@@EndBracket@@ it is often beneficial to have the bishop on g7, mainly because then the king is safer and the g6 pawn is guarding the f5 square. }
6. Bc2
{ Here I played  6...Bg7  first, but I like the idea of starting with b5 right away, not to allow a4 later on. }
6... b5 7. O-O { Logical, getting Re1 first before pushing d4. } 7... Bb7 8.
Re1 Bg7 9. d4 O-O
{ In general if Black gets to fianchetto the bishop to g7 in such a position and the e5 push doesn't bring White much, then Black should be happy. White does have a strong pawn centre, but we always have the idea of going for the closed Spanish structures with the e5 push and for that our pieces are already on ideal squares, with the knight being on d7 and the bishop on g7. }
10. a4
{ It's better to include this first. MVL against Nepo played  10.d5?!  here, but after Black did the natural Re8 and e6 push he got worse and went on to lose.   10.e5  immediately was played in Perez Ponsa - Sjugirov Online Blitz 2020, when Black should react in the same way as with the a4 a6 inclusion. }
10... a6 11. e5 { Now this should lead to equality. } 11... dxe5 12. dxe5 Ng4
{ Forcing White to push the e5 pawn forward. } 13. axb5
{ Trading some of the stuff first is good for White, to simplify the queenside somewhat. }
13... axb5 14. Rxa8 Bxa8 15. e6
{ White ruins our pawn structure, but it does open the f-file for our rook. }
15... fxe6 { There is some serious pressure along the f-file. } 16. h3
{ Now we can take with the rook as well as the bishop on f3. } 16... Bxf3
{ Is simplest. } 17. gxf3 Nh6 { The knight is heading towards f5. } 18. Rxe6
Nf5
{ And Black has a very stable position and good pieces. White has kingside weaknesses and is yet to finish his development. }

{ This used to be a safe sideline for White, that has always been around at club and amateur level. Who doesn't like to give a check and castle as fast as possible?   But it wasn't until around a decade ago when it was picked up by the leading players, including Magnus Carlsen, that it suddenly became one of the most testing systems against the Najdorf. At first, it brought Black players a lot of problems, but by now slowly the solutions started crystallizing and the Najdorf fans have found various ways to deal with it. }
3... Nd7
{ I am going to recommend  3...Nd7.  To be honest, I think  3...Bd7  is a lot easier and would also take up a lot less space on the course, but I feel that it would be unfair to those who play Najdorf as a fighting weapon and want to get as complicated positions as possible.  3...Nd7  is more in the spirit!   After  3...Bd7  the main-line is  4.Bxd7  when Black again has a choice,  4...Qxd7  is the old main-line when White has two plans the one with c3-d4  5.O-O  Nf6  6.Re1  Nc6  7.c3  e6  8.d4   And the more critical c4 aiming for the Maroczy bind  5.c4  Nf6  6.Nc3  g6  7.d4  etc.   By now Black had figured out various ways of equalizing against it, I would recommend those interested to study the latest games at the highest level.  Another option is  4...Nxd7!?  which had become very popular at the high level recently. There too, White can either go for the centre with the c3-d4 idea or try for a Maroczy bind of sorts. And again, according to the latest high-level games Black holds his own. I for one used the  3...Bd7  4.Bxd7  Nxd7  line twice in a very important blitz tournament and scored 1½ out of 2 by drawing Magnus Carlsen and beating Maxime Vachier Lagrave with it.   Back to  3...Nd7  , White now has a lot of different options. }
4. c3

{ I believe the setup with e6 is very fine too, but for those who are not too familiar with the closed Spanish positions it is better to develop the bishop to g7 and allow some e5-e6 complications rather than get a worse version of the closed positions. }
9. O-O Bg7
{ In terms of meeting the e4-e5 push it is always safer to include cxd4 cxd4 first, but I propose to play it in the most ambitious way and keep the c-pawns on the board.   The good thing for us is that if White doesn't go for the concrete play with e5 and just finishes the development with some Re1 Nbd2 plans, then we will have the best version of the closed Spanish we can possibly have, with the bishop already on g7. }
10. Rd1
{ Is also possible, keeping e5 in reserve. Here I propose to stop teasing White and address the threat of e5 with cxd4!?. }
10... cxd4
{ If we play  10...O-O  , which is also possible and principled, White has  11.e5!  Bxf3  12.Qxf3!  dxe5  13.dxc5!  with a very complex position. }
11. cxd4 O-O
{ Now  12.e5  has no point because of  12...Bxf3  and White can no longer recapture with the queen because after  13.Qxf3  dxe5  there is no pawn on c5 to be captured. }
12. a4
{ The weakness of the b5 pawn is compensated by pressure against e4 here. }
12... Qc7
{ More ambitious might be  12...Nb6!?  when Black keeps more tension and the position remains dynamically equal. White can never grab the b5 pawn because of the weakness of his e4 pawn. }
13. Bd3 e5
{ And Black equalised swiftly in David - Papaioannou, Greek Ch 2017. White can't just go after our weak b5 pawn, as he has to worry about his e4 pawn. }

White can play  10.Qe2  and again  10...g5  is less good. Instead I recommend to just finish the development, let White have his centre and enjoy the fact that the knight on a3 is misplaced. }
10. Bc2 O-O { We can't stop d2-d4 at this point. } 11. d4 cxd4 12. cxd4 b5
{ Using the awkward position of the a3 knight. The position certainly remains playable and White can be happy to have achieved his strong pawn centre, but with the knight so misplaced he can't claim an advantage and Black is bound to get good counterplay here. A well-timed d5!? or e5!? push is on the agenda. }

{ This used to be a safe sideline for White, that has always been around at club and amateur level. Who doesn't like to give a check and castle as fast as possible?   But it wasn't until around a decade ago when it was picked up by the leading players, including Magnus Carlsen, that it suddenly became one of the most testing systems against the Najdorf. At first, it brought Black players a lot of problems, but by now slowly the solutions started crystallizing and the Najdorf fans have found various ways to deal with it. }
3... Nd7

After  3...Bd7  the main-line is  4.Bxd7  when Black again has a choice,  4...Qxd7  is the old main-line when White has two plans the one with c3-d4  5.O-O  Nf6  6.Re1  Nc6  7.c3  e6  8.d4   And the more critical c4 aiming for the Maroczy bind  5.c4  Nf6  6.Nc3  g6  7.d4  etc.   By now Black had figured out various ways of equalizing against it, I would recommend those interested to study the latest games at the highest level.  Another option is  4...Nxd7!?  which had become very popular at the high level recently. There too, White can either go for the centre with the c3-d4 idea or try for a Maroczy bind of sorts. And again, according to the latest high-level games Black holds his own. I for one used the  3...Bd7  4.Bxd7  Nxd7  line twice in a very important blitz tournament and scored 1½ out of 2 by drawing Magnus Carlsen and beating Maxime Vachier Lagrave with it.

11. Qe2 Na5 12. Rd1 Nxb3 13. axb3 Qc8
{ A position like this should be good for Black. We traded the light-squared bishop and stopped Bg5-xf6 from happening. The d5 square can't be fully controlled by White and we have the a6-b5 idea in reserve, while we are also always on the lookout for a d6-d5 push, whenever White allows it. }

{ Is a direct transpose to the 6.Bc4 Najdorf. after d4, while if White doesn't push d4, he will have a very impotent position with a rather dumb bishop on the a2-f8 diagonal and the knight on f3 in front of the f2 pawn, which can't be advanced. }

4. Bb5+
{ Doesn't seem too challenging here. Now we can play the Bd7 line, compared to 3. Bb5+ White has already developed his knight to c3 which cuts out two of the most critical plans: the Maroczy bind with c4 and the c3-d4 idea grabbing the center. }
4... Bd7 5. Bxd7+
{ White usually trades, if he chooses a move like  5.a4  we can continue with our development with  5...g6  or  5...e6  , both plans are fine here. }
5... Qxd7
{ The knight is well placed on c6 in the arising positions controlling the d4 square, so delaying the development of the light pieces by one move and capturing with the queen is a good idea. }
6. O-O Nc6 { As planned, developing the knight to c6. } 7. d4
{ If White chooses not to push in the centre, it is not clear what his plan is. Black, in any case, wants to develop the f8 bishop with either e6 Be7 or g6 Bg7, both of which are perfectly fine here and it is just a matter of taste. }
7... cxd4 8. Nxd4
{ Now both  8...g6  as well as  8...e6  give Black good play. Without the pawn on c4 White can't stop our counterplay. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4
{ The so-called Grand-Prix Attack. A beautiful opening, White wants to develop with Nf3 Bc4 O-O, throw the f4 pawn forward and checkmate us with the Qe1-Qh4 d3 Bh6 idea. This works in the fantasy world, but if Black knows what he is doing, it can backfire on White. }
3... g6
{ No need to fear d4, although Nc6 first is also possible. In that case though,  3...Nc6  can be met with  4.Bb5 }
4. Nf3 Bg7

{ This was a fresh idea introduced a couple of years ago by Grischuk. He won a brilliant bullet game with it, but if Black knows what he is doing, it is not that dangerous. }
7... cxd4
{ We shouldn't get too greedy and should capture with the pawn and later return it. }
8. Nb5 a6
{ Also possible is to go for development first  8...Nge7  9.Bb3  O-O  10.Nbxd4  and  Na5!?  Once I mixed everything up and went  8...Na5?!  here against Nepo, which is a move you shouldn't play. }
9. Nbxd4 Nxd4 10. Nxd4 Nf6
{ Developing with a tempo. If White just defends the e4 pawn we can go for b5 Bb7, while  11.e5  can be met with  11...dxe5  12.fxe5  Nd5  The most critical move seems to be the f5 push. }
11. f5 gxf5
{ This move has never been played so far, but it is very thematic, opening the g-file while aiming to keep the centre closed. }
12. exf5 e5
{ We have a wall in the centre of the board with the pawns on d6 and e5. Next we want to finish the development of our queenside and potentially castle long and utilize the open g-file for the attack. }

5... cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nc6
{ I like starting with this move, intending to take on d4. If we start with  6...Bg7  7.Bg2  O-O  White has an extra option of  8.h3  Nc6  9.Be3.   Now White has three options, taking on c6, allowing Nxd4 with Bg2 and dropping the knight back with Nde2. }

14... h6

Bd2 Kh7
{ Guarding the h6 pawn and freeing the g4 knight to go to e5. Black is doing well here. Our wish-list is: push the b-pawn further to b4, kick the knight away from d5 with e6 and reroute the g4 knight via e5. }

{ The so called Morra-Gambit really doesn't have a point, as we can transpose to Alapin if we want to. It does have a serious following and some people even write books about it, so let's check it out! }
2... cxd4 3. c3
{ Taking on d4 with the queen is not great, as we will gain a tempo with Nc6. After  3.Nf3  we can transpose to the Najdorf with  3...d6   We can also think of keeping the pawn after  3.Nf3  with  3...e5!?  as  4.Nxe5  loses to  4...Qa5+ }
3... dxc3
{ The easiest for us is  3...Nf6  which after  4.e5  Nd5  transposes to ourAlapin line, but of course, grabbing the pawn is more principled. }
4. Nxc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bc4
{ This is how White usually develops his pieces. Here they usually recommend a6, but there are simpler ways. I like finishing the development first. }
6... Bb4
{ Alternatively,  6...Bc5  is similar, while the main move  6...a6  is something I definitely don't want to recommend. }
7. O-O Nge7 { As far as I can see, Black has pretty easy play here. } 8. Nb5
{ This is probably the best for White. Black's edge here is just symbolic. }
8... d5 9. exd5 exd5 10. Bxd5
{ White wins back the pawn, but we get the bishop pair. } 10... Nxd5 11. Qxd5
O-O { With a symbolic edge, thanks to the bishop pair. } *
